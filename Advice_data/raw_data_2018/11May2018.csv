0,"I'm currently a 24 year old woman who is a school teacher. When I was younger I didn't have a lot of luck with getting a boyfriend and didn't have the highest self-confidence in how I looked. 

Long story short, I dated a guy when I was between the ages of 19-22. He made me feel a lot better about myself and eventually he talked me into letting him take nude photos of me...and I don't mean tame ones, I mean ones that show *everything* I have. 

When we broke up I pleaded with him to delete the photos. He promised me he would never show them to anyone, but said he wanted to keep them...which I guess it doesn't matter because even if he told me he deleted them, I would never know for sure. While I trust him not to show anyone, it torments me to think that this one guy has so much power over me...he can utterly humiliate me and can ruin my career as a teacher. 

While I trust him not to do that and know there's not much I can do now...I can't figure out how to get over that feeling? How do I accept that I'll never know if he will delete them and accept that this one guy has that much power over me?  ",11May2018,1

3,"I just got a job at a small retail store and I’ve been texting one of my coworkers and it’s been kinda flirty but sometimes when we chat he mentions other people.

4,"So my mum's bf says that I'm not allowed to get angry because I'm too young. I am 16 and today was one of those days when I couldn't control myself. 

We have guests staying over at our house, who are sleeping in my room, they decided to go on a trip tomorrow. I was buying the tickets for everyone online when I asked if I could go. It didn't even take a second before my mum's bf clearly expressed that he didn't want me to go. My mum got really mad at this and the guests staying over also thought that it wasn't fair. I got mad (not showing yet) and he told me that he was going to pay for it himself. 

Almost two hours later I went down and told him to pay because I needed to close my turn off my laptop before I went to sleep and it was very late. I usually wake up at 6 and it was almost midnight. He ignored me and told me that he was going to do it later so I decided that if he wasn't going to use it that I should take it to my laptop to my room, turn it off and finally get some sleep. You see I needed to turn it off because I know he wouldn't. When I went to get it he jumped off the bed towards it, grabbed it by the edge with it bending down as if he didn't care if he broke it. We got into an argument - I tried to remain calm but by the end when I was walking away I was so mad that I threw the chair down. He pushed me onto the stairs and said that he was going to spank me (wtf I'm 16) and break my laptop. I wouldn't be surprised because he did that to my phone when he ""borrowed"" it after he broke his phone.

He keeps telling me that I'm too young for anger but when I try to hold it in I always end up blowing up with furry. Once I left the house for 6 hours and came back at 2 am. I had my reasons.  

Sometimes I think that he does things just to piss me off. On my first day of school, he played loud music till 3 am. I asked him to turn it down and he wouldn't. A more recent example happened yesterday when he was talking loudly till 1 am and then decided to wake me up at 2 am to tell me to sleep on the couch. I have school. He doesn't have to go to work since he is on a holiday and he expects me to sleep on the couch because he won't get enough sleep on it. 

I really hate him; that's not a word I use often. Got any advice on how I can not strangle him in the next 2 years (I'm moving out as soon as I'm 18)? If I'm going to have to pay rent I at least want to feel comfortable where I live. ",11May2018,1
5,"Backstory: So I've known this girl for a few years, but we never really talked or hung out until this year, and I'm into her but I don't plan on telling her or anything (mainly because she has a boyfriend). But I just like hanging out with her cause she tells amazing stories and I find her really interesting and funny. Her relationship with her bf is also kind of sad because of her bf's personality (guilts her a lot and she cried in front of me and a few other friends from how frustrated she was) but I won't get into that. We kind of text and I'm just trying to stay friends with her and be able to hang from time to time but after us texting each other funny stuff form time to time (memes..) for a while she's started to not really text back, it takes days for her to text back and sometimes she just doesn't text back at all. We also see each other in class everyday but we don't really talk anymore either. And in a few months we're graduating and going onto college so I really want to be able to at least be friends but it seems like she doesn't really want to. Should I keep trying? Or should I just get over it and give up?

TLDR: Girl I like (liking isn't really relevant) isn't really responding to me and wondering if I should keep trying to be friends or give up :) ",11May2018,0
6,"Tl;dr last paragraph
I feel a little backstory is needed.

Four years ago I got together with a girl, two years after that I got dumped. I have tried no contact for a long time without any results and at this point I don't believe I will ever get over her.

I have been in one more relationship since my ex. It lasted something like 9 months and ended about 6 months ago. She was amazing in so many ways, but in the end I ended it because I couldn't say ""I love you"" without feeling like I was lying. I just didn't love her like I loved my ex.
Maybe I shouldn't have ended it, maybe things are just different after your first relationship. I don't know.


Anyways, my question:
I don't think I will ever fall in love with someone else, but I feel terribly alone. Should I get into another relationship? I know that it is probably not true, but I feel like either I get into another relationship with someone I don't love at some point in time or I will live the rest of my life alone. ",11May2018,1

9,"Ill try to keep this minimal as my life is very depressed already and thinking or talking about this openly just makes it even more so, afew days ago, my older brother (24) asked me to close the door behind me so that he can sleep, I like to keep the door near closed to allow some light in so I can navigate to my bed and see around me as I sleep, I just asked him to close it him self since he was just closer and refused, since it was kind of tense between us, he then proceeded to yell at me, when I tried talking back he hit me, I then attempted to fight back and it was a very awkward fight but I can't really say who won the trade, probably him, anyway, a bit of history befor we carry on, is he went to prison twice already, once for beating my mom so long ago, and once for beating my dad a couple years ago, iam only 15 years old, he also locked me in a room alone and beat me a couple years ago, but was never punished or went to jail for it, my parents just aparantly dont give a fuck about me, from there on my self esteem was very shaky and iam always anxious around him, always at the ready when ever he is nearby, and for some reason because my mom is just awful, she accepted him to come and live with us, I dont think we really have an option, my parents are divorced and my dad did not want him to live with him, now back to now days, after that fight between us, I tried calling the police to help, the emergency service worker basicly gave no thought to what I said duo to my age and just flat out hung up on me, even though he (my brother) threatned me of sexual threats, iam sure they are just talk but they are very offending, the emergency worker simply ignored me, he said the only way this works is if an adult talks to him so I let my mom talk to him and all she said was that its just kids fighting and it was no issues, she then told me that she would have people talk to him and either make him say sorry to me or force him to leave and not live with us, she could not do either, my dad some how says it was my fault aparantly, I dont know, I did not talk to him, and none of the people my mother talked to want to talk to him, she flat out said to me that she can not do anything.. and still pretends everything is fine, I'm always very anxious around him, now Iam too scared to even sleep in the same room as he is, which is actually my room originially, because if I close the door behind me then iam basicly sitting down and admitting defeat, which makes me feel like a massive coward, and if i dont, iam likely forced to fight him again, and I dont think that ends too well for me, although there is a chance it may, probably won't..

So what can I do to defend my self? nothing? my parents could not care less, / cant do anything, police wont help, neither would my parents contact them, what can I do to protect my self?

I live in a third world country, sadly, sorry for the unorgnized text, like I said I did not really want to think too much about this, and I write as I go, sorry for spelling mistakes and all, I did not bother checking

tdlr: I want to be something, but my self esteem is rock bottom and iam always very anxious and sadly, kind of scared, and sad, I have no one to rely on in this world but my self, and the fact iam so helpless right now breaks me, Iam failing in life and everything, there is too much wrong going on to write here or now, perhaps later, but for now the issue is mainly how can I protect my self, do I just brawl it out and hope for the best? doubt thats wise

11,"I met a best friend 2 years back, and we became close really quickly. For the first time in ages, it felt like I was important to someone other than family. He’s the nicest guy around and one of those friends you only meet a few times in your life. I myself am a nice person too, but I had a dark side, which I now realize was from my depression. I used to be very pessimistic, feel really insecure about myself and my future, and kept comparing myself to others and feeling bad. I’d also just have days when I’d have no energy for no reason. I didn’t realize I even know I had depression at the time, but it would led to the friendship’s demise. 

I started opening up about him about my insecurities, and initially he was very supportive. However, as time went on, my neediness put a detrimental strain on the friendship. I’d have bad days where I’d be very angsty and upset with him over trivial stuff. He couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to change my negative mindset, which was what we both thought was behind my behaviour. He gave me lots of chances, and eventually my anxiety and negative mindset got fixed. However, back in January, I lashed out at him and really shocked myself, since I never intended to be angry. We usually ended our arguments with a hug, but this wasn’t one of those times and he cut all ties with me.

Recently, I had a wake-up call from this moment I felt really suicidal and learned these feelings I’ve had over the past 10 years have been the result of mild or moderate depression. Since I’m blocked by him on all social media and our friend group is kinda alienated by what I did, I was wondering what I could do to apologize and try to explain myself. ",11May2018,0

13,"Initially, when starting my job, I was working within the company (restaurant group) already on an hourly basis. When I was given the opportunity to start helping with an admin job ""remotely"" for one of our other restaurants, where I was only making a very small commission which is paid by the client, not the establishment, I agreed so I could get my foot in the door and show what I can do. Most of the work was possible to complete while at my hourly job, but some of it I was still needing to do at home (about an hr a day, at least). I was doing that for about 4 months.

About 3 months ago, the owner asked me to start coming into the restaurant 1 or 2 days a week, for about 6 hours, on an hourly basis. This way I could call clients, work on paperwork, etc. I agreed and have been going in a few times a week for the last 3 months.

I would love to quit the hourly job at the original restaurant (management is terrible, work is boring/not challenging, negative work environment), however I would be losing out on those 12-15 or so hours a week where I was getting paid otherwise, and could answer emails from my phone for the commission job. 

I would love to ask the owner for a small salary to compensate for those hours worked, to allow me to work from home for those other hours, but I'm not sure how to go about it. It will also help me focus more on building the business at the commissioned job to quit the other.

There's a lot more to the story, but this is the easiest way to explain things. I'm afraid that he will say no, of course, but also that he will not recognize how much work actually goes into this.

I've been looking for a job/ internship, and while I think I just found something, I'm kind of concerned about how I have been acting recently. I've been moodier lately, and have had more mood-swings. I feel very out of it, as in I will wake up at 1 or 2 and start my day then. When I set my alarms early, I just snooze through them because I don't have anything to do during the day. 

To give you some background about myself: I love going out. Ever since I was a little kid, I've been fascinated with nightlife. When I'm in school or when I was in Spain for a month, I felt bad if I didn't go out and instead just stayed in. 

Fast-forward to now, I feel the opposite. Last week, my best friend invited me to a bar-trolley. I eventually went on it, but I was so hesitant to do it. It was just unappealing. This weekend, the same friend along with another one of my best friends are going to a 21st Bday and want me to go.  It's a 2-day party. It bothered me when my friend texted me ""I'm so excited to go"" and I didn't share that same enthusiasm. In fact, he texted me if I wanted to hang out tonight and I just didn't feel like it.

I've been thinking a lot about it lately and I believe that having nothing to do is causing this apathy. I feel like going out and partying is sweeter when you're working towards something, and as of this summer, I haven't been. Does anyone else feel like that, or should I explore my mood change more?

I also was about to steal some sunglasses, like i put them in my bag but then took them out. I didn’t get caught or anything, but today i went to the mall (i went to a different store) and maybe I’m just being paranoid, but the girl who worked there looked @ me and said something to her fellow worker and then called somebody on the phone.

First, i didn’t even go into the store that i stole from, so is it even possible for other stores to identify a previous shoplifter who didn’t even steal from their store? Second, I’m under 18, and don’t shoplift regularly, it wasn’t even an expensive item. So could it be possible that like stores send out photos of suspected shop lifters to the stores in the same mall to catch them?  Is that even legal? Am i being paranoid? If i used a credit card at a different store, could they identify my information? Or do you think they only recognize faces. If i never go back to that mall do you think I’m in the clear?

35,"I’m not entirely sure what details to include and what I shouldn’t but here goes nothing. 

I’m 18, I have a boyfriend and I had a terrible childhood. Parents divorced at 2, didn’t know my mother till I was 10. Born in Japan but moved to the states with father around the age of 9. Mother is Russian and she’s lived there her whole life. I’ve never felt completely connected with either culture, be it American or Russian or Japanese. Fairly abusive father and awful step mother. Few instances of sexual abuse in early childhood. I had a pretty severe eating disorder which started around the age of 11 or 12 ( early puberty made me think I was fat. Stupid boobs) which I’ve been able to deal with much better over the past couple of years. Diagnosed with PTSD, “unspecified anxiety disorder” and major depression at 15. 

Anyway when I was like 17 my boyfriend showed me a model. Shes very popular on Instagram, modeled for playboy previously and is the most gorgeous person I’ve ever seen. I was jealous for a bit because I knew my boyfriend thought she was pretty but it was pretty minor, I didn’t really give a shit overall. Fast forward now, several months later. About a week ago I was bored so I went onto her profile on Instagram. I appreciated her a bit more than I did several months ago. 3 days ago I started researching her. I really started to enjoy her look. The next day I bookmarked a bunch of her pictures and started thinking about “copying” her look, mostly through makeup but plastic surgery came into mind. Yesterday I fucking lost it. I frantically searched google to see if it’s possible to get plastic surgery to almost completely look like a specific person. I looked at her pictures at least 10 times a day. I researched her extensively. I listed the plastic surgery procedures I’d have to get to look like her. Then I thought looking like her wasn’t enough. I wanted to be her. I felt so helpless, that was impossible. I cried for hours, vomited the little food I ate and just felt devastated. Part of me really wanted it, to at least move to California (where she’s based) and get a bunch of surgery to look like her. Part of me felt that wasn’t enough, that I needed to be her to be satisfied. And then another part of me was angry at myself for feeling these ridiculous things. Today I’ve looked at her profile way less, I’ve managed to keep myself under control (emotionally). I’ve been trying to reason to myself that this is all ridiculous but I’m so terrified. 

What the hell is happening to me? I’ve seen lots of pretty girls before. Pretty girls with better lives than me, pretty girls who I’ve seriously envied. But why am I feeling this way about this specific person? Am I just having “an episode”? I’ve been in much more vulnerable positions before with much heavier pressures to look a certain way or with models being shoved in my face every which way I’ve looked, yet I’ve never even been close to this? 

I’m sorry for rambling. I’m scared and confused. ",11May2018,2
36,"I have a friend, lets call him Joe.  I'm currently a junior in college and have known Joe since freshman year.  But it seems like I am always in his shadow.  I can even go as far to say that I'm his sidekick \(or even a pet\).  I feel that his personality just outweighs mine, that it's hard for me to think for myself in the first place.  The fact that when we are walking together on campus and it seems that he knows almost everyone is kinda demeaning.  Even my other close friends change completely in their personality for his liking.  It doesn't help that I don't have friends that he doesn't know.  This semester, he is in almost everyone of my classes and sits right next to me \(we're in the same major at a small college\).  Usually I make a couple friends from class, but this semester I made none.  And I can't help but think that it is because I sit next to Joe. 

 I want to be my own person.  I want to have my own original personality, that is not reliant on Joe's.  I want to be able to like something that Joe doesn't like and have that be accepted.  I made sure that I am in different sections to Joe's classes next semester, and I feel that this is a good start.  If you guys have any other advice for me, I would really appreciate it.",11May2018,3
37,"I'm a bisexual woman and this is the first time I've ever gotten this far in a F-F relationship. We met a couple weeks ago and have been talking and meeting up a lot. She says she's really into me and thinks we have a lot in common. I liked her a lot initially but now I have doubts because I think we're starting to get a little serious and this is where my issues arises:

* I have a hedonistic lifestyle at the moment. I'm 20 years old, have never been in a relationship, and currently enjoy meeting people on the whim. If I go to a party or club you'll probably find me on a guy. You might say I'm filling void in me but I just like being intimate with strangers with the potential of sex at the end, though it never ends with sex. I haven't actually slept with a LOT of people. I absolutely do have a sex drive through the roof however. I've always been very sexual and pro sex but I'm picky because I'd be happier emotionally to have sex with one partner. 

The other thing is I really value sexually compatibility in a relationship because of my sex drive, so if I feel like I won't be satisfied in that aspect I'd be less willing to get serious. I always knew that if I ever got into a relationship with a guy I'd be very loyal because I wouldn't need to go to anyone else to satisfy my sexual needs. I've never had sex with a woman before so I can't imagine if I'd enjoy it or not. With this girl I'm afraid I'd become unfaithful.

My friends think I'm thinking a little too far ahead. I just don't want to hurt anyone or waste anyone's time. I think I like this girl and I do think we have a lot in common too, but I'm afraid we won't be sexually compatible. I mean, there's a first for everything right? Should I give it a shot or not waste my time?

38,"Hello. I lost my virginity to a girl at the end of February. I wore a condom, but I have this fear that semen cum up and out of the sides. I kept going for about 15-20 seconds after I came, but I stayed hard and the condom stayed on. However, her period was four days late. It ended up being late because she had a yeast infection. She was on an antibiotic for that and on minocycline, an acne antibiotic that can delay periods. When she was four days late, she was cramping hard, but she went to a friend's house to take a pregnancy test because her friend had one.

 She sent me back a negative test and she said that she got her period that night. She complained over the next week about how heavy it was, but I was just happy she got it. Two weeks later, she went on vacation and had sex with someone with no condom. She asked me if I could lend her money to get Plan B, but I said no because I did not have the money to give her. She said that kid wouldn't be mine anyway. Eventually, she said she got her period and it was on the same day of the month as the previous month. My anxiety went through the roof and I kept asking her if she was pregnant. 

I kept annoying her because I kept asking if she was lying about being pregnant. She said there is nothing to worry about and that she swears she is not pregnant and she is on her period. She would be about thirteen weeks pregnant at this point and she plays softball for her school. I feel like her mom would have noticed if she was pregnant by now. I am just so worried that she is lying to me. Even though she told me fifty times and ended up blocking me on everything, I am still worried. Just so you know, I have had OCD symptoms since I was a little kid. I am just not clinically diagnosed because I have never went to the doctor about all of my problems. Please help.  ",11May2018,3

44,"**TL;DR: No degree, no work related skills, no social skills, interest in web development/testing, Any ideas how to get back to work life?**

**Some background:**

* 32 years old
* No degree or anything \(just elementary school\)
* Close to no real work experience
* Living in small town, current life situation does allow to move
* Never learned to drive car and doubt I ever will
* Going back to school is not possible at this moment

So looking some advice about getting back to work life.  I'm quite fortunate to have supporting wife who actually makes decent salary and we \(barely\) get through each month. Financially, I bring nothing but disability pension to the table, so obviously I'm looking ideas to do something more.

**What I have been trying to do?**

* Started \(and failed fast\) ""startup"" company with friend,  web design ""agency"" \(doing websites\). We managed to get around 10 clients before friend got job and quit.
* Released a game, nothing much came of it.
* Have tried to apply remote web design positions, no replies.

So why disability pension? I assume biggest reason was that I failed ""work rehabilitation"" due to anxiety and other physiological issues which resulted me failing to be effective or even somewhat decent worker. In short, around group of people I lock down and have very hard time to approach new people, prefer avoiding that all together \(which makes being freelancer impossible\). Mild stuttering does not help situation, gives nice boost to anxiety.

I would not call myself ""unsocial"", but I'm most often quiet with new people and prefer doing things alone or with few people as possible. When I get to know someone I'm very talkative person \(most often too much\).

I have been always interest in testing different things \(such as websites/apps functionality, games etc\), solving problems, coding and website design, but I'm not great/*excellent* in any of them. I can complete different challenges \(such as finishing and releasing small PC game, creating small laravel application \(issue tracker\), android trivia game etc\)., but eventually nothing sticks and I often have to rely on Google/Stack Overflow, way too much. Assuming I would fail job interview when it comes to ""coding test"" due to previously mentioned ""issue"".

So I'm that kind of package, any ideas?",11May2018,1

52,"I’m freaking out, and i need all the advice possible. A few weeks back i was at the mall and stole a few pairs of underwear. I also was about to steal some sunglasses, like i put them in my bag but then took them out. I didn’t get caught or anything, but today i went to the mall (i went to a different store) and maybe I’m just being paranoid, but the girl who worked there looked @ me and said something to her fellow worker and then called somebody on the phone. I left the store, freaked out and went to a different store. When i came back out of the other store, i saw a security guard standing in the doorway of a different store and looked at me and said something into his walky talky.

While i was walking to my car i could see on the other side of the parking lot, a security car with its lights flashing, driving around the parking lot. So by then i was like omg they are out to get me. So i get in my car and sit there for a second, but the car doesn’t ever come to me so i just left. First, i didn’t even go into the store that i stole from, so is it even possible for other stores to identify a previous shoplifter who didn’t even steal from their store? Second, I’m under 18, and don’t shoplift regularly, it wasn’t even an expensive item. So could it be possible that like stores send out photos of suspected shop lifters to the stores in the same mall to catch them?  Is that even legal? Am i being paranoid? If i used a credit card at a different store, could they identify my information? Or do you think they only recognize faces. If i never go back to that mall do you think I’m in the clear?

Unfortunately, this has coincided with our trip as we leave in a few days and I’m a mess.

I've never done anything like this so I don't want you to think i'm being petty or whatever but I need to get this off my back. 

Essentially, my 2 best friends of 7 years who i'll refer to as BF1 and BF2 went to the same University, and I went to one very far away in London because i'm wanting to be a lawyer. Regardless, I have literally spoken to them everyday for these 7 years and had all my school/college memories with them. BF1 has always been a little bit jealous of me, I don't really know why but me getting a girlfriend didn't seem to help things either. BF2 has always hero worshiped BF1, not that he doesn't like me but say if me and BF2 are having a conversation and BF1 shows up, whatever we were debating BF2 would always side with BF1. This never really bothered me as we have always just been dickheads to each other in a fun way and i've always just accepted that's how things are. However, since i've been in London BF1 has taken a bit of a hostile non talking stance with me and as usual, BF2 seems to be following his lead. I know BF1 is a bit threatened by the fact i'm doing law and have been in a relationship for 2 years but BF2 has always been friendly, nice and supportive, much like that what you'd expect of a friend of seven years. Only problem is now they haven't spoken to me in 2 months or even asked me how things are going and this has made me quite sad. I can't understand where this 7 years of friendship has gone, we would stay at each others houses every weekend and drive to far away places together but as soon as BF1 left this stupid group chat we've had for so long, BF2 just stopped talking.

It hit me, I'm 25 years old, living back home without a job and with a demanding father that makes me feel so minuscule. I feel like I had so much potential and I feel like a failure for being my age and not being in PA school yet (or even accepted to one), struggling to find a job and still having to worry about bills. I'm so overwhelmed with anxiety and this is just my 4th day back. Not to mention the snarky comments my father makes after a few beers. I know I sound ridiculous but having to worry about how I'm gonna pay my bills, if I'm even going to be able to further my education or just get out of here as soon as possible. Also, add on separation anxiety from being away from my SO. It's so much, I feel overwhelmed and have no one to turn to. I just needed to vent and I guess would like to hear from someone that has gone through something like this before that it's going to be ok?... I'm just hoping I made the right decision.

I called him insecure because i asked his boyfriend (hes gay) to carpool to the SAT and he didn't like that very much. Anyways, C talks to me the next day about what i said to him and gets all up in my face and threatens to fight me if i even attempt to come and talk to my friends at lunch. Now, this was all a few days ago. However, today i go back to my friend group to see if the waters had calmed down at all (it has been 3 days since the incident). It was all good at first (he was getting lunch) but, C comes back after and gets all up in my face and starts pushing me around trying to antagonize me into fighting him. Hes saying things like ""did I not make it crystal fucking clear that i dont want you here?"" and ""I don't ever want you coming over here and trying to stir up trouble"". Anyways, im conflicted because i don't want to let him control my ability to talk to my friends but, at the same point, C is a bigger dude than i am so hes intimidating.. I don't know what my options are to do and hes making my life fucking unbearable. Please help.

She keeps telling me it’s because her parents raised her that way, but I just see it as an excuse. She’s also extremely negative which definitely had an influence on me. After meeting her, I went through a long depression phase, but I got over it once I distanced myself a bit. The thing is, she’s lonely. Her parents aren’t supportive and don’t allow her to make her own choices ( she’s an only child ) and she doesn’t have other friends. Would it be bad for me to break it off?

78,"I wouldn't normally be posting this but I have been freaking out to the point of tears about my prom dress. I am very ashamed of my body, like lots of girls my age are. Normally I am good at concealing my body, or dressing in a way that is more flattering. 

When I had first bought my prom dress, I remember it looking good on me. I went in to get it tailored, and I had to hold back tears at how awful it looked on me. I can't stop thinking about how fat I look. It's flattering from the sides, but from the front it looks so bad that I feel sick to my stomach. I have absolutely no idea what to do. It's being tailored right now and I can't try and find another prom dress or my mom would kill me. 

I know prom doesn't matter, but I can't stop thinking about how everyone is going to see me and how awful they will think I look. I am scared of my boyfriends mom seeing it and thinking I look awful. I am not scared of prom itself being ruined, as I did not have high expectations anyway. It's just the idea of people seeing me. My friends and boyfriend have reassured me that it looks great, but I can't believe them. You would never tell a girl who is stuck with a dress that looks bad on her that it actually looks bad. At least not at my age. 

I've attached pictures of the dress so you can see how it looks. I also want to say understand it's vain of me to assume that people will be staring at me, and I apologize for that. I don't mean to be so self absorbed. Any and all advice is extremely appreciated. 

TL;DR: My prom dress looks awful to me and I'm stressing out.

88,"Just a heads up- this is a long story.
TL;DR the gist of this all is that my cousin has been jumping from serious relationship to serious relationship, and I'm starting to get the feeling that he's cheating on each of them. I don't know how to tell him that what he's doing is seriously wrong and I don't have hard evidence that he's actually cheating on the women he's dating.

The long version- because I need someone to hear this and no one wants to talk about it with me:

Where do I even begin? My cousin has been through a lot in the past 8 or so years. He's been in 4 serious relationships and 3 of them were in the past 3 years. His first girl friend was a bad and messed up relationship. She was verbally abussive to him and she claims he was just as bad back to her- I have no proof of what he did, but I've seen and heard what she did to him. She convinced him to move to Maine where he stole $1,000 worth of merchandise from a store and she stole and maxed out his credit cards. It was a very bad and messed up situation for him. He finally broke his relationship off with this woman.

My cousin flew back to his home town and stayed with me for a few months while he got ready to join the USMC. The next 2 years I watched him slowly pull his life back together. Eventually he payed off his debt and settled everything he had with the store that he stole from, things seemed to settle down for him and he came home for a visit. This is where he met girlfriend #2 and #3. If I remember right, he had a few months before he was back on duty and started dating a nice girl he knew in high school, he had only been dating her for maybe 2 weeks when he decided to propose to her... I protested, but they both seemed like they were in a good relationship together and I thought they were (at the very least) happy together, but then one week later she dumped him for her ""old boyfriend"" (I'm not sure this was real, I think she asked a close friend to pose...), as strange as that was, it only gets weirder from here. That same day she dumped him, he got together with her best friend and one week later he proposed to her. Over the remainder of his ""vacation"" they planned their wedding and he was stationed in Hawaii and I heard very little of them. The times that I did hear from them it always seemed like their relationship was on the rocks (I know, super shocking right?).

Eventually his contract with the Marines ended and they moved back to his home state. This is when things got really bad. He didn't have a job at first so he and his wife were basically going at each other's throats and I was caught up in the crossfire. They would both come to me with their problems and try to get me to take sides- eventually I had to tell them that they had to stop coming to me with their problems and work things out with each other instead of venting all of their anger and frustrations on me. Things went quiet for a while but then one day (on my birthday no less) my cousin came over to visit, his shirt was teared to shreds at the bottom and he had scratch marks on his face. Apparently his wife had done this to him when he tried to leave for my house. That whole evening I was bombarded with calls and text messages from his wife asking me if it was okay if she came and then my parents and siblings started contacting me, informing me that his wife was asking for our address (we had just moved).

The next couple of days were hell for me. His wife was constantly texting me and telling me all the horrible things that James was doing and (wouldn't you know it) chief among those things was that he was cheating on her. I blocked her number, but somehow she found a way around that and I had to tell her that she was harassing me and if she didn't stop I'd have to go to the police. I assumed that she was just trying to get me to take sides again, because through this whole ordeal my cousin was being extremely honest to me and told me everything that was going on.

Eventually they got a divorce, but one week later I found out that he's already dating another girl. Unlike the previous girlfriends he's had and aside from him going straight to her after getting the divorce, this relationship legitimately seemed healthy. My cousin seemed to be taking things slower with her than he previously had. About 1 year into his relationship with her they moved in together and about 6 months later he proposed to her. They were engaged for about 4 months when her mom passed away from cancer they both took it pretty hard and somehow my cousin and her were roped into living with her dad so he wasn't all by himself. Mind you he had to quit his job and sell his apartment contract within the space of a few days even though there were other siblings that lived closer. I don't understand that, but it's not as relevant to the story. About one month later my cousin came to me and told me that things between them weren't going well and that he was breaking up with her that day. It was hard for him, I know that much. Now today, exactly one month and one day later he tells me that he's been dating someone for about one month (I know this because I still have the damn text on my phone).

Un-f***ing-believable. I am not trying to judge him I just don't know how to tell him that what he's doing isn't right or healthy for him or hte other person involved in the relationship. If a relationship isn't working out for him I understand the need to leave- and he's had some really good excuses to leave a relationship- but he can't just latch on to the next relationship. That's not a healthy thing for him to do. I am concerned for him. I truly hope that he finds someone he loves and that loves him back because that seems to be what he wants so bad, but I just don't know what to say.

I think the biggest thing here is that me and him are very close and I care about him- maybe a little more than I should. At the end of the day this is his life and he will make the decisions he makes, but I feel he needs someone to tell him that he needs slow down and take a look at what he's doing before he just dives right in.",11May2018,1
90,"Okay so, I'm still a kid and I don't want to be too harshly judged for being here, but I don't really know what I should do right now. I'm currently 15 and ending my sophomore year in highschool. I just recently got transferred to a new school at the beginning of April after missing 3 weeks of school because my mother took me and out two cats to run away to my grandparents. What we ran away from was my step dad. For the past 7-8 years my step dad has both mentally and physically abused my mother, she has gone to hospitals so many times that all the medicine and drugs they've given her piled up in her closet I could hardly see the floor. Nothing happened to me, physically anyway. My step dad didn't really acknowledge me much, but he did look down upon me like I was stupid. Anyway, it was an awful household, and I was happy for the past month because I thought I was free, but earlier today my mother was driving me back to my grandparents home and she began to talk to me. She started telling me how I have no right to disrespect my step dad even if I don't like him-which I've never done unless you call hardly speaking but obeying everything he says that-and that she was going to take me back there. She told me I don't understand anything because I've never been in a relationship and needed a break like that. She also said he had problems and so did she and that they just took it out on each other, but he's better. Now....I love my mom and want to believe her, except she's given me very similar speeches over the past years. He's never changed. She's only changed for the worse. I can't really believe her anymore, especially when she's very prone to lying. I'm so happy where I am now, and when I told her this she said it didn't matter. She proceeded to tell me that me playing games (which I do from time to time but not always because I take care of 19 	animals and talk to friends) has given me a psychological disease. She doesn't think me talking to people online is healthy, she doesn't seem to care that I'm happy here and not with my step dad, and she doesn't care about what I have to say. My grandparents love me being here, and I'm trying to think of a way I can get them to have custody of me. I'm not very sure how to go about it, but that's my only hope right now. Mom said I could stay here until the end of summer, so there's time for me to get as much advice as I can. Thank you for reading, and I appreciate anything that I can get right now.",11May2018,6

I've actually been going to a psychologist for the past couple months, and they recommended medication. I've finally decided that enough is enough, and on my next appointment with my doctor I'm going to try to ask them for medication.

If any of you have done this, maybe tell me how to bring it up? And how to bring up medication?",11May2018,1
92,"I had a one night fling with a girl when I was still in school. I didn’t talk to her for about a year and a half after that. 

She then ends up coming to the same college as me (she’s a year younger.) I spoke to her briefly once thinking nothing of it just a sort of “hey.” Next thing I know she calls me through someone else’s phone apparently needing to speak to me. She said some stuff I can’t remember then she says she’s in love with me.

At this time in my life I was an absolute nervous wreck - no self esteem, no confidence and actually in love with someone else (not in a relationship or anything). No one had ever said that to me before and she was way more attractive than me so it completely took me by surprise.

I didn’t think for a second that she was being serious so I kind of awkwardly laughed and hung up the phone assuming it to be either someone else or her playing a joke.

I didn’t see her for the remainder of college and I didn’t think about that moment at all until I saw her again last year.

When I saw her again she didn’t say anything to me she just looked straight into my eyes (it was in a crowd and I was quite far away but it was clearly her - she walked off with a guy quickly after). It was a pretty intense moment because it instantly made me remember that phone call and see it completely differently. It was suddenly clear to me that she was being genuine.

The phone call was about 3 or 4 years ago.

I can’t stop thinking about this and I just feel fucking terrible thinking about the pain I might have caused. If I’d had the courage to do what she did and the same thing happened to me I can imagine how much that would hurt.

So, I need to know if it would be selfish of me to reach out to her and apologise for my own reasons of guilt, or if it would genuinely be the right thing to do and maybe offer her some sort of closure. As far as I know she’s happy and in a strong relationship and the last thing I’d want is to in any way stir that up or have any negative affect at all on her life for that matter. If you can empathise with her what would you want? Maybe I should leave it a few more years? I literally don’t know hence the question.

96,"I come from a very large Hispanic family, we live in separate countries but I was always raised with the mentality that 'you don't ever leave your family; they are the few people you never turn your back on'. It's so different, to me, when I hang out with my dad's side of the family who are white. 

I've been conflicted about whether or not I want to cease contact with them. 

My mother is really toxic. I know I don't want her to play a big role in my life when I'm older. I don't think I even want her near my children if I have any. And my family, on her side, is pretty messed up. 

I've got two alcoholic/addict uncles, one aunt who becomes really unhinged when she drinks, an aunt I haven't spoken to since I was 10 (my mom and her have beef (I actually think that's one of the few members of my family we have all together shunned)), uhh I just found out the man I've been calling uncle is actually my cousin (aunt, the one who's shunned, had a teen pregnancy) and a bunch of other stuff. 

Thing is, I don't see myself visiting them when I'm older. I love them, I do, it's just.. There's not just a language barrier but I was raised in a different country. They speak Spanish and I only understand it; everyone knows English but they don't really speak to me. When they do speak to me, I feel like I'm being talked down to. They never ask about school or what I'm doing in my life. There's no interest. I've always been fine with that because hey, we're family, it doesn't matter. 

I know if I cease contact with my mom, I'll be ending any contact with my family. I know that if I visit my country and I'm seen in town, I'll be talked about behind closed doors by them. And then it'll get to my mom cause my mom talks to my grandparents, two aunt's and at least two cousins everyday. 

I'm also Bi, no one in my family knows, I haven't told anyone because I know I won't be accepted. If they ever find out, I hope to be at least be 18 and have a place to live and some money saved up because my mom will kick me out. My grandparents are extremely religious, I know they won't be proud.

Has anyone else ceased contact with their Hispanic family? How did it go? Any advice? ",11May2018,1

I feel like I have a personality that is generally not generally popular.

And when I say this, I am not saying I think I am a jerk. I have a relationship that is healthy and going well. I have a family that respects me.

Although, If i recall back to school, I never seemed to really click with alot of people. Some people plainly; did not find me attractive. I can definetely say I hadnt harmed them. I just didnt feel popular nor did I click with many people. Alot of people just seemed to either ignore me or not find me compelling to create a real conversation with me.

I’m going by intuition when I say that there’s something special about her. I think she’s actually very intelligent deep down. It’s as if I can sense a kindred spirit in her. Not only this, but I think that despite all of the partying in her life.. she’s actually quite lonely. It’s a bold thing to assert, but I just get the feeling that she doesn’t have any real friends; people who genuinely care about her. She definitely has a lot of friends, but as far as I know they just party and do drugs. 
 I hope I don’t come off as a complete weirdo, but what I’m trying to say is that for some reason I care deeply about her. I don’t even know why; I hardly know her. I don’t hang out with her at all outside of the one class that we have together. I want to be there for her; to be her friend. The life she lives is self-destructive to say the least, and I don’t want to see that happen to her. The problem is that I don’t think I can just stroll up to her and say all of this to her. How can you tell someone that they’re destroying themselves and not expect them to get defensive? How can I help her? I know it’s not a question that can be answered straightforwardly, but I’m hoping that someone here understands what I’m getting at. ",11May2018,1
103,"Hi everyone,

Basically, I've got a Bachelors in Science and am currently completing a Masters in Social Work. To be honest, I find the course to be boring, and really uncomfortable for a number of reasons.

After finishing my bachelors, I couldnt find a job in laboratories or research groups (Despite completing 3 internships at different labs), so I did social work because I want to help people but seeing the work being done I just want to get out.

I guess, I'm thinking of going into engineering now. It's technical, like Science, but it can be about helping people, sort of like social work, without all the emotional baggage. 

I guess, I just feel so stupid. I'm 23 right now and if I were to go into engineering, I would probably be 27-28 by the time I've finished and my resume is just going to look like complete shit because my previous volunteering/work experience was in medical labs, nothing to do with engineering. I don't know, I just feel like maybe I would be happier doing this, but if I'm in a room with people who just finished highschool, I feel like a fucking loser because I shouldve just done engineering at the start or something.

I don't want to reveal where I live, but there isn't any sort of like accelerated engineering Master courses or what ever, so it seems as though I would need to do the full degree.

Thank you for reading this, it really does mean a lot (and I hope I don't sound sarcastic, as I'm reading this back and it sounds like I am, which I'm not).

108,"So I have this guy I’m interested in who’s in one of my classes. Now, I talk to him regularly about the class and try to include him in conversations since he came to the US from a South American country in October of 2017 (and I want friends since I don’t have many).



On a block day, I wasn’t there due to a rehearsal I had to attend for theatre class. I waited outside for another friend of mine who takes the class and notice she didn’t come out. I went inside the class and immediately started helping cleaning our working station (it’s a CTE class). I soon realize that the only people in the classroom was me, him and the teacher. He waited until I was done cleaning and we began to walk each other to class (we both had to get to English class). He began to ask me where I was for that class period at least 2-3 times and other than that, we just talked about classes we’re gonna take next year, favorite subjects, etc. The last question he asked was “Where were you?” I got tongue tied and asked him to repeat the question. He repeated his statement and I explained the rehearsal I had to do before the bell rang and we got into our classes (my class is next to his).


Another thing is that this week, we (me, him, and three other people) were gonna be making something and had to gather supplies to make it. I was tasked to get supplies to make this recipe (the supply table is across the classroom; this comes into play later). I apparently seemed to have difficulty finding the things needed because he came to my aid a minute after I got to the table and asked if he could help with anything. He helped me find some ingredients and when I had trouble getting a certain thing, he offered to hold the tray for me. It seemed he went out of his way to help me.


After this happened, I started to observe his behavior and interactions with others. He doesn’t seem to go out of his way to help others and usually keeps to himself (he’s kind of a pushover tbh). 


As the title suggested, am I reading too much into this? If I am, leave a comment and explain why. If not, leave a comment and explain why. Thank you!

For a while I have wondered if I am just a fundamentally nasty person. I don't really want to be, and I think it's just added venom as I've began to accuse my mom of acting like a victim, and saying she has to admit some part in all of it.

Our relationship seems to be a lot like this. I don't think we've been good for a long time. My dad says our personalities are too similar - although he never elaborates. I once saw a Clinical Psychologist and private psychotherapist about stress management at a previous job after I shouted at a manager - both agreed I was right to shout (I was given an impossible task and blamed for failure) and that I might just 'be the kind of person who defaults to fight in fight-or-flight situations - and that's okay'.

I would describe myself as an otherwise reasonable and sanguine. I have a wife, good job, social life and hobbies. However, I'm currently doing a year long secondment at an office in my hometown so I've been staying at my parents' house 5 days a week for the last six months. 

My parents have always been financially supportive of me, and I know I'm lucky. I still quietly resent them, because I feel as if they were emotionally neglectful.

I can remember back at least 20 years to where I started developing a fear of screwing up my throws when I played defense. And now it's built up to be paralyzing. I've tried practicing like crazy hoping that increasing my technique would give me confidence and I've tried the old ""don't worry about it, everyone makes mistakes""and tried to put the fear out of my mind that way. Neither worked. 

Just this week I went to make a play and literally threw the ball into the dirt about 10 feet in front of me because I locked up with fear of screwing it up as I threw the ball. Likw my mind was like ""go for it"" but then was like ""no you'll screw it up!"" during  the throw and I pretty much made the worst throw  of my life   It's turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Not tooting my own horn here, but I've played high level ball my whole life so I'm not just a mediocre player... this has legitimately haunted me since Junior high.

125,"Hey reddit, lately I have been thinking a lot about my relationship with my mom and am starting to think that there might be some harmful aspects to our relationship…. I’m 21, I go to university in a different town and live with my mom when I visit home which is quite often. I have never seen a therapist or talked to someone about and lately I have kind of been thinking that maybe I should about my mom but not sure if my situation merits it? Any advice would be extremely appreciated..

Basically, to make a long story short our family has had an pretty traumatic run. We lost both my dad and sister and now it is just me and my mom. 90% of the time, she is absolutely amazing and I love her so much, but there are some really dark things that she does (in my opinion) some of the time. I feel as though I am her punching bag a bit in life and she takes things out on me when she gets overwhelmed. For example, I can always tell when something bad happens to her (unrelated to me) like being reminded of my sister or the car breaking down that I need to be extra cautious because if I make one minor misstep (like forgetting to call her if I leave the house one night, or accidentally making a rude comment) it will turn into an extreme meltdown. For example, most recently I got rejected from a job I was really hoping for and I reacted by being a bit reclusive and not really talking (to her, or anyone). She was very supportive and echoed that she loved me for the first day and then the second day something unrelated seemed to have happened which upset her and I woke up in the middle of the night to her slamming all the doors in the house, flickering my lights on and off and screaming at the top of her lungs. I tried to ask what is wrong but she just kept telling me to “go away” and “let her suffer” and say that I don’t care about her and no one cares about her (I’m assuming because I had been very distant lately as a result of my bad news). She has done similar things in the past like one time we were driving home from a road trip and in the car and she started screaming  “I am going to kill myself , I am going to end my life tonight, I can’t wait for it all to be over” — in these instances I feel very scared and guilty, wishing I hadn’t done that one thing to set her off, or I initially think that something serious happened like somebody died which worries me. And the thing is, she is an extremely put together, successful person in the public but I am the only one who witnesses this dark side, which is what makes me think that I am like an outlet to her sometimes to unleash all her sadness.

She takes everything VERY personally — simple things like disliking a movie she enjoys or if she offers to cook me something and I say “no thank you, iI’m trying not to eat too much sugar” or whatever she will take it as a personal stab at her, especially on a bad day. And then come the meltdowns and comments such as “you don’t care about me, nobody cares about me” etc. The things I do to set her off are pretty typical teenage daughter things, like speaking with a rude tone of voice on occasion. She actually often tells me how great of a daughter I am and how much she appreciates me. She also has an irrational dislike of drinking.. on occasion (maybe once a week) I’ll go out with some friends and not come home that night (I’ll always tell her if that’s the case) and she’s fine with it but if I take too long to come home the next day (as in like, not right that morning) she will snap and call me an “alcoholic” (which is funny because I actually volunteer with rehabilitating sufferers alcohol use disorder, lol) “don’t care about her” etc. 

Anyway, lately I have been feeling really depressed and I normally try to forget about these situations when they happen but I am really just starting to wonder if they might be affecting me negatively. Her personality like this has been around my whole life growing up although of course it’s been worse as of late with recent events. The biggest thing is I feel so guilty even considering her as potentially “toxic” because 90% of the time she is the best mom in the world, so I feel so guilty even saying this. But anyway, I was hoping to get any thoughts at all from you guys. I am feeling a little lost and I have no idea what to do!  Many thanks xxx",11May2018,1

At that time, one of my relatives had suggested another guy and they all wanted me (including my parents) to get married to him, lets call him B.

So I felt bad for talking to A in the meantime and thus when he asked me to facetime for the second time, I just blocked A on whatsapp. I thought A was not bad but he seemed boring. So all conversations ended with A. I kept waiting to meet and talk to B, except his parents never let any of us talk directly to B. I waited a whole year and finally my parents got to know that B had a girlfriend all this time. His parents and B himself never bothered to inform us about this. And his parents thought that B might change his mind so never told us. I was heartbroken [Feb-2017].

After a couple months of this incident [Aug-2017], I messaged A again. I told him sorry and that I was not sure about marriage back then but now I was thinking if we can talk and see how things go forward. He was still single and said yes. So then we started texting a couple times. And I spoke to him on the phone once. We never did videocall. At that time, I use to feel very insecure and I felt like I texted him alot while he didn't care much. So I texted him once again and said lets talk. He said can we talk in an hour? And I said sure. Except I didn't call him and he didn't call me either. Couple days later, I asked him why he didn't call and he said I thought you will call me. And I said, you could have called if I didn't call and he said I guess. The conversation ended there and I decided that A did not care enough and I decided to stop messaging him. And guess what, A never messaged me either. So basically we only got in touch and texted a couple times (for a week at max) and everything ended in a week. Back then when I had messaged him, I was determined to consider him seriously for marriage. But for some reason, I felt he was not the one. In [Dec-2017] my mom had called A's mom just for an update, and asked if A could visit all us. His mom said that A couldn't visit as he was busy.

NOW its present and about 3 days ago [MAY-2018], I messaged A again saying if you are still single and serious about our marriage proposal, I would like to meet you in person in September. To this A said, YES lets meet and hopefully we can connect. This makes it exactly 2 years since I first talked to him. And all I feel is regret. If only I had not blocked him back then and continued to talk to him maybe we could already have been married by now? A is very smart, he is handsome, my kundali matches perfectly with him -- it makes me wonder why I rejected him all these years in the first place? He hasn't written back to me since the day I messaged him -- and I am forcing myself to not message as I feel it makes it tiring for both of us. I remember his habit of not messaging is what always made me tired and end up rejecting him. I felt like he didn't care enough. ANd he never pursued me. But now I feel that I want to get married so now it's about me, not him. So I need to pursue him. 

I just feel so much regret for not being able to recognize he was the one. What if he is the one? Then my whole 2 years was just a waste. Me crying and wallowing and going crazy to find someone... its all such a waste. My parents searching for the guy and talking to all the random guys in the search will be all a waste. All this could have ended 2 years ago itself had I been more determined and made up my mind. I often wonder why I let him go last year again? If he didn't call, so what I could have called. I should have messaged him more and talked. Everything about him just makes me sad with regret. 
Almost makes me want to reject him again as I just feel so regretful that I wasted these 2 years.

Any advice?",11May2018,1

136,"Hi Reddit! I’m LOST. Truly lost. I’ve been working in my dream job (the entertainment industry) for almost 3 years now, I’m 26 years old and I couldn’t be happier with it. It’s true that I work 12/13 hours per day, and they don’t pay you any extra hours because once you go there, you know what you will have to give up. This job could open the door to a huge company that it’s my absolute DREAM, I would feel completed and like I would become who I am meant to be. My team is amazing, and my client is too. The only problem? It’s not that well paid, and I know I work a lot of hours. Even in my free days and all that. And some people judge me a LOT (I mean it, a lot) for having worked here for three years. 

The thing is that an ex co-worker of mine recommended me today for a job, and they offered me a position there. The guy who “interviewed me” talked pretty badly about my current company (he told me he used to work there and he hates my boss - I do really get along with him). It’s slightly better paid, but I would do exactly the same thing: there would be no growth for me. And the job is waaaay less exciting. BUT it’s true that is new and fresh, and a change for someone like me, could be good (I’m very afraid of change, had enough change for my whole life but I know this is bad, and I should be open to changes). What truly scares me is that this new company is mostly unknown, a very small business and has nothing to do with the entertainment industry, which would put me out of this circle and I could end up not getting even a chance at working for my absolute dream company. 

I have to fully support my mom (financially, she’s young and independent but I have to take care of her in that sense). I pay for everything. 

If I say no, I would feel guilty for my co-worker who recommended me and I already have turned off two offers that I got during last year just to keep my current job. But on the other hand, the job that I do now fulfills me, it’s my true passion.

Please, I need guidance. I’m completely lost. I need help.

137,"Hi /adv/...I come to you because honestly I'm being driven insane. I'm a female student whose insecurities have eaten me alive.
First of all, it won't help to be told I need therapy; tried it on-or-off for years. Never helped me--and one experience did more damage. 

This is NOT a ""Am I fugly"" post. No, no. It won't help to be told it's all in my head. Because, hey, I need to be told that to my face. Or SHOWED that. 

What I believe my primary issue is, is my skin; scars, sunken eye bags, and dryness/roughness, I look sickly (also feel a bit sickly but I'm working on it). I look downright awful in a lot of bathroom mirrors; literally hurts to look at myself. 

So, naturally, I believe I'm incredibly photogenic...because while my pictures online - no matter how raw, makeupless, at ALL angles, and all them being filterless without good lighting - pretty much collectively are called beautiful, stunning, etc.; a lot of people said I look like Bella Hadid. Jesus.  

I've sought out advice, from make-up, skincare, to even plastic surgery and people said I was already near-perfect, that they'd kill to have my features, etc, that I'm a natural beauty. Heard hundreds of comments like this on many websites (including ones supposed to be more critical), never any negatives aside from pointing my few pimples, or getting a minor tiplasty and...well, I'm confused. 

This is very disconcerting...

In real, I've never been complimented (well, on my eyes in high school, or my legs), nor hit on me. Hell, not even a catcall. 
I know for a fact that my legs are amazing; girls say they envy them all the time...and I see what they mean in the mirror. Just so long. But yeaaaah, this only makes me worry; if I have this great feature, then doesn't that mean my face must be super ugly for no one to be interested?   

Losing weight didn't help me become more approachable (no guy has ever talked to me randomly), nor did fixing my acne. Quite frankly, in a lot of mirrors my skin looks terrible despite me taking care of it for over a year. I wear a nice coat of concealer/foundation.

I know guys stare sometime, and I don't understand why...they never smile. 

Hhem. Okay. It's time. What are my fears? 
That I'm fairly ugly or am creepy...that it attracts attention, that the photographs aren't accurate at all. 

So, I know for a fact that the way I relate to other people and the world now is becoming increasingly f'ed up. I grow more distrustful, more on edge. I hide it pretty well--people say ""Wow, you don't seem anxious at all! You act real chill."" But, still, it's hurting me on the inside. 

How do I fit in better? What am I doing wrong? How do I cope if I really am that horrible of a sight? 
 
Therapy definitely hasn't helped. Feeling attractive and desired helps...I am so, so deprived and I crave it. 
And somewhere in me, I know that even if I truly were that ugly, I know I should be ashamed...ashamed that I cling onto superficial things and people's shallowness, so much so it's become my own. 

I just don't know how to process this, or come into terms with the idea that I might simply be ugly. See, when I was a kid and teen I was real fat with worse skin, so I've been bullied over my appearance, rejected, etc., so it's a HUGE sore spot for me. 
I am shy in general though.",11May2018,0

140,"So I’m 20, trying to become independent finally. I’m in school full time and work part time, and I’m living at home so I’ve been trying to save some money to buy a car and move out. My cousin Sandra, who knows this, offered to sell me her car because she wants to buy a new one. It’s a decent car, in good shape, and not too many miles on it, so I said hell yeah I’d love to buy your car, and I could’ve bought it basically right there on the spot. 

This was in early March. She said she’d be going to the dealership and be getting a loan that week. Weeks pass and nothing happens. I’ve tried to check in every once in a while just to make sure she hasn’t changed her mind about selling it to me, and make it clear that it’s okay if she doesn’t want to sell it to me anymore.

I checked in a couple days ago and asked if everything is still good. She said she had just had the a/c fixed. I asked her if this was going to cause her to ask her for more for the car which I would understand, but I told her i couldn’t afford much more than her original price. She said that no it wasn’t, everything is still the same, she just wanted to let me know. 

Then she said “let’s hang out so we can talk about your car” and I said alright when’s the soonest you can so we made plans for Tuesday 2 days ago. Basically we didn’t end up discussing the car at all. I really think she just wanted to show off her new girlfriend. I asked her when the soonest was i could buy the car. She said she was planning on going to the dealership Wednesday (yesterday) and nothing. She said she also needed to get her nice expensive stereo professionally removed today supposedly. Idk it’s only been 2 days since we’ve last talked about it but I’ve already been waiting 2 months.

I guess my question is, how do I get out of this? How do I go about buying a car somewhere else? How do I tell her? She’s the kind of person who always thinks people have something against her and that other people are trying to start sh*t with her. So I’m trying to avoid that. But i don’t see her that often so it wouldn’t really cause problems even if she did get offended. I’ve been looking elsewhere for cars and I’m confident I could get an equally nice car in the same price range and I just want to do it now. I don’t want to wait anymore. My brother just got his license and it’s causing some issues because we just don’t have enough cars for everyone so I really need my own car. 

TL;DR my cousin offered to sell me her car but it’s been 2 months and she’s dragging her feet. How do I get out of it? What do I tell her?",11May2018,1

163,"I'm a 23-years-old student living in a dorm since 2014. As a result, I'm only visiting my parents once per month at most. One thing very obvious almost from the day I moved out was that my mother wants to keep her role as a mother by any means necessary.

Basically, that translates to her buying me anything she might deem ""useful"" for my flat or me directly. From a stack of ten additional coathangers for my four jeans to flower-patterned drawers for the living room, I've seen just about anything so far. Today, she's bought me grill tongs. I'll give you three chances to guess whether I even own a barbeque or not.

The big problem now is the following: I'm a horrible gift receiver. Always have been, always will be. Being raised in relatively healthy financial conditions, I was never really in a situation where I couldn't afford something on my own if I ever really required it. Instead, I've been raised to make my own decisions for anything I buy. Ironically, it's my mom now breaking that very mindset.

I want it to stop. Every time she proudly presents her latest gift for me, I feel anything but gleeful; it's pure agony, knowing that I either have to reject it or get rid of it later on.

But I don't really know how to confront her without making her feel like she's ""useless as a mother now"". You can clearly tell she's only buying this stuff to somehow still help out, but the reality of the matter is that I don't really need anything but moral support when I'm in a difficult situation, which so far has barely happened.

It's still slightly swollen but now I can barely move my pointer finger without a 'stretching' type of pain.

A friend of mine, is in some deep shit. He's been involved with gang related activities (rumor has it) and has eneded up in hospital with some injuries. He'll pull through but is badly hurt. I do not know the specifics of what he has done, but it's deep with some dangerous people, who have tried to take his life. 

He's in hospital and I fear once he is out he'll either be killed or kill himself. He has a very poor relationship with his family, and I'm possibly the only person that can get through to him. How do I convince him, to leave this life behind and not seek retaliation, and to start a new life. He is still very young (early 20's). He's a guy with lots of potential, but I really fear that it might be too late. I do not want to give up on a close friend of mine , and let him waste his life.

But I feel powerless to have any real meaningful impact that may make him buck up his ideas and turn his life around.

In my family I'm known as the one who destroys anything he touches. So for me to live up to this I borrowed my mother's car \(I didn't really need it but she wanted me to have it for a while so I could use it to go to school since she due to her surgery can't really use the car for couple weeks now anyway\) and on the way to school \(3hr ride\) the car's windshield got hit by two goddamn stones \(not at once; presumably from cars in front of me\) and got chipped in two places. It's not terrible, both chips are roughly 1 cm small. It is completeley fine to drive with cracks smaller than 2 cm but they could get bigger over time. However, since I live in the EU the regulations are that they are unrepairable if they are in the drivers view \-\- which to my great luck one of them is. This happened 2 days ago. I don't know what to do now. I could:

1. have the one repairable get repaired and pay for it \(which I would't mind\) and act like I didn't see the second one, however, would they notice one crack got repaired? \(it doesn't vanish completely\)
2. say that this has happend but that would be weird since I talked to them since it happend
3. not do anything since it's still road legal and other than \(1.\) there's litteraly nothing else I could do to physically fix that

I will be returning the car in like 2 weeks so presumably I should do something about that. I'm however sure that if I say what happend \(even though it wasn't really my fault\) my family would be upset with me etc. \-\- I can imagine how that would go. If I don't they'll notice it anyway. Time doesn't help either. What's your thoughts? Thanks...",11May2018,1

So even though I did get a fresh start with my classmates, everyone had already found their groups of friends. And now, we only have a few days of college left and I haven’t made any friends. BUT here’s the thing, I really think I could form a good friendship with this one guy. I won’t see any of my classmates in summer and I really really want to make friends with him. But I SUCK at making friends. He’s also not that very social and seems to be trying very hard to avoid people. I understand why he would do that, it really sucks here in my college. So how do I make friends with him within 3 days. I might transfer to another college so I don’t wanna regret not talking to him, or at least finding out if it could work.

189,"So here goes: 
I started dating a 21 M from Frankfurt, Germany a couple of weeks ago. The first night we met, we danced all night at the club together &amp; I ended up sleeping over. He said he didn't want to lead me on because he's leaving soon and didn't want to be attached to anyone so we just cuddled when I stayed over that first night. Since then, I have seen him every single day for 3 weeks. He went back on his word &amp; has been sleeping with me regardless of the fact that he is definitely scared of the attachment and knows this may not go anywhere since he is leaving soon. 
He leaves in 5 days. I have plans to visit him 2 weeks after he's back in Germany. I am also going to be studying abroad there in the Fall for a year so I will be living very close by. I must also add that I have left my toothbrush there for weeks, I leave my clothes there as well. He doesn't mention it other than returning the clothing but he's let me keep my toothbrush there, says he doesn't care. We also cuddle and always hold hands after sex (not sure if that matters).
Last night, we went to the bar &amp; he was holding hands with other girls and touching their hair or hugging them. There were 3 girls. I tried to ignore it because I figured he was just being friendly. However, something unrelated to him happened to me (I got a bad text from an ex) and I was visibly upset but he ignored it. He continued with his night and we went back to his place with a couple of people. It was all bottling up and I ended up asking him if we could talk. We talked about how I felt it was rude to be sleeping with me for weeks but still openly be so touchy with other girls around me. Turns out what I thought was just him being friendly WAS actually him flirting with those other girls. That made me tear up a bit but he just said ""we're not dating, so why does it matter. you know I'm leaving in 5 days. you also know through me telling you &amp; my best friends telling you that you are the only girl that I have slept with my entire time studying abroad. you are special to me but I am trying to savor my last moments here and that includes flirting with other girls. I would still like to continue seeing you but you need to give me my space because I have seen you every day since we met and it's a bit much for me."" 
The advice I'm asking for is, should I even keep hope with a guy who thinks it's okay to be so openly into other girls in front of me? I have very high self worth &amp; seeing/hearing everything last night, I am starting to feel like staying with someone like that is not what I deserve. I am feeling like he should see how special and lucky he is to know me and get to sleep with me (which I told him). 
At the same time, I can see that he is just trying to have a good time because he won't be in America for very long and flirting with people is a part of that fun for him. I don't want to be selfish, I also don't want to jump the gun and end things with him if this really isn't a big deal. He isn't sleeping with these girls so maybe it's just a fun flirtationship he's got going on with them? Idk. HELP ",11May2018,0

Shortly after, I knocked on their door and spoke to the wife and let her know the bass was really loud and asked if they could turn the subwoofer off at night (our complex has quiet hours). She was apologetic and for a couple of months I barely heard anything (occasionally it'd get loud on a weekend night, no big deal).

But lately they've been turning up the noise around 11pm and last night it lasted till 1:30am. (quiet hours begin at 10pm here). 


I don't want to make an enemy, so I haven't banged on the wall, stormed over, or called the onsite officer about the noise.

The obvious answer is to go over and talk to them again, but I have crippling anxiety about confrontation, AND they have a dog that rushes to the door and barks hysterically so she has to hold him back the whole time (dog is huge girl is small, it's clearly a challenge for her to hold him back).

So is leaving a note passive aggressive? 

I was thinking of being very nice and maybe even apologetic, like ""hey l appreciate that you had turned the bass down after the last time we spoke, but lately it's been loud again at night. I was wondering if you could turn it down during the week? Thank you""

I didn't know we were goin to drink alcohol that time but he bought them so i just drank it with him even if it wasnt part of the plan. I got really drunk that i was throwing up and all then, it happened. We almost did it but we did not. After that night we talked abt what happened but he only brought up rhat i was good and shit and that he was concerned if i liked how he did things to me. He even asked to see me the day after. I declined bc i did not want him thinking that i really liked what happened. I've always thought our friendship was platonic so i regret what happened. Also, HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.  He did not even think about her. I chatted with him for days after the incident acting as if nothing happened while i compose my thoughts. After several days i finally told him that we should stop being friends if we were going to act that way and i asked him too if he ever felt guilty for what happened bc he doesnt seem like it. I also chatted to him that i was never a slutty person (he addressed that to me when we were drinking bc of an incident in HS w/c is a story he never heard my side from) and that those words hurt me bad. 
The morning after his gf chatted me and got really mad and all but she was understanding. I became honest with her abt everything and broke up with him. He did not contact me that day. A few days later he told me he is sorry for being involved in their fight and that she lost his girl and that he loves her. I told him hw should have had proven it and that we should not contact each other. He did not reply. 

The thing is i still think about the things he said and the way he ended our friendship like we were really good friends and with that stupid mistake which he just dodged and not admit. I hate it too that he necer said sorry for what he did with me since he initiated the thing even if i responded since we were both drunk. He never said sorry for caling me a slut. Also, instead of protecting me from her girlfriend by admitting our mistake, he kept quiet and even worsened my reputation to his gf and maybe to our other friends too. He never explained himself he never said sorry for those things. It breaks my heart that i trusted someone like him.

I like details and analyzing it, so when I'm telling a situation I go in deep about what happened, what I felt, how people around me reacted, ect, and I feel kinda rushed when I'm telling her. I can see she's bored or impatient so I just gloss over some things.

Also, sometimes when I speak to her I feel like my issues are not as bad as I feel they are. Which, I know they aren't. But I don't know, I feel stupid discussing them as I know they're so small. 

For example, my mother got into my facebook account without my permission and I hate this. I already had an istance of her reading my messages on my phone and it makes me really angry. I told her that and she acted like it was very normal(I went through a very difficult period, so yeah, it was normal, but it bothered me a lot). Another time I discussed about a fight I had with a friend and she said that this whole thing was quite immature( she did, stutter, though, I don't think she meant to say it like this). Which I guess it was but I don't know, it was a pretty painful thing to me...

I don't know, I feel like my problems are stupid(not all of them, especially the ones related to anxiety, in which she really helps), or that I'm way over sensitive about everything and I'm always just overthinking

That being said, she truly helped me with my anxiety issues, giving me tools to contain and lessen the effects. I do believe she's a great professional, she always made it clear I could call her, told my mom I should be the one who decided if I wanted to have her in the therapy, ect

I'm also afraid I'm just looking for someone to validate my feelings, to just agree with what I say. I know I need someone able to tell me some hard thruths and make me focus.

I don't know guys...  she is my first therapist so I don't know where the limits are draw or what I should really be expecting",11May2018,5

209,"Hey reddit, lately I have been thinking a lot about my relationship with my mom and am starting to think that there might be some harmful aspects to our relationship…. I’m 21, I go to university in a different town and live with my mom when I visit home which is quite often. I have never seen a therapist or talked to someone about and lately I have kind of been thinking that maybe I should about my mom but not sure if my situation merits it? Any advice would be extremely appreciated..

Basically, to make a long story short our family has had an pretty traumatic run. We lost both my dad and sister and now it is just me and my mom. 90% of the time, she is absolutely amazing and I love her so much, but there are some really dark things that she does (in my opinion) some of the time. I feel as though I am her punching bag a bit in life and she takes things out on me when she gets overwhelmed. For example, I can always tell when something bad happens to her (unrelated to me) like being reminded of my sister or the car breaking down that I need to be extra cautious because if I make one minor misstep (like forgetting to call her if I leave the house one night, or accidentally making a rude comment) it will turn into an extreme meltdown. For example, most recently I got rejected from a job I was really hoping for and I reacted by being a bit reclusive and not really talking (to her, or anyone). She was very supportive and echoed that she loved me for the first day and then the second day something unrelated seemed to have happened which upset her and I woke up in the middle of the night to her slamming all the doors in the house, flickering my lights on and off and screaming at the top of her lungs. I tried to ask what is wrong but she just kept telling me to “go away” and “let her suffer” and say that I don’t care about her and no one cares about her (I’m assuming because I had been very distant lately as a result of my bad news). She has done similar things in the past like one time we were driving home from a road trip and in the car and she started screaming “I am going to kill myself , I am going to end my life tonight, I can’t wait for it all to be over” — in these instances I feel very scared and guilty, wishing I hadn’t done that one thing to set her off, or I initially think that something serious happened like somebody died which worries me. And the thing is, she is an extremely put together, successful person in the public but I am the only one who witnesses this dark side, which is what makes me think that I am like an outlet to her sometimes to unleash all her sadness. The ""episodes"" always involve banging things, screaming, shrieking, crying etc. at the top of her lungs and saying such catastrophized things such as having nothing to live for, me not loving her, her wanting to die.. it can last for up to an hour and I am either trying to console her while being shouted all these things about her hating her life or sitting in my room trying to drown out the sound of her shrieking. It is sometimes difficult to explain to my friends that I couldn't hang out when we had planned because my mom was going off the rail and I was too worried about her/upset to go out. I think it really upsets me because my mom is someone I idolize, she has worked so hard and is such a kind person in general and seeing her say these things about her life makes me feel a bit hopeless about my own life.

She takes everything VERY personally — simple things like disliking a movie she enjoys or if she offers to cook me something and I say “no thank you, iI’m trying not to eat too much sugar” or whatever she will take it as a personal stab at her, especially on a bad day. And then come the meltdowns and comments such as “you don’t care about me, nobody cares about me” etc. The things I do to set her off are pretty typical teenage daughter things, like speaking with a rude tone of voice on occasion. She actually often tells me how great of a daughter I am and how much she appreciates me. She also has an irrational dislike of drinking.. on occasion (maybe once a week) I’ll go out with some friends and not come home that night (I’ll always tell her if that’s the case) and she’s fine with it but if I take too long to come home the next day (as in like, not right that morning) she will snap and call me an “alcoholic” (which is funny because I actually volunteer with rehabilitating sufferers alcohol use disorder, lol) “don’t care about her” etc.

Anyway, lately I have been feeling really depressed and I normally try to forget about these situations when they happen but I am really just starting to wonder if they might be affecting me negatively. Her personality like this has been around my whole life growing up although of course it’s been worse as of late with recent events. The biggest thing is I feel so guilty even considering her as potentially “toxic” because 90% of the time she is the best mom in the world, so I feel so guilty even saying this. But anyway, I was hoping to get any thoughts at all from you guys. I am feeling a little lost and I have no idea what to do! Many thanks xxx",11May2018,0

1. What size is right? I was thinking on 12 inch, as I will be placing it from a 10 ft ceiling, but the room is strange. The living room and kitchen are connected, and my goal is to have the living room be the dance floor. The problem is that the ceiling is like 50 ft tall. So, my fix to this is to put it on the 10 ft ceiling that is between the kitchen and living room. The living room is about 30x30, and the kitchen is 10x35-40. Would a 12 in be a good size?

211,"I have a horrible history of becoming really close friends with someone, and then developing a crush on them. And then, when I confess to them that I like them romantically, I get rejected (either because they see me too much as a friend or they don't find me physically attractive), but I still manage to remain friends with them, and in fact, those people are my closest friends of the opposite gender. And there's no awkwardness anymore, and for the most part, I don't really have any plans on making sexual advances (obviously) and I don't really like them romantically anymore. 

My problem is that this is a cycle, and it keeps happening with new people of the opposite gender that I meet and relate to. I begin talking to them, I find that the person is nice, and then I get to know them better and I start really liking them, and then I feel like we could be romantic partners or something. But then by then I've already gone too far as a friend, and I know that there's no point in confessing that I romantically like them because they're not going to reciprocate the feelings, so I hold it in, and I don't tell them, and I try to let the crush wear off, and just remain friends. But I can't. I start fantasising and stuff and I hate myself for doing it. I hate myself for this entire process, why can't I just see people as friends and not potential romantic partners. The worst part is this is currently happening with someone that I don't want to be interested in romantically, but I can't help it. I feel like I just need to confess to them again, and let it pass, and still remain friends, and wait for someone else to come along so I can repeat this process and forget about the previous person. 

I also hate that I go out of my way to get closer to the person I'm interested in sometimes, even if I know it's a lost cause.

And the thing is, honestly, I don't really ever consider sex appeal when I'm thinking of people as potential romantic partners, I just look for someone who is empathetic, kind and loving.  Maybe subconsciously I do have some standard of the person's physical appearance, but it's not like I only fall for someone if they're attractive or anything (idk if this has anything to do with anything, I'm just kind of going on a tangent here)

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, here's a TL;DR: I keep ""girlfriend-zoning"" people who I could just be friends with, but I just can't seem to let the crush on them pass unless someone else comes along, and I don't know what to do about it. Please help. ",11May2018,1

216,"Unsure if the flair fits, but let's see if I can say this as quick as possible (probably not)

My mother, brother, his girlfriend, her mom, and I all live in a house that we've been paying off for a decade+ now. When my father passed, we moved them in under the idea that everyone would be contributing to the house - through bill money or just cleaning up.

Now, seven months in, things happened with my brother and his girlfriend. They aren't together anymore and she left the house. That's about all I'll say on that, but with her leaving dropped a lot of bills on my brother. I was unemployed and finishing school at the time, but now I am working part-time to make some money to contribute too. Combined with the drama and bills, it's taken a toll on him to the point where he takes it out on us, too.

My mother, who can no longer take it, has just announced to me that she wants me to find an apartment since she is unsure how to. My father took care of all of that - even when he got us our house. I don't mind doing it, however **my main issue is that I'm not sure where to start.**

I have a bachelor's degree now, my credit score is 750+, and my part-time job is 11/hour. I currently live in Austin, Texas, but I just need to know who I can consult offline about this.

My mom was many things to be fair. She was narcistic, neurotic and mentally ill, but refused to get help or accept that somethings not okay with her, it was always the others. Thats how i remember her currently and all the time since she died.

I know she could be different if she wanted, but she ruined my life and how i am for 21 years now and i cant think positively of her. 

Its even worse, considering she said fuck you to all of us. To my dad who works so much for me and my sister that i fear he might break down, to my sister who is becoming more and more like mom was, and shes just 14. And to me, after i finally got help and started building my life. 

I hate her, so much so that i want to scream at her for killing herself that one evening almost 3 months ago every day. So much that i have terrifying nightmares every other day that leave me disturbed. And so much that i dont think that i can ever forgive and mourn her after all she did to make us feel miserable. 

I dont know how to go the first steps, how to cope with what is happening. I cried at her grave and the next day i hated myself for feeling anything else than resignation towards her. 

It makes me sick how i feel happy sometimes that i can come home and wont get yelled at or bullied from her, but it feels so wrong to think of her like this after she killed herself.

226,"Hi all. I'm 24 y/o, male, and currently I think I might be having a child soon with my girlfriend. (not yet confirmed, but all signs are there...so let's assume that there's already)

The thing is I just love the news in itself. I mean, my goal in life is to have at least 12 children. So, this age is actually quite the golden age...since we both don't have family history of twins/ triplets. 

Background: With my job and present opportunities, I can support at least 4 children at this point. So no worries on this part.

Now my problem: I suddenly felt all sad about this entire event not because I am having a child, but because I just think that it's unfair for me in the long haul. It was like rush of waves when I realized this not too long ago this week...

She always said that she doesn't want a child because of a ton of valid reason and I believe her, but her actions have contributed to this. I mean, she asks to be impregnated by not moving away when she's riding and I'm about to cum (on a monthly and random day basis); and yeah, I tried asking her to take the birth control pills because of the irrationality that's been happening, but to no avail cuz she said it was a hassle and now this happened.

I know that problems are split between the persons involved, but I'm also quite certain that I've done most of the understanding, providing, and loving part here. That's what every fiber of my being is telling me.

Well, it's been a good run so far for us (not going to disclose for how long we're in a relationship, because this is not the case...but, it's more than a year), but she already forced me away many times me many times for every possible shitty scenario and reason yet I held on...and when I decided to finally leave a couple months back (as she was forcing me out of her life constantly *she admitted this later post-fight) she caved and turned bipolar on me and became...""hey where are you going, what's going on? what food do you like to eat downstairs?""

I love her so much that I just meh, whatever, I'm here for you. Hence, the now situation.

At this point you might be wondering why I'm keeping up with her, but I do because she's always been suicidal before we met for reasons I know about 40% tops. AND I don't want to be that final trigger... I've already fallen deeply in love with her when this was disclosed.

I guess you can say I feel so trapped right now; well actually that's what I feel...

Because my dream is to raise my child with its mom. 

And I seem to have mom part of the dream wrong; and I can't do anything rash/ shitty about it because [one] I'm not that kind of person and [two] I can't be that trigger to her dying.

This entire thought would go away if she's as equally feeling responsible and happy for the miraculous adventure we're about to have; but that is just my fantasy at this point. I don't want my child to know/ feel even the slightest that it is unwanted by anyone before being born.

227,"I’ve had this job since I was 17 years old, and I’m 20 now. I run rides at an amusement park. I was promoted last summer to a lead, so now on top of running rides I’m managing team members, sending them on breaks, doing daily ride inspections, and training new hires how to run the rides. The problem with this job, however, is that it makes me very anxious. As a lead, there’s SO much responsibility weighing on your shoulders. It’s not just the occasional nervous jitters before a shift. It’s crying in Olive Garden the day before because I’m so nervous, having nightmares about my rides literally crumbling to the ground, and having nervous sh*ts during my shift. Also, working out in the cold, rain, and sometimes even snow, sucks. 

So, I’ve thought about putting in my two weeks. I wouldn’t be jobless if I did. I have a second job working with people with special needs that I absolutely LOVE. I started working there during the winter months while the amusement park was closed. It’s closer to home, it’s less stressful, and it pays more. If I quit the amusement park job, I would just compensate with more hours at my second job. 

Like I said, I’m really torn on whether or not I should quit. Whenever I’m not at the amusement park, I dread going back. Not only that, but we’re short on leads. I feel like they could really use my help. All my managers and supervisors love me. While I’m there, I love what I do - not being a lead, but operating the rides and interacting with guests. Lead duties stress me out. I love the park and everyone I work with. The place holds a lot of memories, but I just don’t know if it’s worth the fuss, especially when I have another (better) job. 

I have thought about asking to demote myself. However, that is highly frowned upon - it’s more respectable to just put in your two weeks. 

I’m stuck. I can’t decide if I should tough it out and stick with it for the remainder of the season and just not come back next year, or if I should put in my two weeks and focus on my other job that’s financially and mentally better for me. Any advice? Thanks!

228,"So the situation is that this person is a coworker whom I became friends with. I didn't have any romantic feelings towards them until about a month ago. I use the word feelings because I haven't figured out exactly where they fall on the scale as I've been trying to just ignore them.

They started dating a friend of mine and they treat them more like a buddy than a girlfriend. She's growing sick of it but is willing to work through it despite bringing it up to him multiple times with no results.

Recently, before I developed feelings, she asked about us moving in together. We're both responsible adults with similar living habits. She doesn't want to move in with her boyfriend because she would have to do all the cleaning since he is a messy person.

We've looked at an apartment together and explored the area to find cool places to shop and eat. We talk about the stuff we want to buy for wherever we live. 

So far, I can't determine any signals from her that indicates interest. That doesn't mean there aren't any as I am extremely dense. In addition, I have not acted upon my feelings or made any decisions based on them. I have treated her exactly the same as I did before when the feeling was of just friends.

I want to be fair to her and tell her about this before we make any more plans about an apartment. I'm thinking of asking her to tell me there's no chance so I can reasonably move past this. If it changes her plans, I won't blame her or anything.

Ive considered the possibility of it being just a crush, but have realized it's more stable than that. Which is disappointing because a crush is easy to move past without any awkwardness.

I guess I'm asking for advice on how to best inform her of my feelings while preserving our friendship and keeping an apartment in the works. The apartment is a little selfish but we both want to escape our shitty towns and our shitty job. And that is the best avenue to do so.",11May2018,1

231,"Hi r/advice. Recently, I've noticed something about the relationship between me and my best friend (for context, we are both high school age females). My friend always seems to take from me and never gives anything back. 

For example, every morning I bring a sandwich or some other meal for my friend's lunch so she doesn't have to spend money on it. I also bring snacks that I share with her daily. If she ever asks me to buy her something with money and I say no, she will pester me until I say yes.

The reason for all of this is that my best friend has told me that she has a rough home life. I have never seen any proof of this, but I do not want to question her as I do not want to affect her mental health. My friend sometimes uses her mental health as justification for things: one time, I went on a field trip for a class, and when I returned my friend was having a ""panic attack"" (sitting in public in the cafeteria)  just because I wasn't there and she felt alone. I had to spend time with her for the rest of the day even though I had other stuff to do.

So you would think that because of all this my friend would be caring and supportive of me or at least acknowledge the things I do. However, she will:

* Complain if the food I bring isn't to her liking or is something she's eaten recently
* Refuse to share any food that she buys with me
* Beg me for money to buy lunch if she doesn't like the food I bring
* Ask me for my food without regard to my hunger
* Continually brag about how superior her writing ability is to everyone else's even though she had a C in English
* Use her mental health as leverage over me or an excuse
* Refuse to study class material and then come desperately to me for help when a test is coming and I am busy studying
* Never bring a water bottle to school and then drink all of mine
* Complain and rant to me all the time about a trivial and insignificant thing that is bothering her and blow it out of proportion
* This is a big one: neglect to attend any big events for me and require that I show up to hers. I'm in Film class, and my school has a yearly annual Film Festival where my movie was being screened to a large school audience. My friend ""couldn't make it"" despite me offering to pay for an Uber to take her home (she didn't have anything planned during the festival). However, my friend is also planning a showcase to show her story idea to a bunch of teachers. Her story is a rip-off of the Marvel Universe but as manga. Of course, guess who is being forced to attend.

Basically, she just uses me for any needs that she has and doesn't feel like remedying.

I know it sounds like I don't care much about her but she really is my best friend and I care about her a lot. Without me she would not have any other friends and I don't want to take that away from her. Besides, I am awkward and quiet and I don't make friends easily. When my best friend is around I don't feel so alone anymore.


Do you have any advice on how to deal with this situation? I love my friend, but I don't feel like this kind of one-sided relationship can go on forever. I just want my friend to recognize the accommodations I make for her and maybe be a little more open to giving back.",11May2018,1
232,"The whole thing started when I went to the school curator to talk about my issues with anxiety, and now in about two weeks I will have my first meeting with a real psychiatrist. The thing is, the anxiety is not my only issue. 

I have a hard time with social interaction, and this is my biggest problem, but the school consuelor seemed to kind of brush that away as ordinary anxiety and told me that she couldn’t tell that I was struggling. I am afraid that I did not express myself correctly, and felt like my problem was not being taken seriously. 

Now I am afraid to do the same mistake again. I want to be able to get help, but part of the help I need is to find a way to express my issues. I’ve always been uncomfortable talking about my emotions, and serious stuff, and it doesn’t help that I’m going to talk to a stranger who will also be judging me. 

My problems listed:

- I feel anxious and scared around people. (Especially crowds and people I dislike. This goes as far as to me avoiding school when my friend is not there due to fear of people talking to or looking at me (when she is there I can always count on her to do the talking and if someone were to look at me I could talk to her in order to seem busy so I can ignore them), so she kind of works as my shield.

- I have little to no motivation for anything. 

- I sleep poorly. (I feel tired all the time and sleep seems to be making me feel even more exhausted. Sometimes I also wake up with headaches.)

- People don’t seem to take my problems seriously and/or not understand the gravity of them. For example my dad thinks I’m just shy and my friends think I’m being dramatic and delusional (and I’m only letting them scrape the surface of how much I struggle). 

Now that you know what my biggest problems are, what do you think is the best way for me to bring them up to the psychiatrist to not get misunderstood? And to not get my issues blamed on family members or friends, because they have nothing to do with why I feel the way I do, and I don’t want to mislead her/him by thinking that. 

I am very grateful for answers!

234,I’m apartment hunting and this is an issue I’m running in to. What are the pros and cons of each ? Most places in my price range have window units and my one experience with them wasn’t the best. I had one in my bedroom but I was barely ever home so I didn’t spend that much time using it. I was under the impression they used more electricity but I’m open to any input. Thanks ,11May2018,1

I was told there’s plenty in nursing but it turned out I’m too stupid for that, too. I'll endanger patients if and when dealing with medications or left on my own devices with them.

I also lost my driver’s lisence for endangering traffic because I’m too stupid to pay attention to more than one thing at once.

236,"On Sunday, my younger sister \(23\) ended her over 3\-year relationship with her fiance. I'm going to try and give a little backstory without going into too much detail. Six months ago, they got into a huge fight and she's felt like they weren't meant to be together ever since. She also started to develop feelings for someone else over the last month. Therefore, she ended it. They were living with the fiance's parents, so she obviously had to move out. Since she didn't really have anywhere to go, my SO and I offered her our couch for a while. It's probably going to be for a few months, but we haven't had a chance to sit down and talk about how long she plans to/would need to stay due to our different schedules. She's balancing work and school and is also a smitten kitten, spending a lot of time with this new friend. \(Tonight will actually be the second night staying at his apartment.\) Because she's so busy, she's really only at our place to sleep and get ready. My question is, should we ask her for some rent money while she stays with us? She won't move in with this new friend, mainly because he lives so far away from her job and school, but I have a feeling she'll be spending quite a few nights over at his place. This is just new territory for all of us, so I wanted to get some advice. Thanks in advance!",11May2018,1

But for some reason she is always indirectly threatening me. One time we were having dinner and my boyfriend went to the bathroom then she completely randomly said ""If you cheat on him I will gut you with this fork I'm holding"".

When there's only two of us she is always quite threatening for no reason, I never provoked her or anything.

Now my boyfriend told me that his sister and her boyfriend invited us to go to another city to do some sightseeing. I don't want to go anywhere together with his sister.

242,"So let me give some background, I’m 16 my friend (who’s name is cj) is 16 as well. Cj has had a bit of a rough life, his dad is an alcoholic, and his mom is too wrapped up in work and supporting the family to care. Cj plays hockey, and loves playing video games with our group of friends (who I will name later). Hockey has odd scheduling so Cj finds himself at practices usually until midnight or one in the morning on school nights. Recently Cj got out of a very promiscuous relationship that was causing him to self harm because his girlfriend was cheating on him very frequently. Because his girlfriend slept around, Cj has had rumors of him being a practical male prostitute spread about him. Because of this, he has found finding another relationship to prove quite difficult. Well he succeed, with this girl who’s name is Peyton. Peyton wants to love Cj, but finds it hard because of all of these nasty rumors that are said about him and in turn is mentally abusing Cj without even realizing. This has a severe negative effect on cj’s mental health. Recently (4-5 months ago) cj’s mother was hospitalized and had emergency surgery for an issue that I am not aware of. Cj’s Mom was given oxycodone (that’s how you spell it right?) as a pain reliever, which she still takes to this day. However, Cj has been stealing his mother’s pills and replacing them with look-alikes and using the opiates for his own personal, recreational use. This was caused by a wonderful man named Cody-who as far as I’m aware is a pill junkie-who convinced Cj that stealing oxycodone from his mother and snorting them for his own good, would be the best decision he’s ever made. Reality check: it wasn’t. In this recent spell of about 5 months, Cj has began to battle a serious depression, came off and then went right back on oxycodone, has forced himself to stay in this mentally abusive relationship-to prove an unnecessary point that he doesn’t date girls for sex-and has had no more than 5 hours of sleep a night, because of his schedule with hockey, and his addiction. I have seen pictures of Cj with a gun in his mouth and suicide notes he has written. (I kept his Snapchat streaks for a short while and they were in his memories) Recently, me and my friends: Mike and Jonah, have really tried to get through to Cj, because he is now speaking of doing Xanax along with all of the other shit he is currently doing: Acid, Oxy, and shrooms. We have tried to emphasize the dangers of addiction and warn him that the next step would be heroin (which is basically a ticking time bomb before overdose) Cj becomes combative when we talk to him about this, claims that he has overdosed before, he knows his limits, that we don’t know the difference between heroin and oxycodone, and we are just being Debbie-downers and don’t know how to have fun. However, it’s more than that, the county I live in has an over dose death rate of 42 per 100K. One of the highest in the country. I really don’t want to see one of my best friends turn down a dark path and be gone forever. I don’t want him to become another statistic for the CDC to publish, but most certainly I don’t want to estrange him by my ant-drug rhetoric. (I am not against marijuana use, but hard drugs are a different story) However, I feel it is important to pound this information into his head, because he doesn’t get it, and is really living like he’s invincible at this point. Sadly, I’m not getting through to him, and I’ve reached my wits end, I don’t want to have to bury my friend before he even graduates. Please help me here, I’m really in a pickle. ",11May2018,1

I feel like my feelings are always invalidated by everyone around me and I’ve never felt this alone in my life. The only reason I told my mum anything is because I couldn’t stop crying and have been feeling this way for months. When I felt she understood I stopped because i was like wow someone understands but then my dad came home and she started yelling about how she wanted to get me a gift which was not the point of the convo at all I realise I’ve said that but I started crying again then and there because I was so embarrassed.

Do note I am in College and they KNOW that and it was my finals week so I had to reschedule all my finals just because of this job. Well, no one wanted to cover the other shits. So my manager said well you have to do it until we find a replacement. I said well I have finals that I still need to study for and they just act like that's not their problem. So I said ok I will cover. Now do note I been working here for the past 6months. I never called off, used my PTO or any sick days and I was sick as a dog and they still made me come in. Also for the past 3 months I have been working AM shifts Not PM(the shift the girl quit working) Ever since I started the PM shift my managers been complaining and yelling at me saying ""this is not done right...you're not doing this right and so on"" I try explaining to them stating ok so how am I suppose to do it and they catch an attitude and never show me how to do it correctly.

Pretty much what I stated beforehand in english.

I know this sounds crazy I really do. But I'm terrified of my medication which has been recently prescribed to be used to control my mind. I feel like I'm part of a huge experiment to see how it works. 

What's the best way to test it on people, test it on the people who are ""mentally ill"" and then if they say that it's used for kind controlling or some sort of experiment they are just mentally ill and don't make sense. It's a genius idea, test mind controlling drugs on people who are classed as mentally unstable so their opinions and thoughts are that of a crazy person and no one will listen to it properly.

I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression but I feel like somehow I've been targeted using tv and social media to make me feel depressed so I go to get help and they give me these tablets that control my mind. 

I can't tell the doctors how I feel about it either because they'll just class me as crazy and section me, try to keep me away from society so I can't ruin their plan. The doctors themselves may not even know it's an experiment but they've been taught to take to section anyone who says things like that so they can't harm themselves or anyone else.

But I've been told I have OCD so I doubt how I feel about this but what if that's the plan, they tell me I suffer from OCD so I believe it's the OCD that's makes me like this when I'm fact I'm right about it all. The worst part is I can't stop it or doing anything about it because people will think I'm crazy.

I don't know what to do, any advice is welcome.

252,"I am a pretty average guy in most ways, but there are a couple of specific things I am very good at.  I have been a programmer for 10 years and enjoy solving difficult problems and dreaming up neat projects.  I've done well enough in my career, but I've only ever given 25-50% effort at best.  Most of my work is done in small bursts of productivity, either due to deadlines or the aforementioned things I enjoy.  Otherwise, I spent quite a lot of time on Reddit, browser games, reading, and chatting with friends.  I know, poor me, right?

While I don't have a ton of personal time due to being married and having 3 kids, the overwhelming majority of it is spent gaming with friends (mostly DotA).  I have taken breaks from it for little projects that come up, but I always come back.  This is usually between 11pm til 1am, give or take an hour.  While I don't want to give up this time completely, I feel like I should be able to limit it to 1 or 2 nights a week, but... see title.

All of this to say, I've been feeling a growing sense of dissatisfaction for quite a while now, but I almost never care enough to actually do something about it.  I don't like to sound conceited, but I always figured I'd eventually 'make it' by building something (platform, game, app, w/e) that became a big hit.  I now know that (unfortunately) this attitude was fostered by my mother and siblings.  Of course, I'm now a grown man and I know I should be able to move past such obstacles, but... see title again.

I always get these big ideas, then am never able to follow through with the prolonged effort required for such projects.  Some of my ideas even ended up being created by someone else (not stolen, they just made something very similar to what I envisioned/documented) and became wildly successful.  I'm currently sitting on 2 or 3 big ideas that have serious potential, and I know somebody else will make them eventually.  I just tell myself all of these excuses/lies like I can't do it alone, I don't have enough time, theres always time to do it later, etc.

I'm sorry this is so long.  Expressing my thoughts in a neat and concise manner is definitely not one of my strengths.  If you made it this far, thanks a ton for listening and any discussion/advice you can provide.

254,"I chose a new first and middle name that I adore, but when I told my friend she said that my birth one suited me better. 

The main reason I wanted to change my name is because I don't think my birth one suits me. It's not an awful name, and I know everyone says it suits me so well, but my mother was young and naive when she named me, and I have a name which has no meaning. It's difficult to say and the opposite of my personality. My middle name is my father's surname, who is the most despicable human being I've ever met, I want nothing to do with him. 

I love Cora Elizabeth, but because it's such a girly/flowery name, I'm worried people will not accept it because it doesn't suit me, especially since I'm a black girl, I've never been made to feel girly or delicate before. It seems that people expect a ""ghetto"" name when they meet me for the first time, and while I think that  no one should be shamed or judged for the name that they're given, I think Cora represents the type of person I am. It's sweet and simple and makes me happy when I doodle it in my notebook. 

I confessed this my friend and she was very against it, saying that she prefers my old name instead. It has made me doubt myself as it seems that everyone will have the same reaction, and I will go back to the old me.

I'm going to uni soon and I want to start this new chapter of my life with a new name, and my old one as a nickname, MAYBE. I'm worried that if people found out my old name, people would think that I'm trying to be someone I'm not and use my old one again. I've been told many times that I don't act black enough and I think changing my name will worsen this problem.

I’ve had lots of problems with my family. I’ve been threatened to be sent away when I was younger. My mother threatened to cease all contact with me if I continued speaking with my aunt (her sister) and uncle. (She really did stop speaking to me and made my sisters and dad follow along.) Threatened to stop helping me if I continued to talk to my ex.

Their reasoning? Family always comes first and if I don’t accept that then I’m not really family. 

However they’ve left me multiple times to pick myself up after they’ve gone to town on me. They’ve wrecked me apart by talking shit about me to my face and behind my back. They have stopped talking to me on multiple occasions.

Just today, my sister decides that I can no longer ride with her to a music festival bc we don’t talk. Granted, I left a job she got me but she knows and refuses to understand my reasonings. She invited me to go with her, planned to ride together (main reason I even got my ticket and didn’t pay for a parking ticket) and now she doesn’t want me to go with her.

They’ve done these kinds of things to me time and time again but I’m supposed to just take it. Yet when I try to bring up their mantra it doesn’t seem to apply to anyone else but me when they want to keep me in check.

1. Job at my hometown in Georgia at a call center.  $10 dollars an hour.  Minimum wage in my state is $7.25. I'd take calls from people, especially people stranded motorists.  
2. Job in Washington, D.C. as a nonprofit fundraiser.  $12 an hour.  Minimum wage in D.C. is $11.50.  I'd be outside all day, on my feet, talking to people, fundraising for different advocacy groups.  

I'm having a hard time deciding which job to take.  On one hand, if I take the job at my hometown, I'll be able to save up a lot money.  I don't have to pay rent here.  I could save thousands.  But I'm also tired of living at home and I don't want to waste the next several months, or a year here.  It feels stifling \+ there's nothing to do in my small hometown in Georgia.  I have very little social life here.

On the other hand, if I take the job in D.C., I'll be mostly independent.  I'd feel proud of myself.  I'm an introvert and I feel like talking people all day would get me out of my comfort zone \(that's what i want\).

-Nieghbor two houses down is an asshole (witnessed him yelling at a guy for parking his truck around the corner)
-No fireplace (House #2 has a fireplace)

House #2
Pros:
-Allows pets
-Prettier area
-Fireplace
-Near a river/park

Cons:
-25-45 minute commute depending on traffic. (I work early in the AM so at least my commute in is reasonable)
-One bathroom
-Smaller kitchen

Which is the better choice?

276,So my family is considered upper middle class regardless of the large amount of debt crushing them. They can’t help and haven’t financially supported me in any way for three years.

279,"This happened a few weeks ago but I still think about it a lot and don’t understand what happened.
I went to a bar with my boyfriend and coworkers and only had 2 beers which I drank rather slowly. I drink beer all the time and usually 2 wouldn’t even get me tipsy. 
After that second beer, I cannot remember anything. I woke up around noon, fully clothed im my bed with 17 missed calls and many worried messages. My boyfriend later told me that we stayed in that bar for hours and even went to a club after and that I seemed pretty normal, just a bit distracted. Apparently I just disappeared at some point and they broke down my door to see if I was there. 

So can anyone tell me how tf that could have happened? Because I could apparently walk and talk and normally and even made it home on my own but it would be hella unusual to just lose all my memory after 2 beers and to just go home without telling anyone.
It might be important to mention that I felt like shit for a whole day after. Not hungover, just extremely tired and heavy and my vision was kinda blurry. I also had the worst headache.

He posted a tribute to his mother on Twitter today, she passed away earlier this week. I want to reach out and say something to him, but I don’t know what. For some reason even “I’m sorry for your loss” strikes me as the wrong thing to say.

  a) She doesn't seem to want a boyfriend (in general)  
  b) she is very religious and all the things this implies in regards to sex/marriage etc   
  c) She takes pride in our ancestors and their history(too much in my humble opinion)

I am 29M with a Bachelors degree but I think I do not like the degree that I have. Now I work as a Sales Rep, I am unsure of what to do with my path.

It's been far and few between when something actually checks those boxes, and turns out worth checking out. 

So recently found a place that checked everything perfectly, my fiance went to view it said it was great, we got a copy of the lease, but were waiting until I could get a viewing since I work nights and was unable to until the weekend. We scheduled a tour for me for tomorrow where we would likely sign the lease, but heard today it was no longer available. 

Is that the norm, where even expressing a likelihood of signing, they just get swooped in and taken?

Now jump 2 years, I rarely ever check my bank statements as the only money I get is from my Student Loan, then I decide to finally check it a few days ago and suddenly out of the blue, It turns out I have been receiving benefit money, even though I was at University and this has apparently been paid to me 3 times! (Every month since February 2018) all my money has been going to my rent purely, so I never actually saw these payments in my account balance either, again, just thinking it was apart of my Student Loan.

I know I should contact Universal Credit about this, but I’m incredibly worried that this will be seen as fraud, or I’ll have to pay them back, which I can’t afford to do, as I literally have not a penny and I’m already paying off an overpayment from the Student Loan service.

Hey guys,

feeling down again and getting things off my chest. Trying not to write a text the length of a book as i do usually here.

It begins with that i got rejected two and a half weeks ago by a girl which i was so sure liked me. The usual stuff that gets posted here every day, you know... 

What bothers me is that i was so sure she liked me, she went out of her way to spend time with me, and it was great and i enjoyed every second with her and it seemed to me like she did too. 

Fast forward, i ask her out 
(four weeks after realizing she was there, even though she was there all the time - im sure you know what i mean) , 
she says something about busy weekend and later that night texts me that she doesnt think that it would work out between me and her. 

I act like everythings okay and tell her she shouldnt think about it because its nothing.

Many times since then i have felt like i was over it and was actually happy and confident. 

Lately i see how she always seems to be around a friend of mine that i like. For example at a party some days ago. He sits down, she sits down. He gets up, she gets up. They say bye to each other and go into a fucking 10 second hug, with me standing right next to them.
 
it f*cking kills me inside, for several reasons. 

im also confused because he has a girlfriend and isnt the guy who would start something with another girl, so i think they just must be very good friends. 
At this point i should probably mention that im not the one who got invited to many parties in the past. 

And that makes me think. I thought that she liked me, but i was nothing for her, ever. Probably not even as a friend because i see now that she has much better friends that she seems to know since forever.

313,"My girlfriend works as a cashier at a local store and for a few weeks has been been the subject of repeated unwanted attention and verbal abuse from a customer.

It began when he made some inappropriate remarks-- I stress the word inappropriate though they were not lewd-- while she was ringing up his purchase, and these made her very uncomfortable. She didn't confront him at the time, just tried to finish his order and get him out the door as quickly as possible. He returned a few days later and when he was ready to check out, he made a beeline for her register. At this point, she asked him to please go to a different register, and he blew his lid shouting and insulting her before storming off to a different line. After he'd finished checking out, he took his purchases and went to the office where he resumed shouting and carrying on, saying he's being discriminated against, continuing to insult my girlfriend, saying he'll sue her and the store.

After he finally left, she got called into the office and asked what that was all about. She told management he'd previously made her uncomfortable and as such refused to personally serve him on this occasion. She was told that she can't do that, but they weren't going to punish her for it due to the circumstances. Subsequently, whenever management notices this customer in the store, they pull my girlfriend off register and take her to a secure location in the store until the customer has left.

This is actually more than I'd necessarily expected from the store, but is certainly less than I'd hoped for. This guy comes in all the time, and my girlfriend feels very much as though he's looking for her with the intention of continuing this pattern of behavior. She's afraid for her safety. She's having actual nightmares about this guy. As far as either of us know, nobody at the store has told the guy his behavior is unacceptable or that he's not to return. She very nearly has a panic attack before every shift knowing that there's a chance he'll be there, a chance that nobody will get her in time and that she'll be trapped at the register if this guy decides to escalate the situation even further.

I've started walking her into the store as far as I'm allowed and then only leaving after she's gotten to the office, but it's not much of a solution. She's worried. I am, too, and more than that I'm frustrated not knowing how to help her. I can't very well just loiter around the store until he comes in and confront him myself.

But like when I leave her on read or give her late ass replies it seems that she likes me better. And also when I do message her right away and stuff I feel like those are the times when our friendship is at it's lows.

Have any advice? ",11May2018,1
320,"I (18M) have been stressed over my body for a long time, and the fact that I have anxiety and depression only makes it worse. I am from Brazil, where it is common for people my age to get together to go to the beach almost always, and I unfortunately never go, because I'm a little fat and I have puffy nipples, something that kills my confidence, and the fact that I do not go on the beach (or just take off the shirt somewhere very hot) with my friends because of this constantly bother me. I've been trying to create motivation for months to go back to doing exercises (I did a year of gym alone, and then I switched to crossfit, where I stayed for almost a year, training with a friend) and go to a nutritionist to improve my eating habits. The fact that I'm not happy with my body is making me mentally exhausted. I have been to a psychologist for 2 years but recently quit because I felt that I was not making more progress than I had already done, which was basically improving socially (I am currently doing better in this regard) but, as I said, this lack of motivation is destroying me. Any help in this situation would be appreciated.",11May2018,2
321,"First and foremost I'm well aware what I'm about to say makes me sound insane. This is why I'm here and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I also realize what I'm about to say sounds like a huge lie, even though I also swear it happened so I don't expect much to come of this but I'm desperate. 

There's a minor celebrity I've liked for a long time. Had a crush on him since I first saw him years ago in a specific set of movies. He's not well known unless you are in his little cult circle of fans so I'm not going to bother saying who he is here. He did conventions for a while to meet fans then quit for a long period after an incident with a stalker that was pretty horrific. 

I was bummed and thought I'd never get to meet him until by pure chance he appeared at a convention last year near my city that I was easily able to get to. I went, not knowing what to expect. Keep in mind I am not one of these people who's into celebrity worship or gossip. I don't see the point of it. Celebrities are just people and should be treated as such. They deserve the same amount of privacy as you and I so if I do end up admiring a celebrity, which is rare, I pretty much try to keep my distance instead of approaching. Admire from afar and try not to idolize anyone. My father was a local celebrity growing up and I've had enough exposure to the attention that brings that I don't find it very appealing (fame I mean). I'm also a regular convention goer so I know how these things are supposed to work and I don't expect more than a ""hi how are you"" sign a picture and leave sort of deal. 

However, to my utter surprise, almost no one was there to see the guy I was there to see. I am aware he's not nearly as famous as he once was but I didn't expect it to be literally 5 people in line to see him (not an exaggeration). Since he had very little to do and wasn't trying to charge money to talk to him and I'm a fan I took the opportunity to talk to him and we did talk for about an hour. 

The conversation had very little to do with him as an actor. We hit it off surprisingly well considering that I typically don't get along with strangers and prefer to keep to myself. I was having a hard time telling if he was flirting with me or being nice until he said to me ""I should stop being so flirty with you or it'll make my wife upset"" to which I had no answer because I didn't know what was going on and I wasn't trying to flirt with him at all, I know he's married. 

Yes I'm attracted to him, yes I think he's amazing, but because I knew he was married well obviously I'm not going to be trying to pick him up. 

Cut to a year later, another convention. He was appearing with the rest of the cast of the movie who I desperately wanted to meet but couldn't meet the year prior. I decide to see him again anyway because a bunch of my friends want autographs and I thought it would be fun to see if he remembered me considering we talked for an hour the year prior. 

I'm waiting in line and he recognizes me, in line. Points to me, waves to me, and calls out 'hello'. I get up there and he's calling me pet names, and asking me about stuff we talked about a year before. Like he remembered everything. I'm shocked by this because I'm a pretty boring person and I don't think too highly of myself but he was super into me. When we went to pose for a picture I just put my arm around him but he pulled me into a hug out of nowhere, which of course I hugged him back but I didn't initiate it and it was a really firm hug, more so than just being friendly. 

We start talking again because he knows I'm a writer and we start dicussing possibilities of him reading a script I wrote as he knew I already had sent it out to other actors who gave me a referral. He tells me that we'll have lunch or something and talk later cause he's busy. 

It's a convention so I stick around to do other stuff, see other people, and whatever. I get a text from a friend who wants an autograph from him so I go back. I'm in line again and while he's with another fan, his back is to me, he reaches out behind and holds his hand out to me like he wants a high five. I go to high five him and he grabs my hand and intertwines his fingers with mine. Once again, this is something he initiated, as I said I know he's married so the last thing I'm trying to do is flirt. Is it possible I was throwing out signals unintentionally? Sure but my physical and verbal behavior was not intentionally trying to flirt with him. 

The next day we meet up privately for about ten minutes. He drops some line about ""If this were five years ago things would be different but I'm married now and trying to settle down"" and this was apropos of nothing because the conversation was literally only me trying to get information to get a referral to his agent so I could give him my script. So he says this and I'm thinking ""okay I know you are married why are you bringing this up"" but I just kind of nod and go with it. Yet once again I get a picture with him while grabbing another autograph for yet another friend (pictures come with the autographs and I like him so I'm not going to not get a picture). He hugs me, another hug he initiated because once again all I did was put my arm around him like a natural friendly pose. 

Right before this happened, I realized I had my backpack on and I told the guy taking the pictures to wait because I had to get my backpack off. Apparently, within this time, he took two pictures quickly thinking I was ready when I wasn't. I didn't even know these pictures were taken until two days ago when I checked my camera roll. The way this actor is looking at me in these pictures (which I'm sure he didn't know were taken because I told the guy to hang on a minute) is undeniable attraction. I'd prefer NOT to post them but I do have them and I asked my other friends what they thought and they all agree he's definitely looking at me like he wants me. 

The thing is I don't know how to process any of this. I've admired and been attracted to this actor for several years and he's inspired a lot of things I've written. I love him as a person and as an actor. This is not at all the situation or outcome I wanted to get from this because I know he's off limits and I know it will stay that way (as in, I'm not going to do crap about it). 

I'm not going to actively pursue him, I don't even know what city he lives in and even if I did that wouldn't matter much because I'm not a creepy weirdo. The problem is that the massive emotional fallout all of this has caused has stuck with me. I have a really bad life, an unbelievably bad life, situation, job, you name it. I'm a struggling writer trying to get somewhere with my work and pretty much aout one step away from behing homeless. Every day for me is misery, I have no self esteem, I don't think I'm pretty, I really do not think highly of myself and if you were to ask me what I think of my future it's really grim. Then this crap happens to me, out of nowhere, I have no idea how to handle it. Even worse, because he's famous it's a story NO ONE IS GOING TO BELIEVE and I suppose he's lucky that I'm not a crazy fan of his because I'm not going to pursue it, at all, nor am I going to post the pictures I have publicly, tell people his name, or even say who I am. I don't want people to know about this or take it entirely out of context. 

As I said I know I sound insane and I know this sounds like a lie which makes it all the more frustrating because why would anyone believe me? I just sound delusional but it certainly happened and I have the pictures to prove at least some of it. 

How do I get over this? How do I move on with my life and accept that this man is married, even though he's quite literally the only man EVER IN MY LIFE that made me feel attractive, wanted, and like I mattered? I know I have to move on but I don't know how to move on. 

TL;DR: A celebrity I met at a convention threw out flirty mixed signals to me, he's married, I can't get over it, and I'm sure no one is going to believe me despite trying to get get advice. ",11May2018,1
322,"Hello all!

I finished my freshman year of college yesterday. I am in William and Mary’s honor program on a full ride scholarship. I finished the academic year with around a 3.7 GPA and 62 credits. I’m a research assistant in an international relations consortium, an editor for an international relations journal, and a member of the debate team. I worked for the Clinton campaign and a local judicial campaign. I am interning for the Palm Beach County court system this summer.

I was at one point an intern for the school’s newspaper but didn’t find it in my professional interests and backed out. I was also a part of the MUN team but also found it not in my professional interest.

I am at a crossroads. I am considering four different academic paths:

1. Government
2. International Relations
3. Government and Economics
4. Government and Finance

And a handful of career paths:

1. Investigative/Political Journalism
2.  Civil Rights/Financial Crimes/International Law
3. International Diplomacy
4. Finance/Stock-brokering

324,"I am a single parent who was, until recently, attending a church. I live in a pretty liberal area, and so I assumed that my divorce status (especially considering that my ex husband was abusive) wouldn’t matter. I think that I might be the only single parent who attends this church, and as such, I have felt kinda isolated. I have over 90% custody with very little help, and I have been in the middle of a really rough custody battle and divorce since joining. I don’t feel seen or supported. They continually ask me to do things (ie work) that are a stretch for me—my child is very small. The last straw for me, I guess, was this last weekend. I was teaching a class that I felt guilted into teaching which requires me to put my child in childcare at the church. They had my toddler (who is suffering from confusion around his father) do a coloring project where they cut out a father, a mother and a child for him to color and glue on paper. This felt like, to me, quite literally the writing on the wall. I’m not even a member of this organization, and they’ve got me teaching a class of kids (that I later found out is notoriously difficult), they’re shoving Herero-normative nuclear family bullshit down my child’s throat and not one of them has reached out to me (besides saying that they’re praying) when I am seriously struggling. I sit by myself almost every Sunday, and nobody really talks to my child and me. I told the woman in charge of the Sunday school that I was upset by the activity they made my toddler do, and that it didn’t reflect our family, and I have retracted my desire to join the church.  My question is this: I have received emails from both the associate pastor and director of children’s ministry asking if something is wrong. Do I say anything or let it go? What do I say? Is it worth it? I’m not planning to go back to church there. I only teach this class for a few more weeks. ",11May2018,1
325,"I finished my first full year of college a couple of weeks ago. I'm a part of a religiously affiliated group there that has become kind of main new friend group since I didn't know many people there. I have a few really close friends in the group, but the ones I'm closest to are the leader of the group and his wife. They aren't more than a few years older than anyone else in the group. Obviously, the whole group is friends with them, but I think most of the time that we in particular are close. I'm single, so not leaving anyone behind, so that's not an issue, but I really miss hanging out with those two. I wrote them both short letters before the semester was over so I know that they know what they mean to me.

331,"This is going to sound like a troll, but I swear it's real.

I live on Long Island. About a year ago, my best friend (28M) met a girl on Tinder. I'm going to call her Sarah. She introduced herself, in a thick southern accent* (this is important) to me as ""Miss Sarah"" and drinks water out of a wine glass with her pinky out. Boyfriend and I look at each other like, ""ummm ok""? Quirky, but whatever. We play a round of Smash 4, I beat her but she holds her own - word, we can chill.

Their romantic relationship fizzled out almost immediately, but she continued to hang out with our social group. Cool with us, and not the first time it's happened. We got along just fine, and I was always nice to her. I wouldn't say we clicked, but I did enjoy her presence.

She eventually starts hooking up with another guy (24M) in our group. Lets call him Charlie. No one cares.

One day, shit hits the fan. We discover that she has been engaged this whole time and has been lying about huge pieces of her identity. This leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially since Charlie is a good friend to me and is very cautious with women. She disappears completely for a few months, and we assume that that's the last of Miss Sarah.

Best Friend's birthday rolls around and she shows up to his surprise party. Someone on the fringe of the social circle didn't realize that most of us would prefer she not be invited and told her to come by. Girlfriend of Best Friend is less than thrilled, but it is what it is - she's already walking up to the front door, so might as well let it go and try to all just get along.

Miss Sarah walks in and greets us. Her southern accent is gone. She spent SIX MONTHS speaking to us in this exaggerated southern drawl, and now she is standing in our living room with a bedazzled hat that says ""BROOKLYN"", wearing a skimpy dress, sans-accent.

For whatever reason, no one addressed this. We were all so stunned and not interested in drama that we just let it go. This was in January. Ever since, she hangs out regularly again. She attends our weekly open-invite video game and drinking night. I have not yet seen her get invited to anything individually by anyone. She's known for hitting on all of our friends (including those who are taken), and no one has solved The Case of the Runaway Accent.

Best Friend keeps pushing me to be chummy with Miss Sarah again. I am cordial and polite, but I am definitely far colder to her than to the rest of the group. I refuse to allow any kind of friendship to blossom again as I feel that she is manipulative and untrustworthy. Girlfriend of Best Friend also doesn't care for her, obviously, and my boyfriend cannot stand her one bit (although he too is polite).

Some of my friends agree with me and feel that the cool part of being all grown up is that you do not have to be friends with people you do not like. You don't have to invite everyone in your class to your birthday party when you're 23. Best Friend very much wants me to get over it and be her buddy again to maintain the peace. I think he feels bad for her.

On some level, I feel for her. I think she wanted to live out some strange fantasy that got out of hand, realized she was in too deep and actually genuinely liked us and wanted to stick around, and didn't know how to fix the situation. On another level, I know I could get over it and move on if she would just address this strange song and dance she perpetuated for months.

So, Reddit, am I the asshole? Should I just... pretend shes a new person? Pretend she didn't lie to us all for 6 months? Should I just tell her we've got beef and hash it out with her so we can be cool? I never imagined i would find myself in such a strange situation.

334,"Hello,

So  I worry a lot \(pretty sure I have OCD\). I've worried about a lot of  things, but the scariest fear was the fear of losing my sanity or a  loved one dying.

""What if one day I 'go crazy'? What if my friend becomes severely depressed and dies? What if...""

And  the cycle continued until I cut out my compulsions by not Googling my  symptoms and resisting rumination. It turns out, with anxiety/OCD, the  more you compulsively run away from your problems, the more they appear.

Anyway,  I am mostly over my fear of 'going crazy' I think. I know that the  chances of me being 'crazy' are basically next to none, as 'crazy'  people don't think anything is wrong with them.

Anyway,  after nearly getting over my fear, last week I realized all of my  friends were depressed, and I didn't really know how to handle that.  I  think I retreated into a strange, numb feeling, which worried me because  I thought I was depressed. I looked at myself in the mirror, and the  first time, I didn't recognize myself. I think this was because my  expression was neutral, and it usually is happy or silly. The second  time I looked into my eyes, I got scared for whatever reason, and sought  reassurance from the internet that I wasn't losing my mind. Worried I  had depersonalization/derealization.

I  hope you can relate. I have a book on mindfulness which I need to read,  and several workbooks on anxiety. However, I think I may need to look  elsewhere for this detachment I'm feeling. I'm typically a pretty  empathetic guy, but I'm concerned that all of my friends' problems \+  mine are bringing me down.

Please offer a PDF or good article to help, or advice, or both.

Really appreciate it!",11May2018,1
335,"Didnt knew where to ask, sorry. From time to time when im going to sleep i experience ""mental images/visualisation"" - dont realy know how to say itproperly, but i see very complex abstract figures, like circles, cubes, that constantly moving. There is usually one object and colors are raight white and black + important part - image moves and pulses realy fast with size change. I basicaly feel like im seeing object in 2 forms in one point of time - imagine seeing something from 100m and 1 m at the same time. Second form is like negative version of first form increased in size. By negative i mean if first form is white, second form is black.

We stopped talking and then I keep getting texts saying, ""I can't do it. I need you,"" etc, etc. We tried to compromise, but it ended with us breaking up for good. 
      Her best friend (Cathy) ended up logging into her Snapchat and changing her password, so that she wouldn't be able to text me (that'll come in soon). 
      I get a text from Beth's phone saying, ""I'm pregnant,"" and I'm freaking out. The next day she supposedly went to the clinic and got an appointment for in a few weeks. I then calm down, until later that day, I found out that Beth's ex (Steve) was logged into her iCloud and somehow was able to text me through it, and all of those texts were from him and not her. That trips me the fuck out, so I'm just confused as fuck for the rest of the day.
      That night, I'm texting Cathy on Beth's Snapchat, because she was giving me info on how my ex was doing (she doesn't handle things the best way), and Cathy starts saying how she wants me. I'm telling her that's wrong, because your Beth's best friend. Then she starts to say all this shit about how Beth deserved to get beat and raped (she got beat my 3 of her exes and raped by 2), and I'm flipping the fuck out, because that's beyond fucked up. 
      It turned out to be STEVE AGAIN. Cathy ended up giving Steve the password, because he threatened to tell Beth that him and Cathy had sex while him and Beth were dating.

My mom sacrificed a lot for me to move to the States and for me to go to good schools. I didn’t really have an outstanding passion except serving in the Armed Forces then doing law enforcement. I figure that I’d give nursing a try. 

2 years of community college later and I’m finally in the nursing program. At some point, I realized that all my stress and worrying over grades were for my parents and not for myself. I wasn’t comfortable with giving so much of myself for their sake. I told them how I felt and what I really wanted to do. My stepdad just mocked my height, my strength, my aspirations of joining the Armed Forces and police force. He said that I’ll fail at life if I quit now and they both constantly told me that I owed them a degree. 

I just broke out and asked “Do you even care about my happiness?” And my mom just deflected and said “Do you know how this will make us, your parents feel?”. To be honest, I’ve just gone with the flow and I have myself to blame. And my stepdad kept saying that I’m selfish for telling them how I felt and saying how emotionless I was. Which was wrong because this is difficult for me. My mom also revived this great tradition of taking my electronics away (even though I’m 20 already). 

Is it right for parents to make me feel like I owe them? My mom took on two jobs for this and she did bring me over to America. A part of me feels indebted but another part of me just wants to break free and be an adult. Their words really rang a lot of alarm bells in my head because it feels like they’re manipulating my dependence on them and my emotional tie to my mom to pressure me to stay.

347,"My boyfriend had a very tough school year. He dealt with a lot of stress- for starters, he was elected as the president of a cultural organization and didn't receive much help in planning/organizing events, yet had a lot of pressure to succeed.

He had way too much on his plate and was done in by the stress. On top of homesickness and never having any money, he also gained weight, got insecure about his body, and got diagnosed by the school doctor as having depression and anxiety. I've never seen him struggle so bad.

This year kicked him in the butt. He was extremely worried about his GPA - if it got too low, his scholarship would be revoked (he's international and needs the scholarship or his tuition will be high). 

He passed all his classes. But he just got an email saying he lost his scholarship.

What can I say to comfort him? What can I do to help? What advice can I give him that's constructive?
Should he tell his parents on his own, or wait for the news to be delivered? He's dreading their response. There are cultural differences to keep in mind too, about how they'll handle what they perceive to be a big failure (him/his parents are Sri Lankan)

I've been in his same position. I got a 1.8 GPA for one semester because I was horriblyyy depressed and wasn't able to get out of bed, let alone excel in class. Got it back up to a 3.15, but I didn't have a scholarship to lose.

354,"Greetings fellow redditors. Hope you're all well.

So I'm an 18 year old Indian guy. I've never had a girlfriend (too busy with academics and sports in high school) and I'm still a virgin (waiting for the right person). When I started university this year, I was introduced to the idea of casual sex, where you have sex with a stranger or just a friend. It's not something I would ever consider doing because I want to share that type of intimacy with a girlfriend/wife. Before any of you say ""You've never had sex, you can't say that!"", please don't try to convince me to have casual sex. I will do no such thing because it goes against who I am and my values (personal, not religious). Nothing wrong with casual sex, it's just not something I will ever do.

One night, I came out of my bedroom high (I've stopped smoking marijuana for good now). I went into the kitchen of our suite for a glass of water. My three roommates and two girls were sitting in the living room of the suite. When they saw me, they started pressuring me to have sex with one of the girls. I politely declined as I wasn't physically or emotionally attracted to the girl and had no interest in her. They all started saying things like ""A beautiful girl wants to have sex with you, you should just do it."", ""Don't be a pussy, just do it"" and ""Do it! It's now or never!"". I kept declining saying I was intoxicated on weed and couldn't consent (Canadian law). They blew it off and kept trying to sway me. The girl was trying to open my bedroom door and kept saying ""Let's do it"". Let me give some background on this girl. Throughout the year, she tried to kiss me, grind on me, and try to hookup with me (during parties), but I declined every single time (she would be very drunk).

Now back to the story. Eventually, they left me alone and I went back to my room. I felt kinda shitty. Like I wasn't good enough a virgin and that I wasn't cool enough to hang around. This all happened last night and I haven't really spoken to any of them since. What should I do? Do you think I did the right thing?",11May2018,0
355,"So background, I'm 20 years old, and I'm a lazy bum. I don't work, and I don't go to school. I pretty much workout, watch basketball, MMA, anime and play video games. I was planning on eventually going back to school, but like I said I'm a lazy bum. 
&amp;nbsp;

So a few months ago my dad got really serious about starting a business, he's got a good full-time job, but wants his own business. He told me he wanted me to get prepared to do the day to day operations of the business. I didn't think he would go through with it, and now we're one month away from actually opening the business. I'm going to be doing basic stuff, like answering the phone, answering people's questions regarding policies, filing paperwork, putting stuff in the computer. 
&amp;nbsp;

I know this is a big opportunity for me, and I want to do right by my dad for giving me this opportunity, but I've literally failed everything in my life. I just feel like this is too much shit for me to handle.

356,"Here's my current backstory, I'm 22, male, graduating college in two years due to health issues delaying my graduation (cancer and pneumonia respectively), never had a job trying my damnedest to get one, and don't have my driver's license but am working getting it soon. Still I feel like a total loser. All my classmates from high school and college have either graduated, gotten their careers starting, or are starting families. When I was out driving with my mother yesterday, she told me I should have started driving earlier ""like a normal person"", as if I could jump into a time machine go back to 2012. I know I should have gotten these things done earlier, but isn't it good enough that I'm getting them done later rather than never. I guess not, according to her. Is everything I'm doing now good enough or am I just destined to be a loser for the rest of my life? ",11May2018,1
357,"So, my best friend who I've known for 8 years has been in a relationship for a few months and I'm happy for her, but it seems that he is everywhere we go. I hit her up after class and she brings him along and only pays attention to him the entire time. I was a little annoyed but never really that put off by it, since I have a second friend who was single and always willing to be there for me when the first friend bailed to hang out with her boyfriend.

And then the single friend got into a relationship.

Since then, no matter who I invite to hang out, I can always expect guys to come along. And when I try to hang out with my friends, they ignore me completely just to make out and hug.

It's almost liket they're rubbing their relationship in my face everywhere they go and making it their goal to make me feel lonely and uncomfortable. I'm upset because they never hang out with me like they used to, they always have to be within 2 feet of their S/O. Not only that, but they make me feel lonely because I don't have that with someone and nobody likes me like that. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that they've found someone who they love, but I would rather they not have to always be right by each other's side. I would at least like to invite one of the girls out and expect only her and not her boyfriend to tag along.

It's just irritating being the third wheel all the time and I don't know what to do",11May2018,2
359,"Hi everyone. I have an iPhone 6 and it has recently gotten hacked by my boyfriend’s ex girlfriend. She has an alienware laptop and was able to ping our location and find out my phone number. She hacked into my phone and unblocked herself to send messages. She has done this to my old phone and was able to take, delete, and see all pictures/messages/music, see my location, text people from my number, and even listen in using the microphone.

I believe I've liked this particular friend for a while now, but growing up in a religious community, I never allowed myself to think about it. I feel like I'm either pan or bi, but I'm not completely sure. 

I'm not going to say anything to my friend, considering I don't want to wreck my friendship and I'm currently in relationship. so I just want to figure out my sexuality. Like, I feel like I prefer guys, but I've liked a girl or two. What does this mean?",11May2018,2
361,"Note: She's not abusive or mean to me, quite the opposite. 

Anyway, last summer, I told my friend some very hardcore stuff about me, that I haven't told anyone other friend in depth and my family at all. I told about my depression but I told her too much. I told the thoughts I had daily, I asked very morning questions about my view of my own life and after one particular day (which I'll get to later), I told her that I attempted suicide and everyday since then, me telling her that was the worst decision of my life. Not because she told anyone (I hope) but because it's something I just wished she didn't know about me.

Mainly in part because I really liked her during that time, and I took my shot at her (though poorly) very early into our rekindled friendship, and she's not the reason I feel this way. It goes back to college but that's another story. Anyway, one day, I asked about the rejection and she told me why, and she gave me her reason, which was something she didn't have to do. The thing that eats at me is that I told her about my suicide attempt in the very next conversation we had three days later, and from every angle I look at it, it looks I was trying to minute her into liking me, which was never my intention. I didn't tell her why because it involved my family situation as well and I didn't want her to get into that but I felt the need to talk to someone because I was afraid of hurting myself and I had no one else to confide to besides her. 

It's been nine months since that happened and the last time I mentioned my depression at all to anyone. I went to therapy and I'm feeling better. I apologized to her about my depressive episodes in November, and I kept talking to her since then. She doesn't laugh anymore with me but she still reciprocates conversation with me where I know that she likes talking to me. 

Last month, I asked if we should hang out and binge watch a series, and she said that it sounds good. The last conversation I had with her was a week ago, and she was just saying that she was out of school finally and that she would be home Monday. Something in me thinks that was her way of saying 'We should hang out' during in that text because she usually never tells me what day she gets home. 

I have another friend group (that she mutually are friends with) and they were planning to hang out on Wednesday. She's not in the friend group chat because she doesn't like Facebook all that much. Thing is, her brother is in the chat and he may or may not come. (NOTE: My friend in question and her brother do not live in the same house, but the brother knows that me and his sister are closer than with the rest of the group). 

So the dillemma is that I can invite her to hang out with us but she's the only person who knows about my past depression. My friend group does not even know I was depressed at all. Her brother doesn't seem to know either. I just fear that she'll look at me differently.

But another dillemma is that I'm scared to hang out with her though I want to. It's weird I know. It's just thatI'm an introvert like her and I'm not used to having people over my house. I'm paranoid because my parents are going to get the wrong idea since this will not only be the first time a girl will be over my house, but the first time I have a friend over my house in ten years. I don't really know how to hang out in 1v1 settings like that anymore. ",11May2018,1
362,"I got a few cavities filled by a dentist (it’s a couple, and they run the small business). I have a suspicion she’s not so great, because she said I had many cavities when I think my oral hygiene is above average and I’ve never had a history of multiple cavities (max 2 at once, total maybe 6 in my life) in one sitting. She was saying I had 11. 

Anyway, I got most of them filled because I believed she may just have caught cavities precious dentists ignored and it’s best to nip it in the bud and continue improving on oral hygiene. After the first, the teeth started to hurt. Very sensitive to pressure, and especially to cold. Not as much to warmth. Cold water is fucking unbearable. Crunching accidentally on a hard popcorn kernel sends pain radiating through my mouth. It hurts to floss and feels sensitive. It’s now a problem on 3/4 of my mouth (top and bottom right, bottom left). It feels like she took too much tooth away and nerve is exposed. And I’m terrified of it! What can be done for this? She said it was normal and may take a couple weeks. It’s been four months since the first filling....

Two months ago my roommate who worked full time got fired. It wasn't too bad because between myself and my other roommate we could still pay the bills. Well, last month I got fired. The only person who is working is the one roommate who makes and works the least. 

I honestly don't know what we're going to do next month. I did apply for unemployment, but I wasn't approved. I've applied to many places. I have trouble with calls and interviews because of anxiety. I'm not saying this as an excuse, but it has made it harder. 

I can't ""move back home"" because neither of my parent have a ""home"". My mom lives with my sister. My dad lives with his girlfriend. Neither of my roommates have anywhere to go back to. I don't have any friends outside of my roommates. 

I have undiagnosed mental illness. No doctor has given me any real answer, but I have mood swings. This is not extremely relevant, however my previous workplace knew this. I fear that this will hinder me from keeping a job. Each job that I've lost/ quit it's been because of my moods. 

I've tried to sell my art, but tbh, it's not good enough. More than anything I'd like someone to talk to, but also really need some advice. I know a lot of people go through this sort of thing, but it's a first for me.

My mental health is shaky at best. I have severe anxiety and paranoia. He has done everything he knows how to do all with the goal of helping me get through it but nothing has helped.

I’m so scared that he’ll leave me despite all of his actions proving the opposite, that I sabotage our relationship. That way if it does end, it’ll be on my terms and I somehow feel justified. I somehow don’t care that we’re both miserable and I’m hurting the person I love most. It’s fucked up and instead of using the hurt to motivate me to better habits, I just wallow in it as if I deserve to be miserable. Like if I have to be miserable so does everyone else. Except no one but me thinks I deserve to feel that way.

I’ve done a little research on trust and self-confidence and found the concept of a thought review. It’s a therapeutic process in which people with negative thoughts identify the thoughts and reframe them. I like the idea and I think it will be a helpful habit to get into but I want more. 

My husband’s patience is understandably almost run out. We’re not speaking. He took off his wedding ring. Hell, I wouldn’t want to be married to me either after the way I treat him.

370,"I (27)  have been friends with this girl (26) online for 5 years, best friends for 2. We have been talking daily and playing and just being close 12 + hrs a day every day basically. Well, it was no secret that I had feelings for her. And she knew that, but she only ever saw me as a best friend. And part of me knew it would never go beyond that but my feelings always held onto a hope.

Anyway, off and on for the last 2 years. My jealousy/anxiety/other excuses got the better of me at times, I would accuse her of ditching me, I would guilt trip, say one thing do another, and I seemingly never listened to her feelings, or listened to her at all. Every time I would fuck up, I would ask for forgiveness/another chance/etc.

Well, I've done this a million times, my word means nothing now, I am completely out of chances, I have shown no signs of changing, and she said she can't take anymore.

She just got a boyfriend right as things happened, too.

When shit hit the fan, I freaked out over seemingly nothing because I mistook her word about not talking outside of a game so we could focus on it. She didnt respond to me at all outside the game and I freaked out.

Well, the following morning she woke up and saw all the stuff I left her when I freaked out and she said she needs time alone. And I was begging for chances and she just couldnt deal with me.

The next few days my depression and whatnot got the better of me and I just wouldnt give her the space she wanted. And I was so depressed one night I was close to considering suicide because I thought I was losing her. And I didnt even stop to think that her brother had killed himself, and that REALLY upset her. To the point where she said that alone makes her never want to speak again.

Well the next few days, I message her boyfriend to try smoothing shit over with him because we werent exactly friendly I guess or w/e. And I just ended up making shit worse, especially with her.

He would tell me ""I know where she stands and thats not for you to know"". And eventually he said ""she doesnt want to deal with you, get over it and move on"".

Well I said I am not believing jack shit coming from him, so he made a chat thing on discord with all 3 of us, and she said she can't do it anymore, shes done. Well I went into meltdown mode begging for chances, he kept saying things so I told him to shut the fuck up and called him a racial slur, and none of this helped me at all. She was even more upset because I had said something to him that she told me in confidence, because I figured he ""knew everything"" because he seemingly did at that point. She was upset that she didnt get one small thing from me, and I was disrespecting him/her/their relationship. I kept begging and pleading for another chance to show that I would change and she kept citing ""The boy who cried wolf""

I had bought her an account for a game right before shit happened but i didnt get to give it to her until shit did. Well, she posted something in our personal discord, which I thought was to get my attention (a stat bot for the game, when she usually looks up the stats directly on the site).

Well, I commented on shit, she responded, there was minor back and forth about it, but apparently she said I was still bothering her just from that.

Well during the chat with both of them, things got heated and he said ""if you want me to be an asshole, fine its me or him, and you know shes going to choose me"". After I left/whatever I messaged her asking if it was done, if we're never speaking again. She said ""I don't know if I can"" Well the next morning, she told me to get into voice chat to explain something.

She said she was done, I was a dick for being racist, and all the shit I have done to her. She asked if I wanted the account back because ""shes leaving"". I told her to give me one final chance to still be in her life. She said ""if you change and get a gf, good, but I won't be here.""

I kept pleading and pleading and she had said ""MAYBE I'll think about it in the future, but we're not speaking anytime soon. (Or something like that). This after her saying shits ""too late"" and ""you should've thought about that a long time ago"".

She deleted me from steam, psn, another game client, and she unfriended me from discord. She said NOT to message her on discord and to only text her via phone if I really needed to because her bf could see the convos and shit. She said not to delete the discord until she got all of her pics/whatever from them. But there are no pics anymore, and she hasnt left it yet.

I messaged her like an idiot wednesday night asking if they could ever forgive me for the child I acted like that night. She said ""I don't think that he'll be willing to forgive you since he doesn't want you in either of our lives.""

I asked what I can do and she said ""Nothing, just let it go"". Then I asked her if we were ever going to speak again and she said ""I can't answer that since I really don't know at this point."" Then I said I hope when I do some growing up that she'd let me back into her life. She said ""I'll have to think about it."" Which usually always means no to.

I said shits so bad right now theres no good case for her to consider it. And she said ""Sadly, it is bad. It's affecting me"". Then I said we were really good friends for 2 years, and I let my feelings/lack of restraint/filter cause me to do a lot of shit to hurt you.

Last thing she said to me was ""At least you realize what you've done."".

I responded with stuff after that but she didnt respond. I deleted one thing and texted it to her because I didnt want her bf to find out that she asked me to text her instead of discord.

I went to edit a post today and accidentally sent another message. I'm not trying to bombard her, I need to leave her be and give her space.

Given shit is very very very bad right now, how can I go about fixing this friendship at all? I can't change the past obviously.

She hasn't blocked me on discord yet, she hasnt left our voice server. She didnt block me on any of the shit she deleted me from. So if she ""never wanted to speak to me again"" why hasnt she fully cut me off with blocks and whatnot, and why still be in our voice server?

I'm obviously not going to message her for a long time, but what can I do to get my best friend back? I've ruined shit completely by never changing. And now that her bf hates me completely now and doesnt want me in their life. Shits that much more difficult.",11May2018,1

Alright, so this all started back in about 2012, I met a friend online and started talking, a few weeks later he introduces me to one of his friends, I end up talking to her far more than the first one. A few months down the line, we start getting quite a bit closer and make the decision to start a relationship. A few weeks later she tells me about how her ex sexually abused and raped her on atleast two notable instances. At the time I tried my best to support her and put all the focus on her.

Skip forward a few years and that thought is now on my mind daily, it's gotten to the point where i've pushed every single friend I had, her included, away, over about six years. It has gotten to the point where the main focus of every second of my life now is hurting *him* . 

It has gotten to the point where my thoughts on a daily basis are of nothing but torturing and killing him, to the point where it has become almost impossible to focus on even the most basic of things without it intruding. I have gone to a hospital and been appointed a psychiatrist and therapist, both of which have done nothing and basically discharged me at this point.

At this point, on a near daily basis, my time consists of either thoughs of suicide, holding a knife to my heart/throat and cutting up/stabbing things while putting *him* in their place, he lives in an entirely different country now, but I have no doubt that if he lived within reach of myself he would be long dead. I'm sick of thinking this way and even more sick of pushing everyone I care about away. I don't want any of this but I can't stop myself, i've tried to get help and been turned away at almost every avenue and I really don't know where to go from here.

Any little bit of advice you can give would be incredibly appreciated, thank you for reading.

Is this normal?

379,"I noticed yesterday evening that they haven't been home and the dogs were still outside. I fed and watered them by pouring food over the top of the pen and tried to aim water in the empty bucket because the dogs were barking like crazy at me. Today, the neighbors are still not at home so I went to the store and bought a big bag of cheap dog food and poured it in the cage and then said the hell with it and went in the pen and got their water bucket and filled it back up, they seemed to understand what was up because they thankfully didn't eat me.

I'm at a point where I am afraid I'm going to get in trouble for going on their property and doing this and I'm hesitant to call the police about it because that's just going to cause drama.

Should I give it a few more days and then call someone? I don't know these peoples names or numbers, they have only been living there a few months, while I have lived where I am for 20 years and I try to stay the hell out of everyone's business.

But I don't like this at all. Poor puppers.",11May2018,2
380,"This is a stream of consciousness and may make little sense but I've been thinking a lot about these things for a long time and haven't been able to really articulate it into a core philosophy \- I still am struggling to put it down clearly.

I want to read and discuss more views on these topics and enhance my thinking. It's easy to say that the current system is broken without offering an alternative and this is why I want to try to find like\-minded individuals to challenge my thoughts on these issues.

Where can I find online communities of people who think like me? In a nutshell:

* society is bankrupted, people by and large are chasing this life where they spend more time working than anything else, struggling to pay off a mortgage and raise kids.
* the whole political system is essentially theatre for the great unwashed \- as we've seen time and again these guys don't give a stuff about the substantive issues, it's about pursuing personal goals and power, and looking after your mates. the public discourse and media is carefully contrived and more easily manipulated than ever.
* mostly we're taught to be a cog in the machine and the ideal life is seen as working a corporate job 40\-60 hours a week and maybe snatching an hour or two to yourself on the weekend.
* people cramming in like sardines into the major cities and following like sheep after the latest mind numbing fad, choosing to spend their precious downtime watching dross TV like master chef or the bachelor. 
* even the relative few that have milked the system \- been lucky enough to get a top education and well paid job \- and come out on top are still working their asses off harder than ever until they are old and gray
* capitalism has failed \- wealth increasingly amassing into the hands of the few and most punters are battling just to live day to day and provide for their families. people who earn the most money are not contributing the most value, in fact it is often the opposite. The parasites who create no value like lawyers, consultants and financiers are making out like bandits. The way society values and remunerates people for their contribution is fundamentally broken.
* social discourse is completely fake \- we walk around having these dull water cooler convos and business and social chit chat that fits neatly within the lines. people don't say what they really think for fear of being ostracised. 
* people are not inherently good and are driven by self interest \- the only time you can trust people is if your incentives are aligned and even then it's tenuous
* we've got more advanced technology than previous generations could have even dreamed of yet we are all working harder, faster and more stressed than ever
* the things people are chasing for by amassing large amounts of money are hollow and the price/value is artificial rather than based on the cost to produce, things like diamonds and luxury handbags and sports cars.
* rich or poor most people share one thing in common \- beavering away up to 60 hours a week at jobs where if they weren't being paid they wouldn't be there at all and longing for a couple weeks annual leave a year if they're lucky.
* religion \- the belief that you don't control your own destiny is one of the main tools used to keep the large majority being scewed by the system from actually taking action \(even if they can take time out from paying off their mortgage and putting food on the table to even think about the fact they're being screwed\). it's god's will right? religiion allows you to ignore that you're being screwed by systems put in place by men no different from you.
* people are parasites consuming at the expense of other living things on this planet and even when we're warned by scientists that human life as we know it could be wiped out we refuse to do what's needed to be done to safeguard life on earth because it might hurt our hip pocket by a few bucks a week today or be a slight inconvenience. 
* for all we know we are a freak accident, a pale blue dot of amazingly diverse life in a universe of unknowable scale. it should be celebrated that we're even here. In 125 years there will be a completely new set of people on this planet \- we may die out but the planet will renew and refresh as it has always done.
* when we die that's it, we're gone forever, so why are people so content to waste their lives working, rearing children and watching reality TV?
* why are we so accepting of a social system that benefits the few and leaves most of us leading dull repetitive routine lives?
* we will all be dead soon so why spend even a minute doing something you don't enjoy or living a life that you're not 100&amp;#37; happy with? why hold yourself back from taking, doing and saying what you want?",11May2018,1

382,"I am currently 18 years old and have just completed my first year as a mechanical engineering student. I am currently on summer break which lasts 4 months (2 weeks in so far). This is the time of the year my parents absolutely dread. I do absolutely nothing but play video games all day at home. This has been the case since when I was around 14 or 15 when I stopped going to summer camp (too old for many camps at this point and the few that I could go into were all sport related and I am not particularly athletic). I am naturally introverted. I don't really like talking that much and even close friends I can't bare being around all day every day for weeks on end. I wasn't bullied or anything in high school and I handled social situations ""normally"" nor did the ""cool"" kids ever look down on me with contempt but I barely interacted with most people. The few people I did interact with semi-frequently were people I could talk about video games with. Even these friendships didn't last outside of school and I never went out to do normal activities with them. Furthermore, this addiction (if it is one) to video games made me develop an extremely lazy attitude towards all my school work. Fortunately, I am innately very intelligent (I apologize if I come off as narcissistic) and I breezed through high school without needing to do any form of school work outside of the classroom. This innate intelligence, however, is a double edged sword. This has been the enabler for my laziness throughout my life. I mean I made it into engineering school for God's sake! Some people bust their asses of trying to make it here and I literally did nothing but play games and never did homework and studied an hour prior to major tests. 
I thought that perhaps university would be where I finally would be forced to adapt to a more proactive and diligent lifestyle but after first year, NOTHING has changed. I still played video games throughout the entire school year and I studied a maximum of 4 hours the day of for my finals. Actually, I lied. I started off the year going to 95% of my lectures but I ended up going to LITERALLY 0% of the lectures by the end. At least in high school I was forced to go to class for the sake of attendance AND I couldn't have my phone out. I ended up having to buy crash courses in the second semester because I didn't know 95% of the content the day of the midterms and I didn't even finish these! With all this said and done, I managed to pass with a 3.5 gpa. I sometimes feel absolutely despicable but this self-contempt is never enough for me to ever actually change my lifestyle. I've tried applying to a few jobs around the neighbourhood (McDonalds, namely) but they never accept me due to my lack of experience but most importantly because I apply WAY too late. The reason I've went out of my way to ask for advice is because of the family discussion I had last night. My mom cried when I told her that my life was boring and that I was stimulated by nothing besides video games. I know I shouldn't have said that but I was also emotional leading up to that comment and I just feel like shit now. I want to change my life around for her sake but I don't know where to start. I always end up relapsing into video games.",11May2018,1
383,"hello all,
so I’ve recently been facing some problems with someone I used to call a friend [21m]. Me and Mat (fake names) were tight, for like almost 4 years. He’s an international student, so when he arrived he literally knew no one and was introduced to me through a mutual friend. We realised we had a lot in common and became real close, but more on a bro/sis kind of level. Nothing more. However, we fell out, and all because he decided to jump to conclusions. 

Last summer, I got caught up I so much work at University, and I had to get a lot done, which meant my social life was no more until I had submitted everything. But he automatically assumed that I didn’t want to be friends or see him anymore. This isn’t the case at all. I stayed in touch as much as I could, and I would see him in passing and ask about him, general chat etc, before I would run off to the library or go to work. Yet he still had the idea I wasn’t interested. So many times I tried to explain this to him, however I was getting random messages and calls from my other friends telling me that Mat had been going around saying that I don’t want to see him or talk to him. Not only this, but two other mutual friends told me that he had been slagging me off behind my back and insulting me. I let this go. Not because I don’t deal well with confrontation, but I just don’t think it’s worth it. 

After the summer, he came back from visiting his country, and I had a chat with him about this. When I confronted him, his response was “What? No way! I would never say things like that. You’re like my sister! You’re the only one I truly have by my side here” and foolishly, I assumed that maybe our other friends misunderstood him because his English isn’t bad, but it’s not perfect (we speak the same language which is why I can communicate easier with him). 
So I thought all was kushty and good. But nope. To my dismay, more people started coming over to me telling me that he’s been further insulting me behind my back. 2 or 3 times again after that, I still let it go until one day, I found out he went to someone very dear to me, spreading malicious rumours about me which have now affected my friendships with people, as well as those who I work with too. 

Now I know this might sound like it’s nothing. The problem is, it’s really affecting me. The city we’re in is so small that everyone knows everyone. This could easily reach my family. I lost so many friends that were dear to me because of what he’s been saying and who have now sided with him. Certain people I work with, I don’t get along with anymore because of what they’ve heard, and they treat me so differently. I lost everyone to the point that I became depressed. I couldn’t leave my house, or even go to university with the fear that someone I know would see me. I’d even call in sick at work just to avoid being seen because I was so worried. Now I’m just purely depressed, stuck on meds. I don’t even enjoy the things I used to. 

I’m just trying to get on with life. I’m a simple person, I don’t ask for anything. I just work and study to get my degree this summer. It was a miracle that I was even able to submit my final paper... it took so much

I feel so alone. All the friends I used to talk to don’t want anything to do with me. What was said today was just the last straw. I heard it too, when they all thought I was not near. I guess I’m just sensitive. I never was like this. I could always handle this kind of stuff. But when it’s everyone you know, that’s been turned against you... what can you do? I feel like crawling into a ball and just hiding under my covers forever. I’m sorry to be going in to this so much.. but I just need advice from honest people. I’m 22 and I feel like I’m in school again, being bullied. Can anyone help? 

Tl;dr? - I [22f] feel like I’m being consistently bullied by someone I used to call a friend. He [21m] spreads these horrible rumours about me to everyone who knows us and it doesn’t help that the city we live in is small. It’s now affected my personal and professional life, as well as my health getting me depressed and on meds, from losing everyone I was friends with before. Any advice?

384,"So I (M 19) have been with this girl (F 19) since high school. we lasted 3 years together before I decided to end it off. she is a great girl but we used to argue and frankly i got bored of the relationship. I didn't put much effort towards the end, no matter how hard I tried. I felt hopeless. I also did it for selfish reasons. Im in college and i wanted to experience the college life; dating and fucking different women. I also just wanted to be free... I didn't really have a future plans with her but i felt great just having her there, she was really supportive. Now i have made more friends and decided to explore more; to find myself. I feel like i have found myself and now i understand why we used to argue. I still dont want to think about commitment, like marriage and all that. But i want to be with her. I just don't want to get back with her and then realize i dont want her and break her heart again. Maybe im just going through a phase.. who knows. But im confused wether i should date her again or not. 

P.s im a freshman in college. She also goes to college, we live near each other. ",11May2018,1
