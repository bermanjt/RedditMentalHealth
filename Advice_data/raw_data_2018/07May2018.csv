0," I had a crush on my best friend in high school since the 1st time I saw him. He ended up losing his virginity to me after our sophomore year. When the next school year began we had a fling, we never officially said we were together and would hide doing ""couple"" things in public. Halfway through that year we stopped talking because he surrounded himself with bad influences and it got him into trouble. On our senior year he wanted to reestablish our friendship but I just gave him the extremely bare minimum. We stopped talking until around new years of this year \(3 years after graduation\). Yesterday, he talked to me and told me he loved me and had a crush on me since he first saw me and even described how we ended up sitting together that first day. He remembers a lot of these memories crystal clear but he said he never wanted to tell me because he didn't want to lose me as a friend but it happened anyway. He told me about one of the dreams that really stuck with him which went along the lines of: he one day confessed his love for me and we ended up dating for years, getting married, and living a happy life. He described our first kiss and how magical it was to him and he would never forget it. I feel like I still have these unresolved feelings for him but we are both in relationships. I havent felt the same for my boyfriend and sometimes feel like he doesn't have any ambitions. I felt this way before the whole confession thing happened. Im not sure what to do. Any suggestions?

2,"Hi everyone,

I've been thinking for a while now about starting a youtube channel but I am not sure exactly what to make it about. I'm pretty funny \(I know this sounds cocky but almost everyone I know well considers me funny so I am trying to embrace it\) and I love gaming so I was thinking about maybe a gaming series called ""A High Guy Reviews..."" which would be like a parody review show where I would get a bunch of stuff wrong/shitpost and mixing it with a lot of adult/college age humor. As far as I can tell nothing with a similar premise to that exists on youtube right now. I also considered making an advice channel, where I would start off by replying to posts on this subreddit, but eventually if I got a decent following I would reply to my viewer's comments. I'm not exactly sure but I haven't seen that many life advice channels, but I think I would be able to make entertaining videos with that idea. Do you think either of these ideas are good? Do you think I should even bother making a youtube channel? Let me know \(please be nice this is my first time on reddit\).",07May2018,0

4,"So this guy’s locker is right next to mine and I have had a crush on him pretty much all year. The tough part is that I am always too nervous to start up a conversation with him because I am always at a loss of what to say. I don’t really know him very well, either, which doesn’t help. We do have some common friends (one of his friends is in a relationship with a friend of mine). 

Just this past Friday everyone in the AP physics course at my school got to go on a six flags field trip. We got to pick groups of 4 to be in to work on the final together and while we were there, my group (2 other girls and a guy) decided to pair up with the group my crush was in so we could work together. We all hung out the rest of the trip and had a ton of fun together. At this point, I have grown to really like my crush and I would like to try to have some kind of relationship with him. The only problem is that he is really shy. He doesn’t use much social media and barely texts either. One of his friends hooked me up with his number so I could tell him thanks for hanging out during the trip, which I did, but I don’t know where to go from here. 

I should mention that the girls in my six flags group and 2 of his friends know that I am interested.

I want to find a way to show him I am interested without making him feel awkward or anything. Any ideas for how I can score a date with him? Group settings would probably be ideal, but I’m afraid I don’t know him well enough for him to feel comfortable with that. Please help me! I feel such a weird connection with him and I want so badly to act on it!",07May2018,21

7,"Okay, wife wants friend to be our threesome partner and said she could be both of our fuckbuddy(as long as I don't bang her behind my wife's back, i.e. lie about it). She told her friend she was alright with it. But only because at the time she thought I was not happy with her. On top of that come to find out the friend(who was a lesbian last I heard) ended up banging her married boss while they were out of country multiple times and is now carrying his kid. Now I don't feel like having sex with her even though she is in town and really wants me to bang her and is offering any and all holes. Is it wrong that I'm not as raring to go and hop in the sack with her?",07May2018,1
8,"I am currently a junior in a very small, private catholic junior/senior high school. Due to the small size, there are not any AP classes offered, there are barely any interesting elective classes, and any honors classes offered are not treated as honors classes - they have the same level of difficulty and academic rigor as the non honors equivalent classes that our school offers. In addition, the quality of education just really isn’t that great compared to the local public high schools. 
I have also run into some social issues at my current school with some classmates, and as my junior class has less than 40 people, it’s kind of hard to just ignore it and make new friends. I only have one or two friends at my school and I feel pretty lonely and sad when I am there.
I am also very into Academic Decathlon, but because our school is so small, our team basically has no chance of doing well because we don’t even have enough kids interested in doing it. I can try as hard as I can on the team, but it’s pretty disheartening knowing that we will never win our state competition because 1. we don’t have a full team and 2. the kids on our team don’t care about it to study enough to do well. 
All of these problems could be resolved if I transferred to the local public high school. I could take AP classes, do choir classes (my current school doesn’t have any, and singing is a hobby of mine), be with my friends (who mostly go to that school), and be a part of an Academic Decathlon team that actually is successful in competitions.
However, my parents are reluctant to let me transfer. They say that it will hurt my chances of getting into college (my dream school is University of California, Berkeley. I would be going for either physics, astronomy, or aerospace engineering.) My parents are most concerned about my class rank, however. I am currently Salutatorian in my junior class, but since it is out of less than 40 people, I don’t know how impressive that would be to colleges. If I transferred, I’d most likely still be very close to the top of my class (in the top 10%, at the very least, and it would be out of way more students than at my current school). I know being second in my class is worth more to colleges than being simply in the top 10%, but I have a lot more going for me than simply class rank. 
I know that my dream school is very competitive and only has about a 17% acceptance rate. However, I have done very well in school up until this point (all of my high school grades have been in the 96-100 range), my ACT score is a 34, and I am very involved with and hold a leadership position in a local community service organization that is outside of school. I also think that taking AP classes such as ap calculus and ap physics if I transferred would help, rather than hurt my chances of getting into college, especially since I am planning to go to college for STEM. In addition, I would most likely be all around happier at the new school, since I would be around my friends and be able to take more academically challenging classes.
In your guys’ honest opinion, will transferring schools for my senior year hurt my chance of getting accepted into college, especially University of California Berkeley? If you think it will, why? And if you think that it will not, how can I convince my parents to allow me to transfer schools?",07May2018,1
10,"Currently I'm a student and I'm turning 23. I'm completing a games development major and I really dislike attending university to get my bachelors. I'm practically doing this for my mum but I want to work on my own projects instead. University is draining me and the past year, I've already failed a few units. I'm also getting burnt out and losing motivation fast from all the assignments and exams I have to complete. I'm not entirely sure what to do and I've contemplated dropping out many times. At first, I really enjoyed games development and I still enjoy it to a certain extent but university has made it feel like a chore and it's not fun anymore.

13,"This will be my first public post on anything ever so forgive me if my language is strange. I just have an odd way of speaking/typing.
I'll be calling this friend Dan. Not his real name but close enough for me to remember.
This story is pretty long. It doesn't even have all of the weird things he has done up till now.
Backstory:
So it all starts when I get introduced to him by another friend. Immediately I don't really want to interact with the guy. He's loud, annoying (On purpose.) and can't seem to go five minutes without interrupting any conversation that doesn't involve him. (He later on admitted to me that he can't stand being alone. Says he feels like he's dying.).
Keeps making irritating comments about my art and characters trying to get a reaction and taking up my art supplies and running off with them. Keep in mind that we are both college students and he's older than me.
Also randomly screamed like a dying moose to get attention whilst I was trying to comfort a mutual friend very clearly having a panic attack.
On to the weird things:
After some time knowing him and barely talking to him he somehow gets my number. Adds me on Whatsapp. I brush it off thinking maybe a mutual friend gave it to him. 
He proceeds to spam me every time I'm online.
Whines when I start to ignore him.
I usually sit alone somewhere to draw until my classes start. Dunno how he found me but ever since he's always sitting there waiting for me to show up. 
Every show or character I like is suddenly his favorite thing ever.
He wrote a story and put me in it. I brush it off.
I add him on Discord and suddenly every game I play he plays. I had to rename or remove everything for it to stop.
Every time I'm online I get a message from him. I have recently come to note that he seems to check my accounts pretty often, since he's often the first to message me about it.
He starts adding me to every group chat he's in despite my numerous requests for him to stop.
He used to bug me to let him meet my friends (The ones he doesn't know). I think he forgot about them after a while.
I make all my characters in a game we both play pastel. He saw it and proceeded to rant about how he hates pastels. All of a sudden pastels start popping up on his characters. His current goal seems to be to get all of the characters I currently have. He has also spammed me with porn of my favorite character in the past.
He and this other guy make a porn channel on a server we're both in and he constantly tries to lure me into looking in it. I have told him several times I don't want to see it.
I joke debate people. Now he joke debates everyone he can, but only when I'm around. Whenever I joke debate him he gives up. I'm always right according to him.
He recently started skipping classes to talk to me. He doesn't seem to be talking to anyone else much.
He recently sent me a friend request on an account that I have no idea how he found. None of my personal info is anywhere on the profile. Nor do any of our mutual friends know my username on it.
I don't really know what to do...
Please tell me if you think I'm just overreacting.
It all just seems pretty creepy to me.
It's exam time now so I have a break from interacting with him (I picked up the habit of leaving myself on ' Invisible/Offline' on everything that allows for it) but I know I'm going to see him when classes resume.",07May2018,1

17,"I feel like doing nothing and it's been like this for a long time, as soon as I hit puberty and had a hard time mentally when I was 15.

I'm always lazy, I started gaining some weight because of that, I don't do a lot, I'd rather stay home and binge a show than go out with my friends. I have no motivation to do anything even if I have to do it. I don't really have passion for anything, either.

I think it's even worse recently. My GPA is terrible and I just finished my freshman year with a lot of regrets about it, but I can't really get myself to fix my lifestyle again and stuff to possibly make things better in summer and following undergrad years.

Also, my sex drive just died off. I used to go around hooking up with guys from Tinder, sexting and stuff but now I don't even get turned on from porn.

18,"I'm not too sure if this is the correct place to be posting this, but it is a big issue in my life right now and I feel as though my friends can't really give me guidance in this situation due to the caliber of it.

So here is some context (I'm going to try write this in the best way so I cannot be connected back to me personally, and give the best perspective.) 
Over 5 years ago my dad passed away when I was of reasonably young age, was very unfortunate and me being so young I did not know how to cope with it. Having no other family my sister and I had to move in with our mum and her partner, eventually moving interstate.
 
About a year later my dads will was finally processed and money was released to us blah blah blah, lots of legal hoops that needed to be jumped through due to complications with his will, all in all a decent sized amount of money was left for my sister and I to be able to set up our lives and live with out, lets say no worry if something drastic was ever to happen. Being a teenager this exciting. But there was a darker side, that me and my sister would not realism until now, and that is how greedy and jealous some people are. Not bragging about having this money left to me, but when you have money, people ask you for money. This is where the problems started. 

A couple months after the will was finalized, my mum and her partner sat me and my sister down to ask if they could 'borrow' money from our trust fund to pay off there debts and black marks against their name, in turn they will pay us back and we can live happily without having to stress about money, saying ""We will be able to go do more fun things, like go out for dinner!"" 
Being a teenager of course I wanted to help my mum, who wants to see them struggle? They said they were going to pay us back, it's my mum of course she will.

Fast forward a couple more years, more money has been taken out of these accounts for stupid things that were never really discussed but it was more a ""We will pay it back eventually"", to pay for things like courses, rent, bond, financing a car, paying off a mortgage, and more that I can't think of/that we haven't even been told about. All in all that adds up to POSSIBLY around $75k

As of now, the trust accounts have been signed into my sister and myself names to have full control. But about two years ago, my mums partner left her, leaving us with no signed contract saying she borrowed this money and with my mums partner saying she is not going to pay the sum of money she 'borrowed' back, we decided to look into legal action with my mum against her ex-partner. Going to a couple of lawyer consultations, racking up the bills in lawyer fees, we decided it wouldn't be worth chasing her for the money we just want to move on. My mum did not like this decisions. 

About a year after the visiting lawyers I decided it is time to sit down and talk to mum about what she wants to do with the money she owes us, how much it is, how she wants to pay it back, blah. To get a reply from her saying 
""Why should I have to pay the money back I borrowed if my ex-partner doesn't have to?""
""I raised you I think I am entitled to have some compensation for looking after you.""
""If I didn't look after your trust fund then it wouldn't be here still""

From there it was a big fight, my mother and I have not talked since, and I'm not sure how to proceed with this to get a resolution, I really love my mum but this is the last person I would think to do me and my sibling dirty like this. Please help.",07May2018,1
19,"I’ve always been terrible at.. well, keeping myself in a routine. Depression and anxiety are things I am currently battling untreated (had a really bad problem with my older therapist in a small town setting and lost my job previously so couldn’t afford medication anymore, will be seeking help in my new city when I finally get paid again) and have had both diagnosed since I was a small child. 

After four months of unemployment I started at a new job last week, got myself in the door for every shift and really applied myself! However I’m starting to feel that creeping feeling of ‘this isn’t for me’ come back when it surely is. It isn’t a dream job, but it’s routine shift work, I can do the job and I like it a lot more than what I was doing before. It’s enjoyable. I’m always busy. 

Recognising the behaviour early this morning, I managed to get myself out of bed, cleaned the house, had a shower and I’m not calling in sick- because that is what the old me would do. So I feel proud for making that progress. I’m very tired though.

I’m just looking for any advice somebody may have there who understands, how can I motivate myself to keep going when I don’t feel like doing it? Because I really need to and I want to prove to myself that I CAN live a normal work life, even when I feel exhausted.

Its a small local business and I have moved up into the equivalent of management in less than two years in a company of about 60 people. But I've been making a lot of mistakes lately. Usually very minor, small details that I tend to lose as I focus too much on the larger issues of the job (I left the AC on overnight, etc). Occasionally they're larger issues, like today I was left in charge of some prep work by myself for the first time and royally screwed it up and I know I'm gonna hear about it tomorrow. My boss, who is the nicest man I've ever met, is always super nice about it but I can't stop beating the shit out of myself for it.

21,"Ok so a few months ago or 2ish? 1? I got a personal trainer because I wanted to reach my fitness goals you know? And it was particularly hard for me since I don’t know anyone who would teach me how to do weightlifting etc so I don’t injure myself so I got a personal trainer at In-Shape. Okay so first session was with jake . He’s a p cool guy but he doesn’t specialize in what I’m goal is In which is gain muscle so he handed me off to another PT who’s name is Cody shit.. I should prob change the names..  ok changed em. Okay so the first few sessions were 👌🏻 but they were awkward since I’m so fking weak and I was also working on another goal. I have had really bad social anxiety so my goal was to be able to do this alone which at the time I couldn’t soo.. okay so here comes he 5th session I think? And dude is late. Next session he’s late and third session he’s a hour late makes me wait because he “can’t drive fast in these tires” okay after that it all just kinda went downhill not that it wasn’t before.. after that time he was on time for like 2 sessions after but then dude texted me with “do you mind if we cancel tomorrow’s session? I’m really sorry I’m sick” and I was like ok no problem get better and texted back 2 min bc I had remembered I didn’t have time bc o had class and he didn’t answer until I texted him again the next day. Ok at that point I was like okay he’s sick no problem . But then after that he canceled again and I have to be constantly on his ass for him to even get his ass to the gym -.- then on Friday he cancelled on me again but this time didn’t even bother giving me shit excuses. And every time we have a session in shape sends me a confirmation email 2 says prior. My next session was supposed to be Monday but Saturday I didn’t get the email. Dude probably is canceling on me again. 

I am so fed up with this bullshit. Last month I was so ducking worried because I wasn’t going to be able to make payments on my personal training and I barely got through and for this guy to now be doing this fucking bullshit? Naw! 

What should I do? I see 2 options here (but I’m open for suggestions) 
1. Call him on his bullshit 
1.2 he gets his shit together and all fine 
1.3 he doesn’t get his shit together and I tell jake(who is also the fitness manager) to switch me
2. Wait it out and see if the guy gets his shit together

33,"I don’t really know where to start so I’ll start from the beginning. Sorry if I tend to ramble but I’d like to say that I really appreciate any help as this has been on my back for a while and need an outer voice to help me out. I will attempt to keep it short.

I first met her when she needed signatures for a class project and she approached my friend and I along with her other friend that also needed a signature. We make little conversation and I write my name for the two of them. 

Maybe a week or so passes and I’ve grown interest in her and before  she me  walks out of one of the school doors and says Hello to me and says my name(I am not very keen with names unless someone has a great interest in someone so I applied that to her maybe having interest in me), I tell her hello as well and we part ways. A couple of days later and I’m thinking about how she may be the one. I may seem a little quick to conclusion but I’ve found that I’m like that when it comes to someone having an interest in me (is anyone else like this?). Next day or so I have my earphones in and just pretend that I haven’t acknowledged her yet and we make our way to the door. I hold the door for her and her friend and she says hey and tells me that she tried to follow me on instagram but noticed that I didn’t really use it so I offered her my Snapchat. I put in my user, she thanked me said goodbye and we parted ways.

I texted her that day and got to know her better, everything is going well and find that we have similar views on the world. I find that she has her own taste in music apart from mine as well, At this point she is becoming a bigger and bigger possibility. I tell her I want to hang out with her in real life we hang in her car and her friends go sometimes as well. I’ve only been alone with her in her car a few times but anyway I find that she smokes and even offered me but I declined as I don’t smoke anymore, for me this was a little bit of a turn off but at the same time I told myself it doesn’t matter all that much. I decline and we go about normal conversation. 

I would snap her first and sometimes she would swipe up at a story of mine and we’d start talking but she would tend to take a long time to reply and still does as of this moment, sometimes hours and she would never tell me why. Acknowledging this I would stop to see if she would text me first and mostly nothing would come. 

She is a friendly person and waves, smiles and says hi in the hallways every time I see her. I walk her to class sometimes and she’s even walked the long route all the way around just to walk with me longer and one of these days she has also told me that she broke up with her partner. To me it’s like she wouldn’t do these things if she wasn’t interested (hence the significance of this situation to me). I’ve told a friend about this situation and he said that she is interested but afraid I’m not interested in her. I’ve had friends tell me that She could fall for me and others that told me things I should do when the time comes but I feel like there is a wall keeping me from getting her. It’s a huge mess of mixed messages coming to me. 

I asked her if she wanted to go to the local fair and she said yes but she may have work. I really want to go with her but It seems I may not even be able to go at all. I asked her if she’d be willing to take a day off for me and she said if anything she’d would be able to next weekend. Yesterday I told her that she was at a parade and that she was all I was thinking about and she replied with “aw hey!” Asked whatsup and asked if I was having fun. From there I teased her a little and we talked. I might just be crazy I don’t know lol. I know it’s hard to tell on whether or not she is interested in me but does anyone have any idea what I should do? Take a break? Pursue my wants? Focus on school? This unsureness is what drove me here in the first place. Just fyi feel a great enlightenment anytime we bond and really want this but it also wouldn’t be very much of a loss if it doesn’t work as I want to work on my future job and self improvement. Once again, Anything is appreciated.",07May2018,1

So this person I know through an app, - I mean, we're not exactly close friends, I mean we've chatted and did an art trade - just messaged me... They're 13. Part of me doubts then, but they do have have pics of themselves on their profile.

Anyway their mom forces them to drink, and is marring a man who is abusive. I kinda of want to ask them for their address so I can call the cops... Not sure if I should and can??

35,"Hey everyone! This is kind of a long back story so thank you to everyone who sticks with me here. 

My best friend/roommate has one semester of undergraduate left before she’s off to her masters. She only has to take classes in the fall and she’s graduated. The thing is she would need somewhere to live during that semester. I️ graduate in a few days and will be staying in our current city with my boyfriend. I️ offered to let her live with us at our rental home for the one semester because six month leases are ridiculously expensive and hard to come by (where we are you do NOT want to end up in the wrong place because it can get really scary- gang activity, random violence, etc.) 

Some more background- she has a lot of health problems and has seizures but she has to be taken care of a certain way when they happen. She’s isn’t from this state originally since I️ live with her I️ am her medical liaison while she is at school. I know her medical history inside and out and she had an episode about three months back that was pretty scary. Her parents are over 10 hours away driving and 3 by plane. 

So I️ offered for her to move in with us and she was thrilled. The house had a great set up for her studies. But when she told her dad, he freaked out. He’s VERY religious and told her he would cut her off if she lived in a house with an unmarried male. My boyfriend and I️ have been together for 4 years and will be engaged soon. 

She’s really distressed because she doesn’t want to have to find a six month lease and explain her health issues to new people or even worse, live alone. I’m at the point where I️ want to scream at him that living with us is in her best interest with her health concerns and short timeline. What do I️ do? I’m concerned she’s going to get sick and there won’t be anyone to help her and since she pays the bulk of her own rent it’s going to be even more expansive for her. ",07May2018,1

37,"I'm 18 years old, about to be 19. I was pursuing a major in Aviation Science for school so that I could be a pilot, but my color vision was too poor to continue that career and it really knocked me down, it's all I wanted to do and I thought I had stuff figured out. I'm almost down with my first year of college, but now I don't know what to do. I want to change my major, but have no idea what to change it to. I'm even considering transferring to another school/state.

41,"First and foremost i realize I'm an idiot, just needed to put it out there that I do in fact know this. Also TL;DR is at the bottom. 

So what happened was a bunch of coworkers and I were in our break room and we have a pretty loud, crazy server who I'll call Peter. So Peter says something like ""hey guys I wonder why Hunter G. Jones (fake name for obvs reasons) hasn't accepted my friend request, it's been like 3 days"" and we're like""who?"" And he informs us that this guy came into our restaurant, racked up a $113 tab and left no tip at all, and Peter swears there were no issues with service. So we're all laughing because we think it's ridiculous that he added him, and then Peter suggests we all add him, so there's a total of like 8 of us who sent this guy friend requests, myself included.
Anyways a couple hours later it seemed Hunter G Jones added only me, and sent me a message asking if he knew me. I was with all the servers when this happened and kind of freaked out and off pure stupidity just asked around what I should say, or if I should even say anything at all. They all chime in with responses but we all agree to say something like , ""oh! I saw you at restaurant name when I was waitressing and you looked like someone I knew from random high school name. I think you were actually my friend Peter's table, and your name seemed super familiar so I thought I'd look you up"" 

To which the guy responded that it was super weird I used his credit card receipt to see his name and that it was highly inappropriate and a violation of his privacy. I just messaged that I was really sorry and truly meant no harm and that obviously I was severely mistaken so I'd be unfriending now and I proceeded to block him on Facebook and messenger. Anyways, his response has been stressing me out a ton because I'm scared he will report me at my job, and it really sucks because I never served him/handled his credit card or receipt and was just acting off of stupidity and being hyped up by coworkers. 
Anyways what I'm asking is, Should I just out myself to a manager and explain? Will this be worse than just waiting to see what happens. I honestly love my job and don't want to get fired. 

TL;DR added a coworker's bad tipper and he was very upset, now I'm not sure what steps I should take in case he reports me. ",07May2018,1

44,"i am a 20 year old woman and i havent had a boyfriend before, and ive also never had sex before. that simple fact is truly embarrassing to me, i dont think its a negative thing when someone else has the same situation, but when i think about myself and my life etc, that fact hurts me. the only way i can really explain why i havent is because i am demisexual i guess (only sexually interested in those who i have a strong emotional connection to), i dont rlly like classifying myself like that but it truly fits how i feel.
so anyway, it goes without saying that im not into hookups, which sucks because it seems like thats basically all that goes on these days. Ive had crushes on guys before and at those times im really into those people and do genuinely want to have sex with them etc., felt comfortable and confident at the thought of doing it, but somehow things never got that far w those guys. im only ever nervous w this around strangers, and i mean REALLY nervous. to the point where im not even on the fence about having sex with him or not. if its a stranger the answer is always just straight up ""i do not want to"" simply.
for backstory, i guess you could say im a late bloomer. i only started really looking at boys and searching for romance after highschool... old i know, but before then i was just leaving it all up to fate. i kept thinking and telling myself that someone will come naturally and i dont have to look for him or do anything and - surprise surprise - no one turned up. my ""future husband"" didnt present himself because fate isnt going to give you love if youre emotionally unavailable - which i really was due to my belief that my freaking soul mate was on his merry way. after i realized waiting isnt gonna get me love, i began to look for it, but everywhere i looked there was a demand for sex over conversation or connection. i wanted to find a guy that i could get to know as a friend and slowly start a romantic relationship with. but when that didnt happen and i started shutting down their advances - not out of disinterest but out of wanting to get to know them better - they (not unreasonably) took it as disinterest and stopped pursuing. there have been many times where i was very interested somebody as Ive said, though one way or another it wouldnt work out. and that leads us to the present. 
so, because of my novice, sexually, i do often feel that i get looked down on or judged by friends etc. &amp; dont get me wrong, they are genuinely really great people and theyve only ever been comforting and supportive and helpful, but its only natural for people to have their own opinions about things, and even if they dont say anything directly about their judgment to my face (which they never have - ever) i can still imagine or feel what they must be thinking. and it sucks. often times i get told to just get drunk and get it over with, but its not that simple to me. Ive considered it though. only because i hate being thought of as someone whos scared to do something that isnt a big deal, and logically, im aware its not a big deal. but, i also cant help my feelings/boundaries/what im comfortable with. a lot of the times i feel like im being really misunderstood for being virgin which is ultimately what hurts the most. people think im simply daft for avoiding sex, think im lacking knowledge on the matter (dont know how sex works or feels)(i know how it works AND feels thanks), multiple people asking me if ive considered whether or not im into women instead, people saying im just acting childish, ppl thinking my imagination is blowing things out of proportion etc, and none of these are bad assumptions.... but it hurts me when people dont understand me and judge my situation wrongly.
so... heres where it gets kind of shitty... recently, ive taken to saying im not virgin, etc... all just so i could stop feeling inferior... i hate that. i hate lying, i dont like making it up it feels wrong and it sucks. ive always been an honest person and never felt the need to hide what i feel or think, but this is different, the matter is so personal and - i cant even explain it well but - unchangeable in a way at the moment? (only way ill feel comfortable having sex is with a guy i have a strong emotional connection to - and right now theres no one like that around that i am attracted to - therefore its a waiting game) so i feel that theres no other course of action to make this (mis)judgement stop??? i feel like i might have ruined something in my life... dont know whether to force myself and bring the lies to truth so i can stop feeling like shit, or whether to keep it up until it happens when im comfortable, or whatever else. what would you do?
I know what ive done sucks - to lie like that is really a rotten thing to do and i feel terrible about it. i just wanted to feel stop feeling so misunderstood all of the time.
it still feels really shitty though either way, just needed to get this off of my chest.

TL;DR - i am demisexual and wanted to wait to have sex until i met a guy who i would have an emotional connection to and felt comfortable with, but being judged/misunderstood for this ended in me lying about being virgin to friends, and now i feel like utter shit for doing it &amp; dont know what i should do now..",07May2018,1

I never had a place to be able to go crazy on guitar drums and singing (lived in a small house, then a really cheap apartment haha) So I got a job during school and worked as much as I could. I then rented out a rehearsal room and wrote an entire albumn with all these ideas Ive made over the years (the room is 24/7) I bought mics, a good amp and all this recording gear and am about to record and learn how to make music. I am also gonna make some a youtube series. AnywaysI know a few people who might be intrested in gigging music wise but if not I need to look for new people. I am now learning that this is what I want to do with my life and am considering the following options: 

1. Get a degree in dental hygiene (They have 3 day 12 hour shifts which I like, i dont give a shit about teeth tho haha) so I have money and keep working on music and videos until hopefully it takes off 

2. Get a degree in say music production or something similar to that nature so I can finally be around like minded people and meet bandmates, con to this is that alot of people say you dont really need a degree in that field, and majoring in anything in music is eh

i lost a girl in my life that was my everything, she was the sister i never had.

after her, getting close to anyone scares me, i don’t think i can manage losing another support system.

51,"As title stated, She logged in to my instagram and looked through my recent searches where I had looked at 2 of my ex's profiles at some point. I saw this as a harmless act of curiosity more than anything whereas she sees it as me checking them out (aesthetically) and super weird to the point that in her eyes it is borderline cheating.

I have said that it was just because I was browsing through Instagram and I was curious for 5 seconds so I searched them. After talking I see that affected her and could be seen as weird - but not the the extent that she thinks. I also get that it is all relative to the person but I want to know what the general consensus is on that.

She knows I am making this post and would like genuine constructive advice and opinions on this. Do you think it is weird to search an ex out of curiosity? (I haven't spoken to either of them since I broke up with them).

We aren't looking for hateful comments on either account - just some opinions on where people stand when it comes to this.  Please do not focus on the instagram checking part as this isn't what this is about; just contextual.

Whether it was get better at a sport, go to the gym and get abs, I freaking did it and I’m proud of it. Now, I’m 17, bout to go to college next year, but I just cannot find any motivation in that. I’m happy about it, it’s what I wanna do with my life, but I just cannot get excited about that like I used to be with everything else.

Idk I think part of the problem is that my support system went from a 5 to a 0. My brother hates me (BPD, drugs), my parents are out of my life for good (also drugs and BPD) and my grandparents I’ve been living with have never in particular been good roll models in terms of people I can ask for advice from. 

Prom is a whole other can of worms. I was gonna go with this girl, but she had been asked out the week before and I honestly think that she still would’ve given me the “you’re nice, but...” lecture. Next girl I wanted to go with is already going with her BFF, and HAS A CRUSH ON THE BF OF THE PREV GIRL. Idk, so I think I’m girled out and rocking it solo with my friends.

I recently found out she still works at the same coffee shop she worked at when we broke up a year ago. Which is surprising considering she never lasted more than a few months at any of her jobs. How bad would it be if I went there to get coffee? Is it too much? Would it be okay if I said that i didn't think she worked there anymore?

I find it essential to give a quick background of my life as I see it necessary to understand the position I’ve come to. 

I was born into a middle class family in the suburbs of Chicago. Had an abusive father, mentally disabled brother, and was the youngest of my parents four kids. 

My father held a gun to my head and made plans to kill my family and family’s friends when I was 8 years old. Parents got divorced and dad went to jail for a little bit, but had a powerful family that somehow got him off with a slap on the risk. (Chicago politics is incredibly corrupt). 

Long story short my family gets plunged into poverty, I move around a lot, became that fat loser throughout school and played a lot of video games. 

My mother started up her own business and worked many jobs to keep our family afloat, which she succeeded at. However, being the youngest, having a dad out of the picture, and having a mom always out working I never really had anyone around. And not being a cool kid I took what friends I could get. 

Taking what friends I could get meant I wasn’t hanging around any good influences, but for most of my teens I stayed out of trouble but never had good grades. 

Then I finally get to college. I immediately changed. I lost 70lbs, had a 3.9 GPA after two years, studied abroad on prestigious government scholarships, got my first girlfriend. I had my life together. 

But all this success was fueled by one dream. The dream of attending the University of Chicago. I had always considered myself a smart individual, and going to a good high school surrounded by Ivy League students fueled this desire to prove myself after a completely lost childhood. I had everything in place, an impeccable resume, and I applied for transfer. 

I didn’t get in. I was devastated. 

I didn’t have good role models or anyone to talk to growing up. So instead of refocusing my goals, I decided to cash in all of the hard work I had done. 

I started hanging out with who has become my best friend. And instant change in the opposite direction. 

I gained back 50lbs, have gotten straight Ds the past two years, started smoking, started drinking, started spending all of my money on gambling and strippers and prostitutes, constantly chasing the next high (although I’ve never committed crimes or have done hard drugs). I even got fired from a job for a pretty stupid reason if I’m being honest here (said I talked to other employees too much). 

So midway through this crash I came home one day in tears. I couldn’t even recognize the animal I had become. I broke down and for the first time ever my mother say me cry. I admitted most to her, and said that I was scared and lost. All I wanted was my mother to comfort me and say “it’s all going to be okay, we’ll figure this out”. 

Her response? 

She got angry and shouted “your dad used to do this all the time. If you’re going to do it, go kill yourself.”

This fucked me up more than I can express. And I’m sure contributed to my continued downward trend over the past year. 

Now’s probably a good time to say that my mother, I believe, is mentally ill/emotionally abusive. She hit me a couple of times growing up. She even went berserk once and broke some of my games. I’ve seen her hit my disabled brother, try to kick my cat, and one time she tried to kick me out and was flinging my stuff around the room when I was 18. I didn’t know what to do so I called the police. Police show up, she makes up a sob story, and I get treated like a domestic abuser. 

She has kept my family trapped for years. My entire family is overweight, swamped in debt, still living at home, working minimum wage jobs. My mother even convinced me to take out student loans so she could use me as her personal ATM. She even convinced my brother not to take a job at Whole Foods because Amazon advertised on Breitbart and she feared that Whole Foods would go out of business due to the backlash. I wish I was making that up. And my siblings are totally brainwashed by her too. 

So that brings me to now. I should be graduating, but instead I’m failing two classes and am finally getting kicked out of the honors college. 

I have done a great deal of maturing the past several months. I’ve come to realize how far I’ve fallen from grace, all of the mistakes that I’ve made, and how now I’m going to take an extra year and finish up my dual degree and pick up another minor. I’m finally taking steps to improve my life once more, to realize that this isn’t normal, and to live the life I’ve always wanted to. No longer will I be a slave to my addictions and to my family. No longer am I going to be the victim, as I am captain of my destiny. 

So here’s the ordeal. This job I’ve had at a distribution company for the past two years needs someone to go to Minnesota every week. I’d spend 5 days a week there, and come back on weekends. My hotel would be paid for, I’d get $25 a day untaxed food allowance and would get paid $15 an hour at 70 hours a week. All in all this job pays $72K a year. 

I see this as my saving grace. I’d be able to get away from the routine and mundane, to travel and see more of the country, to be on my own and focus on losing weight and quitting smoking, to get away from my family and to make an assload of money in the process to pay down all of my debt I’ve built up. I’d only have this job for the next four months but it is everything I need right now. 

My mother is having no part of it. And is so violently opposed that she is threatening to call the company and make up stuff to get me and my friend fired, to have me evicted, etc. 

Now this seems like a clear cut case but my mother isn’t always an abusive cunt. She did sacrifice a lot for me when I was younger, and at the end of the day she’s still my mother. She’s had three heart surgeries over the past two years and is not in good health. And I believe she’s fucked up in the head because of the decades of abuse at the hands of my father and her father before that. 

All in all I’m lost guys. This is where I stand and how I got here. I need advice on how to handle/ how to approach this. 

Thanks. ",07May2018,1
65,"Basically, she was the first person who told me how much she liked my writing, and over the course of a few years helped me improve and encouraged my love of reading and writing. This helped me alot when I was younger, as I come from an abusive household and I've never had anyone support me in anything. She made me realize that I was...actually *good* at something. And nobody's ever told me that.  Writing is now a very big part of who I am, and it's all thanks to her. I want to give her something to thank her for sticking with me and making a huge mark in my life; but I don't want to come off as creepy or anything. What should I do? ",07May2018,1
66,"I’ve been with my girlfriend for 2 years, and she’s always kind of had a problem with my best friend. The best friend is admittedly a very attractive girl but she’s more like a sister to me than anything else. She’s been my best friend for almost 20 years, since the first day of first grade. It’s caused a couple of arguments over the years but yesterday it caused the biggest one we’ve had and she ultimately said I had to choose whether to be with her or keep my best friend. 
Naturally I chose my friend and she lost it. She knew already who I would pick but hearing out loud just pushed her too far.  Long story short we broke up.

All of our arguments about this have pretty much been based around the fact that my girlfriend and/or other people suspect that there’s something going on with me and my friend and that she thinks I’m secretly in love with her or something. I can honestly that there is nothing like that going on with my friend. She is in a happy relationship, living with a great guy and has been for 5 years. 

I would like people’s opinions on the fact that I picked my friend. I know she was completely out of line to even try to make me pick between the two of them, but does anyone think I was out of line to pick my best friend of 20 years? I get that your girlfriend is meant to come first but does a 2 year relationship outweigh a 20 year friendship? Are you supposed to love someone enough that you would happily drop your best friend if it ever came to it? Would it be different if she asked me to pick her or one of my guy friends? 

Obviously if she really loved me she would never have put me in that situation, but the more I think about it and ask people about it, they are convinced that I must be in love with my friend to have chosen her.

Long story short a couple of weeks ago something happened where we had to talk about it and we decided that we wanted to have sex with each other.

After I left, his roommate completely yelled at him and basically gave him a mouthful.

71,"My boyfriend of 3 years is turning 46 in the next couple weeks. For what it matters I’m 29. Every year (and for every holiday where a gift is typically associated) I struggle with what to get him. While I have the financial means to buy him nice things, he is definitely part of the 1%. He already has everything he needs and more...

It gets a little more difficult. He owns a salon so he can get spa services any time he likes. He owns restaurants so a meal out holds relatively little value. I’ve already done the “personalized” book of favorite relationship photos, gift basket of his ‘favorite things,’ apartment full of balloons/cake/etc, and surprise party. I would love to take him on a trip but he has so many free miles he would be upset that I spent the money. 

Looking for advice on what to get him/do for him to make his day special. He always goes above and beyond for me so I want to reciprocate. Note: he will appreciate anything I do regardless and is not “expecting” anything. 

—He’s very active; loves tennis, working out, and sports in general. Into healthy eating. 

—Loves being “at the lake” and “on the water.” Has a boat. However; is not “outdoorsy.” 

—Enjoys fashion; already has lots of clothes. Wears a suit to work every day. 

—Enjoys travel. 

—Is quirky, enjoys kitsch. Kid at heart. 

—Foodie. But recently we are trying to go vegetarian so this limits us a bit in terms of cool dining “experiences” that are available in our area...

—He’s open minded.

Any ideas? As of now I made him a book of our travel adventures from the past year, am planning to order him a specialty cake (pac man themed...LOVES and is extremely good at pac man). Obviously this is diverting from vegetarian but I’m picking my battles. But that’s all I’ve got! I keep coming back to the idea of something personalized. Last year I got him a TUMI briefcase with his initials on it but it was unfortunately stolen from his vehicle earlier this year. I could get him a replacement but I feel like that’s too boring/expected.

I followed her for her career and moved across the country for her about a year and a half ago. I'm well established in my job, but not making enough to support myself in a big city (wife was the bread winner).  I talked to my bosses and they said they would work out something to help me get by for the time being, but I don't want to look like I just got a raise because of my separation from my wife. I really have three options though. 

1. Stay in my house with my wife and try to work things out (but I don't know if I can let this go). 

2. Take the raise, barely get by and be alone with not many friends and no family here. 

3. Move back across the country to live with my parents to get my feet back under me. 

None of these options are ideal, but it's really all I have. I don't think I could handle the stress of finding a better paying job along with dealing with my devastation. I know it isn't completely urgent because my wife and I are on good terms at the moment, but I don't want that to change and be totally abandoned here with not much support. I am just trying to make a decision before I am in a worse situation. 

Any advice helps.

74,"We've been dating for a year now. It's great, we have nice times and all but I think our relationship is kind of suffering from-- hell I'll admit it: me.
We are polar opposites but we have been best friends since the eighth grade and recently started dating after high school. For the longest time it's been really nice and yeah our opposite personalities cause us to have occasional spats but we get over it in like five minutes. Not a problem at all.

Buuuuut recently, I'm gonna be straight here. I've been SUCH a gosh darn bother towards her. My personal life has been completely bonkers lately and there's a lot of crap flying around and I've felt pretty depressed lately. Not gonna list the big things that are happening but it's been affecting me pretty badly.
The main thing though, is that she's going to study abroad for a year and I've been trying to cope with how difficult its going to be. We've talked about it and hopefully we'll be fine during that year (so no this is not a thread to discuss why long term doesnt work so shut yer mouths, that's a problem for future me).
It's kind of been taking a toll on me because I think that subconsciously I feel like I need to spend time with her now because there wont be time later. That's me rationalizing my shit behaviour recently. It's a load of crap.

I hate admitting it but I have been in her personal bubble WAY too much lately. So much that she has literally begged me to give her time to herself- which was pretty devastating for my ignorant piece of crap to hear at the time.

I've been prolonging our nightly phone calls. I have been getting really salty that she's not been replying to me or not wanting to do anything with me. Which is pathetic of me.

This has caused some bad arguments recently and I have come to the stunning conclusion that.......I really need to grow the heck up.


So I'm here. I'm not usually like this and I think it's really circumstantial but I really need to fix my problems. I'm trying to pick up some video games to entertain myself but it's kinda pointless. Does anyone have any advice or tips? Or things that I can do to self improve and focus a little more on myself so that I'm not completely smothering my girlfriend? I've really been down in the dumps with my personal issues, but I am still 100% in the wrong here. I'm aware, and I'm asking for help.

75,"I asked her to be my girlfriend officially only a few weeks ago but we have been talking a lot and have been emotionally invested for months now. Since being official we’ve been spending more time together (I’d say we see each other around 3x a week on average) when we can. We both work unpredictable hours at work, live at home with our parents so when we both see free time we kinda jump on it as an opportunity to hang out. 

We both have big freelancing dreams and are working hard to make those things come true and last night she expressed to me that she feels that we may be moving too fast. She reassured me that she the feelings she has for me are strong but that ideally seeing each other 1 or 2x a week would be better. She said she hasn’t been talking to her friends much either because her and I text pretty frequently throughout the day. I support her dreams and I know I need to work on my own but her telling me this has made me kinda shitty, like there’s going to be constraints on texting? I’m okay with reducing how much we are together physically because in past relationships I have gotten carried away with trying to see my partner every day. To me texting doesn’t take away much from your day as I feel like I’m just constantly casually texting my friends and family.

It’s kinda sparked this insecurity that like maybe every time I’ve sent a text first she starts to feel like “I won’t get any work done today” or that she feels like she has to neglect her work to text me. I asked her if she wanted to be the one to text me first that way I’d know it would be a good time to talk but she struck that idea down so quickly and said it wasn’t like that.

Just looking for some advice here... I am being too sensitive or irrational here? I want to let her know this makes conversation feel too controlled but I’m not sure how. I hope to be with her for years to come and I know that less contact right now means we can advance professionally which will lead to a life of not being so constrained or limited with our time spent hanging out or texting.

76,"I've come to realize that I'm just waiting to die and that I don't really care when it happens.  I'm not suicidal, it's nothing like that.  I'm just really tired.

I'm middle aged and I never figured out how to be happy.  I never married, I have no children.  I've never been in love.  I haven't had a relationship in 15 years - I haven't been touched in 15 years.  And even then, it wasn't really all that interesting.  

This would shock you if you knew me.  I'm the funny one, the (seemingly) happy one.  At the risk of sounding immodest, I'm a pretty good-looking guy.  I know how to love, I've got a couple of people in my life - friends - that I truly love. and I'm good to them.  I've always been good to the people in my life.  None of them are close by, so our relationship is via email - but I love them anyway.  It's just not the sort of love that sustains me.  

I have no idea what it feels like to be **in** love.  I don't think I've ever been in love.  

I had a great life for a while.  I made huge money, new cars, vacations, the whole nine yards.  I gave it away, I gave so much away.  I lost the rest in 2008 and for the last decade I've been working little jobs and just getting by.  There is no real joy anymore.

But I've learned to be happy with what I have, and I am happy with what I have.  It's nothing like it use to be, but I have a little house and I have a car and I feel very lucky for that.  I can't do the things I use to do, but the way I see it, ""I did the things"".  Some people never get to experience the things I was able to experience, and so I'm just grateful I had my shot.

But now, I'm just done.  I smoke, I drink, I don't do anything, and as a result, I feel physically horrible.  I'm dying and I know it.  I'm going to die.  I want to care, but I can't.  I don't want to feel this way, but I can't stop it.  I know how to fix it - I'm not an idiot.  I could get up and get out there and exercise and quit smoking and better my diet and join a social club and meet people but I don't want to.  I have no reason to.

Problems:

Mental health. Untreated anxiety and PTSD. Untreated phobia of insects buzzing. Constantly in a state of high stress. Frequently have intrusive thoughts about suicide. I don't want to die, I just don't want to live like this. Even the smallest baby step feels like too much stress to enact. Oh, and lovely mothers day is coming up, which is another layer of stress. 

Physical health. Neck and shoulder pain. Frequent numbing in my hands due to a pinched nerve in my neck. Asthma flares due to stress. I'm overweight, but if I don't eat frequently I become more stressed and get acid reflux problems. I've been sick for two weeks with vomiting and nausea, likely due to stress. This isnt an exhaustive list, various aches, pains, and more intimate health issues are around. 

Social issues. Mostly anxiety based. I'm getting panic attacks whenever I'm in public. I'm losing most of my social group due to changing jobs.

Work issues. My manager has become a walking HR nightmare. I'm finding a new store to work at, but its slow going. Between my long commute and the level of stress at work, I can hardly take it. Once I find a new store, I'll be there 30 days later.

Housing issues. I'm living with my partners parents while we look to buy a house. I'm overwhelmed even googling things. I need to be pre approved for a mortgage. We have the savings, we have the credit. I just can't drag myself to the bank.

Relationship. We live with his parents. Infrequent sex, made worse by a pain problem on my end. Not his fault, he's actually very good at what he does. I can't even use tampons sometimes due to the pain. I also have been moody and disagreeable from stress, which makes me more stressed. He's been fantastic, but I'm terrified that how I treat him will make him resent me. More stress.

She talks back to me and doesn't listen to important lessons or any sort of reasoning. She acts like I'm a monster.

90,"Hi, I'm a high school student (junior) and I am a really passive and socially awkward person in general. 

1.) I will admit that I'm a pushover. However, i don't think I would have a problem if some random asshole wanted to fight and actually swung, I would fight back in that scenario, but I can't deal with the small things that my friends do to annoy me. I think I can handle an extreme situation, but cant handle anything less than extreme. If someone tried to rob me, I would fight. If someone kindly asked for money everyday, I think I would give in. This is way less extreme, but when I'm wearing a hoodie, some of my friends would  pull on the strings. This may sound pretty petty, but it really ticked me off. They even busted an expensive jacket I had. I don't think they realized, but I couldn't bring myself to tell them. I felt like telling them I was actually bothered by the string pulling would make me seem like someone that couldn't take a joke and was too sensitive. What is the best option in that scenario to convey my annoyance? Is it just directly telling them or is there a less confrontational option?

2.)This kind of sounds arrogant, but I think I'm a nice person. I know it's not really my place to judge my own attributes, but I try to go out of my way to help people. However, I feel that being too nice to people makes me way too available. I sometimes feel like I'm just someone's second option most of the time. Now I'm trying to be less nice and considerate, not an asshole but not going out of my way to be kind, so that I'm not taken advantage of. Is this the right way to go about it?

3.) I have a friend that is a good kid and we have a lot in common. In the previous scenario, he would say that my other friends were being assholes occasionally . Let me clarify something, this friend would say something if he felt like it, but he's not a saint. I love the kid, but his moments of kindness were always on a whim. We get along decently, but there are times when he gets on my nerves really badly sometimes. If I was talking to one of my friends about something and a different friend wanted to know what we were talking about, I would naturally fill them in. However, the friend that I was talking about, would never fill me in or tell me that I should've done my research. I would just be ticked off and nothing more if he was at least consistent with this principle, however, when he's on the other side of the scenario he expects me to do what he wouldn't do for me. I'm mad at myself because I do tell him when he misses out on a conversation, even though he doesn't bother with me when the script is flipped. How should I treat him? I have thought about just replying with what he tells me, but I can never bring myself to.


I'm really sorry that my problems are so lame, but it's kinda been gnawing at me and I didn't know where else to address this. If you only want to respond to what you would do or what I should've done on a single scenario, that's fine. Thanks in advance ",07May2018,2

97,I work at daycare center and I am in charge of a group of kids and I met this 4th grade girl that laugh at all my jokes and was pretty close to me. A couple weeks ago I got two new kids that I been knowing for a while. The manager told me. Who I wanted and choose my favorite 2. With the 4th grade girl nothing really changed when I added them. The kids that I picked are also girls and they are pretty close to me like they walked always around me or surround me to talk to me. About a month ago. The 4th grade girl stopped talking all together to me. And when she needs something she goes to other teachers to get what she needs or tells her friends to get items from me. I talked to her but I did as a controlling way as other fix it or I'll let the manager know. I know I know I should know better. When I asked her what was the matter she told me that she did not like me because I told jokes that were not funny and made her angry. I been knowing her since she was a second grader. She would laugh at literally any joke that I made. Her closest friends told me that she also said that was her reason for not liking me because I try to be funny but they belive that it's not true. My coworkers think that it's because she feels that she is not my favarite and I prefer the other 2 girls that I brought in.

102,"Before I start I have a simple fact about myself I need to get out there, so you can better understand the reasoning behind any decisions I have made regarding this situation thus far.

I have very high social anxiety. I’m sure most of you reading this are familiar with this by now, but for those of you who don’t know I’ll give you an explanation. Basically, I have a hard time talking to others because I have an irrational fear of them judging/disliking me, and I’m self conscious all the time. It’s a little more complicated then that, but that’s the basics of it.

Anyways, I need some help and I’ve turned to reddit for this.

I’m going to use nicknames for the sake of keeping people’s identities safe and whatnot. So we have C, S, A, B, P, F and Q (creative nicknames, I know.) Now that you know the nicknames, here’s the problem. This will be very lengthy, bare with me here.

So I was hanging out with B, P, and Q one summer evening. It was fairly hot outside with the sun beaming down on us, so we were chilling in B’s room in order to stay cool. While we were in B’s room which smelled a lot like the beach, my phone vibrates in my mini purse that’s neatly slung across my shoulder. I excitedly react to the buzzing in my bag with the knowledge that it’s most likely my crush, C texting me. I open up my purse and slide open my phone to read the flirtatious text C had sent be about a picture I’d sent him. 

Let it be known that B strongly dislikes C. 

I read the text out loud giddily, excitement all over my face which was a little rosy from a bit of sunburn. As I finished reading the text, I had realized that B looked rather unamused and annoyed at C’s message. I also had realized that B had no shame and could be very intense at times. I should have thought before reading the text out loud to my friends, but it was to late at that point.

B demanded that I hand him the phone so he could text C, and at first I clutched my phone to my chest and turned away from him, my nervous heart pounding in my chest. Me and P exchanged worried glances as B groaned and started snapping at me, which made my friend Q stared to whine and plead that I should hand B the phone. Q liked B a lot, and I knew she was only trying to appease B, so with a shaky breath I sigh and hand B the phone. I mean, how bad could it be? 

I should have been less scared of B. B was ruthless though, and it was reasonable that I was afraid of telling him no, but I also know I should have put my values first. I really should have, because B went off on C, telling him that he was ‘sexually harassing me’ (C was not sexually harassing me, by the way) and that I never loved C. The thing is, C and I liked each other and we knew it but I wasn’t ready for a relationship because I wasn’t in a good state of mind. So, we agreed we’d wait until I was ready. But, B fucked it all up by barking at C for no reason.

C blamed the whole thing on me, which is fair because I let B yell at him. I couldn’t have brought myself to say no anyways though, because I had high social anxiety. C couldn’t have known that, and to him I just looked like a bitch so I seriously don’t blame him for hating me. At this point in time though, I didn’t know I couldn’t control my anxious feelings around people and I had convinced myself that I was a bad person. I lost friends, I lost faith, I lost my will to keep going because after I showed B I’d let him walk all over me, he ooo advantage of that and slowly took away all my friends until I was left with only two, Q and P. The worst part though is that C had started to date a girl by the name of S.

That stage of deep depression lasted two months until finally C realized how guilty I felt. C agreed to being civil with me once more if I apologized to him in person, and I did. Finally, C and I were friends again! We began to talk, quickly catching up and clicking together once more. I was so relieved that finally after all of this time that I could push past this whole thing with C and move on.

At least, I thought that was going to happen.

I made a mistake one day, and I told a girl named A that I had a crush on C. The thing is though, I was trying not to tell people. I didn’t want C nor S finding out about my crush because I only wished the best for them. I told A reluctantly who I liked, and A promised to keep it a secret. Surprise surprise, she broke the promise and ended up telling no one other than S. His girlfriend. 

I panicked, knowing that if A told S she could easily tell C. So, in a fit of blind panic I told C I liked him. C was surprised, which I would be too in his situation even if we had confessed to each other before. And this, folks, is where the problem began.

C has a best friend, F. C tries to be like F a lot, stealing his jokes and stuff. Nothing to bad. That was until recently. F has a very closed mind. F is very judgmental and crude sometimes, and C picked up on this attitude. Like a switch, C went from being surprised and nonchalant to manipulative.

He started insulting me, making crude jokes about my appearance and personal problems. One specific comment that stuck with me was when I couldn’t go to some store with him after school because I had therapy. 
C said something so sick about it, and I hate him for it.
“Why don’t you slit your wrists and get over with it?”

So this is the part where I ask for your advice, dear reader. I’m scared. I like C but he’s taken and he’s an asshole now. I don’t know what to do with my stupid affection for C. I can’t make a move on him because I respect and support C and S, but I also can’t ignore these feelings.

The most I've ever had in my bank account at one time was $5,000 from my grandma's inheritance, which I spent on traveling.

I also intend to give $50,000 to friends and family, donate $100,000 to charity, and set aside $10,000 for travel. 

That will leave me with about $400,000.  This might sound strange, but I'm really stressed out.  How should I invest my money to plan for my future?  I'd love any advice.

At this point, he's demanding that I not do anything at all in the kitchen or living room after 9:30pm because me opening a granola bar wrapper or pouring a glass of milk in the kitchen is too loud, no matter how quiet I am with it. In essence, he's telling me that my curfew is 9:30 and I had best stay in my room after that, no cleaning, cooking, doing laundry, using the TV, getting a snack, etc. 

I genuinely don't want to cause him problems and I always try to stay quiet at night, but this is negatively affecting my ability to get ready for work the next day.

I’ve known both for a really long time and I’m really close to them but they both have boyfriends now and I just feel so alone. They completely changed. We don’t do the things we used to do anymore because “their boyfriend would get concerned” or something like that. I hang out with them but their boyfriends are always there. When, on the off chance that their boyfriends aren’t there, they come out, I can tell that mentally they are not there and that no matter what, they just want to be with their boyfriends. They stopped coming to me with problems and went to their boyfriends instead. When I have problems, they are always busy with their boyfriends and don’t answer for a while or, worse, they tell their boyfriend about it even if I’m not comfortable with them knowing that because they just “share everything” 

Don’t get me wrong, I am happy for them, this is the happiest they’ve been ever, but I feel so alone.

114,"I'm about to be a new graduate this year in business admin.

How do you usually job hunt for a full time job while on your internship? The drawback on my internship this summer is that I am guessing that they won't be hiring students this year due to budget cuts in the company (it's a relatively small non profit company too). Ideally, I'd like to move elsewhere as well. I have seen some office jobs that are wanting to hire people full time starting this summer and I'm wondering how people usually address this issue? I don't want to burn bridges but I do want to softly tell them that I don't plan on staying.. though I don't think it's right to do it on my first month

Do you apply to full time jobs while your on your internship? If so, how do you manage if you get an interview at another company? I don't want to call in ""sick"" and it would be crude for me to say that I'm already job hunting when I'm still on my first month of internship and they might get the wrong idea that I hate the job etc. I don't mind it, I just don't want to keep doing that kind of job.

I was thinking of applying to jobs while I'm on my last month of internship or even last 2 weeks of my internship instead.. however, there was one job add in particular that really hit all my qualifications.. it sounded very newbie friendly, and I had the background they wanted. I'm wondering if I should just pass up this opportunity and wait until I finish my internship instead. I finish my internship in September.

I do have the Hiring Manager's personal email address on file from the job add, so is it better to email her now sometime this week and tell him/her that I am interested in the full time job if still available in September (which is not likely), or is it better to email him/her 2 weeks before my internship ends and just basically hope that she still hasn't met anyone or the person she hired quit after xx months. I honestly am such a novice with job hunting and would appreciate some great advice!

Everyone has their own bedroom, living space, and bathroom. My living space is the only one that doesn’t have any doors on it. It’s a home built in the 50’s and my living space is what would normally be the living room of the house. It has two door ways, none of which have doors. 

I have a nest cam set up so that I can see if anyone decides to go into my living space only. Well I have caught both of my roommates going into my living space to casually look out the front window, or just look around my living space. I don’t really like it. Today I caught the one roommate that I can tolerate most entering my living space and opening my laptop and just looking around. I feel like my privacy has been violated and my suspicion of untrustworthiness has been proven correct.  

The rental agreement states we are not to invade anyone else’s portion of the house— but I’m presented with going about it a couple ways.

1. Confront them directly, and tell them that I don’t appreciate them going into my section of the house while I’m not there. Which might make living situations awkward

2. Confront the landlord directly. Show her my evidence and voice my concerns. But that might be legally obligated to act on these things which would make bad blood.

117,"So, over the last 4 years me and my family have struggled with my sister who is a drug addict. She's been using heroin, and meth. She used to more heavily be into heroin, but is now more so into meth. Over the last 4 years I had moved out of my parents house due to the anxiety, and negativity my sister brings into my life. I moved out because I was tired of her stressing out my parents which in turned...stressed me out to no end. At one point, my parents couldn't take her on anymore and so they wanted me to move back into my parents house to basically, ""help out"", with trying to look after her. 

I've gotten to the point now where I just don't care anymore. My sister has been in and out of rehab. Every time she's clean, gets a job, and a month later no-call-no-shows and just goes back to being a jobless leech on my parents. I've tried to really hard not to, but I hate her. She treats my parents like shit who have nothing else to turn to and shell out thousands of dollars every month to cover my sister's legal fees, attorney fees, everything. I feel so bad for them because they just can't let her go and hit rock bottom. 

Most recently. My parents went to Cancun, Mexico this weekend on vacation and left me and my sister home to kind of watch over things until they get back. Turns out, my sister ended up driving to another state to hang out with some guy who is probably a drug addict. I assume this because she lied to me and said she was going to stay at a friend's house that night and ended up staying over because she had had a couple drinks. She ended up stayed with my grandparents who, of course, told my parents that it was unusual for her to just show up at their house unannounced a state away. Now they're stressed out and in a different country on vacation. In anger, I sent her a long and drawn out text telling her how much I really hate the way she makes everybody in this family feel and that I had given up on her.

119,"Male, 28, American, Currently in Bangkok, Thailand. Long story short, I split with my Australian girlfriend while I was in Bangkok, Thailand (no infidelity or anything, just weird circumstances) and can no longer go back to Australia (stayed there 3 months on a tourist visa, work visa application could take up to 2 months and I don't have that time) So I am here in Bangkok looking for a job. Fortunately Thailand is inexpensive and I've been able to float on my funds, making a border crossing to renew my visa twice. I've been job hunting in Thailand but not with much luck as I didn't bring my college transcripts (A weird obsession in the Thailand job market). I  have found a few jobs that pay fine, are about an hour away from Bangkok, and only need a degree (which I got sent to me from my mother). However, my friend in Beijing, China has told me he has a job for me and it pays twice as much as Thai salaries. While these are both jobs in teaching, I am actually currently learning marketing, design, and google analytics autodidactically with the hopes of starting a business in a year or two after getting some freelance experience. I've considered going back to live with mom &amp; dad for a few months to focus on my learning and put all my efforts into that, but I'm also broke and teaching in China pays well for the work (in my opinion at least). My last option would be to move to Las Vegas and crash on my friends couch until I get on my feet. Parents or friend would basically be the same, study, work a tertiary job, and then see about launching a business, but one would be with a friend and one with my parents. I know this is an almost logorrheic rant, but I've never been at a crossroads like this in my life. Anything would be appreciated. 

In summary:
Bangkok, work full time, study in free time
Beijing, work full time, study in free time, be near friends
Parents, work part time tertiary job, study as much as I can
Las Vegas, work part time tertiary job, study as much as I can, be near friends",07May2018,2

121,"Its been 3 years since I have actaully succeed at anything. 

I used to be a good programmer. I lived my work at job. But somehow I felt I could do more. I tried things after things and sometimes i was into 3\-4 major stuff at once.

I joined a distance course at an institute and gave it my all. But things didn't turn out my way due to multiple reasons. None of en\-devours took me to a place which I could call my own.

While I was failing with my experiments, people followed the beaten up path and earned more money with better companies and positions. Also my position at my workplace deteriorated.

Having failed and exhausted all my will, I dont feel have energy to learn something new and fail again. As motivated and quick I was, now I left life on an auto\-poilet, on my way down.

123,"Disclaimer: this is very jumbled but I can't really think straight so sorry in advance. 

My entire life I have been very good at school, all As and did a lot.
I'm in my junior year right now, and ever since the start of second semester, I've been doing jack shit. I think in the past 4 weeks i've done zero homework at home and rush through it all the classes beforehand. My motivation is there, but I never end up doing what I tell myself to do. 

There are probably a few reasons from what it stems from.  First off, I got a job this year because I needed to pay for my car and other expenses. I would often come home from school, sleep until I have to go to work, and then get home and fall asleep telling myself I will do homework, but I don't. I live with my mom, and she doesn't have a consistent source of income. I recently learned my dad is moving from a place 15 minutes away to 45 minutes away, so I won't see him as often. My car has been inoperable since march. I don't study for anything anymore. I also recently got out of a 1.5 year shitshow with this girl who constantly led me on and then pulled away, leaving me fucked up because I was in love with her and she just broke me down. 

I've always loved astrophysics, and I want to go into that field in college, but I'm struggling in AP Physics. I know I can do better if I study. 

My AP tests are in a few days, and I haven't studied for them. My SAT and ACT scores were not where I wanted them, mainly because I didn't study. 

Nobody has been to college in my family, and I will be the first to go. I feel like I'm letting them down when I do this, and even that doesn't give me enough to try. 

I'm constantly tired, my room is always a mess. 

As 8th out of 500 or so people in my class, I know i'm going to drop in class rank. 

I think the final reason for this was upon discovering one of my very close senior friends getting rejected from Rice University. Him and I have identical class ranks, we both want to go into astrophysics, same test scores. we are similar in every way. Once I heard about that, I began to think to myself ""whats the point?"". I am auto accepted into UT due to my ranking, so why even try to do all of this when I know I won't make it into my dream school and I can go to UT instead? 

I won't be able to pay for a lot of universities without taking out extreme loans because of my financial situation. My mom (who I live with) makes less than 20k a year, but my dad makes ~130k. FAFSA and CSS are going to shit on me due to my dad's income, but he doesn't have any extra money to spare.  

I'm writing this all as I stare at an essay that is due tomorrow, 2 FRQ packets for physics, and 2 sheets of untouched homework for PreCal due tomorrow, along with a PreCal quiz. 

I don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry for writing this, I just don't have much hope right now. ",07May2018,2

126,"Hey, so this is a throwaway account for a reason.
I'm male and 17 from Germany, about five months ago I had a very sexual encounter with a 12 year old.
I'm not gonna go into detail but in short, we texted, sexted and made out once.
I did all of this with her in the mindset that she was more mature than her age would indicate, because a lot of our sexual conversations originated from her asking provocative questions etc.
I have never felt worse in my life, I know I messed up and I know, that I most likely took away part of her innocence at an age she shouldn't have to think about things like this.
I regret ever getting in contact with her and ever going along with her questions or initiating such conversations myself.
I want her to be okay, because I don't want to be someone who ruined someone else's life.
We did not have sex, I never was inside of her in any way.
But we kissed, hugged and did some stuff over our clothes.
I don't know what to do, I feel horrible for the things I've done, I know what we did was consensual at the time in my mind but I also know that she most likely didn't understand what exactly was going on.
I feel guilt and regret, I wish I could take these experiences away from her and have everything go away.
I'm at a point where I don't know what to do anymore.
Should I turn myself in? Should I try and reconnect with her and apologize directly? Should I just leave it because she broke of contact and is trying to move on?

I am a 26M with a bachelors from a good in\-state school. Luckily, I have zero student debt thanks to my hardworking parents. I have a good relationship and am planning to move in with my gf here within the next month. Pretty typical stuff. The problem is I just feel like I am drifting aimlessly day to day through my life. I recently quit my job \( decent sales job 60kish \) about 2 months ago to work part time and study for the LSAT to go back to law school. The problem is now that I have had all this time to study, I don't know if thats even what I want to do any more. I don't know what I want to do with my life any more. My passion is in video games and computers, and I would love to get into the industry, but I have no knowledge or background in computers that would get me a job in said industry. My degree is in communication with a minor in writing. My gf and parents are all so anxious for me to get into law school, and I feel this huge weight on my shoulders as to not let them down. I have always told them that I wanted to go to law school but as it gets closer to becoming reality, it is not something I really want any more. My father is a lawyer and we have always talked about working in the firm together, so I would have a good job and be able to provide for my gf \(and children if we have them\).  I know I can't do everything for my parents or for anyone but myself, but I don't want to let the people I love down. I know this probably seems like something so stupid to complain about, but I just don't know what I want to do with my life any more. I have been contemplating going back to school for another undergrad degree, but if it is already too late to apply for fall semester somewhere, I will just be scraping by until then living paycheck to paycheck. Everything just seems so hopeless. How do you know what to do with your life? What if I pursue a career in the computer field and end up not being able to provide very much for my significant other? These feelings of helplessness are overwhelming and it is starting to take a toll on my health and relationship. I have been so stressed out that I am constantly getting sick and not being able to eat or do very much with my gf. She deserves better than how I have been lately. I have good intentions I just don't know what I want in life any more.

My partner and I have been together for 10 years. She's great and I love her very much. She has one younger brother who I've never gotten along with and it's starting to drive me crazy...

A little family context: Her mother died 2 years ago and their father abandoned them when they were young. The two of them are all that's left of their family. Naturally, they are extremely close, which is awesome. Strong family connections are fucking vital for a healthy heart and mind.

Here's the problem. My Brother in Law and I are total opposites. He loves sport (I'd rather code.) He loves going out 'with the boys' and getting smashed. (I'd rather renovate my bathroom.) He likes BMW's and living in a giant house (I'd rather live small and spend my money on holidays.)

My Brother in Law has been in my life for 10 years and my relationship with my girl is watertight. I really WANT her to maintain her relationship with her brother. I don't want to do anything to come between them, I mean, he's not a bad guy, he just has COMPLETELY different values to us.

I spend every family dinner fake smiling and pretending to laugh whilst he and his girlfriend talk about their new designer puppy, their desire to buy a new Audi....you get the idea. My GF and I are financially stable, so it's not jealousy on my part. We just spend our disposable income on different things to them, like holidays/experiences.

To make things worse, 

1. He and his GF will happily talk about themselves the entire time so it's hard to ask a leading personal question. (I've tried this route.)

2. My GF also likes his GF, and is constantly listening attentively to the both of them. Now, his GF is nice but Jesus! How many cars can you have girl? Talk about something that's legit and truly valuable!

I have tried to find out more about his/her interests over the years, but we honestly have NOTHING in common! Does anyone have any advice they can give me?

*As a extra bit of info, they will be having a baby soon. My GF and I are not into having kids, so this is gonna add a whole new dimension to my relationship issues with her bro. I'd love some tips on how to deal with this......

My goal since childhood was to be a lawyer but now I'm turned off by that idea. So I switched my major towards the end of my Sophomore year to Geology. I initially went to community college because I had no set in stone major plan \(no pun intended\) and also it's cheaper. Well, I transferred to University as a Geology major in January of this year and love my major, however the more I meet geologists and learn more about the industry and jobs, I find that the jobs don't seem appealing to me at all. They seem very boring and just not satisfying. So I started to dip my toes into Industrial Engineering now that I'm in University, and currently am taking some classes for that major along with my Geology classes. It seems pretty cool, however I wouldn't call it something I'm passionate about. I figure it'd be a good major that will help me land jobs that will eventually land me in a spot I want to be, it's better pay, and I like how there's a vast amount of industries I can get into making it very flexible \(I love this aspect because Geology is pretty specific which is another reason why I feel that I should switch\). However, the only thing turning me off from Industrial Engineering is the math. I know a lot of the math required for this degree will not be used on the job, however I'm unsure of my capabilities of passing these classes. Also I am very behind in math due to math class transfer issues \(that's a whole other story\). I passed Trigonometry in community college with a C, I worked my ass off and had a lot of tutoring and watched sooo many youtube videos. I worked harder than students that I was close friends with in my class who did the bare minimum and got an A. That class literally had me in tears with stress. I've always struggled in math since grade school, however I really don't like the Liberal Arts \(which is my strong suit\). I just don't know what to do.

153,"The antibiotics and natural supplements haven’t worked. It’s started to affect my heart and give me severe bone pain and migraines, among other things. 

My mother and I are looking into the intravenous antibiotic treatment administered for late-stage Lyme Disease, but it might not be available in Australia, because Lymes isn’t acknowledged in my country. We managed to find a doctor to do the necessary blood work and prescribe oral antibiotics, but I don’t think we’ll be as lucky finding a way to do the necessary 4-6 week intravenous treatment. 

We can’t afford to go to another country to have it done, so I’m pretty worried. Is there anything I should be aware of? Clinics that might do it in Australia? Questions I should ask the doctor? Alternative treatments? ",07May2018,3
154,"TL;DR I'm doing stuff in social media with a few others, we're just starting to earn money after having worked really hard for a couple of years. We're pretty big in my country and I don't know if I want to be known as *that woman from that vlog/blog*. Also it takes up a lot of my time and frequently wears me out completely due to the sheer amount of work and responsibility. I've stepped down as a leader of the group (just couldn't deal with the amount of work) and can either quit the whole thing completely or continue in a different role more in the background, but ofc then having to swallow the fact that I don't get to have a final say in things anymore and must do what the leader or group as a whole decides. We don't always agree on stuff, to say the least. 


For the past couple of years, I've spent a lot of time on a hobby related to social media. There are several of us running it* and, though we've had some people come and go, the majority of us have been at this together for about the same length of time. We chat every day and I consider them fairly close friends by now. I don't really have that many friends I see in real life so at least having people I can chat with is nice. 

* Think of *it* being a profile in social media that is more like a concept than a person, or perhaps the most like a small, independent TV channel. Our aim is to be a safe, chill haven in the midst of everything glossy and fake in social media, invite guests and professionals to speak or raise awareness of important topics etc. 


Now, to the issue at hand. This hobby has taken up a ridiculous amount of time. Everything is done on a voluntary basis and up until now, there hasn't been any money or income involved. We are now in the process of turning it into a small part-time business. I've been in a leading position for a good while and, while it has been both fun and challenging at times, it just sucks me dry. I've handed in my resignation for that position but I'm yet to decide whether to quit the entire project or stick around. 


I've invested a small amount of cash and can earn a little extra on the side, but I don't know if it's worth it anymore. Thoughts like ""but what if I leave now and the rest earns a ton of money only one year from now"" and ""this will look good on my resume"" make up the main portion of what's keeping me. The other reasons are my friends there and the fact that I do feel proud for having gotten this far, especially since I've really worked my arse off for us to get where we are. But motivation gets harder and harder to come by. I guess it's because I've given this so much for so long, and together with very demanding studies and a family life, it has certainly often felt more like a chore than fun. 


The product we're *selling* (think in the realms of influencer marketing) doesn't really interest me personally anymore but I can appreciate that other people find it valuable or interesting. I know that what we do (the majority of it is *not* the stuff we're selling, so non-commercial and for good causes etc) means a lot to many people, yet I feel like I've never been in the target group myself so I find it difficult to be over the moon about it all. I want to cut down on the time I spend on my phone and don't priorities watching things like these on YouTube/Snapchat/Facebook/Instagram etc. I'm trying to get excited about new projects and ideas but I simply can't, being completely burnt out right now. 


I'm also conflicted because my views on social media has changed over the past couple of years and I kind of think it's rather fake and staged, even though the message is empowering and real (in our case at least, as it's the entire point of the project). I used to think that sure, it's okay that I stage things a little in order to make a decent point, but the lines have started to blur. What's okay to stage and what's not okay? Is it most important to be authentic and real or to deliver quality content that people love? Thoughts like that. 


I'm holding on because I hope I'll find motivation and inspiration again. And because I want to keep being a part of this group of people. I wonder if I'm just blind to the obvious here, that I should drop it and just not look back? The others say they want me to stay and that I can get other things to do that's more in the background, so that I don't have to be a profile in social media anymore. I really don't want to be recognised as some sort of low-key ""famous"" person when I'm out and about, which is something that has happened to several of us several times by now. I have certain other, shall we say, hobbies that calls for a little bit of discretion. Nothing sinister, just that I would prefer to just be another face in the crowd.


I basically have to make a choice within a month or two and I don't know if I can't trust my judgement right now that I'm pretty exhausted and worn out after having reached a breaking point. It's happened before as well. History repeating, I guess. Gah. I hate having to make big decisions. I want to continue to be a part of the project I've worked so hard for taking to where it is today, yet I'm in despair because I'm so tired and overworked. As a final note, I can add that this will likely never be a full-time job for me, though some of the others dreams of it being that for them. I want to work with the stuff I'm studying for a degree in, and just keep this as an on-the-side thing. ",07May2018,1
155,"I've always been very fortunate in having a great relationship with my parents, primarily my mum. However there have been recent issues regarding my mental health and it has gotten to the point where she feels like I am no longer trying to help myself and if I don't start helping myself - I need to leave the house. 
This is a vastly unfair ultimatum and not one that I saw coming at all. (I have very recently gotten a job after being unfit for work due to my mental health and have started being able to go outside again after spending months having panic attacks at the thought of leaving my house)
Telling me to get better or leave has left me feeling worse than I have in months. I am back at rock bottom and am heavily suicidal but promised my mum and myself that I'd at least try until after summer and I start my second degree to see if it brings me any joy.  I now feel like I am totally unable to show any symptoms to my parents out of fear that I'll get kicked out and I definitely can't tell them how I am feeling. Problem is I am now back to panic attacks at the thought of going outside, human interaction is feeling impossible and I can't go more than a few hours without a panic attack over nothing at all. As I have just recently started working again, its going to take me 2-3 months to be able to save for a deposit for a flat but I genuinely don't think I'll make it 2-3 months at this rate. Honestly, I'm at a loss and I don't know where to go or what to do.

157,"My sister has never been the most stable person I know. For as long as I can remember, she was always screaming at our mother for something or another. Calling her stupid, unhelpful, annoying, and overbearing. This is just when she would help her with homework.

Growing up around her, I learned to stay away. I would keep myself occupied in my room, try my best to keep myself distanced from her. When she did focus on me, it was a 50/50 chance of nothing important, or some form of criticism about how I needed to ""get out more"", or ""hang out with her"", or just hug her. We had normal moments, of going to get ice cream, of talking about our parents, but I can recall far more where she just wanted to tell me how weird I was or vent about how ""awful"" our mother was.

Things came to a head last year. My sister, probably 24 at the time, had driven to our mother's house to say hello, or something along those lines. She apparently had been having a ""bad day"" though. So she exploded at our mother, as she always did. And my mom finally put her foot down to tell her to leave. She did, but not before driving and calling to visit me at campus, saying, ""mom hates me!"".

I let her visit, I try to talk her down, and figure somethings out. One, she bottled her feelings. That's why she would explode. Because something would crack the bottle, and everything would come pouring out. Second, when I brought up my roommate who suffered from depression, she acted in a way to say she felt those similar feelings, and likely also felt depressed.

But the biggest revelation I had over the coming weeks was that my sister believed our mother actually ruined her life. That our mother was the reason she had trouble making friends as a kid, that our mother was the reason our parents got divorced, that she was the one who pushed her so hard to get straight A's. None of this was true.

She was just reframing her memories. The lack of friends interpretation involved the time our mother had our family move when we were kids. This took my sister away from her friends in pre-school. Then, when she joined the swim team, she wasn't involved in the car pooling, blaming our mother for not getting along with the other mothers. Really, the other mothers didn't get along with ours, because they were staunch conservative women, and our mother is a very liberal person. Nothing our mother did would cross that gap. So, myth 1 debunked.

For the divorce, I have no idea where she got the interpretation she did. She claims that when our parents were in the room together, things were tense, that they shouted at each other. That our mother was somehow the instigator. I have talked to both of our parents about this, and neither remember this. In fact, our dad was very reclusive up to the divorce, hardly leaving his room. Kind of a dick move on his part, but whatever. Myth 2, debunked.

Finally, my sister drove herself crazy to get straight A's, not our mother. My sister is fiercely competitive. Starting in middle school, after finding out there were awards for good grades, she did everything she could to get them. Our mother could have cared less, she only wanted us to do what we could to be happy.

So, after all of this, I find out she is ""changing"". Our mother reports to me that she has improved. That she is getting ""better"". And that I should stop pushing her away. Because our mother honestly wants us to get along, because it tears her up inside to see us argue.

And I don't want to give her a chance. She is the most toxic person I have ever met in my life. The person who tore me down more than any bully on the playground, more than any asshole I have ever met in college. I don't care that she has ""changed"". Because I know the second we meet, she'll be bothered by everything about me. By the way I act, the way I think. She'll call me annoying, say I should stop being ""disrespectful"", and that I need to pick up on social cues more. This has how she has always treated me. I don't need that in my life. I don't need her in my life.

But I also know that if I approach her with this attitude, I'm not giving her a chance. I know all I'll do is bring out the worst in her with this attitude. That I will be the problem.

So I want advice on how to get past this. How to get past this intense dislike for my sister, to redefine our relationship so my mom won't be sad anymore when I argue with her at the dinner table",07May2018,1

I come in nearly every night to a fucking trainwreck. Trays for the coffee machines overflowing on to the counter, floor so sticky and black its disgusting, you get the picture. 

It wouldnt be a big problem if that was all they could do, but it definitely isnt. Ive had a coworker tell me to my face that he never sweeps and mops on his 2 nights covering my days off. The same guy told me he gets bored and just stands around, and the manager worked a second then told me he has no idea why the fuck these people act like they cant keep the store clean. 

Even though the manager knows, nothing is changing. Im getting fed up with this- I barely have time to finish my own work as it is, not do second shift's work as well.

160,"Hello everyone.
 I think I am experiencing bad anxiety. I think it's build up over the years due to my mom overly critiquing me on (most) things I do. Anyway, this upcoming week is my last week of college. However, I am not excited about graduation. I am not excited about the next phase which would be either interning or applying to grad schools; I'm anxious about what is going to happen next.

In addition, I've noticed myself become worrisome over my extended family coming to my graduation and learning that I have switched one of my concentrations (I'm a Liberal Arts major). My parents are somewhat aware but I do think they tend to brush it off so they may think otherwise. Besides that, I'm also anxious about my final exams, my projects and senior paper, respectively. Everything is happening so fast and it feels like it's out of my control. I haven't experienced since earlier last year. And to top it off, a girl that I've been interested in for awhile, who's very attracted to me, rejected me because she's moving away to attend another college.

I'm not sure how to properly deal with these emotions and quite frankly, I do not even want to attend my graduation. I'm not getting my diploma the day of and my mom has spent money on things that to me, don't make any sense to. My mom also wants to treat the guests to lunch, which due to my own anxiety and emotions, I tried to convince her not to go along with it. I've contemplated hurting myself in order to skip the ceremony and to avoid dealing with the next phase of my life. 

I'm honestly just overwhelmed and anxious about everything to the point where my stomach is in knots. I really don't know how to handle this.

At some moments, I'm fine but other times, I'm constantly overwhelmed and on edge that some of the smallest things tend to bother me. ",07May2018,1

163,"On a early Thursday morning, I was tossing and turning in my sleep, having a nightmare. In this nightmare, I was in my room. Suddenly, everything started to rattle.  Everything around me rattled and shook with increasing force until it came to a sudden halt. It was an earthquake.  Then came this urgent need to evacuate. (For refrence, the dream took place at my home, and I live on an island.). The quake stirred something deep in the earth and something was coming. I instantly assumed it was a tsunami. All I could remember feeling during that part of my nightmare was a huge rush of adrenaline as I tried to throw everything important in a bag and holding my cat, trying to figure out how the fuck I was going to do this and where to go. After packing to evacuate, I instantly transported to another ""scene"" in my nightmare, I was at the beach. I could remember holding my belongings and cat close to me as I looked at the ocean in fear, but alas there was no impending tsunami. The ocean was peaceful. No receding water, nothing. But the sense of dread never went away. The quake awoken something. In retrospect as I type this, it was like the narrator of my dream was trying to say ""No, this is not your source of fear. That is not what I'm telling you."" Suddenly, I jolted up out of bed, my cat laying right next to me the whole time. My heart was fucking pounding and I held him close as I calmed down to a rather abrupt way to start my day. Talked to my roommates and apparently while I was resting, there was a relatively small but noticeable earthquake. They showed me pictures of cracks beginning to form on the road in an area of our island that lays near an active volcano.  I didn't think much of it, as our volcano is very active. My fucking mistake, because the cracks ended up becoming fissures that began to spit out lava. 

Day two, I woke up to the worst migraine of my entire life. (I'm very sensitive to volcanic fumes, so I blame the volcano.)  While I'm resting in my room, a small rattling starts to gently shake my room. It's a quake of about 5.2 magnitude. The volcanic activity is increasing as more fissures open up and spit lava. A couple hours later a feel a small rattling again. Then a little more. And then HOLY SHIT IT'S A BIG FUCKING EARTHQUAKE. (Registered a 6.9) My first reaction was to grab my cat and huddle over him to protect him in case anything collapsed over us. We ended up being fine, but what in the actual fuck? My dream came true? In that moment I relived my dream. 

After that massive quake, the lava cracks and fissures increase exponentially in this area of our island. Eventually an evacuation of this area is called for and all nearby areas are being heavily monitored. As of right now, the lava has claimed 30 houses, while countless other empty evacuated houses are being looted. It's devastating. 

I just can't fucking believe I dreamed of the quake, the evacuation, and the threat of something caused as a result of/ by the quakes before it even happened although I didn't know what the threat was in my dream. I can promise you I never watched any news, read any articles, or anything of the sort that would subliminally creep into my head that would've caused me to dream of the earthquake and volcano - in fact that's why I remembered the dream so well, because it was so out of the blue for me.  What confuses me even more is that I'm quite a staunch atheist. I don't believe in anything supernatural, I don't look for coincidences, I even have a few science related tattoos, like an atom, a planet, and some geometry. Basically my point is I'd be the last person to claim having a ""vision from the future"".  So ummm, what the fuck? I'm so confused. I don't know who to talk to about this, or where to even start. I tried looking up coincidences like mine online, but every page I come across leads me to some hippie spiritual shit from people who sound like they're trying way too hard to make themselves seem like gifted messiahs.

169,"I'm a 27 year old male.
I was born into an incredibly dysfunctional family. Long and short of it: Dad was a pill popping drug addict who expected too much, mother was an emotionally manipulative coddler. I was caught in between. My dad so monopolized my childhood that my mother retired so she would have time with me (they were together, mind you). They fought wars over how to raise me and ultimately my mother's way prevailed, and in my father's words, he gave u on me when I was 14 or 15. Not because of anything I myself did, but because he was tired of fighting. He gave up interest on me as a person.

My dad is a man who dropped out of High School in 12th grade because from lack of attendance he didn't have enough credits to graduate, but when my sister (his stepdaughter) graduated high school, he refused to celebrate because she had to go to summer school which meant she ""didn't really graduate."" He rode her very hard and was very verbally abusive. He would get drunk and sometimes become very violent, once brandishing a butcher knife toward my sister while she held me.

When my sister would say to my mother let's leave him, my mother would pull emotional manipulation, ""But where would we go? And wouldn't you miss all your friends?"" very manipulative crap. My dad would do his thing for a week, my mom would be mad for two days and then the process would restart over again and again. When I was a child when my mother had too much she would run away for a week say but leave me behind.

When I was in HS I wasn't a bad kid. I didn't get in really much trouble. I wasn't like my parents - not a truant. I had subpar C grades and because of that, my father treated me like I was the scum of the earth, verbally crushing my self esteem. It got to the point I would have to hide my report cards. Meanwhile, his HS grades were in the D range. The more I got screamed at and called names, the lower the grades went - it wasn't spite.

My sisters (I have 2 half sisters from a different father who are 17 and 18 years older than me) sort of removed themselves. I am their brother but I am also my father's son, you get me? They never knew their own father but I came part and parcel of my parents' dysfunction and they removed themselves from me as such. So did my parents' family (both of my parents were the black sheep of their families). I think the assumption was because I came from them, I must be like them.

As it stands, I have one living grandfather and one living grandmother whom I have no real relationship with. A sporadic relationship with cousins. A relationship with one of my sisters where we can't talk about older things.

But I'm obsessed with the past. Finding out where it went all wrong. I watch our 2 hour long home movies and see all these smiles and see everyone getting along and wonder why it couldn't just be like this all the time? Why'd all this love have to go to sleep?

I (consciously) emulate my father in terms of aesthetics and I don't know why. I have a fascination with my parents' generation and that era - the 1950s-1960s before JFK got killed and the Hippies (both of my parents were essentially self-absorbed pseudo-Hippie types) and just want to collect as many family photos of that time as I can cause I feel like it'd give me something to hold onto, even if it's something I never experienced - a happier time.

I never really had a crush when I was in middle school... I have a senior who lives in the same Condominium as I do. He was in the same middle school as I am and I would see him when I am on my way to school. I get a weird feeling when I see him. I don't know why... When he graduated from middle school, I never seen him since then. I did see him once when I came to school early though...

Now, I am in an all girls high school. I found out that he was in an all boys high school... The schools we are in are really far from where we live. I have to wake up at 5 am (T^T) everyday to get ready for school. When I get out of the house and wait for my bus, I would sometimes see him at the same bus stop as mine, waiting for his bus. Whenever I see him... I start getting that weird feeling... I start trembling and my heart beats faster. I just want to get closer to him.. It feels stupid thinking all this. I told my closest friend about this. She said I had a crush on him? But it could be fear... Since I keep trembling like I am in fear. Fear or like? Help! :/

Whenever I see his face, My face starts burning. Sometimes when I see him pass by, he would either look very fierce or nice and chill. I really want to talk to him. The problem is that others told me that his school hates my school for some reason. This makes me afraid of talking to him. I don't really know if I like him. So for now, I just want to be friends.

176,"I am currently studying Accounting, this is my first day back from a period of exclusion. I have been smashing it in terms of the homework and the understanding of the units, but I have mucked up the two exams I had so far. 

For Law, my handwriting was kind of bad and I might not have gone into enough detail, but I get the marks back tomorrow. (My exam was part of a random selection of papers to be marked twice, for the sake of accuracy, so I get it late). 

For Bookkeeping, I very much understood the topics, but I rushed through it, and made mistakes in my formatting. It looked ugly and I thought it wasn't good enough, so I crossed it out and redid it, and ran out of space and time. After that, I had a mid-semester break.

Someone in my class, who had done this unit before, said that after the mid-semester break, the topics become incomprehensibly hard, unrecognisable from the topics we have done so far. That scared the shit out of me, so I emailed my teacher. 

He's a decent bloke, but he wasn't particularly helpful in this case, he said ""of course the topics get harder, that is the nature of studying at this level."" ""Guess what, study harder."" 

I just feel really guilty for not taking advantage of the easy marks when they were available, especially because I am aiming for HDs this semester. I just had a look at the lecture for this week, and it doesn't look that bad, but still, I can't quite get over the sense that I am about to experience a decline.

178,"Hi Reddit... I never thought this would be my first post. Well, let's start from the beginning. February 2017, this guy messaged me on an anonymous app which has since been deleted (Candid) and we talked for around 6 months. I was at a low point in life; family issues. I took comfort in this guy I guess and we would talk to each other very lovingly and definitely as a more-than-friends-but-not-together kind of way. He would also send dick pics (nothing in return from me). Anyway, he would talk to other girls and I didn't like that so I left him. Flash forward 10 months later (today) he messaged me. He had my phone number, I know that. I had blocked him. That means he changed his phone number possibly in order to contact me. Me being a dumbass, responded. He said he wanted to be friends with me (why wait 10 months and go through all that trouble? I thought I made it clear I didn't want to have anything to do with him before). He kept bringing up the past, calling me insecure and attempting to, in his words. 'counsel me'. I made it clear that I didn't like that. I did lash out at him too, many times. I ended up blocking his number again. 

I should mention that I'm a 16 year old Australian female and he's an almost 30 year old American. I did not know his exact age in those 6 months, and based on how he acts no one could blame me for thinking he was 18-20. 

I'm not comfortable with that age gap, friendship or relationship. He has said to do stuff that makes me uncomfortable in the past too. I'm very scared of him, and never want him to contact me again. 

I want to be sure he can't contact me, but I cannot change my phone number without being questioned. I could use anything from comfort to advice or any steps from here I should take. I'm scared and don't think I deserve this because he's an adult and I'm a minor. 

Thanks in advance. ",07May2018,3

I usually have bad thoughts about losing my girlfriend or everything that I've, as well as stupid bad thoughts about smaller things.

We could've choose another city that I was really curious to see an I'm sure is worth seeing because my girlfriend went there recently and liked it. For some reasons it didn't come to my mind when we were chasing what to do and so we ended up having this bad weekend. It's been 2 days and I can't stop thinking about it.

I am in a science but not engineering major, and I applied to over 70 internship positions and got none. My gpa is not good, probably average at best, and because I've had some mental issues going on, it kept slipping this entire year. I don't know if I'm smart enough to go to grad school.

188,"Hey reddit. So I just got in a huge fight with my father because of the most ridiculous thing... and this used to happen a lot.. For a while I’ve look past all the fucked up things in our relationship and just said “that’s how he is” but I’m fucking exhausted. Here’s the backstory I guess. My dad is American and my mom is foreign. When I was little my mom moved me to her foreign country for three years so I forgot who he was. This caused me to be distant towards him in my early childhood which made him angry and started our bad relationship. Then in my pre teens he started taking his anger out on me and hitting me when he was angry or breaking doors and smashing things and calling me names. This messed me up for a long time and I told multiple family members who didn’t really care to do anything.. and it went on. I’d get into fights with him about why he hit me and he would say something like “You make me do it” or “I love you but I dislike you” or “If you push my buttons I’m going to have to kill you” (he literally said that to me). I started self harming and he said I was trying to emotionally manipulate him. Every time me and him get into a fight he pulls the “I won’t be manipulated by you” or “I won’t be bullied by my own daughter”. Yep, a 260 pound year old man who hits his kid is being bullied by his daughter. I ended up needing a medication later on and he felt bad and stopped hitting me, but our huge over the top arguments remained. He has anger problems and would scream at me over the most ridiculous things (almost always food.. how I ate too much of the salad, etc.) I wouldn’t talk to him for months at a time because I was away with my mother in a different state/country. When I had to live with him again I realized fighting with him was pointless and I let him have his little fits and I let him say mean things about me to other members of the family. He often says mean comments about my looks. He told my mom “She definitely has more Neanderthal in her than me and you, No neck.” And him and my mom call me hobbit and then question why I tell them not to take pictures of me. I just get rip a piece of paper and ignore it. But for the past year he’s been uncaring about the medication that I need. This medication changes my entire body and going too long without it results in all sorts of hormonal imbalances. I can’t schedule any appointments or talk to any doctors without him (my mom refuses to do it). And he’s always lazy about it. I was supposed to get my meds in September... and I still haven’t gotten them. That’s how lazy he is about getting my meds and it’s messing me up mentally. He always says he will call the doctor tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and he’s mad when I ask. Today he pulled that... I said “why didn’t you call yesterday?” “Because it was Saturday.”  “But you said you would call” and then he says “what do you want me to do about it now? I’ll call on Monday”... I just ignored it. And what makes me angry is that he goes and tells all my other family members I’m not “thankful” enough that he gets me my medication. I ignored it.. but it was building up. It’s been nearly ten months since I was supposed to have my last shot.... and all of the horrible shit he’s done to me has been building up in my head every time I hear him say shitty things about me to other family members... My dad bought four bags of salad as groceries. That’s all I have to eat, so I ate some of a bag..... and thirty minutes later... upstairs I hear him screaming about how terrible I am because I picked the salad apart... and something in my mind just clicked... next thing I know I’m upstairs screaming at him... we’re in a ridiculous argument about salad (even when there is four bags of it). And I was done with his bullshit when he pulled the “you’re bullying me” I can’t fucking believe he pulled that. I needed to see a counselor because of him hitting me and (although she knew) she told me not to disclose to her who has hitting me because she would have to call the police if I did... and I’m the fucking bully. I guess I should be more grateful, I get food and shelter. I feel guilty for being upset when I know there are kids starving in the streets but.... I just can’t deal with him. He’s been like this all my life long. And I haven’t taken my medicine in months and it’s fucking with my head and my body. When I told my other family members they all said I WAS THE ONE that needed to compromise and move on. But I fucking can’t it’s constant.....

Two weeks ago on Thursday I placed an order for some (quite expensive) Puma sneakers and chose their UPS Express delivery method. They should have been here by Friday.

A week went by and I was calling both of them almost every day, I asked if I could cancel my order and get a refund, Puma then put me in contact with their shipping department.

They called me again two days after that to inform me that an investigation is to be started with UPS because they still have no clue what the hell happened to my parcel.

215,"Allright, so I've been in a relationship with a lovely person for 3 years now. I love him very much.
But here's the thing; for some reason when we talk about relationships he always brings up that he thinks that I will commit suicide if he broke up with me.
I always reassure him with ""Babe no, I would be extremely sad yes but I wouldn't want to die"" after which he usually responds with ""nah you would.""
I have heard of people threatening with suicide if their partners break up with them but here it's the other way around? I don't know how to deal with it or what to make of it.

All I wanna do is to go on with my life, improve what has to be improved, eat healthy (I mean eat just right not perfectly, exercise, and yea read a book while having coffee or whatever hot in a cup on a sunset.

220,"To try and cut a long story short I need everyone’s advice who can help me here... it’s sort of a cry for help. Also bare with me as I’ve written this on my phone.

So I moved to university and got into a relationship with a girl on my course and who lived in the same accommodation flat as me. We was going well for a few weeks to a month. Before more and more fights started happening pretty much 1-3 times a week easily, to a point I could only remember the bad and not the good.
All my flat mates used to tell me that I’m too good for her and I go above and beyond for her everyday without hesitation and she doesn’t appreciate it. We dated from September/January so about 4 months and then we broke up due to more major fights. She never really had any proper friends or did she get on well with anyone but me on the course and in the flat. She left and moved out of accommodation and university.

Now in the middle of April she got back into contact with me and said she missed me and we decided to talk again after 3 months of no contact. But we couldn’t agree on giving it another shot or being friends and clearly feelings got involved again and being physical caused us to argue about where we are heading. She used to say we will most likely only be friends and that we probably won’t get back together because it was hard. But still is intimate with me and goes on meals with me and stays over night. We had a huge fight because I felt i was being played with emotionally and physically. Now we are not talking on a level again and are pretty much keeping things civil we are not hanging out or talking like we was before. 

My problem is I don’t know what to do, because Even though she’s bad for me and each other I miss her like crazy and I want her to be mine but we can’t work when are together we’re too stubborn and fight easily and drag on fights for longer than we should. 

P.S I’m moving back home tomorrow which is 2 hours away from uni and her and I’m coming back to the same uni In September to study something else. 

Can anyone please help me out with any advice or what to do it nearly killed me losing her the first time how do I recover this time and do I keep talking to her civilly and hope something comes from it? 

I will reply to everyone to offers any advice or more questions!

Thank you all! ",07May2018,1

I find myself frequently starting up a hobby going at it feverently then tapering off in my motivation to keep it up. It's not that I don't want to go to it anymore but when faced with the actual process of getting ready and going I make lots of excuses and end up skipping it. Then I feel guilty for essentially staying at home and doing nothing instead of being active.

On a day to day basis I often find myself not fully finishing tasks before I start another one. Or when people are talking to me I struggle to listen to them if they don't maintain brevity.

The last month or so, Because of the improving weather, I’ve been riding my bike and not the bus. Lately, she’s been calling my phone multiple times a day. I’ve answered a few times and it’s always the same: “I never see you! Are you ok?” A few days ago, she showed up to my home and knocked on my door for 10 minutes when I wasn’t home. My landlord, who lives in the basement, had to tell her to leave because her behavior was disturbing the other tenant. I’m actively avoiding her now because I really need my space. I appreciate her kindness and I want to continue a casual friendship but I feel like she’s becoming very clingy. I’ve told her several times that I ride my bike a lot and that I’m fine.

224," Hey. So this quarter is definitely my hardest academically out of my first year of college; taking my first upper\-divs and some dense CS classes. Sleep's at an all\-time low. And I took on a position as a content developer in a student org that is sucking up a lot more time than I anticipated.

I am hesitant on dropping one of my classes since most are prerequisites to the more advanced courses in my major, and I don't want to delay those. So, I'm considering withdrawing from my role in the org instead.

However, being that I'm working as a developer in a team of 4, withdrawing can be relatively detrimental to the team, and would likely degrade reputation with the org's leaders. And I'm also not sure on how to even approach them with this decision considering that I was very persistent in taking on this role.

Any advice would be appreciated.

225,"My husband and I were invited to his cousin's destination wedding which is 5 hours away. Hotels are at a minimum $350+ night and 95% booked during peak season (It's Newport). My husband's mother-in-law assumes she will be sharing a hotel room with us without really asking. ""I just need a shower and somewhere to sleep!""

Background: MIL has no disposable income and can barely pay her bills due to retiring early because she felt like it. My husband and I don't have much money ourselves and rarely go on vacation. We haven't taken a vacation of any kind (not even a long weekend) in over 18 months due to work obligations and my husband starting his own business.

228,"To explain my situation I am 15 years old and a sophomore in high school, on April 17 2018 I wrote a five paragraph essay for my friend and in exchange for this essay I was to receive a cannabis oil pen. I started working on the paper on Tuesday night and then went back over Wednesday and finished it that night. I spend the night and go home Thursday night. I receive no updates from my friend about the oil pen he says “my mom has to go to the dispensary” and I patiently wait the whole weekend. Another whole week goes by and at this point I’m getting pissed. I get it about two weeks after I wrote the paper or Thursday, may third. Friday, may fourth I go back to the same friends like I normally do on the weekend. After a few hours the power goes out and everyone is outside but I’m high and feeling a bit sick so I stay inside to listen to music and hit my new oil pen. I threw up hours prior to this because of a slushie from McDonald’s. Apparently I look dead and am super pale. My friends start getting on my nerves making fun of me saying I’m dying and other rude stuff. So I go outside to hang out and my friend decide to “take my oil pen” because “I’m abusing it”. So I’m pissed and I go home Friday night without my dab pen and my friend promised to bring me it first thing Saturday morning, this doesn’t happen. So Sunday comes around and I’m still without my oil pen I ask for it back repeatedly and the response I get is no. So I decide to steal his Snapchat until my oil pen is returned. He shows up at my house and threatens to give my mom the oil pen if I don’t give the Snapchat back, me being smarter I gave it back and he didn’t know I already was a step ahead and had access to the email. It’s currently Monday and I still don’t have it back. I’m not sure what to do to get it back he had his phone connected to Snapchat so he was eventually able to change emails on the account. My question is should I go to his mom and tell her the situation or should I just wait it out and see if he gives it back.

229,"About a month ago I arrived in Tokyo for a 3 month program abroad here. My only reservation in coming was, what do I do if one of my grandparents (who I am incredibly close with) gets sick during my time abroad. I thought about this months ago, but decided I was being too worrisome, since they were both in seemingly great health at the time. Both are very smart, and very capable, and lived alone, so I was able to convince myself that the possibility something happens while I'm gone in minuscule. Well, as the title suggests, about a week and a half ago, my dad called me, and informed me that my grandpa (who, next to my parents is undoubtedly the closest person to me) is in the hospital after having had a stroke. They found a mass in his brain that had been there for about years, and he had told nobody about. He's recently been getting worse, and it's not looking hopeful. I just don't know what to do, it feels so helpless being about as far away from home as I possibly can be, and knowing what's going on there.

230,"So, long story short, I slept with one of my flatmates a few times the past month, we were kind of seeing eachother I suppose but it was very non-serious sort of early days.

Anyway, she's one for drunk texting and she was away for the weekend, drunk in a club and texting me. Essentially, she very nonchalantly mentioned amidst a jokey conversation that she ""isn't gonna keep it,"" at which point my stomach obviously fucking turned. I asked what she meant and she said ""the baby lol,"" so I was like ""what do you mean? are you serious? are you actually pregnant?"" and she was just saying ""forget it, I didn't mean to say anything."" From there our conversation really went in circles but the summary of it was that I said obviously I'd be there for her regardless of what she wants to do and of course the decision is hers but that I felt she ought to keep me in the loop and just be open with me about it. Essentialy she just kept repeating ""forget about it,"" ""it's nothing,"" and ""it's got nothing to do with you,"".

This morning she's said more or less the same and seems more stressed about whether I'm annoyed with her or not, which I keep reiterating I'm not, I just want her to let me know what's going on. She comes home this evening and I said I wanted to see her to talk about it and she just keeps saying ""it's so awkward, don't worry about it, it's none of your business.""

239,"So to start, I do a lot of care for him, so I'm involved in his life. My previous posts have info on that jazz. Brother is going on 13 years old. He is partially incontinent and needs diapers. He has a stroller and a car seat he uses sometimes, because he has posture and balance issues. He has muscular problems, which also hinders digestion and his burping muscles (which is a necessary detail). He's medium or high functioning, autistic and limbic disability. He's dependent but he walks and talks well and understands things and he is at the level of a 1-4 year old for the most part. I have partial care over him (like a ward status). We have family issues, and it's mostly through court, my mom has overall custody of him (compared to a recently methhead father, other abusive family). She takes him to the doctor and provides for him and technically does what is needed when she has him. But, she's a just-no. She enforces, she doesn't allow room for what he *can* do, she treats him like a baby or pet that his disability makes him out to be. She has her own severe issues, she has mommy issues and OCD  (impulsiveness). I'm trying to get things sorted and I'm slowly getting things figured out, so some general advice on how to deal with my mom is welcome (other than ""do something now""). This is mostly to vent to keep me on my feet, and to see what you think here. 

Our mom will treat him like a baby, or like a little pet. I don't know where to start. 

He will sit in a diaper or in pajamas all day. If he's not with me, he doesn't know what actual clothing is. She'll take him out places, like grocery shopping, in his character pajamas with no shoes. 

Almost all day, she'll lay in her recliner watching TV, and hold him on top of her. He likes it, he is small, and she's on the much heavier side, so she's warm and snuggly. She will lay with him on top of her or at her shoulder, and rub/pat his back until he burps, or pat his butt until he falls asleep. Or she'll feed him candy and pudding and whatever else she snacks on. If she needs to do stuff, she buckles him in his special needs seat in the kitchen or in front of the TV. (He can sit and walk and play on his own. His buckling seat is for long term sitting, due to his posture and balance, btw,)

She won't make him walk when he's able to, she'll keep him in his stroller or in the shopping cart. He'll miss a lot of school, unless she's allowed to monitor or participate  (he's in a special BD class so it's often). He goes to motor gym, which is basically a free gym indoor park where he can play for motor skills. She is helicopter as crap there, he doesn't climb anything or talk to people he doesnt know or disciver things on his own. Everytime she takes him to the doctor or chiropractor, she'll hold his hand and demand to stay near him. When I take him, he'll crap bricks if I don't stay near. He'll whine for her in the middle of the night, and she'll put him in her bed or rub him to sleep. He has a drool problem, he drools up food in his throat or he'll drool excess saliva and sometimes can't keep his whole tongue in his mouth; she made cloths for her shoulder and calls them burp cloths.

She'll take him for a car ride to get some fast food or to the bakery for cookies, whenever he sees an ad on TV or says ""Momma I want ____"". She doesn't have any meal to herself, she will feed him at least 1/3 of it. She'll make good meals, he'll eat what he needs. But she'll feed him every bite. Currently with me or his school teacher, he'll feed himself a bite then we'll feed him one and we'll take turns like a feeding game to practice eating. Mom will feed him every bite, all he has to do is open mouth. 

If he throws a fit when I'm watching him, and he breaks a toy, she'll just buy a new one (I think she has duplicates of everything in case it breaks or he breaks it).
She'll defend his bad behavior. When he throws something, she'll tell me ""he doesn't know what to do so he throws it"". When he whines, she'll tell me ""Well he just wants something. He's probably hungry."" 

He can sometimes use bathroom with help. He knows flushing and washing hands. But sometimes, as I said he's incontinent with kidney problems, and he can't hold it or can't recognize the sudden urge to go. With mom, he'll use diaper as a toilet, he'll use it even when he can control it, and she'll happily change him all day. 

He has a medic pro pacifier for bruxism. And he's autistic, he has sensory issues, and needs stimulation to soothe. He'll suck his thumb or knuckles when he doesn't have the pacifier, as he's learning to self soothe and control. She'll say ""we can't have that thumbsucking"" and she'll divert him to the pacifier or a toy.  

She does have her good moments, her antiJNM moments, and has been helpful as a parent. But otherwise, JNM alert. Red afuckinglert. This is all I can say for now, maybe I forgot something, but you know the deal.

240,"It's 8 a.m. as I write this and I've been at work for about an hr, I woke up at 6 a.m. and started crying as soon as my alarm went off because I was dreading going to work. Now I work from home which people might think is a really great thing but honestly it's just killing me physically and mentally and I really don't know what to do. 

The obvious thing would be to quit but if I quit then I'd have no way to help pay the bills. My husband and I both work full-time and we still have trouble affording groceries some weeks. Unfortunately in the area I live in there's not many jobs so even though my husband has many certifications and has spent years in college getting them, they really mean nothing to the company's where we live but we also cannot move so we're kind of just stuck. 

I hate to make it seem like I'm just making a bunch of excuses but it's really just how it is. We only have one car and I cannot drive so I'm the one that's stuck at home. We don't live anywhere near public transportation or any places I could work within walking distance so that's why I chose the stay-at-home job. We really rely on my paycheck to pay rent at the first of the month so like I said quitting is not an option at all.

I also chose a stay-at-home job due to my stepson we share 50/50 custody (which is also the reason we cannot move.) but while he's in school we only get him on the weekends but during the summer we're going to have him all the time so I really can't work out of the home because we wouldn't have a sitter. I feel completely screwed. 

The reason why I say I think it's failing my marriage is because all I can do is cry about it, and like I know it's not my husband's fault but it's almost like I want to blame him for me having to work if that makes sense and I know it's not fair to think that way.  now my husband's a very kind man so he understands and he doesn't get mad at me or angry but he also just doesn't know what to say of course because his job alone cannot support us. 

I feel so stuck. I text my mother this morning that I would rather just not wake up than have to continue working. I work for 10 hours a day and sit in most of that time and it's been really killing my legs, I tried to stand but my computer is quite large and any stand-up desk that I found that is within our price range it won't work size-wise. I've had cramps in my legs every single day I wake up with them cramping and it is the most painful thing I've ever felt. I've stopped drinking soda and only drink water I have changed my eating habits to help out with them but nothing seems to be working. 

Honestly I'm sure it just sounds like a bunch of excuses and I don't really know what else to put here I guess I just may be needed to get it off my chest, I had made a post before on r/confessions about having no will to live and I really thought I was depressed and hated my life but it's just my job making me want to die.

I'd be going pretty much alone, so no more scientific talk with my friends, no extreme networking, and no social pressure pushing me to do more, which is a good and bad thing. I'm also worried that I won't be able to find more like minded people there.

  


There are a ton of amazing retired smart people in that city, but few people my age are entrepeneurs that have actually done well so soon and want to go live somewhere quiet, beautiful, and away from social drama. I've met a few people my age there and know friends who lived there for a while and, even though it's not a good sample, I can kinda tell that I'd have a hard time finding people that are really smart and hard working or have ""grater than themselves"" aspirations. At the very least my work partner already moved there but he's married and has 2 kids.

  


Has anyone else experienced something like this? Will my need of social interaction with people that work towards amazing goals and fight for them overcome my want for living in an amazing place? My current hometown is extremely big, traffic, pollution, insecurity, and it's a desert so not much to see other than industrial buildings. I also hate the pompuos ""I'm better and richer than everyone"" attitude of most people here, and I'm usually a loner and introverted. But the few friends I have (which I wont lose obviously, I just wont interact with them as closely) are amazing hard working people that push me for more. Should I just be more self conscious and grab more strength to do more from within and not to have my friends pick me up as much? Thanks and sorry for the long post",07May2018,0
243,"So, basically my roommate and I get along well for the most part. My roommate has been tagging along fishing with me on some occasions. He is a beginner and up until a week ago, he never caught a fish. I am a 23 y/o male and he is a 26 y/o male. 

I strive to not be a dick in life, but there's one thing irking me. My roommate is a bit wimpy when it comes to handling fish/worms etcetera. He won't kill any bugs in the house, stuff like that.

So, last week we were fishing and he finally caught his first fish. I think it was like an 8-inch walleye, so nothing huge. I told him I would show him how to handle the fish and remove the hook. So, he glady sat back and watched the process. I could not even get him to pick the fish up, at the end he picked it up with his finger tips and dropped it in the water. But, it was painful to watch. 

Now, I don't mind him coming along in the future. I just want to make sure that he is able to learn to remove hooks and handle fish by himself, so I don't have to baby him. I don't want him scared to remove hooks and having these fish die from his lack of ability. I also don't want to resort to saying something rude like, "" quit being a pussy.""

244,"I'm only in my mid 20s but for a while (last 2 years approximately) I've felt like I'm getting old or life is losing its appeal. Mainly I've been pretty desinterested in my day-to-day life. Stuff is just boring. There's nothing really going wrong but I just don't feel any excitement or passion for anything. 

I feel like as a teen and very young adult there was much more stuff going on in my life. Everything was more spontaneous, for example I would just randomly go partying with coworkers on a Friday after work if we felt like it. Now as people are getting older, that just doesn't happen anymore, everybody has a family and goes home immediately. People talk about their houses and how their last vacation sucked because their kid caused trouble. 

It just feels like life has become slower and less intense and I wonder if I'm depressed, doing something wrong with my life, or maybe this is a common thing when getting 'older'. I'd love some opinions from you guys.",07May2018,10

My name is Rokas. I am 18 years old, from Lithuania. And i have decided to try to find a girlfriend. I have tried for 6 months and failed with each one \(8 times\), i have almost given up at this point. 

After a few weeks my friend recommended me a girl to add on facebook, we don't know each other, we haven't met once. She was cute, i fell in love with her right there \(i guess i am that desperate lol\), but when the time came and she accepted my request i was trapped, i didn't know what to text her firstly and secondly i was afraid of being rejected for the 9th time, it would have been the final blow for me. I would like to ask you for some help on how should i start and keep a conversation with her, impress her, look like a kind person \(which i am irl\) and not end up making a fool of myself. I am not looking for a girl just to look cool, im looking so i would be happy as a person. Im really hoping for a good turnout. 

Thank you very much for the help,

247,"Some context first, my last relationship ended about 6 months ago, was already not feeling too happy/confident before it happened but afterwards there was pretty much nothing left of my self esteem. The past 3-4 months I've started exercising regularly, eating sort of healthy and stopped smoking after picking up the habit again when I got dumped. University work has suffered a bit, but nothing mayor, since I've always had it kind of easy, and got a lot of extra credits in my first two years.

So I've basically been taking it easy for about 6 months now, I don't need a lot more credits for my bachelor's (undergrad in US?) degree save for some 'free' classes and my thesis. The problems I'm facing right now are the following, and I could really use some advice on how to go about doing something about it. I still exercise regularly but that's about the only productive thing I do lately. Problems:

1. tired/low motivation: I used to be a pretty hard worker but I can't seem to pick up the pace lately, which I really need to do in order to finish my thesis in time. The thing is, I have no idea what masters (graduate?) program I would like to pursue yet, and I have been toying with the idea of taking a gap year, working the first half and travelling the second half. I have a pretty good job at the university but I can't work there if I don't study there, so a delay in my thesis would make this plan sort of easier. College is not too expensive here so I would still make a 'profit', plus I can loan interest free as a student.

2. thinking about relationships and how to get a new girlfriend/move on from my ex: every time I meet a new girl I immediately think about whether I could/would date her, I obsess over the idea of never finding someone I liked as much as my ex again, there's like 3 girls I'd consider dating but no idea how to go about it, and the idea of sleeping with someone who is not my ex somehow makes me feel kind of uncomfortable. This used to not really be a problem for me, these things used to sort of happen, but nothing has really happened in this aspect of my life lately.

3. low confidence: everything I do to increase my confidence makes me feel like a phony. I've started trying to dress fashionably, my friends are all pretty hip/alternative people and I used to dress pretty modestly, but now I try a bit harder to develop my own fashion style. I like doing it but sometimes it feels like I'm kidding myself. The same goes for music, I've been listening to hiphop lately which I really enjoy but somehow I feel like I'm not 'cool' enough to be listening to the likes of odd future, tyler the creator, donald glover etc, I usually listen to more indie/alternative pop/rock music like beach house, yo la tengo. Even exercising feels kind of stupid, I feel like a skinny nerd in the gym. I'm also super anxious about going bald lately, my hairline is sort of receding at the temples, which seems pretty normal, I see a lot of guys that have this, but I'm scared other people see it more than I do, which is probably bullshit but still worrying, can't seem to stop checking myself in the mirror. Also worrying that this might be the reason I haven't been approached by girls recently.

My main problem is that everything I do somehow makes me cringe. Even as I am reviewing this post I'm sort of cringing at myself. I'm pretty anxious about being a cringy person. My main question I think boils down to this: how can I be more comfortable with myself again? This post turned into quite a rant, probably useful to include a:

255,"I must look decent on paper. If I apply for a job, I most cases get a phone interview or whatever their initial interview is. But somewhere along their I just blow it.

I know the market can be tough, but it has happened so many times it can't be that someone else always did slightly better or will take slightly less money.

I'm talking years and dozens of interviews. Occasionally I walk out and smack myself in the face because I realize I've done something boneheaded, but sometimes I think I've done great and I get a rejection. At least half of the rejections I get say that they aren't moving forward with the position any longer, so I can't even ask for feedback as to why I didn't get the job, but then without fail I checked LinkedIn and they hired someone else. 

A few months ago a company I had done some business with contacted me. Pursued me, brought me in for several interviews, made a very casual verbal offer, asked when I could start, had me meet nearly everyone there, and then I never heard from them again. I'm quite sure these things happen, but it just KEEPS happening to me I have to think that I'm the common denominator. I send a polite and not demanding follow up email, and usually it's ignored. 

Am I horrible? I think I'm confident yet modest, I can sometimes be way too chatty but I have really worked on that and I'm more precise with my words, I try to be funny but not make anyone laugh (like a light humor not joke telling).

“I haven’t been honest with the both of you. In part because I find it difficult to talk to you in person or on the phone about things I struggle with.

I believe it was a mistake to go back to school while not on a stable treatment plan; dealing with the transitional effects from starting various medications and the withdrawal effects from stopping them has made this past semester very difficult. So difficult that I am unsure which if any of the classes I took I will receive a passing grade for.

I know that this is on me, and while the effects mentioned before might have made things more difficult the fault is ultimately my own. 

I’m unsure if you two will continue to support my pursuit of college given this failing, and I understand if you do not. If you do I know I am not ready to go back at this moment in time. 

I believe the best course of action for me currently is to continue seeking a stable treatment plan and working on communication between us.”",07May2018,1

I’ve been with my partner for just over a year. We live together and for the most part, we have a great time together. I met him not long after I moved to this city and we spent some time as friends before establishing a relationship. 

As we were friends for a while, I was always aware of his past. He has a son from a previous relationship when he was 19 and has a history of drug abuse and mental health issues. His son is now 7 years old and my partner has had scattered contact with him throughout his life. I have always been very encouraging of him having a better arrangement with his son and his ex.

He was denied any sort of custody agreement for years as his ex believed his mental health issues made it impossible for him to be in their lives. He is however more settled these days and has been allowed to send letters and Skype chat etc. He was also planning a visit and saving up money in order to arrange a more permanent custody agreement via a solicitor. 

Over the last few days this has crumbled though and a lot of this is due to my partner sabotaging himself. It’s as if he knows the correct way to act but does the opposite as he’s convinced it isn’t going to work anyway.  This has lead to him drinking more, refusing to communicate and he’s unwilling to talk anything over. The issue I’m having is this is starting to negatively affect my mental health and I worry that I’ve got myself into trying to fix someone and I’m aware that’s a pretty impossible task.

Basically, I don’t have the experience in my life to deal with these issues. I have a man who isn’t willing to get help, is dealing with severe depression and anxiety issues and has a tendency to try and sabotage himself at every turn. I want nothing more than for him to be happy but it’s fucking with my own happiness. I took today away from work as even though he asked me to leave him alone, I felt so anxious and worried about leaving him that I couldn’t get past my own front door. I have considered discussing this with my friends but they are already disapproving of this relationship.

Thanks in advance.

261,"So I want to preface this post by saying that I hate airing my dirty laundry in front of others. I usually keep the things that bother me to myself and I try and either deal with them or fix them myself. My girlfriend even comments often that I don't talk to her enough about my problems, though I am getting better. I say this because it's hard for me to share such private things about my family online, but I really need unbiased advice. Now, enough of my rambling.

I'll start with my mother. I love my mum but for the past few years she has been drinking a lot and whenever she drinks it's always to excess. She often finishes two bottles of sparkling wine in a night, all by herself. Usually when this happens it's very late at night and everyone else is trying to sleep. She will often start crying and when my father tries to calm her down she get's angry. 
For a bit of background; my mum is a nurse and she works the night shift to help us be more financially stable. On top of working nights she does most of the housework minus the cooking (done by myself) and the dishes. She is, in my humble opinnion, the rock of the family. But, having said that, she can't handle the stress of working nights (and thus not getting enough sleep), dealing with work related drama and then coming home to take care of the housework on her days off. She tells me that her drinking is her way of relaxing but all it does is make her angry, sad and resentful. I hate seeing her like this but she refuses to stop even after my brother, father and I started picking up more responsibilities around the house. I'm worried she has become alcoholic and is more than likely depressed. 

Now my brother. My brother is two years younger than me but at 18 and 20 that's not a huge difference. He is violent. He has a very short fuse and blows up in anger over the smallest things. He never lets anyone just walk away from an argument and he constantly plays the victim. He has on multiple occaisions attacked me without any physical confrontation to set him off. Once he punched me and knocked me to the ground in an attempt to prevent me from leaving the house. He has been to see a psychologist but it hasn't helped. He also often acts entitled to the house and it's contents, as though he were the adult of the house. He sometimes berrates my parents and I for ""not thinking of others"" for doing something that only causes him a mild inconvience.

And finally my father. My dad is a great man, I love him dearly. When he's happy he's jovial and freindly; the type of guy that could make friends in an empty room. However he often gets very low and this causes him to act out in anger. He has been diagnosed with Bipolar (he calls it Manic Depressive but I think it's the same thing?) by a few different psychologists and has been on various forms of medication for longer than I can remember. His condition has caused him to lose a few jobs and two years ago at around Christmas time he attempted to commit suicide. 

Now the backstory is out of the way, I can get to my issue. Recently, over the past two years, the family has been fighting more and more. This most often comes from my brother, though not always. It's led to multiple physical confrontations and my dad has thrown around the idea of kicking my brother out or calling the police. I however, want to move out. It's gotten to the point where hearing everyone argue all the time is effecting my sleep, my mental health, my confidence and at times my relationships with others. The trouble comes from the fact that I am studying full-time online and only working as a miniumum wage casual worker. I can't afford a place of my own and I really don't want to hae to burden my friends with this but it's gotten to the point where I just can't handle it anymore. I feel scared for my safety in my own house and the constant arguing is driving me mad. I had gotten to the point of wanting to leave before but when the arguement calmed down I came to my senses and decided to wait it out. I felt selfish for wanting to leave and I suppose I still do but I honestly feel like it's my only option. What should I do? Should I ask to move in with one of my friends? Is there another option? Im so conflicted. If anyone can offer some honest advice I would really appreciate it. 

P.S Sorry about any grammar and spelling mistakes, it's quite late as I'm writinng this and I'm too tired and emotional to think about things like sentence structure.

263,"Hello everyone.
I got a friend that I have known for a while now, but we didn't get to talk
much until recently.

We started sharing aspect of each other lives and soon I realized they were into
a really crappy situation.

Basically they ran away from their home when they were teenagers (can't rely on parents / family), joined the
military for a while (mandatory in their country I believe), and after a couple of years,
they started college and working at nights for money.

However, they have been dealing with depression their whole life, working and
studying at the same time was too overwhelming for them and they ended up dropping out of college half way through.
They also cut contact with most of the people they were acquaintance with at this point due to their depression.
Fast forward a couple of years and they are now in their early 30s,
have been stuck in a dead-end job for several years, money is just enough to cover living expenses.
As far as I know their usual day goes as follow: Go to work at night, return to their rented place
in the morning, sleep the rest of the day and then repeat.

How can I help them? They have been really nice to me and even helped/motivated me to fight my own demons in the past.
Talking to them doesn't really help. They feel like is too late to do anything about it
and even if they went back to school as long as they have to juggle working and studying
they say they couldn't handle it.

Given that we are in different continents all together, I don't know how to help.
I asked them if they had suicidal thoughts, and they said they had in the past
when they were at their worst (years ago?), but they don't think they ever go through with it.
That is a relief to some extend, but at the same time, they some times disappear
months at the time, which didn't bother me too much before, but after
knowing the situation they are into makes me worry.
Any ideas in what I could do?",07May2018,1

266,"20 year old female here. Dating a 26 year old man that's in the army. Been dating for about a year. We met online, and the sparks were immediate. I just got out of a 3 year relationship and same with him. Unfortunately, he is in the military and got  stationed in the southwest US back in October. I live in the north east. We are both crazy in love with each other. I've gone down there twice to visit. It's a lot different then up here (less populated) but I have always had an itch to live in the south and get away the busy traffic and fast life of the north. 
He wants me to move down there. And I want to move down there as well. I'm not in college. I have my cosmetology lisence but mostly focus on makeup/assisting hair dressers up here at my job. I dont love  my job(the people I work with are all family and I continually feel as if they're talking behind my back and since I'm not family I can never do good enough). 
The only thing holding me back is that half the people I told that I'm thinking about moving said I'm young now is the time to move,because if it doesn't work I can still have my life ahead of me and my parents would always have a room for me. The other half said it's a horrible mistake because I know noone down there except for my boyfriend..
Should I make the risk because I'm so young and not really going anywhere in my career up here? Or should I stay with my family up here and not move for love.
Just need a little advice on what you would do in my situation. ",07May2018,2
267,"Hey everyone! 

I have an extremist personality, in that if I want to do something I throw myself at it 100%. For instance, if I want to learn something, I will do it as much a possible and practice as much as possible. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing except if I want to learn something else or do something else, that starts to become my main focus and I push aside the first thing.

For example I am an artist trying to get better at my craft, so I spend a lot of my free time practicing and drawing. But that's not my full time career and now I want to start studying for a new certification, but my tendencies is to go head first and study my butt off and push my art goals to the side...

How do you break these extremist tendencies? This effects my personal life in some degree as well. Is it as simple as creating schedules for my practice and studying? Is there something else I can do to fix the tendencies in general? Thanks for the advice!",07May2018,2

269,"This is a weird situation. I just got the news this morning so I’m sorry if this is a little all over the place but here goes -

The grandmother in question is my ex boyfriends (read almost fiancé, we lived together, moved cities together etc). Our breakup was one of those unexpected, non closure, thought we were ‘soulmates’ and would be together forever sort of thing and I took it really hard. This grandmother (and grandfather) were there by my side through the whole ordeal. Let me preface this by the fact that I have no other living grandparents and I wasn’t close to any of them because they all pretty much passed away when I was really young.  Anyways so after a 4+ year relationship down the drain, I never felt a difference in their treatment of me. They have been the best ‘grandparents’ in the world and in the last three years that we have been broken up and not in each others lives at all, they have supported and encouraged me through other things in my life. I love them as they were my own and they make me feel the same way. 

Last night, my grandma passed away unexpectedly and I’m still in shock. I haven’t even been able to respond to my grandpa cause I don’t know what to even say. they live almost a 4 hour drive north of the city I live in so I can’t even just go over there (I don’t drive). 

So I guess my question is, what do I do? I know it’s vague but I don’t know how to process any of this; how to grieve for her or be there for her. I don’t know if I’ll physically be able to be at the funeral because of the distance and stuff which would be different if I was of course with my ex partner but I feel even if I could make it, I don’t know what feelings it would bring up in him and I want to be aware and sensitive to that as this is his family. 

All the people who know her and have this connection are all his side of the family who, well let’s say I have more of his family on my Facebook than my own. But again, I don’t want to intrude as I wasn’t close to them the way I was with grandma &amp; grandpa. 

It’s even more complicated because as I mentioned this ex partner was someone I thought I would end up with forever so while I’m not IN love with him, I do love him and probably always in many ways. Now we have been cordial and even friendly with each other after the breakup but don’t interact unless we have to. Now he knew I had feelings for him even after we broke up but long story short, it’s fine. He’s happy how he is and I’m fine with that. But I don’t know how he will perceive it because I haven’t been emotional around him on purpose in years and I don’t want him thinking I’m trying to use the moment? I don’t know maybe stupid of me (hello anxiety). So I really don’t know what to do in this situation. 

I feel like I don’t have the right to be as upset as I am for losing her. I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to about this because no one besides people associated with my ex knows her and I don’t know if it’s appropriate to reach out to them. I feel like I have no one to turn to and scream that this isn’t fair and that I thought she would help me pick my bridesmaid dresses (nothing chartreuse gramma I swear!) and just I’m angry because I can’t be there and most of all, I am livid because my grandpa is facing losing his wife of over 30 years and I just want to hug him and ease his pain somehow but I don’t even know what to say. 

Any, and I mean any words of advice would be appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my long rambling post

I've made a lot of mistakes through high school in my friendships, especially I feel on the last two years during and after high school finished. I lost a friend who had a lot of problems (she was a bit crazy) when I'd had enough of her one day and bitched about her to two people and one told her. After school finished I cut one person I called my best friend out of my life because she was becoming really toxic for me (she bitched at me and left me crying just because i declined in paying to carpool with her to uni) and she had majorly stabbed me in the back in the last two years of high school and seemed to forget it when she would treat me horribly. That then that led to a mutual friend of ours I go to the same uni with cutting me off without a definitive reason why in the message she sent to me where she apologised for being off the last year but I figured it was because when me and the best friend were having problems I would message her asking if I had been horrible like my best friend at the time said I was being and I would then vent about the best friend to her because I'm a fucking idiot who didn't think it would push her away and it did.
Another thing happened where I tried to makes amends with  a old best friend who was like my sister at one point.  I cut ties with her 4 years ago after a huge falling out which left me thinking for years it was her all in the wrong until I came across messages from our last few conversations and realised how emotionally immature I was with her and I was blind in seeing that she just had a different view to me. So I messaged her apologising and asking if I could do it in person because i was so horrified in my manner towards her and it didn't work out like I hoped. She didn't want to meet in person to let me apologise and told me to find my own peace which ironically just left me more troubled and now I've been laying awake at night the last two nights with these thoughts swirling around on how I'm such a dismal and horrible person in my failed friendships and that I can't do anything right or fix how past me was. I've tried calling a counselling hotline to talk to someone because I've been feeling so low in myself. How can I shake these thoughts and feelings and let go of all this guilt I have. I wish I had a magic wand and I could undo the mistakes I did, not have the friends who cut me off do that I have the ability to make amends with my old best friend.",07May2018,2
273,"I recently started my first job, and what at first I took as a friendly work environment I’m not seeing as possibly something more? I applied here after my friend was hired on the spot hoping for the same result. I found out later that they don’t like 16 year olds working cashier as it’s a family owned business &amp; idk but they don’t hire 16 year olds and even another manager has told me that. I also applied at the same time as my other friend who is 17 and we had basically the same resume, but she didn’t get hired. The manager I interviewed with pulled a few strings and I got hired. Also, my friend mentioned before I interviewed how annoyed she was that she makes minimum wage. I was told by this same manager that I’ll be making $8. not a huge difference, but considering I have no work experience and everyone else there making minimum wage does, it was odd. Between this and him telling me I don’t have to work Fridays because I would be stressed and a few smaller things, I’m starting to get suspicious. He’s young and I used to find him attractive, but he’s also in a multiple year long relationship.

277,"Hello!

So I graduated from college in December with a media degree. My plan was originally to move to California bc I interned there last year and enjoyed it (besides the awful traffic and outrageous prices). But my boyfriend of 1.5 years still had another year of school left and I wasn't sure if I was ready to move away from my family. So I decided to try and find a job in my home state (Ohio) and I'd just move when my boyfriend graduated. Well, it's now May and haven't found a job. Also my boyfriend and I broke up in February.

So should I move to California? I have several connections and friends who live there, but I'm still not eager to leave behind my whole family because we are all very close. Even if I was offered a job in Ohio at this point I'm not sure if I'd want it because I'm beginning to feel afraid that staying here is wasting my youth, like I should be doing something exciting like moving out of state and/or traveling and meeting new people. I blame my friends for putting the idea that I'm going to  be wasting my youth in my brain haha. But the same time, I'm such an introvert and I love being comfortable in my routine and seeing my family whenever I'd like. And if I stay in Ohio, I could afford a one bedroom but if I move to California or something, I'd need roommates to afford it.

280,"I literally just made a reddit account to ask this (Sorry for my inexperience)-- But it's been giving me anxiety lately and I really need some unbiased advice ; ;

I run a group chat and there's one member (I'll call them Sara for now) who used to harass others and make inappropriate comments which in turn caused a clique in the group to form dedicated to gossiping and belittling Sara in private. I know they do because these people used to be my friends until they all cut me off because I kept defending Sara from being banned completely and telling them that what they were doing was also bullying. The clique members told me that what they were doing is justified because ""If people treat others like trash, they deserve to be treated like trash too."" I just think it's kind of... hypocritical and self-righteous. 

But now, Sara's behavior has improved drastically and she no longer makes inappropriate comments after I talked with her and worked on her behavior in the DMs. Note, we did give her a strike and temporary ban when her behaviour was at its worst so there was some consequence for her actions. As cliche as it is, I wanted to treat her with kindness since I thought it was what she needed and that it'll rub off on her (Which my ex friends hated me for lol). Although, she does occasionally make remarks that can be read as passive aggressive but these comments are far and few. Unfortunately, when she does make those passive aggressive remarks the clique members use that as ""proof"" that I don't do anything and I don't care about the group chat.

Anyhow, the issue I'm having right now is one of the clique members DMed me asking me to ban Sara (This has happened twice so far, each with one of the clique members) for all of the things she did in the past and criticize me for not being stricter. I brought it up to the other moderator in the group chat and they agree with the person who DMed me but I'm afraid that my fellow mod is biased because they're part of the Sara-hate clique and best friends with the person who DMed me.  As we speak, I'm trying to convince them that banning is a serious issue that we can't do unless she explicitly and recently breaks the rules but the mod says we should judge Sara by her cumulative behavior, past mistakes and passive aggressive remarks.

So I guess, I'm just doubting if I'm doing the right thing? I've always said ""hate the action not the person"" but if they keep on bringing it up am I just turning a blind eye to all of this? Or am I right in believing they want to belittle Sara to make themselves feel more morally righteous? I've lost almost all of my friends (all clique members), have been blocked by them and even have these people actively want to make me miserable so I can't help but think I'm in the wrong here if some people dislike me so much.

I’m 24 years old working as a “production department supervisor” for a local shipping company.

My father passed away in Nov. which left me with house bills/rent. That’s all fine and dandy as my girlfriend moved in to help with that, but it didn’t last long. She moved out and in order to stay afloat my friend said he’d move in as long as I didn’t take the Police job otherwise he’d have to move again as well when I left. So I put an axe to the police idea. 

They (police dept.) recently called me again last week and said the job was still open if I wanted to come down for an interview on the 17th. 

Not exactly sure if I go for it or not. It’s not exactly a “dream job” but it would be nice to move a few states away and start over with a decent job. 

My current employer is great, pay is decent for the work I do (babysitting really). I’m unsure how to go about dealing with this. 

My options are: 
-Tell my boss I have an interview and see what he says
then go to it 

- Lie about why I need off and go to it 

- Go to the interview and if I get the job bail on my friend that I told I wouldn’t take the job

289,"Here’s the rundown: My parents are very protective. They love us kids. I’m a fraternal twin and one of 5.

My mom’s dream in life was to have a family
of her own. A loving family. Growing up, she was verbally and physically abused by my grandmother. She (according to my Mom) was very nasty to her and would make her feel like shit. Because of this, my mom grew up in a super depressed state and wanted out. She escaped, got a stable career, flowing income, met my father and they were engaged 3 weeks after they met. She’s always wanted a family.

My dad grew up in a bit of a depressed state was well, although delayed into his teen years. His dad had a massive heart attack when my dad was only 13. Super traumatizing. He passed because of it. So my dad had to maneuver through a difficult stage without his father. His mother was great to him, also overprotective. So my dad always wanted to be a dad and have a family.

Anyways, because they’re so focused on family, I’ve been getting vibes that they don’t want me to move away on my own eventually. I’m graduating high school early next month and I’m slated to attend the local community college. Not my choice. My parents want me local. I understood as they are paying for it. But there was a handful of colleges that expressed a big interest in my abilities. I’m really great with computers and coding and programming and all of that. These college sent me countless handouts, called me dozens of times etc. But my parents always threw the letters gotten from these colleges away, but were overjoyed when I got into the community college.

Here’s where I start to really get suspicious. My older brother and I were talking with my dad one night. He drank a little bit. Anyway we got onto the subject of moving out. I told my
dad that I had plans on moving once I got a stable career. He replied “Ha, you’re not going anywhere”. Didn’t sound like he was kidding. 

Is there something I can do now before it potentially turns into a toxic situation? I have no desire to live where I live forever. Preferably I’d love to live in California or somewhere down the east coast. Currently in MA. Finance certainly won’t be an issue when I get into the tech industry. Super lucrative.

Extra info: Out of all my siblings, my sister is the only one who has moved out, although she’s not far. My oldest brother is in his late 20s, still living at home. My parents still love having him around. He’s employed. My other two brothers have disabilities and are still home as well, and likely will be forever.

I am currently on Academic Probation 1 because of the C's I made freshman year. The professor didn't use the school website, like at all, therefore I could never check my grades or know my progress. When I asked him for my grade he told me he keeps his gradebook at home and there was no email for me to get as he has no syllabus.I honestly had no idea what my grade for that class was until today.

I am completely dependent on my mother who pays for my education and my living since I have not worked since so since last year but I am terrified of telling her I failed again.

Soooo I have a question for you fine folks in Reddit land, a few weeks ago I had an interview for my dream job! It went great, it ended up being almost 2 hours, they showed me around, introduced me to everyone ect. 

I sent the usual follow up email, they emailed me back said they’re busy (filling other positions in 2 other branches as well) and they would let me know. 

Another few days go by then they emailed me again said I was a front runner (top 2, their words) but the other branches were consuming their time (other provinces). 

Last week the big boss (Canadian regional manager) calls me and apologizes for the delay and they hope I’m still interested/available, I said definitely (this is my dream job) and he said they would let me know this week.

My dad drinks all day not to the point where he's wasted at night but enough to give him a good buzz. He smokes marijuana and stays high all day as well. My dad yells at me for a lot of things, really small things; leaving a light on, didn’t shut a cupboard, didn’t do my sisters laundry, etc. It's made me feel as if I am a prisoner of my own home, I cry all the time, I feel unwanted and I’m honestly afraid of my dad. My parents also search my room sometimes which invades my personal privacy. 

My dad won’t let me hangout with any of my friends because they say they’re a bad example or I could have better friends. I am also hardly even aloud to see my boyfriend because my parents had found out that we were having sex. They got mad and told me that I’m to young to be having sex &amp; I could pregnant. I told them that I got an IUD and struggled to give me a reason why I can’t have sex. My boyfriend thinks it would be a good idea for me to get emancipated because he notices a difference in my mental health. He knows that I would be a lot happier, I could focus on myself a lot more then what I even can now. If I got emancipated he believes it would be a better environment for me  

My situation that I am in literally blocks me from having any social experiences that I should be having. Im seventeen, I should be going out with friends and having a good time. Instead, only aloud to leave my house if I am going to work or to the grocery store. They’ve also installed a tracker onto my phone.

I used to be very confident and never depend on anybody and I always knew what I wanted. When I met my boyfriend I was kind of in a bad place dealing with self confidence issues and I felt like he saved me from that. And we were so much in love we used every opportunity to be together and this lasted for about 6 months.

Now things have calmed down and everything is still great but he is very busy with schoolwork and wants time to hang out with his other friends too. But I am still feeling like im dependent on him, in a way that he is the highlight of my life and other experiences are just something on the side. This caused me some self confidence issues because I still need that attention but I don't ever wanna be the super needy girlfriend. I dont want to focus on him every waking minute and it's so difficult not to text him all the time. I don't wanna be a burden and I want to let him live his life and live my own life too (while we still meet up occasionally).

313,"My s.o and I have decided to ""take a break"" for about 2 weeks. I'm confused how this will work... he (and I) said that maybe we should just see each other as friends for a while instead of boyfriend and girlfriend because I was feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety about it. He's been busy with work and I'm generally insecure in relationships of any kind when I'm not able to have constant demonstrations that someone wants me around.... I'm working on that. But we still live together.
We've lived together for about a year and a half . Our relationship is going on 2 years. We get along really well and the only reason this happened is because he's been gone so much that I was sure he wasn't interested in me anymore. He said that he thought I was too emotionally dependent on him and that we should take some time to see where our relationship was at. He broke up with his last girlfriend because she put all her emotional well being on him, but he said even if I did that, he wouldn't want to separate from me because he liked me so much as a person. I admitted that I was insecure and that it's easy for me to have bad thoughts when friends or significant others aren't blatant about how they feel. I'm not good at reading people, either. I'm really confused though because everything feels the same as before (nothing has changed aside from us saying that we're not going to ""think"" of ourselves as a couple). Not to mention a half hour after our conversation we had sex.  I agree that its nice to tell myself that i don't have to stress over how I think a romantic relationship should be. At the same time, neither of us plan on seeing other people. But he told me point-blank that he doesn't have time for a traditional relationship like before. All things considered... does this even sound like a ""break""? We still sleep in the same bed, we still spend time together, we still have sex, we still split the grocery bill... I do want to take a break but how can this actually happen? I was at east thinking that I would try skimming through tinder and have a few mindless flings (completely out of my character, but who knows), but I can tell that this isn't want he has in mind. I also wouldn't be too thrilled for him to bring home another girl, but if we really are just going to be friends, shouldn't that be permissible? if it isn't, doesn't it sound like a relationship still? he can't really devote his time to me right now in a ""romantic"" way and I understand that but at this point it feels like a mind trick to say that we're just friends when everything about us remains as it was.

317,"I'm a young woman in my early 20s. I started a fitness program app and followed it for about 3/4 months, by the end of it U noticed I had some knee discomfort. The program included a tiny bit of jumping but a lot of weights and leg work. I was only using 5kg maybe 7kg (10-13pound) weights at the heaviest I went. 

It wasn't too bad so i kept going but the knee pain continued, so after 1.5 weeks of noticing the knee pain I ceased the program entirely. 

It's been about a year since that knee pain first started. Now I can't do my own grocery shopping as easily because of knee pain. I have to carry each individual item into my house as carrying several items in one bag, so grocery shopping takes me like 2-3 times as long as others. 
  
My knee pain is never excruciating thankfully, it's just chronically there and it shouldn't be there. 

Saw a doctor a few months ago who told me just rest your knees until they become better. Didnt work. 
Am going to see one again soon but apparently chronic knee pain can't be cured. 

I feel like a disabled person. People don't believe me when i say I can't carry things, they all call me lazy including my own family. I can't carey normal things that most people can.  

I'm not lazy at all. I dream of being able to go to carry my own groceries easily, go to the gym, play sports, like I used to, that would be amazing. I feel like I'm missing out so bad. I wish I had knee strength so that I could help my family more with things too. I can't believe people call me lazy when I wish I could do everything. 
It makes my self confidence so much worse, there are so many things I just can't do that most people can. 

I'm worried my knee pain will get even worse as I age and I'll have to be in a wheelchair in just a few decades.

324,"To start, TL;DR: Grandfather passed in November, grandmother has been staying with Aunt since then. Aunt wants to go on vacation for a week in June, dad offered/volunteered my room to grandmother without asking me, saying there's ""no other choice"". Expects me to crash at my boyfriend's.

Since my grandfather passed in November, my grandmother has been staying with my Aunt. She has spent a couple nights at our place since for hospital visits, sleeping on the couch with her dog. Now my aunt wants to go on vacation for a week to Florida. For the record, I do not like my grandmother at all. She treated my dad like a reject compared to his brothers/sisters, and that extended to treating me and my brother like black sheep when compared to my cousins. She's nasty, mean, smells like death.

Basically, my dad just messaged me saying that my grandmother will be staying in my room for a week, that I won't be able to come and go as I please to get my stuff. I asked my dad where the hell am I going to sleep, and he told me to crash at my boyfriend's place for the week, ""I'm sure he'll understand"". 

First and foremost, I have anxiety. My room, my stuff, it's my only sanctuary.  And only recently did I start feeling truly comfortable in my room. As I type this, I'm trembling from the thought of having someone I really don't like intrude in my personal space, with seemingly no option for me.

Second, my boyfriend and I don't have a super solid relationship. Sometimes we're best friends and everything is great, others we  get into arguments and take a few days away from each other to sort out our feelings. I can't guarantee I'll be able to sleep over at his place come June. I understand this isn't a super healthy relationship, but that's for another time.

I want to tell my dad to fuck right off, that it's my space and my things. But at the same time, I'm over 25 and still living at home. He told me I was always welcomed to stay with him in his house, I'd always have a room available, since I'm saving up to buy a house in the coming year. But I didn't realise this would come at the expense of my privacy and intrusions of my personal space. It has already happened, a couple times, where I showed up in the middle of the night after going out, only to find one of my cousins' asleep in my bed.

326,"So, this is me, a traveling man, for work. I stay at many hotels in one country where there are saunas and they are for bathing, not mixed gender. I have a girlfriend of more than a couple of years.

I don't know where to put this stuff in my head.

I will not try to make this clean or anything. I feel terrible after the fact. I kind of did comply but I just feel so horrible about having her trust placed upon me and now I have betrayed her. I can not even kiss her, I can only think that now I am infected with something. I think I must call her tonight and just tell her, whatever happens. It was my fault because I did not distance myself or say no to begin with. I have never had a one night stand or anything, just her.

So, the story. Today, I went in and there was only one guy laying down in the sauna. So I went in and started throwing some water on the stones and casually talking to this guy. Some guy from Germany with a wife he says. . Then he starts to ask about a giving body massage and I said no I'm fine thanks, don't need one.

At one point he starts saying it makes him hard \(the heat?\) I thought I could hear him fapping, it was kind of dim and he had a leg in the way. Earlier he said he prefers men only saunas so you can show off?? So I don't escape the situation but say, kind of not believing what is happening, ""did you say hard"". He then starts to be more direct, if I want to jerk off and such. I tell him well I have thought about how it feels to touch another guy \(big mistake\). In fact I was a little curious, touching will not hurt anyone. I did touch the guy's cock. He then stands in front of me, kind of pushing his penis towards me. I said""I don't know  you...are you healthy"" ""perfectly healthy"", asking to be sucked, and I did for just a couple of seconds, then I did not want to anymore. . He then sucks my cock without asking for just a couple of seconds until I say no more of that. The man jerked off and came on a towel and went on his way. In the moment I masturbated too and came. In the shower he asked if I'm ok and I just say yeh and he went out.

I was washing my mouth with soap in the shower. I felt shaken afterwards. I can not tell my gf, right? I must.

Health before anything. But on the other hand, I read that oral has a low risk. But I don't know this guy and he has done it before from the looks of it!! He said that he doesn't do this kind of thing often.

 I was on the verge of crying after and pretty much threw up. I guess going down on a guy is not my thing. I wish I stopped at touching him. What if I have something now, herpes or even worse? Worst is that I have to wait a long time for any test.

I read that at least HIV has a very low risk with this kind of stuff. But the thought of my mistake costing me my quality of life with a random cock hero is haunting.

I am quite sure I will be fine because the guy is also travelling for work, seemed normal, and if it is true he has a wife, and Germany should have pretty good health culture, right?

Am I overreacting?

327,"Hello,

I have issues with shopping. My shopping is tech and specifically, phones. I currently have an S9+ and a Pixel 2 XL and I'm selling my Note8 though I'm thinking about switching and selling my s9+.

Anyway, I am now thinking about getting an iPhone but I've tried iPhones many times in the past 2 years (since this all started) and I always end up returning them or selling them because I like to customize my phone and if I can't of that k get bored of it really fast.

I know I shouldn't get an iPhone. I know I will return it. I know this is costing me money but it is hard for me to stop.

How do I stop? I'm wanting to change and I'm trying hard to change. I'm just not sure what is causing me to want to buy a phone I don't want or need. I'm tired of this... It is exhausting.",07May2018,0
328,"I'm home all day, I play games when I force myself to play, or I am just lying down bored but not wanting to do anything. 

I have barely any muscle and I'm all fat. I don't know what to do anymore. I was thinking of doing push-ups but I don't know how much or how often. I have 8lb weights to lift.

I have no will or discipline but I don't want to stay this way forever. I'm getting worse every day but I need to change. I want to go out but I have nothing to go to, nothing to look forward to. I go out for walks sometimes but I don't know. 

I keep thinking I'm not depressed but just the result of my habits. No discipline and bad life choices is why I'm here. Maybe I am depressed because of that and fixing it will make me better. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist, take medications, and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I'm in denial about it or blame myself.

Ahhhh I need help, this isn't me. What can I do to exercise at home? I can't go to the gym anymore because I'm afraid of seeing the national guard folks and I have no will to go. More like no discipline. I'm spoiled and whining. I'm sorry for writing so much.",07May2018,1

I am a 24 year old guy married to the girl I dated in high school. Ever since 7th I always wondered if I was gay or bisexual. I never experimented (which was a poor choice on my part) so I never had the chance to know what I really liked. My family is real old fashion so I suppressed my feelings and attractions for guys and just dated girls. Yes, I have slept with a handful of girls, but ever single one of them there were periods of time that I could not get aroused and it would just make me wonder even more. Now fast forward a few years, I am married to the girl I started dating my senior year and 6 months ago I finally slept with my first guy and it was AMAZING. Ever since then I have not been able to connect sexually with my wife. I have not even wanted to sleep with her or any woman for that matter. I know I want to be with a man and I am not happy, but I do not want to destroy her world. I also don't know if its just a phase or if I am gay or just bi. I need advice and any given is much appreciated. Thank you anyone who takes time to read this.

332,"Hello, so this is kind of my last resort to ask for help :\( I have been studying a Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Health Science \(4 year double degree\) for the past 3 years, and have absolutely hated every minute of it. I am half way through my fourth year, and if I stick at it, I will finish mid\-year next year due to changing a minor once, and then back which extended my studies by a semester. From day one I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do, and for that reason I continued studying the same course despite hating it. One thing was for certain, having a Health Science bachelor was something which I enjoyed, and was told that I would be able to explore other avenues in the health science area if I ended up not wanting to pursue teaching. It was the perfect course given this scenario. Throughout the duration of my course I actively looked in the Health Science avenue to see what I would like, and half way through last year \(my third year\), I came to a well informed decision that Physiotherapy, or Radiography is something which I really wanted to pursue, as it checked the boxes for being in the health science avenue, and I genuinely wanted to pursue it.. A bit of a run\-down on physiotherapy; it is only offered as a post\-graduate \(masters\) at the two universities in my city, and it only has two prerequisites. One being that in order to apply \(to be considered\) for the program, you have to achieve a GPA of at least 5.0 in your undergraduate degree, and the other being having to complete 2\-3 extra body and anatomy topics. This in itself was a bit messy due to the 2\-3 extra body and anatomy topics, having pre\-requisite topics as well. In essence, I have to do 2 prerequisite topics in one year to be able to do the 2\-3 extra pre\-requisite topics I need for the following year. This bothered me at first, but I quickly learnt that at the end of the day, that sometimes you 'gotta do, what you gotta do'. After getting a hold of countless people over the past two years I recently was able to get in touch with the main lecturer of the Physiotherapy program after much hustling, and she informed me that the lowest GPA requirement of people who gained entry into Physiotherapy was 6.18 over the last 3 years and that I should just apply for the Health Science and Physiotherapy undergraduate/masters combined degree which is a total of 5 years for a guaranteed chance of entry \(3 years of health science, and 2 for the masters of physiotherapy attached as one\). My GPA is sitting at 5.16. I have achieved mostly credits and distinctions, however it still isn't enough which is absolutely heart shattering as I hated studying this course, and as a penalty, I now suffer from bad anxiety, am miserable most days, and have missed out on so much back home with friends and family as I am from the country. I toughed it out the whole time despite wanting to go home every minute, while achieving good grades and it just feels as if I've been mislead. I'm completely lost, and these 4 years have been for nothing. Sure I can ditch this, and start a 4 year Radiography course, or a 5 year Physiotherapy course, but I'm just at witts end of enduring a course I've hated for so long, and this anxiety, depression and wasted time would've all been for nothing. Can anyone shed any light on my terrible situation, or give me any advice :'\(",07May2018,0
333,"Im 13 turning 14, and im about to be in the 9th grade, and in my coming up high school, there's a pretty big science fair competition thing between grades 9 and 10. I got an idea. Ive seen this thing on a YouTube channel called ""Cody's Lab"" and another one that i cant remember. Where he got a scalpel, and cut right below the layers of skin that peel off and made a small opening and pocket, right beneath the pad of his finger, and its about 5cm across, where he put a small neodymium magnet into his finger, closed it up and let it heal. What i wanted to do for the fair was to see how the brain adapts to new stimuli and can create new senses. \(and put a magnet inside my finger ;P\) The magnet turns into a little electromagnet almost, where it vibrates and shifts to electromagnetic current. So technically, it turns into a new sense in your brain. Fun. And the thing is, is there's a pretty major nerve in your finger, and if you go too far, you may slice it and completely lose feeling in your finger. I feel the reward outweighs the risks, but id like to know what this subreddit has to say on the matter.  ",07May2018,0
334,"okay i had this group of 7 friends that i hung out with this semester, and i was really close with two of them, but suddenly they just began to ignore me all the time. i decided to ask them via message if i did something wrong, one of them responded that she was mad at me because i told her off when she threw a shirt i just ironed on the floor (i guess it's not the entire reason??) - the other girl didn't respond at all. time went by and i just hung out with some other people (that i really don't like that much) for a while. so today one of the girls kicked me out of our group chat, but she messaged me saying sorry but she just thought i didn't like them anymore??? but i told her that of course i liked them, but i didn't want to keep hanging out with them if they thought i was being annoying. then the girl who kicked me out told me i should apologize to the two other girls, which i had tried to do in the past even though they didn't really want to tell what was going on. i did as she told me, but the girls just seemed awkward and still annoyed at me and one of them said ''well yes we can start speaking again but it won't be the same because we are too different'' but literally four weeks ago we hung out everyday and had a blast??? i'm so confused about whats going on here, because since they don't really want to tell me what i actually did wrong i feel like they're just playing me, cause i just became a part of the friend group but the other girls have known each other for long time so they might just be fucking with me?? idk if i should just drop them and hang out with the other people in my class",07May2018,1

338,"I am starting to realise how unhappy I am. Outwardly I am quite happy and I have a sense of humour, but when alone I reflect on everything and I am not happy in my life.

There are a few areas that I have identified as causing me unhappiness.

1. Friendships

I am introverted and i struggle to make friends. The people I end up friends with are not like me deep down. They are the awkward quiet people, even with their good friends. I am only a bit awkward to begin with, so after a while we don't click. These types of friends aren't social and don't say or do anything that makes me happy. I want friends who do stuff and invite me, and who take my mind of the things which bring me down. My last group were quite like that but one of them doesn't like me hanging out with them so now i dont get invited to the cinema etc. I am not this negative in person by the way, so it isn't like I bring them down too.

2. Romantic Relationships

I am not straight so meeting people of my sexuality is difficult. This girl and I liked eachother but didn't know eachother that well and we only saw eachother occasionally around school. i think I accidently rejected her by not acknowleding the flags she was giving me. Now she is with someone else and I am kicking myself so much. She is great and just my type. I cant let go of her unless I fixate on someone else which I don't want to do. I am clinging onto the idea of her because she is not straight and i don't know of anyone else anyway. She is who I want to be with. I don't know if it still possible and obviously everyone will tell me to move on but I can't.",07May2018,1
339,"Long title, I know, apologies about that. But yeah, basically I have no idea where to begin about telling my parents about my continuous depression and anxiety, which would then follow up to the therapist talk. I've talked to them about my depression before, years ago, but they said it was just a phase and swept it under the rug. Obviously this hit me pretty hard then and now, but my depression has gotten to the point where I feel like I can't fight this battle by myself anymore. So now I'm stuck on how to talk to them about this whole ordeal.

Apologies if this seems like a rushed text. It is, since I'm writing this on break and (if possible) would like to talk to my parents about this before tomorrow, that way it's just done with. If you have any questions, ask. Thank you. ",07May2018,1
340,"Hello guys I'm very new to this reddit thing bud I'm a 19 year old girl with priorities in front of me so I just tend to listen to more reddit stories on YouTube more then anything else. Anyways, I did not for my life know where to post this so here I am and I finally figured out. I just moved to Minnesota about a month and a half ago and I was just checking everything out last Tuesday just for curiosity's sake and I ran across a café in Minneapolis so I thought I'd go check it out because I was getting very hungry. I'm choosing to leave out the name because I don't think it would want to be affiliated with my post or these incidents. So, I entered the café and ordered my stuff then went to go find a spot which I reluctantly did. A man about 6'4 then walked in and ordered a few things then sat about six seats away from me which didn't really seem weird at the time because it was a decently packed place at the time of me being there. I stayed in the café for about four hours as I was doing homework for school and using there Wi-Fi to check out new YouTube videos. The later in the day it got and the more people left the closer this man got to me. I never really noticed it until he was sitting right at my table just staring at me. I then asked him while I was still staring down at my computer ""Are you looking for something sir?"" He then replied ""Yes, what's your name? You look very familiar."" I then replied ""I don't think I'd look familiar sir I just moved here about a month ago."" He then proceeds to say ""No, I might've seen you on some dating app or something as I have a couple and please call me Derrick."" I then reply and say ""I don't use any dating apps as I'm in college and I don't need to worry about relationships right now so may you please go and let me do my work."" He then mutters something I couldn't make out and leaves the café. About thirty minutes pass by and I pack my stuff up to leave. I then buy a drink and a parfait to have on the way home. As I'm walking home its around 8:00 pm and its very dark at this time bud it didn't really bother me as I love walking during the night time because its very silent and soothing. I then eventually hear a car pass me which didn't bother me as there's been a multiple cars going by bud this car in particular was weird as it was an old, red, rusty Cadillac which shouldn't be weird bud that same exact car was at the café when I was there. It then made a U-turn and then proceeded to slowly follow me in my direction. The window slowly rolled down and it was the man in the café. He was just staring and smiling at me like all this was okay. He said to me ""Hey beautiful café girl. Need a ride home? Its very dark and dangerous out."" I thought to myself ""Yeah no shit its dangerous when your just following me you fucking creep!"" Instead I said ""No, I'm fine sir. I don't live much farther anyways."" That was a total, complete, bullshit lie. I lived about four more miles away. So I started walking a bit faster and guess what? He started to drive a bit faster so he could catch up with me. He said as I was trying not to get nervous and as he was getting even more aggravated ""Remember you can call me Derrick. Also its fine you don't need to pay me I just want you home safely."" I then said ""No its okay I'll be fine."" He then yelled at me ""GET IN THE FUCKING CAR IM JUST TRYING TO BE NICE AND KEEP YOU SAFE!"" I then started to run as I was fucking scared for my life. I didn't know if I was going to get raped or even die at this point. As I said He was about 6'4 and I'm thinking he was around 250 pounds or more. He was also very buff and he looked like he was around late 30s to early 40s. Me on the other hand I'm a 19 year old girl who's barely 5'4 and exactly 115 pounds. He's a foot taller then me if my accusations are correct. He would also be 135+ pounds bigger then me plus he has a lot more muscle mass then I do. So after I started to run he started to drive faster and after he caught up to me he yelled out his window saying ""I'm sorry my love! I didn't mean to scare you! I'm just very tired and I want you to make it home safe!"" I ignored him and oh it was a terrible idea on my end because he then got even more aggravated and started to scream at me ""YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK THIS! GET IN MY CAR NOW SO I CAN BRING YOU HOME!"" At this time I just fucking booked it and I sprinted as fast as I could possibly sprint down to my house which I may mind you at this time it was now around three miles away. When I feel under pressure or scared I can run a good ten miles without getting tired so when that adrenaline kicked in my system and I was also scared for my life I ran like Usain Bolt. I might've actually ran faster then him. So I got into my house and the very first thing I did was lock every port of entry into the house. I then turned off the lights because I didn't know if he saw where I went into and then just sat on the ground and texted my parents. I then texted a few friends of mine to see if I could say with them until this thing rode out and I wasn't too afraid to go into my own house. One of them reluctantly texted back and I went to stay with him and his two roommates until last Thursday (Remember, this all happened last Tuesday). I then finally went to my house and checked everything out and someone broke every door lock in my house. They also broke every window lock in my house. So now my windows wont fully close. Plus on my front door there's now fourteen words etched into it. ""You will be mine no matter what I have to do to get you"" It's now Monday morning and every night I hear tapping on my windows and scratching at my doors (I don't have any pets and no one lives with me or above me). I know its Derrick whose doing it because whenever I wake up to the noises (I'm a very light sleeper) and after a while of him doing it I always hear him getting into his car then driving off because he has a very shitty and very noticeable engine. I know you may all say ""call the police"" or ""move out"" or something along those lines bud I refuse to call the police as I'm new to this state and I don't want to scare anyone or even myself as I've had a very hard past with the police and so has my whole family. Plus with the moving out thing, I cant because if I move in with friends that I stayed with before I'll only be able to stay there a couple days again. They are the only people I know in this state and my parents live back where I used to live. Plus I'm here for college so I cant just move away. Also I cant just buy a new apartment or house as I don't have the money. So sorry for this being so long bud I really need help on this. So please tell me what to do. ",07May2018,0
341,"One day when I was 16 in April of 2015 I had a really intense dream, it wasn't bad or good, just extremely vivid. And ever since that day I've been having intense night terrors (different then nightmares), sleep apnea, and sleep paralysis ever since. These don't feel like normal nightmares either, like I could recite them in exact detail even though most people forget their dreams about halfway through the day.

I've tried every method I found online on how to stop them. I avoid certain foods before bed, listen to rainymood, and I try waking up early so I'll be able to pass out when I hit my bed at night.

So... I have a self-help product out there. It is new. Only 37 people have taken it. It is literally changing lives. People are saying things about it you would not believe.

HOWEVER

I have no clue what to charge for it. It's at $1,197 at the moment. I am tempted to drop it down to, like: $7. No joke. I am not even tied to the outcome. In fact, as I mentioned in the title, I am more scared of Reddit (which is a giant cavern of the unknown for me than I am about charging pennies for an amazing product). I am not tied to it via ego or cash or what have you.

What my friends and I have been discussing is that if you really want to save/change/fix/repair the world (or people or lives or whatever) would you make it free? Would you make it cheap? Would you make it pricey because then it implies value?

Does a grand make it worth more in your life than $10?

And does the extra profit make it possible for me to reach more people?

As a sign of being genuine here, you will notice there is no mention of my website or product.

I just want to know what others think.

But theres a problem: The last two times I had a crush were basically a horrible rollercoaster of emotions ending in bad rejection. Thats why im a bit shy when it comes to love and rather holding back. So back to the present: The girl kinda seems to like me and at first we talked a bit but I always am very jealous when I see her talking to other people. And so I figured: Ill just not talk to her and let go of the whole crush thing because A. I wouldnt be a good bf If im always so jealous when she even talks to other people and B. As said, my past two crush-experiences were horrible and I couldnt withstand a 3rd failure. But then again she doesnt probably crush on anyone else, I really do love her and she hasnt been in a relationship since about 5 years (also you cant call a relationship ""real"" when youre about 10y/o). She even seems to think like me a bit.

How to train yourself to stop laughing nervously? Any tactics? How to take myself more seriously and be less nervous?

I’m okay with the idea of failing a lot before being successful I just need to learn to cope better with the failure and not feel so embarrassed in front of him. ",07May2018,1

They said stuff like, ""I don't appreciate ..."" and ""While I understand..., I think..."", and it got me thinking that they might be attending Marriage Counseling/Therapy.

364,"Wondering if I can get Reddit’s temperature on this. I’m pretty sure I’m crazy for even thinking about this and probably am just a little depressed, but hey.

General background. I recently changed jobs and am currently 28. Moved from a very high stress work environment involving long hours with a high earning potential (&gt;$1MM per year in the next 6 years) to making a decent living (current all-in at $225k) with not much room for upward growth in pay with total 9-5 comfort. It’s not interesting work to me, but it’s not crushing my soul like my last job.

My previous job blew up my personal life and ended an engagement. It took a lot of time and energy to escape, and I was convinced the job was the source of my creeping restlessness and dissatisfaction with life. Turns out I’m still dissatisfied with things, but I have no reason to be. I travel pretty much every other weekend and have the freedom to do whatever I want generally from a financial perspective. Yet I still feel like I’m going through the motions and just existing until the weekend rolls around.

I’m finding myself more and more wanting to bail and travel the world for a year or more, collecting my thoughts, and figuring out what I’m ultimately passionate about. I’m a total weekend warrior right now and I’m frequently finding myself wondering if I can do it forever. 

The finances don’t matter. I have zero debt and about $420k in savings. I’m looking for advice on whether this is colossally stupid and if I’m just in a rut and should see a therapist. I get stuck in a bubble sometimes and an outside perspective would be helpful. I don’t even know what I’m looking for or why.

We had broken up many times before this but this was my first actual serious relationship I had been in and was very naive on how unhealthy it had become. A little back story. About two years ago I had the ""brilliant"" idea to try to help her get a job at the same place I work, putting her best interest and future in mind. She ended up getting the job,  and to no ones surprise things got rocky working together and eventually called it quits. Around the same time my best friend was finally getting his shit together after not really doing anything for the past 4 years. His brother in law (who is now my supervisor, but also a great guy and good friend) helped him get a job on the same shift around the time we broke up. I decided to quit my job one night and HR offered me a better job on a different shift, in hope of me staying with the company.  I took the offer and life slowly started to get better, I had dealt with some sort of depression and suicidal thoughts in the past but with help of others I've worked through it. Fast forward to March of this year and I heard rumors of my best friend and her dating each other. I honestly didn't believe it for one second considering the sources and gossip culture that you find at work... plus I mean this guy was my best friend and I had always been there for him regardless of what kind of mess he went through, always hung out, I mean dang we knew each other since we were  5.. anyways I confronted him and asked him if this was true, he denied and said he would never do that that we were best friends and he was going to put an end to the rumor. And it seemed like he did, things got quiet, we still hung out, just like normal. Then someone mentioned to me last week that they had seen them both together at a concert. And the very next day he hits me up to grab a bite and starts telling me about the concert and tells me he went with some mutual friends.. talk to the friends.. false.. and I keep digging a little more and it wasn't long until I found them tagging each other in lovey dovey Facebook posts. I've been calling him out like crazy, texts, phone calls even went to his home but he continues to ignore me. I really feel like a fool and just used to a whole new level..

It's only 10 days, but I'm very excited as it took me a very long time to be able to afford to travel, which has always been a dream of mine since I was in elementary school. There are linked classes with it, and the professor is offering us the opportunity to do blog posts for extra credit. She's given us no information for the entire semester on how thorough she's expecting it to be, or what the format is. I think I'm getting around a mid/low C in her class as I didn't do very well with her specific teaching style, which will bring down my overall GPA. I feel like I'll regret not doing it because of my grades, and regret doing it when I'm sick of school and desperately want a break, and because I have wanted to do this for so long. She's a very demanding professor so while she hasn't seemed to take the extra credit very seriously thus far, I'm still expecting it to be fairly rigorous and time-intensive. We'd be doing them daily at our hotels; I don't know if this would feel like wasted time, although there will probably be a few others doing it. Time is running out and I feel if I waited for more information it would already be too late, as she wants us to let her know if we'll be participating in it soon. She won't be on the trip itself but I'm very sick of her, while at the same time being worried about how I did in her class. I don't think I'll realistically be going to grad school or something, but good grades are still important to me. What do you think? yes, I know I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing.

TL;DR: Going on a trip I've always wanted to go on. There's extra credit opportunities that will help my grade, but I'm sick of the class and won't experience something like this again, so I'm not sure if I should bother with the effort. ",07May2018,1

My mom isn't necessarily narcissistic, but she has a lot of things in common with some of the other parents I've read on here, so I'm kind of wondering if she is.  Anyway, I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with her.

So I'm 20, in my second year of college. Because of some roommate problems I've been forced to live with my parents and commute, which isn't ideal but was the option I was basically stuck with.

Both my parents were very willing to let me stay at home and seemed excited about the money they'd save. My mom asked me to do chores and keep things clean which was fine up until I started slipping. I'd forget to do chores a lot because I was busy, and this pissed her off.

She sat down with me in front of my little brother and told me exactly how much I cost them each month, and how they don't need to be paying that. She told me that her and my dad don't need to be paying for my schooling but they're good parents so they do. She turned to my little brother and asked him what he thought about everything, and when he asked why it mattered she said it was because if he wanted them to they would stop paying for my schooling. She ended the conversation with telling me to step up, because it's not fair for them to be doing this much for me and for me to do nothing in return.

I felt so shitty afterwards, like I was just a walking price tag to her. I really wanted to be able to pay for my schooling myself (I have a giant chunk out right now in student loans, and I'm paying 1/2 of my tuition money next year) but if I had to pay for it myself I wouldn't be able to go to school anymore. I'm grateful for their help, honestly.

So it's currently finals week, and I'm super busy and stressed and chores are the last thing on my mind, so for about and a week and a half I have been forgetting to do them outside of picking up after myself, and maybe the dishes. A few days ago my mom texted me angrily that I hadn't done them, and I said I would. At the end of this weekend she asked if I had done them again, and I apologized and said I forgot because of finals. I tried to talk to her about it and she interrupted me to say, ""No. This isn't cool. After this week were going to have a serious conversation.""

I guess I want advice on how to handle this, because I don't want to have the same conversation again because it made me feel so shitty. I am aware that it's my parent's house, and their rules and stuff, and I should try to help out. But sometimes I just forget.

382,"I took a new job in April 2017 due to feeling overworked and left with little opportunity for worthwhile \(i.e. financially lucrative\) advancement in my previous position. I’m a licensed counselor \(LCSW\) and had my masters’ at 23. I’ve always been an over achiever and forward thinker but at 29 i’m again finding myself burnt out and irritated for the second time in 2 years. 

I initially took my current position because it was a salary increase \(from $50k to $60k\), with less paperwork, fewer clients, no direct reports, comparable benefits, and a smaller service area. However, my PTO/holidays changed from 25 days PTO and 9 paid holidays to 20 days PTO and 7 paid holidays. For what it's worth, I was a part of a dynamic and fun team in my previous job. For the past year, however, I have been extremely bored in my new position. We are a “start up” company, which is something I had never had experience with prior to this. There are days where I literally have nothing to do. I spent the first 9 or so months finding things to fill my day. At that time, we were all required to report to the office every day. I stuck it out but hated every minute of watching the clock tick by every day and “sneaking out” of the office at 4:30pm. There were some toxic staff that were eventually let go but for the time they were with us, they made this time even more painful by dragging others into pointless disputes and generally permeating the office with their toxicity. My boss was \(and is\) sort of absent\-minded and didn’t spend the day checking in on any of us or training us for that matter. I’ve had only one 1:1 focused on performance evaluation since I started over a year ago. Any meeting is at my request. Furthermore, it was also clear from the beginning that other teams in the organization actively disliked her team and anyone associated with it \(including me\). The office environment was quite hostile with our administrator favoring another team. My team was not included in office activities and we were discouraged from learning the operations/roles of the other team. 

To be clear: the reason we were slow was due to the administrator not prioritizing paperwork needed to make our operation kosher with CMS. I blame the same organizational issues on her. No surprises there and despite this complaining on my part I realize that nothing about that component will change. More on this later…

Finally in December of 2017 I voluntarily went “part\-time” e.g. 30 hours per week so that I would be better able to fill my time and have to waste less time in the office. My partner is in a financial position where we are not dependent on my money to live—e.g. what I make is what I keep \(generally\). However, I live in a metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and want to be in a decent financial position. This part time status was meant to be temporary with the assumption I would go back to full time “when we get busy” and give me some breathing room in the meantime. This hasn’t happened. 

Fast forward to February 2018. My team was forced to merge with another company prematurely ahead of a larger corporate merger set to happen in 2019. Now I work from home \(because we were all displaced out of our previous office space\), basically watching Netflix, running errands, sun tanning, and stressing out that I’m not working. I typically go 2 weeks without seeing a coworker. In the same breath, there is nothing additional that I’m expected to do. However, we have to “time track” e.g. record what we do each day. Most of the time I write things like “research” or I find trainings to attend. We also have an 8am conference call each day where we go over our schedules. Its a very weird dynamic.

I’ve gone through 2 job searches in the past year since I started this position \(one 4 months in and another shortly before I went part time\). Both resulted in me being offered a job of similar pay \(but more intensive work—which makes me wonder if it would be too much of the other extreme\). Both times I hesitated and decided to wait it out a little longer. Despite my boss being aloof, I enjoy her as a person as well as my other coworkers. The new company we have merged with has a strange culture \(many are overly religious and could be described as ""intense\) but our interactions with them are minimal and I would say their intentions have been good.

Honestly I could go on and on as there are so many layers to this but i’ll save it.

I think while you are dating someone is something private, yoyr talks and pictures should remain between both of you. And the way he acted was just being \(sorry if I cant swear on this sub reddit\) an asshole.

Ok, this was end of February of this year,  and recently we started fighting about things we dont agree etc, and I'm thinking about telling the girl he is dating \(lets call him Pablo and the girl Camila\) about everything he sent of her to me. You might be asking at this point:

\-Why dont you just tell her? It seems like an obvious decision, but here are some points why I havent told Camila yet.

1\- Pablo started being suicidal last year.

2\- It is my ""fault"" the dating between both of them.

3\- I'm afraid even after Pablo sent me those pics and everything, he loves Camila and I would be ruining a ""perfect"" relationship.

4\- I have already talked with Camila, but she has no reason to trust me over Pablo, I mean, to her I'm just a stranger friend\(ish\) of Pablo.

Recently I found out that a close friend’s grandfather (Let’s call him G) accidentally killed a cop. 

From what I gather of this horrible event, the officer was helping someone fix a flat tire in the left lane of the highway. It was raining a lot the day the incident happened, G could not see what was ahead of him, his brakes weren’t working and, as a result, he slammed the car with the officer. 

The officer was a husband and father of two. He was just getting out of work when he saw that a person was in need of service when his tire broke.

G was not taken to jail nor charged. He was not DUI; he never had any problems with the law, truly the opposite. He’s an incredible human being who every friend and family he has loves him dearly. I’ve known this man for a long time and can say he’s a good person.

When these things would happen, I knew that my brother, who struggles to make friends, would often feel alone and overwhelmed, so I would always listen and provide advice very gently. 

Now he’s an adult, and things are on a different level. Fights are serious now, and he throws out hurtful things as if he has no idea how hurtful they are. He told my stepmom that he would rather my mom’s boyfriend move him into college than her (terribly hurtful as  we aren’t close with him). He asks for “just dad-son time” in front of her, and once said in front of her parents that he likes being at our mom’s place better (again, terribly hurtful - my mom’s home is stressful, emotionally abusive, and we are not cared for there - hence why he moved out). With my dad, he makes it seem as if he feels unloved and unwanted, which is VERY upsetting to my dad because he goes ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure we are supported, encouraged, and taken care of. He is working overtime to help pay for his tuition and drives crazy distances just to take my brother to lunch. He tells us he loves us every day. 

Tension is building between brother and dad, brother and stepmom, and now dad and stepmom. I know they’re fighting a lot, and I know she’s unhappy in the house now that my brother is home for the summer. My stepmom has a temper, which she usually keeps under check, but one of these days my brother will say something truly awful, she’ll say something less hurtful but he’ll think it’s worse, and they’ll never be able to mend that (they both hold grudges like you wouldn't believe). Or, she’ll break down and move out. 

The problem is, my brother cannot handle guilt. He will feel absolutely destroyed if he realizes he’s the one in the wrong, but that’s even if he accepts it. 99% of the time, trying to make him see what he’s done causes him to be offended that you would think he’s so horrible, or ganged up on because “everyone’s against him”. That’s why I always listen while he vents and then told him what he's done wrong gently, but I can no longer do that. None of it gets through to him, and in the process he is hurting our family, making a happy home unhappy, and damaging relationships that aren’t even his own. He struggles with depression and isolation, and I fear that I could push him away and make things worse, as I’m one of only two people he feels he can talk to in the world, but none of us know how to get through with him and at this point his treatment of my stepmom and dad is borderline abusive.

TLDR: How do you get through to someone who you love, who is hurting people you love, when they struggle to accept fault for anything and become tremendously guilty when they do? How do you give them tough love, because the gentle approach isn’t working, without making them feel more alone? ",07May2018,2
392,"So, I am an incoming freshman at JJay College in NYC. Currently, I live in Louisiana, which means that I’m going to have to move to NYC in the fall soon. But because of advisement and orientation during the summer, I would have to visit NYC multiple times, which is pretty costly. 

I have recently made a little plan to just go ahead and move to NYC this summer so I wouldn’t have to go back and forth from Louisiana and NYC. However, since I’m 17, have no work experience, and do not have any family in NYC, it’s gonna be pretty tough finding a place to live at. If I do find a place, I do plan on getting a job, whether it’s scrubbing toilets or washing dishes.  But I’m not really sure if anyone would be willing to let me room with them.

Now I can’t do that as easily, like I can have strong feelings for someone but now I’m so hesitant with telling him if something is wrong. I’ve been single for awhile because at the end of my last relationship and a couple of months after that I didn’t care for a lot of things I just gave up on everything. Now I’m scared to date, I’m afraid I’m gonna hurt someone again and end up in my own head and just give up. I loved my last boyfriend but I gave up with no reason I shut him out without realizing it until I figured out I wasn’t happy at all at the end which made him break up with me and I didn’t feel sad I was emotionless about it. Now when I’m single I’m not in my head all the time and if I am it’s nothing bad. But now I’ve been talking to this guy and I like him but only sometimes I’m actually happy and most times I have to put a fake face on. I can feel myself going threw the same thing I did before, I can feel myself about to shut everyone out again and It just feels like when that happens I have this big wall up where I just stop everyone from trying to break down that wall. Which causes me not to date at all cause I’m just comfortable that way. It’s like I stop everyone from getting in my head.

No apology or anything. This kind of thing doesn’t just happen in my romantic relationship, it happens in my familial relationships too. For example, my grandmother comments on my size whenever I have dinner at her house and it’s hurtful to me. Why don’t they apologize? Is because they meant what they said or they don’t think that they said anything wrong?

He's overall an inconsiderate person and he makes life miserable for me. We share a room, by the way. The manipulation stems from any time I try to ask him to quit doing something. If I beg him to shower, I'm ignored. If I get pissed off, he laughs at me and says ""have fun with that."" He constantly whistles, which he knows pisses me off. I've tried to beg my parents for help, to no avail. When I'm just casually asking him to stop doing something, he'll tell me to calm down, that I'm overreacting.

406,"This is my first time posting, so forgive me if I mess something up.
I also apologise for this being long, I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'll give a tiny bit of backstory first.
My coworkers(F) boyfriend of 5 years broke up with her a month or so ago.
It's a very vague breakup, from what I know.
Meaning, for at least a week she didn't know it was a breakup.
But he also seems to ""hold onto her"", in the sense of sending her very mixed messages (she's still incredibly hopeful he will suddenly take her back).
For example, wanting space, but wanting her to text him more.
So ofcourse, she texts him almost non-stop now; to the point were everyone in the company can tell her keeping contact with him hurts her and breaks her more.
From what I've heard of her stories, it seems to me that he's keeping her as a back-up plan if he can't get with one of their mutual friends.
I'm incredibly worried for her, and for her (mental) health.
She is not ready to move on, and keeps herself wallowing in her sorrow.
I understand this, and while I support her where I can, I leave her the space she needs.

Here's the problem itself.
While I feel incredibly sad for her, and I completely understand her sadness, she becomes too distracting during work.
Distracting by sighing loudly, by cursing under her breath, and generally showing her sadness quite loudly.
I know I sound like a complete dick for this, and I feel truly terrible about it.
However, I feel like it's not only just distracting me from working- I sit diagonally across from her and because of the placement she is right in my view, and I can't ignore her.
Even when I wear headphones and listen to my music, I cannot put it loud enough to cancel out her sighing and cursing.
It's gotten to the point where I also feel myself getting more down when around her, and I can't stop myself from worrying more and more about her.
I want to help her, but she doesn't want help.
I realise I should let it go, and I'm trying to, but now it's impossible to ignore her sadness.
How can I deal with this situation better?
How can I ignore her better, while staying appropriate and not blocking her out rudely? 

TL;DR
Colleague is going through a rough break-up, doesn't want help or support.
I try to let her be, but she's quite distracting in her sadness.
What can I do to ignore her better, while staying appropriate? ",07May2018,1
407,"I’m 19, she’s 24, so in essence she’s the mature one. Welp, I don’t know, maybe sometimes ? But I’m the last few years I feel like I’ve drifted from her a bit because she is just becoming more and more of a drama queen by the day.

Please don’t say I’m ‘mean’ because over the years I’ve never said anything straight up against her and just give her my genuine advice. Which she probably has literally never taken.

So I’m texted constantly because either she’s tired, her work is boring, her boyfriend is being a butt (which happens like twice a week because they’re both immature as holy hell), and some other shit when she’s at home.

Oh I might as well mention she still lives with the parents and me... so there’s that. And she’s been blatantly shittt with them too. 
I know they have their quirks and I know right from wrong, so if they call me out on something stupid I’m just like “guys stop”, if they say anything to her, you’ll be in for a long ass conversation with her just shouting random shit and being pissed.

That’s what happens when you disagree with her, so I just don’t say shit now cause I’m over it and I wish she’d just leave me alone.

But obviously I can’t say get away from me without her hating me forever sooooo, any ideas ?

*Specifically I have questions about:*

\- Dating. \(I've dated 2 guys in middle school, for reference ig\). **When did you guys start dating in hs? Is it wise to date in my first yr. of high school, or should I just wait? Do senior guys actually go for freshmen girls? This is kind of off topic, but I wanna have more guy friends, is it difficult to make them being a female?** \(I have very similar interests w/ the average guy lmao, I usually connect with guys better than girls\).

\- Making friends \(There's **2,000 students** at my high school, there's roughly 500 kids per class\). Anyway, I have barely any friends in middle school, but I have many close friends outside of school. I used to be apart of a friend group, but I left because they made me feel like shit. I now hang out with a few friends, we're not a group though. I talk to anyone at recess, mostly. I'm fairly shy when it comes to new environments, but if there's a situation where there's a chance of communication, I'd say something. Once I get comfortable with my surroundings, I'm very open and social. But, I'm wayy too shy to randomly strike up a conversation with someone random, but I'm working on it lol**. Should I just fuck it, and sit with someone random on the bus on the first day of school? Also, what do I do at lunch on the first day of school, I won't have anyone to sit with, so should I just randomly ask someone maybe? Is finding a friend group difficult as wel**l? 

\- **Should I take honors classes?** I don't think they'll overwhelm me, but I'm just wondering if it'll make a difference in the long run.

416,"(Sorry I'm advance - on mobile)

I'm a married 30F, living in a booming tech city, with an amazing husband and toddler. 

I love so many things about our lives. For one, I LOVE my job and my boss. It's an extremely low stress work environment with lucrative pay and extraordinary flexibility. I'm able to spend the majority of my days with my toddler, while still maintaining my career. 

My husband also got his foot in the door in a company (without a college degree) and has worked his way to an also lucrative position that he enjoys. 

I of course love my little family and couldn't imagine a greater life to come home to. We're beyond comfortable and even in the fast pace tech field, if we were to lose our jobs tomorrow, we would easily be able to find another within days due to the amount of technology companies in the area. 

However, I'm not from this state. Nearly the entirety of my large family lives back in or around where I grew up. It's a much smaller midwest area with not a lot of opportunities. But I am so incredibly lonely without family. I feel like a shell or who I used to be without being around family regularly. My husband has a very small family, just his parents and a sibling and I dont particularly enjoy being around my MIL, so it doesnt help ease the pain of missing my family. 

We've talked for a couple of years about giving it a shot moving back, but my main concerns would be:

1. Sacrificing our job security. We'd move to a suburb of a larger city that is still within an hour or so of my family, but the technology jobs are not as prevalent and there is a fear that we could be without jobs at any given time. 

2. Losing the jobs we love to find out we hate potential new positions. 

3. I lose my flexible schedule and invaluable time with my child. 

4. Without a degree, my husband may or may not be able to get another job of the same caliber. 

5. Potentially earning less and not living as comfortably as we do now. 

The loneliness is somewhat devastating and we are likely only having 1 child, so I'd love for my toddler to grow up around cousins at the very least. 

I just wonder if anyone has personal experience with a similar matter? It seems like we would be risking so much just so I can be closer to my family. It's also probably relevant to note that my grandparents are like parents to me and I lost my grandpa last year and I'm full of regret for not moving back sooner and spending more time with him. I now feel like I need to move back to be around my grandma as much as I can before she's gone and my dads health is also questionable. 

Any advice and personal insight is beyond appreciated. This feels like one of those major life decisions that I don't feel in any way prepared to make. ",07May2018,1
417,"[Some context] Since October 2017, I have been at my first full-time job working as an apprentice. I am the youngest person working within the team by quite a few years. I thoroughly enjoy my job and know that this is what I want to focus on from a career aspect, and my store director has approached me on multiple occasions about funding future training once my apprenticeship has ended. 

From the beginning, there have been a group of women (late twenties-early thirties) who have taken an extreme dislike for me. They often talk about me when I am in earshot, exclude me, undermine my contributions and other subtly cruel and catty things. Despite this being hurtful, it has been relatively easy to ignore as there were many other people who I got on well with. 

One of these individuals I get on well with is a man called *Chris. For the last few months, we have become good work friends as he often gives me much appreciated advice and support. Chris has worked in the company for 12 years and has a degree in the field and is easily the most experienced member of staff. Chris does not get on with many people at work, he often can come off as arrogant, moody and is incredibly deadpan and sarcastic. Other colleagues seem to be surprised that we get on so well as personality wise we are very different. Chris effectively took me under his wing in terms of training, and he often spends quite a bit of time with me, helping me write case studies and essays I complete for my apprenticeship coursework. He jokes with me a lot, and often approaches me to make conversation which I have noticed he does not do often with others. This has also caught the attention of other people we work with. 

Perhaps it is my own naivety, but I am certain that he does not have bad intentions. In my eyes, our interactions are not flirtatious. However, over the last three months there has been mounting suspicion that we are having relations out of work. This is entirely false and it seems that these rumours have stemmed from the same group of women as mentioned above. One of the women, *Sarah, seems to be the instigator. Sarah has even contacted Chris' partner (with whom he has two children) and told her that he was having an affair. Chris has also informed me that former coworkers of his who have since moved to different branches within the company have approached him and have asked if these rumours are true. What concerns me the most is how these allegations have spread outside of our office and that there are people who I do not even know discussing what we have supposedly done. 

What I find most frustrating is how unconcerned Chris is, he often jokes about me being a ""homewrecker"" or refers to me as his ""other woman"" and seems to incite these rumours by showing off, especially to our male colleagues. Chis often tells me how much he dislikes the company and his plans on leaving within the next few months. I have expressed to him that I am unhappy with the way he is handling the situation, and that seems to get off on the ego boost and notoriety. 

My career is only just beginning and I am afraid that I will be fired due to these accusations. These rumours have also sparked other discussion as to whether I am sleeping with managers and other coworkers to get ahead. My workplace feels incredibly hostile and I do not know who I can trust. These rumours have been incredibly demeaning, the women view me as a threat, some of the men avoid me because they think I am dangerous, whilst others make unwanted advances towards me because they think I am easy. 

I thought that by entering the workplace, I would escape this trivial drama that is reminiscent of being at school. My reputation has been severely impacted and I do not know how I can recover. I feel extremely isolated and alone at work, I have tried to cut myself off from Chris, but this seems to arouse more suspicion. I do not know how I can resolve this situation and prove to others that I am not who they think I am.

Unbeknown to me they embarked upon a secret relationship which I found out about 4 months down the line.

There has been a long\-running family joke that I will marry one of my brothers best friends that only continues because my brother cant stand the idea of it. When I found out about my bro and good pal we ended up having an argument because of our differences of opinion when it comes to dating each others friends. Its not like I have had any intentions to sleep with/date any of his friends but I'm of the opinion that my sex life is none of his business and surely if someone is your friend they can be trusted as a decent person for your sibling to date.

My brother went travelling with a few mates at the beginning of the year and is still away but two of his mates came back at the weekend, we all met up last night to catch up about their trip. The three of us ended up getting quite drunk and I slept with one of them while the other was in the house. There has never been any sign of us being more than friends before so we agreed it was best to forget it happened and not tell anyone about it.

420,"This is by far the worst and most depressing day in my life. I had a pretty tough weekend even before this had went down. I honestly just felt sick from partying the night before and that same night I almost blacked out so I felt very ashamed of myself. I think this came from all the work I been doing, starting to feel the pressure at school, hanging around with the wrong people so I decided to get hammered and forget about it all for a little. I wake up today at 09:00 and as I am late for the train I start running towards the train station so I can catch the next one. I do not really look at any of the people waiting on the train, just minding my own business as I always do. Then from a far distance I hear the train uses it horn and it was kinda strange since I never heard that sound before. I turn around just to make sure I am not standing too close to the tracks and I was right - I stood far away from the tracks. Then the horn goes again and this time as I turn my head I see this poor girl laying down on the track. She is 4 feet away from me. I fucking lost my mind and I can not get the pictures of my head. How did I not see her in time, is it possible that nobody seen her going down. I just started screaming and no words can describe the feeling that went through my body. I already seeked for for professional help but writing this down makes it a little easier for some reason. I don't know how to handle the situation, I am a emotional person so this literally took the soul out of me. I am gonna live with this for the rest of my life and always thinking how did I not see her in time, how is it possible that nobody reacted to this. 

I am completely lost for words, traumatized. ",07May2018,874
421,"Hi guys, so my sister is an adult, just finished her masters, lives at home and landed her first job - overall doing well. But recently, she's swapped many of her old friends for these new guys who do a multitude drugs and pressure her into doing them with her (on top of making fun of her and it's been taking a toll on her self-worth). 

She agrees too, she know's she's unhappier when they're around, but has fallen for one (with a girlfriend) and he has her doing drugs (molly, coke, LSD, etc.) too. 

My friends say I can do nothing, and I have to let her make her own mistakes, and I've been trying that for months now...but she spent the weekend in a literal crack house doing LSD, coke etc, etc and came home to tell me how horrible it was...so I feel lost. I hate to see this happen to her and my advice seems to do nothing. 

Is there anything you guys think I can do or say? Or should I just let her make her mistakes like my friends say..? Or just any new perspectives would help!

Just to provide some background, she has very large breasts and gets teased a lot for it, and teased in general, by my lunch table.  Sometimes she laughs it off but other times it becomes obvious that its going to far.

He has asked me to bring my highschool diploma, social security card, military ID, and he already has a copy of my birth certificate.

Then, in the space of two years when I was aged 10\-12, my four closest friends all moved away. Everybody else had friends. I had no idea how to break into established groups, I was picked on for being weird and I stopped talking at school.

Now 15 years later and I've spent all of that time completely socially isolated. I have no friends or even acquaintances. I've spent almost all of my free time, for 15 years, reading forums. Never posting so I don't even have any friends online.

438,"This is more of one of those things that pops into my head late at night and keeps me up. My grandpa was the most amazing man. He passed from Parkinson’s two Christmases ago. In his final days he was in hospital and it was difficult seeing him at the mercy of the people surrounding him. But he was amazing, and never complained. 

My grandfather had some skin issues and had seen a dermatologist but it was determined that it wasn’t impacting his health and he wasn’t bothered by it so it was left as is, Parkinson’s was the priority. Flash forward to a morning in the hospital when we go to visit, and a nurse had decided to do something about his skin. Without going into too much detail, he had obviously  been poked and prodded at on his face and it looked uncomfortable. 

My mother was mad, she is an RN, but I think the emotions of losing her father far exceeded the emotion of this nurse’s actions. She told the head of the unit and they said they would deal with it. 

I think what bothers me is thinking 1) that a nurse decided to take something into her own hands when it was the responsibility of a doctor and 2) that my grandpa, in a physically compromised situation due to his disease, had to go through that - he didn’t have a choice. I am wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. It’s obviously not the biggest problem in the world but it makes me furious every time it crosses my mind.

439,"My boyfriend has his mother staying in my house. She has a dog, which is very hyper and all over everything. I wasn't asked and I definitely would not be okay with the situation if I had been, but I am now in the situation. They are staying for two weeks. I am not comfortable with the dog being upstairs. I noticed my boyfriend taking down the dog gate on the stairs and asked why--she firmly insisted that no, the dog is sleeping with her upstairs (in the guest room). Would it have been fine alone downstairs? Yes. It even had a bed down there. My boyfriend then ""took the fall"" and said he misunderstood that I did not want the dog upstairs. He knew and he was covering. I voiced my concerns several times to all of them before this....

I have two rabbits. One is fine, having come from a shelter and used to all animal sounds. The other is terrified of dogs. The dog is small, but bigger than my rabbits. Could it eat them or seriously injure them? Absolutely. In preparation for this situation, I moved my rabbits from their normal space into my bedroom upstairs and shut the doors to keep the dog out in case it escaped from the mother. I had bought a lock for the door, but it was difficult to install and I couldn't do it. My boyfriend said he would keep the door shut and make sure they were okay while I was at work. My rabbit that is afraid of dogs freaked out after smelling the dog in the house about 15 minutes after the dog entered the house; she ran in circles, panting and hiding, and also flinging herself into the sides of the cage. I've never seen my rabbit do that before. I stayed with her and calmed her down; later she also seemed calmer. She hasn't done it again and seems okay. Both rabbits are extremely happy to have me in the room.  

I work all day. My boyfriend sent me e-mails saying that the dog smells the rabbits and is trying to find the rabbits; I know he thinks of it as ""oh look what the dog is doing"" and doesn't believe the rabbits are in any danger because the doors are closed and thankfully, the dog is not being allowed upstairs during the day (or at all outside of sleeping with my boyfriend's mother in her room at night). The dog gate is on the stairs, preventing the dog from going up unless his mother takes him up.

I don't have the option to put them in a hotel, they will not board the dog (they drove 15 hours to keep the dog with her rather than flying 2 hours and boarding the dog). I have no one that I can entrust my rabbits to nearby and debated boarding them, but thought I could control the situation as long as the dog was not allowed upstairs at all. I also thought it would cause even more stress to them, which can kill them (thinking the dog wouldn't be allowed upstairs, at least they would be in a familiar space in my room).

Am I making the wrong decision keeping the rabbits at my house in my room? Would boarding them be more stressful to them? At least right now, they are in a familiar place. The dog+his mother are here for two weeks. Talk me through this. My rabbits are my babies. The dog+mother have been here one night so far.",07May2018,1

Here it is my short story.

Hello everyone. I’m 19 years old male and bachelor student at university. I’ve had messed up childhood and I don’t have a great relationship with my actual family, I’ve broken my relationships with them since my age 12. Three years ago I committed suicide with ODs and alcohol but I couldn’t succeed it. I want to emphasize that I didn’t like any teacher in my school life, even I hated some of them. So, I’ve never had a role model for me that I looked up to. However, last year I met one of the best persons in the world. She was my first teacher in my university life, and when I was thinking about suicide again - her existence saved my life. She inspired me so much, I’ve learned so much priceless things from her. After several months passed I started to see her as my mother, it was so deep to me because she was the first elder person that I love and respect kindly. As someone- who had messed up childhood and family, was kicked out on the streets - all the things were amazing to me, she was amazing to me. Whenever I saw her I always got happy and her existance in my life made my life better. I’m not seeing her anymore because my schedule is changed and she isnt teaching to me. And I’m depressed and suicidal again, because everytime my old childhood memories comes in front of my eyes. I feel like she is going to save my life again. I’m thinking about to tell my story and my feelings about her, because all I needed in my life was that person, that MOTHER. Please dont get it wrong, she has a great family and im not feeling any romantic feelings towards to her. I love her as motherly way, because in my whole life I always had poor relationship with my mother. I have searched on internet and some people said that it is infatuation and it will pass. What should I do? Is it normal? Should I tell my story and my feelings to her? What would be her reaction? Please help me.",07May2018,1

I’m in my mid 20s, I live in a very conservative muslim society. 
And though I’m not a religious person, but I saved my self till marriage cuz in my society if a girl lost her virginity before marriage she can be killed “literally”.
I always thought that god isn’t real but society is real, so I was scared to do anything wrong and I saved myself till marriage. 
I met a nice guy and he never tried to have sex before marriage cause he too understand how our society works. 
However two months earlier we got married, and my problems started, I really like and love my husband. But every time we try to have sex I get scared and nervous. And he can’t get inside no matter how he tries to. 
At the beginning we thought I was scared because I always thought the first time is gonna be painful. 
We went to a doctor and she said I have some kind of “phobia” and that I’m uncontrollably closing my vaginal muscles. 
I tried to relax as much as possible. But we still have the same issue, even though the doctor broke the hymen to make things easier. 
my honeymoon became a nightmare. 
I don’t know what’s wrong with me, and I don’t know how to solve this.

454,"For a long time I've been a very passive, unadventurous consumer type of guy. I do what I have to do. I go to work. I go to appointments, etc. The rest of the time I mostly just try to distract myself with entertainment and sleeping. I want to better myself. I want to be more cultured, physically fit, educated, ambitious, etc. I want more friends and more life. 

But I don't HAVE to do any of that, and it's all far outside my comfort zone. More importantly I always have an out. I always have some form of instant gratification to turn to. 

For example since about 2007 I've been trying to express myself through writing as a hobby. I'm not talking about the great American novel or anything, I'm talking like... Pokemon fanfiction, and the like. I haven't finished anything at all, not even a single chapter. I don't know if I can describe how intimidating it is, and it's so easy for me to just play a videogame or go for a walk instead.

How do I stop this? How do I sit down and FORCE myself to do things that are good for me when a huge part of me doesn't want to? ",07May2018,1

456,"So me and her broke up our long distance after 6 months back in February. 2 months later, I was seeking her help because I was in a dark state of mind: my cat of close to 15 years was put down and I was an emotional mess and had no one to talk to, besides family. I reached out to her and we got back to talking again. I learned that she didn’t take our break up well and had sex with a couple of guys. Although I didn’t mind that, I did mind us reconnecting and (emotionally) bonding again. We started to talk almost every night again and. We also both agreed to just stay as friends but if we needed one another, we’d know how to reach the other anytime.

She works 7 days a week with 2 jobs. One at Walmart and the other at a nursing home. She’s also dealing with career struggles, depression and self loving issues regarding her body image and how nobody wants her in her life.

Fast forward to today where she messaged me that she wanted to ‘sleep forever.’ Mind you all that we have a 2 hour time zone difference between us. She messaged me that she cried herself to sleep and was still crying and that she was contemplating on killing herself. It was 1 PM my time when I began to talk to her about not doing anything to harm herself. She then didn’t respond for another 3 hours and all I said was to ‘please don’t do this to yourself’

The previous day, I ignored her because she went out with her BFF to celebrate cinco de mayo (even though I told her to not because she needed to rest for Monday double shift and cause she had an all nighter at her nursing home) and that she wasn’t being sincere when I was feeling down about me thinking about my cat. We didn’t talk that night but did text. She was busy all day and night at Walmart and I had to wake up early for work so thus we didn’t talk and only said out good nights thinking that everything was cool.

Around the time I was clocking out of my job, she texted me again (relieved that she didn’t killed herself) but was still acting and talking suicidal about how she hates her life, that she’s fat and ugly and will never be loved. I begged her to not think that way, reassured her and told her that she means a lot to her family and friends and even me. It began to get to the point that I wasn’t reaching to her enough and she didn’t want to reach out to anyone. She only wanted me to know that she was going to kill herself and I didn’t wanted that to happen.

So I screenshot out text message and contacted her BFF and sister. Is Facebook messenger, whom which I never met and talked to until today, and sent them both the messages she was texting. Little later she called me to cuss at me at how i ‘betrayed her trust’ and that she ‘never wants to talk to me again.’ After that, I decided not to provoke her anymore and let her friend and sister help her from here on out, both of which thanked me for reaching out to them. 

I know that she cared for me and all but part of me feels a bit guilty that I betrayed her. And that I provoked her to feel the need to take her life. What I’m really asking here is advice on if I made the right decision to contact her family and bff, even if it now costed me her trust and friendship with her. ",07May2018,1

459,"My teenage years now adult hood my friends will express their feelings towards me. Happens at all time even when I’m in a relationship.

For me it always goes three ways:
•Strengthens the friendship 
•Ruins it the friendship 
•Becomes a side thing

Most of the time I don’t feel the same towards them. I don’t even notice how it becomes this way. It just happens. It gets awkward for me at times, I start to close myself in and not wanting to talk about it or them.

It also makes me hate myself a bit. I don’t understand what I’m doing for them to feel something towards me. I’m just being me. It just happens so often it makes me cry. I just want to be friends nothing more. ",07May2018,1

I feel really lost for some reason, i lost interest in everything and nothing feels good anymore, nothing even feels bad 
Sorry this start could be misleading, let me explain it in details, so i quit uni because i simply lost interest in what i was studying there and i couldn't keep up with it and pretty much was just failing so decided to quit and now i'm waiting for registration for unis to open up again so i could sign up for something else, maybe something that could keep me interested. The thing is i don't regret quitting yet i wish i stayed, and i feel really empty having nothing, doing nothing, no interest to do anything, nothing feels satisfactory, nothing feels worth it, it's just everything seems really dull to me at this point, i go out for a walk and regret it after few minutes then wish i never left home, i play a video game and throw it after few minutes cause i lost interest, i get in relationship and break up after few weeks cause lost interest, its just this interest losing thingy is seriously fucking my life up at this point and could even make it worse if it stays like this, i don't feel sad nor happy yet i feel like i'm so anxious about literally nothing, like something is stuck in my chest that's why im writing this rn i just want a relief i even feel like crying yet no tears comes out, i think im just being a pussy or something but idk what to do, i don't even think of suicide or anything like that but i don't like living either, i hate waking up in the morning having absolutely no goals or dreams or something in mind to do, i always have that feeling that there is more to life than just this.

462,"I'm in my 20s, and I live at home with my parents and help take care of them. I do a lot of the work around the house, help them get to doctors, emotionally support them. I do more than my older sister because she has her own home and family of her own. My mom tries her best, but honestly she is emotionally abusive. She always expects me to magically do whatever she needs without asking, or respond to any questions happily with the answer she wants, and if I forget to do something without her asking/if I don't smile/if I don't realize and give the answer she's fishing for, she gets extremely upset and angry. I have anxiety, so when she does that, I feel like a horrible awful person who shouldn't exist because I'm 'hurting' someone so much (even though that is illogical, and just my anxiety). It can be over things as little as turning on the heater, or spilling a few drops of pop, or forgetting to make her coffee when I'm making myself a cup. The few times I have confronted her about it, she's cried and talked as if She were the worst person in the world, contemplated killing herself, and implied I hated her and would never talk to her again. 

My mom also has yelled at me for crying, or frowning, or mentioning anything even a little stressful I feel, since I was 12. She tries to be supportive sometimes, because I got an ulcer and chest pain for a year this year from stress, and encouraged me to cry or scream like her or talk it out. But then right after asking me to not bottle my stress, I offhandedly mentioned maybe doing a gym once I had more money in a few months when school's done, and she screamed that I had nothing to stress over and it wasn't her fault I don't have money and that I should be happy.  I have a lot of anxiety around not being perfect/not making everyone else happy, so of course that made me feel horrible for feeling anything or mentioning anything, and I haven't mentioned anything since. 

She is aging, is going through a lot of pain and ailments in her old age, and realistically she's just as susceptible to anxiety and depression as me. I recognize that I should not put up with this from her, and I should not feel horribly guilty when she gets upset. But at the same time, I do love her and care about her, and I understand she's scared and lashing out because she doesn't know how to cope with what she's going through. My friend's mother was like this for a few years, always lashing out at her as she helped her mom, until her mom died. But despite all that, she still misses her mom and is glad for the time they had together.

I love my mom, and I want a relationship with her, I want her to feel loved and supported, and I want her to have a happy life where I'm in it and she's alive for a long while. But I also know that the way she treats me, in combination with my anxiety, definitely pushes my anxiety to the point I'm at risk of self harm or worse. I really would prefer not to cut her out of my life, because I take care of her - and I'm the one that encourages my dad to and tells him how to support her emotionally. And I don't want her to hate me for not talking to her, or to think she's unloved, or to hurt herself. But I know I can't handle the situation I'm in. And I have no idea how to handle my anxiety that gets triggered by making people upset/in combo with her getting upset over anything and everything because she's frustrated with her life. I know its not really directed at me. But my anxiety makes me feel like I should destroy myself whenever I make her upset like that.",07May2018,1
464,"I'm 18, a guy, few months left and then I graduate. Since February I've been feeling extremely tired, as well as emotional fatigue and sadness in general.

A little background: I have been seeing a doctor for my depression for a little less than a year. I just failed several to all of my classes in college. I have trouble actually talking about my struggles. Here’s what I have so far.

“I haven’t been honest with the both of you. In part because I find it difficult to talk to you in person or on the phone about things I struggle with.

I believe it was a mistake to go back to school while not on a stable treatment plan; dealing with the transitional effects from starting various medications and the withdrawal effects from stopping them has made this past semester very difficult. So difficult that I am unsure which if any of the classes I took I will receive a passing grade for.

I know that this is on me, and while the effects mentioned before might have made things more difficult the fault is ultimately my own. 

I’m unsure if you two will continue to support my pursuit of college given this failing, and I understand if you do not. If you do I know I am not ready to go back at this moment in time. 

I believe the best course of action for me currently is to continue seeking a stable treatment plan and working on communication between us. Also during this time I should seek employment, the nature of which dependent on if college is still an option in the future.”",07May2018,5
