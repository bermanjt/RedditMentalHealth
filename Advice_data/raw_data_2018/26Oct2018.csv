0,"I’ve always given cash as a gift for weddings I’ve attended. However I attended (and was in) a wedding a little over two months ago that I picked a gift off of their Macy’s online registry and had it sent to them about a month before the wedding since I live across the country. 

There was an email confirmation of the order and I had tracking info and everything so I know it was delivered. However it was never mentioned to me and two months later, I still haven’t received a thank you card and am beginning to worry they didn’t receive it and think I didn’t get them anything.

How does an online registry work? Would they have known it was from me just by having it delivered to their door? I don’t specifically remember having a spot to write a note when placing the order online either. 

I want to ask other friends who also attended if they received a thank you card yet but haven’t always had a lot of money and feel as though when they got married I didn’t give them enough cash and don’t feel right asking them. 

Can I simply text my friend to see if he ever got the gift or should I wait a little longer to see if I get a card. I don’t care that I never received a thank you card from them, I’m just worried that something happened to the gift I sent and they never got it. Or are they sitting around wondering who this gift is from because my name wasn’t anywhere in the package?

Anyone out there able to offer some advice on what I should do? 

Thanks! ",26Oct2018,1
1,"Hello,

My dad told me that in my senior year of high school, he would take me to wherever I want to go. I said my top choice was Egypt, and he said he’d look into the political situation. The last week he’s been telling me to think of a second choice, and I honestly don’t know enough about the world to choose. Everyday he’s been saying “you can go to Egypt, but be prepared to spend the best 60 years of your life in prison, or die in a terrorist attack.” I desperately tried to think of second options. Then today he told me he made a $3000 deposit in a trip to Egypt, and said “So I hope you’re ready to be locked up.” I said something about how I didn’t want to go if it would be a risk, and he yelled at me. He said I better have a clue next week of where I want to go or he’ll take the $3000 from my allowance (that’s how much I own). 

Any advice?",26Oct2018,1
2,"Okay so. I’m kinda between a rock and a hard place with Mason, my cat. He’s a little over a year old, and we got him from the shelter when he was about six months.
He’s normally great with Keanu, my kitten. But lately he’s been getting ultra aggressive with Lando, my roommates dog, to the point that Mason bites him and he’s not play biting. Today he made Keanu cry because he bit him, hard, when Keanu tried to pass by him to climb into Keanu’s bed. 

Last night my husband tried to pick him up, and Mason bit him, and tore up his hand. His hand is pretty messed up. He’s been getting more and more aggressive over the past few months, and I can’t figure out why.
He used to be super cuddly and affectionate and now if you approach him after dark, he’s spiteful and hissing and angry. He mostly hides during the day and only comes out for food or treats, and even then if you move too fast he runs off.

He’s been tearing up the carpet by the doors, even though he has scratching posts and plenty of toys that he loves to play with, and now there’s a sizable hole by my bedroom door. 

I’m at a loss here. He either runs off or hisses at my husband, and I’m worried Mason might hurt someone, or my roommates dog, in the long run. 


I’m thinking it may be better for Mason to be in a single pet home, cause I’m seriously concerned for the safety of my roommates animal plus my other cat.

If anyone has any advice or ideas, I’m all ears. 
He hates wearing collars and actually clawed my arm when I tried to put one on him, and spray bottles only seem to make him more determined to tear up stuff when we aren’t around to correct him. ",26Oct2018,1
3,"So we met on tinder and have been talking every day. I have yet to find someone I feel I can talk to in the same way I can with her. And she’s even shared deeply personal things with me! We even kind of talked about a relationship. Just last night she told me how she kept thinking about me. Just now I got a message from her saying that she went on a date and that it was a success. What!?

I never really made it clear I’m interested, I think. How should I handle this? The problem is: I have Aspergers so this feels like a once in... hm... perhaps once every other decade? I’m not going to say once in a lifetime anyway. We have a lot in common. A lot of the same interests. I’m in my twenties and haven’t even been close to having a romantic relationship. This is the closest I’ve been. 

Should I let this go, or should I tell her I’m interested?",26Oct2018,1
4,Okay so I am 16 years old and still have not gotten my license yet (I have my permit) simply because I am too afraid to drive. I was involved in a minor accident a little over a year ago and up until that point I was actually really excited to drive and would actually drive almost daily but after this happened I was terrified. I would drive very rarely and when I had built up the courage to actually drive I would always instantly become afraid of getting into another accident. At this point I’d say it’s been around 2 or 3 months since the last time I’ve gotten behind the wheel and as much as I want to start driving again I’m still afraid of possibly getting into another accident. Does anyone know what I can do to help gain the confidence to drive again? Thanks so much for helping...,26Oct2018,1
5,"So I went to a really small school with small classes where you basically had to become friends with everyone in the class. This kid came to the school a few years back and like everyone else I became friends with him. Eventually, I left the school but he’s still trying to keep in contact with me. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t have become friends with him in the first place because we just aren’t alike or really compatible but now he thinks I’m one of his best friends.

7,"It might sound like a blessing but it’s far from that. I’ve only realized this within the last year or so. Let me give some background context: I am a 20 year old African American male in college, struggling with grades. I know i am every bit as capable of getting great grades as anyone else is but for some reason seeing myself fail just doesn’t make me want to change and I am officially lost as to why. I don’t get stressed when an assignment is close to being due and i have done anything on it etc. I feel like I don’t actually even know what stress feels like. My father is from the heart of ghana and people there are naturally extreme calm and collected so I’ve always figured that’s where I got it from but It just is ruining me but for some reason I don’t care. To keep this clear though, i have a very tough time believing it’s depression because I go out with friends a lot, I workout almost daily, In general I am just a very happy person.
Hopefully with whatever advice I get, it can also be used to help others in my situation.",26Oct2018,1

9,"Today I noticed a couple of emails blackmailing me for a pretty large amount of money. Usually I'll skip these emails and not bother with them, but this one caught my attention. It's addressed from my email, and to an old password that I haven't used in maybe 2/3 years.

To save some time explaining, I'll copy/paste the email here, with my email address and old password hidden with asterisks:

&gt; Hello!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;My nickname in darknet is horatius41.  
I hacked this mailbox more than six months ago,   
through it I infected your operating system with a virus (trojan) created by me and have been monitoring you for a long time.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;So, your password from \*\*\*\*\*@hotmail.co.uk is \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Even if you changed the password after that - it does not matter, my virus intercepted all the caching data on your computer  
and automatically saved access for me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I have access to all your accounts, social networks, email, browsing history.  
Accordingly, I have the data of all your contacts, files from your computer, photos and videos.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I was most struck by the intimate content sites that you occasionally visit.  
You have a very wild imagination, I tell you!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;During your pastime and entertainment there, I took screenshot through the camera of your device, synchronizing with what you are watching.  
Oh my god! You are so funny and excited!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I think that you do not want all your contacts to get these files, right?  
If you are of the same opinion, then I think that $827 is quite a fair price to destroy the dirt I created.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Send the above amount on my BTC wallet (bitcoin): 1NXNt72qfMhPZDffUEqryCYpEUzyR6LmgH  
As soon as the above amount is received, I guarantee that the data will be deleted, I do not need it.

&gt;Otherwise, these files and history of visiting sites will get all your contacts from your device.  
Also, I'll send to everyone your contact access to your email and access logs, I have carefully saved it!

&gt;Since reading this letter you have 48 hours!  
After your reading this message, I'll receive an automatic notification that you have seen the letter.

Good luck!

I'm not really concerned about people finding out any ""secrets"" I might have; I've got nothing to hide. I don't even have a webcam, like this email suggests.

I am however concerned with the fact that it both has access to my email account, and knows my old password. It claims to have access to other things that I've signed into, so my main concern is that it may have access to my bank details.

Is this something I should be worried about? I've run a virus scan using 360 Total Security and it's found nothing

It might also be worth mentioning the fact that I got another email like this around the same time, almost identical, but with a different username at the top and a different amount of money. Same BTC wallet code though.",26Oct2018,1
10,So I work at a retail store and I’ve had this crush on a girl that’s works a different area/shift. We cross paths every now and then and we joke around and talk shit to each other (for example she’ll say she hates me and trade insults).

I also live in the same residence as her. I was her health care provider until two days ago. Currently I am looking for a new job and a place to live.

This is a summary of what happened after hearing this from my younger brother.

Sister woke brother up saying TWO LARGE DOGS (some mutt, standing up was near 6ft.. so was big) eating a chicken. Brother couldn't open gun safe to scare away dogs so he tried banging a piece of metal with a bat. Dogs bolted towards him causing him to run inside scared. Scared AF brother called 911 for help...

First off they put him in queue because it was ""...not a big deal"" and made him wait 30min, then he called back same answer. After an hour the body count reached 3. After waiting for nearly an hour brother calls again DEMANDING help. 911 responded sets him (after another wait) to the animal control. So because it was 3:50 the animal control person couldn't help because he would get in trouble if it wasn't there by 4???

After some more waiting, yelling, and s\*\*\* they send a officer. its 5pm now and 6 chickens are dead. Brother goes out to see officer (and because dogs are far away) and the dogs bolt after him again. My brother runs around the house, while the officer watches him and yells ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING SHOOT THEM"". Luckily the dogs were harmless (mostly rip chickens). The officer gets in contact with the owner and he comes along. Apparently they were missing t=since this morning 7-8 am! They only thing the owner did was had his grandma make a Facebook post... Dog owner apologizes and tries to be funny about this. Brother now is obviously upset and calming down. Dog owner argues with brother about the number of dead chickens saying ""prove it"" so he walks around the house counting dead chickens, Includes ones missing that may or may not be also dead. Ends with brother asking he gives money to buy new chickens, brother doesn't care about them just glad its over with, and dog owner goes off.

Honestly, I'm appalled by what happened, and i have YET to call my mother who is visiting my aunt for the next 2 days. Question is... What do I do? Is there any justifiable legal action to take? I had a Sh\*\*\* day and I can't think ahead of what to do.

P.S: Dogs also seemed very malnourished, which could explain their unholy hunger.",26Oct2018,1
13,"So I'm a pilot basically fresh out of school. Flight school isn't cheap and now I'm broke. Despite the pilot shortage going on, entry level jobs for anything but being a flight instructor are extremely competitive and companies like to hire new people all at once and typically only once per year. After waiting for months I finally found a job... 750 miles away... with 3 weeks of unpaid training... and I have to be there by Monday the 29th. Since I accepted the job only a few days ago I have been scrambling to find a way to move there for as little money as possible. These are the issues I need help with right now: How do I find a place to live when I have no current income and the company I will be working for hires me as a contractor? The chief pilot who hired me says he can get me a letter of employment but the company pays by the day worked ($300/day) but there isn't a real figure on how much I will make a year since I can choose how much I work. I Don't have the cash to put a months rent up front or anything like that. Will any apartment complex rent me a unit based on these conditions?

Keep in mind the truck is rented for 4 days and each day after cost $70 extra. If I rent a truck and can't find a place that will rent to me within a few days I will be out the cost of the truck and will be forced to throw all of my stuff away.

15,"Throwaway because my family knows my main account.

Tonight at dinner, my dad told me he doesn't feel needed anymore.

He recently made a job change from a high-stress environment to a very lax one with fewer people. For many years, he was the know-it-all guy that everybody went to when they needed help. Now everybody at work is knowledgeable in their fields and no longer requires his help. It's hard going from the go-to guy to the nobody-goes-to guy. He told me he wants to look for something higher up in the company at the start of the new year, but that's still months away and there's no guarantee he'd actually get it. 

On top of this, I turned 21 a few weeks ago, and am looking to move out in the next few months. My only sibling has been out of the nest for several years as well, and is well established in her career.  She rarely comes to visit now so once I'm gone, they won't have any kids to keep them company. Both of my parents are affected by this but I believe my dad is taking it worse. 

He feels he doesn't have a purpose anymore, and I don't know how to help. What can I do? I love my dad and want him to be happy and fulfilled, but once I'm gone, I won't be able to help him anymore. But I also don't want to put my life on hold...

16,"Two days ago, my friend G texted me and told me she coming to pick me up and talk about something, so she came and we sat at the lake by my house. She sat there and while crying, explained to me she had looked through Bs phone and he had been talking to many girls on Facebook sending sexually charged messages. 

As if this weren’t bad enough, she told me that twice throughout the last year of their relationship he had hit her out of anger. She confronted him about both of these things later that night, I guess they chatted and concluded to stay together and work through it, he promising “he’d do better.” 

For the last two days I’ve felt sick to my stomach. I can’t eat. I’m so hungry but the though of putting food in my mouth and chewing just makes me wanna throw up. I can’t believe he would do this. I am overcome with betrayal and pain. He has always been such a polite and courteous man and I would have never guessed he was capable of such things. 

Honesty, I can’t even look at him anymore. I’m suppose to go to a party at his place this weekend and I didn’t want to go, but she asked me to come for support. I am at a loss of words. I feel so hurt and sick and like I’m lost. No one knows except me and the two involved. It hurts seeing our friends act business as usual, because they don’t know.

The thing is, I go home anyway in 2 months and I’m not sure whether it’s worth the money and the trouble. I’m a student and a retour would be about €190 for 4 days.

21,"Long story short as I can make it, I met my once best friend the first day of high school,and we were basically inseparable the entire time. We both befriended another guy that was a grade below us, and the three of us were quite literally the best possible friends we could’ve ever been for nearly 5 years. After high school, my main best friend and I went to different colleges but still hung out all the time when we could. I hadn’t seen him in about a month or so, and one day out of the blue he contacts me through AOL instant messenger (this was around 2004.) He proceeded to tell me that he thought that I was pathetic. A user, a hanger on, and that he hadn’t even thought about me once until that day when he saw my screen name and decided to message me. Told me that he no longer wished to be my friend and that I may as well just completely delete his number and that I should never speak to him again. Thing about it all was that there was never an instance where we had argued or fought or anything like that. Just seemed to be completely out of the blue that this happened. Needless to say, I was pretty shocked and overall devastated. Our other friend basically just gave me the silent treatment after that and him and I eventually fell out of touch. Fast forward nearly 15 years. I’m married, have kids, am successful and happy. About two years ago I discovered both of their social media accounts and by all appearances they are both doing just as well. I’ve been toying with the idea of contacting them just to be like hey, I want you to know that I made something of myself and that I didn’t need either of you to do it. You both left me high and dry with no explanation whatsoever. But it’s cool, because I didn’t need you. Does this just seem super petty? The adult side of me tells me to just leave it alone and keep living my happy life, but the other side of me, the side that is still that kid who got left at his keyboard not knowing what he did to lose his two best friends, wants them to know that I didn’t fucking need them and they need to know that.

But that’s what accountability is, isn’t it?

Here it is:

&gt;This is a post made far too late in an effort for accountability: two years ago, I sexually assaulted my now ex-girlfriend. I did not know it was sexual assault at the time. It was something I had to be informed of. This does not make my crime any less horrific or have any less impact on my victim. This is a post to say I am sorry. I am sorry for making her feel unsafe in our shared city environment, I am sorry for the trust I have lost with others, and I am sorry for not coming forward with this sooner.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is a post to also say that I have been sexually assaulted before and after I was with her, and I believe my prior abuse directly lead to me abusing her. I cannot separate these two identities of abused and abuser. I wish I could. The same night I learned of my abuse was the night that I realized I had been abused by a woman before. I wish I could separate these facts. I wish I had realized it sooner. I wish my entire abusive history hadn’t happened at all because it has harmed others and made me carry a very heavy guilt for the past two years that has lead to multiple suicide attempts and social isolation.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is a post to ask for understanding. I don’t want to be a bad person. I don’t want to believe that I am a bad person. I want to believe that I have made a very terrible, awful, detestable mistake and that I can grow and heal from it. I want to believe the same healing is possible for my victim. I want people to understand that the majority of people who have committed sexual assault do not do it intentionally, but that sexual assault originates from a culture that lacks a deep understanding of consent. I don’t mean to say that people are not guilty or should not be held accountable for their crimes; I means that a better focus is on understanding and growing than it is on bitter punishment where no one learns.   
&gt;  
&gt;I hope this post finds you well and I am sorry if it hurts your faith in me. I want to work to regain y’all’s trust but right now, I don’t know what that entails. Please let me know any more actions I should be taking for healing. 

Please let me know if anything sounds off or if I should be seriously concerned about anything I've said here. Also, just general reassurance: am I a decent person? thanks",26Oct2018,1

28,"Hey guys, I'm pretty new to Reddit but I do have an issue that I need a little advice on.

I have a friend..we can call her ""C"", and we have been friends for about 4-5 years. She hasn't really come around my family until about this year, so today she shows up to my house uninvited and without me being there. I commute to school an hour away and as soon as I got out of class I received a message from her first saying that she was at my house and out of gas for her car. I started school in august and she knows that I am in class 9-5, M-F. She arrives at my house and my mom gives me a phone call asking if i was going to be home soon since C was there. I told my mom yes and rushed home.  

By the time I got home C wasn't there, then my mom told me that C asked for money and gave my mother a whole story about how she doesn't have money for gas and she hasn't eaten at all this week...the works. My mom not knowing C like I do innocently gives her $100. C is one of those people who asks everyone for a free handout because she is used to being spoonfed her whole life. 

I am disgusted and embarrassed that she would come to my house uninvited and ask my mother for money. I'm not sure if I should confront her or what. Because she knows how I feel when she asks for money, I don't give her any. I just feel like its a really low blow that she would ask my mom of all people for money, and I'm not sure how to gracefully handle this situation without getting crazy. I am steaming while writing this as we speak. Any advice?

32,We've been married for 2 years. I'm 23 she's 24. We rent a bedroom right now in a house. The owners are very annoying and we've been here the entire marriage. We have a golden retriever and 2 cats. We were offered a house to rent with no deposit and no application from a friend. It will make our bills go up by about $1300. We can afford it. We both think we'll be happier because we'll have our own place and we need that being a married couple and all. Its not a big financial burden. But it greatly decreases the amount of savings we can put aside. We were both very happy but now a week away we're kinda looking at the other choice. I think we'll be much happier even working toward our financial goals a little slower. We'll have a quiet place to call home and plenty of room for our pets.

33,"This is my first post, but I may as well ask for some advice. 
My girlfriend (22) and I (21) have been together for a year and four months.
In this time she’s succeeded to come up with heartbreaking stories and guilt trips, and including in these lies were one about my own brother.
It all started last year, within the first week of us being together, she claimed she had felt tightness in her chest, and me, having high blood pressure I knew what it felt like. She told me she’d been experiencing this for months. Flash forward to February last year, she told me she was in the ER. 
I offered to come see her, as to which she said she couldn’t let me see her like that, and didn’t tell me which hospital she was at. It turned out, she was sitting at her friends house. 
The second lie that really pissed me off is the fact she told me she grew up in a very abusive family. She had just moved out of her parents place late last year, and before I met her parents that is what she told me. However, when I met her mother, she was sweet, kind, charming, and was so glad to meet me. I asked about one of the situations that she told me had happened, and her mother was very concerned. She privately told me that my girlfriend will always try to guilt trip me into thinking that she’s in danger. I love her so much, but at this point I was angry because those are two very serious topics she had lied about. 
(There are several other things she has lied about, but I’m going to wrap it after the next one.)
I recently (last month) figured out she had been going out with a guy named Shaun. I met Shaun, and he seemed like a nice guy. He told me how much he’d heard about me and how happy my girlfriend was with me. About two weeks ago I’d finally come to the conclusion she was messing around with Shaun as to which a Snapchat from her |best friend| was sent to me, where she was sitting on his lap making out with him. (She told me she was gay, by the way.) 
I was pissed. I confronted her about it, and she came clean. But now I wonder what can I or could have done to make her want to stay with me and with me only? ",26Oct2018,1
34,"Yesterday my daughter spent nearly the entire day at the hospital being observed for a potential appendicitis.  I've not received any bills at this point for the services.

Supposedly this can be tricky because there might be multiple bills since they ran multiple tests. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Things to know:

* We are insured.  If my insurance company finds out I negotiated down my portion of the cost share, can they come after me?
* All services were incurred on the same day.  Can I just pay a single price and make the hospital eat the rest if they find out they under-billed me?
* Is there anything else I should know?",26Oct2018,1

37," So  here's the deal. I am graduating in May with a BS in MIRS - Radiation Therapy. I am planning on applying to the MS Medical Dosimetry program  at the same college, but I cannot apply until spring 2020. I know the instructors and staff at my college department pretty well + have good  grades so I am pretty sure I will get accepted if I apply.

I  can work temporarily as a Radiation Therapist after I graduate, but I  DO NOT like radiation therapy. In addition there are very few radiation  therapy jobs in my city. I will most likely have to move to another city/state to find a job. I do not like working as a radiation therapist  and do not want to move. Because of this, I am thinking of just working  a knock off job for a year -like in retail or something. Right now I  have my eyes on a job at an Amazon warehouse.

What  is a decent paying knock off job I can do for a year? Will employers accept me if I over qualify with my degree? Am I making a good choice  here?

38,"To preface: 

My parents are controlling and crazy. My mom has physically abused me on and off my whole life, most recently in September 2016. The verbal abuse is constant. My mom has never been a good mom to me, and she has BPD, and Narcisstic tendancies. She is incapable of love, empathy, and trust. She believes my dad and I are having sex, because unconditional love doesn't exist for her. She's currently on her best behavior because anytime she so much as breathes in my direction, I run to my dad. But at the drop of a hat she will throw her weight around and abuse her position in my life. 

My dad, for the first time ever, is listening because a year ago she attacked him physically as well. He's not as bad as her, but can be controlling. For example, he confiscated my cell phone when I was 26 for saying ""fuck"" on my social media, because ""a future employer could look at that, and decide they don't want to hire you"".

I know there's the potential that they revert back to how they used to be at the drop of a hat, and if that happens, I know its best if I'm far away if that happens. 

Just take a stroll through my past posts on Raised By Narcissists, and you should get a pretty good idea of the type of people my parents are. 

I got fed up with their BS, and decided I couldn't stay in the house anymore, and started the process of going to college across the country(I live in IL.)

I got accepted to an Engineering school in AZ, and started the financial aid process, and found that the Engineering school in AZ is about $43,000 a year, that's just tuition, housing, and books, an additional $3,400 is required for the meal plan + health insurance through the school. 

I already have student loans I'm paying off (a little over $9k), and the thought of incuring more student loans makes me sweat. Even though it was expensive, I was really looking forward to moving to AZ, I considered it a fresh start, and a way to escape my parents controlling behavior, and my shitty life in IL. I know its my rose-colored glasses making AZ look great because it's far away from bad memories, and my shitty family. 

But that $43,000+ price tag stuck in my mind, and I started looking at colleges closer to home, because Non-Resident pricing at my AZ college is almost $10k more than resident pricing. 

There's a few large universities in the big city near me(Chicago), one is about a 35 minute drive from where my parents live, the other is about 2 hours. But I could go there for as little as $2k-$5k a semester, which is a huge discount compared to the AZ school. 

I plan to dorm no matter where I go, so I will be more independent, and no longer under their thumb. However, if they go nuclear(as they have in the past), I'll still be in the blast radius, more so than if I went to AZ.

40,"Here it is, in a nutshell. I love my boyfriend very much. The problem is he is conventionally ""ugly"", in part due to mild genetic ""defects"" (not sure if that's the right word) he has inherited, that run in his family.  He has a sister with the same condition and she has passed it on to her child. It's nothing serious, just a mutation in one of their genes that causes some unusual and distinctive features in their face and body. We are 30/31 and together a year and a half but before me he had not had a girlfriend at all, only some one night stands. I have had some mean comments about him. His friends openly acted really surprised when he finally got a girlfriend. People always make those dumb jokes about me being out of his league and ""how did you manage that"" etc etc.  Since he's so nice,smart, funny etc, I feel like this has to be in large part down to his looks, which makes me feel sad and pissed off on his behalf. It also makes me feel like it could be cruel to have a child with him, since I don't want them to go through being bullied and socially excluded or whatever because of their looks. To make matters worse, I already have a 6 year old girl, and she is exceptionally beautiful, I've modelled in the past, and I'm sure she would be able to do modelling if she wished when she gets older, as she is simply stunning. It seems even more cruel if I were to bring a child into the world that had inherited his genetic issues whilst also living under the shadow of an incredibly beautiful older sister. Wtf am I meant to do? I feel like being a parent is one of the most amazing things in the world and he wants to be a dad one day and I want to give him everything he wants and the thought of him cradling his own little baby makes my heart fill with joy, but also, I feel like it would be selfish to have a kid to make us (even more) happy if the kid might end up with a hard life because of the way they look.

I started at a new school this fall semester, and I also started a new job. Everything was going fine, until after mid terms two weeks ago. straight As and Bs. I was studying hard enough to get good grades, and I hardly missed any assignments. 

Now, I feel almost physically like I hit a wall. Every time I try to do a homework assignment I feel like I am pushing a semi truck up a hill. I put them off, and then I feel like I'm about to have a panic attack so I just watch funny YouTube videos and then go to bed. Nothing gets done.

I'm even physically tired. Walking has become extremely taxing, especially up stairs. I just takes so much effort.

This has been my last two weeks. I've only gotten a few assignments done, and I haven't been able to pay attention to more than one or two lectures out of my five classes, and that was with about 3 cups of coffee. I've been sleeping poorly, and now my driving is getting worse, too, along with everything else.

I enjoyed work up until this time, too. I really like helping people, and so I appreciated getting payed to do so. Now it just feels like a chore.

It was supposed to be just a fun carefree fling, but he is such a genuine guy, and we had so much fun. 
He is fresh out of the Marines (war zone in Iraq), so he is new to my city and does not know nearly anyone. He told me he loves me within a month of dating, and he became very clingy, talking about future things for us very quickly. It kind of freaked me out initially, but it didn’t feel wrong based off our chemistry and how we spent so much time together. 
He is very nice, but I no longer have feelings beyond friendship at this point. 
I began a new high demand career fresh out of college, have had some very recent &amp; traumatic loss in my family, and have enrolled my alcoholic father into Rehab. Through this he hasn’t been the most supportive, and insists he’s just not “good about talking about hard things in life after Iraq.” So the last few weeks my feelings just kind of turned off from him entirely &amp; I no longer want more than a friendship. 

The question is how do I tell him I want to break up in the nicest way possible? The basic “it’s not you it’s me” line is so cliché it would be offensive to say to anyone… Let alone him being one of the most kind people I have ever met. I just don’t have enough in me right now to give in a relationship. When you get into a relationship with someone you’re taking on the responsibility of that person’s happiness and have to take them into consideration. I can’t do that right now with all of the tribulations in my life. 
I’m also very worried, because though we have not talked very much today at all (4 texts total) he told me that he is feeling so depressed again and that he’s feeling low and his mental health issues are coming back, he’s having nightmares.

I never wanted to go to this school in the first place - I only went because it was the ""highest-ranked"" (whatever that means anymore) in-state school and my parents told me that I have to either go to this school or go to community college and then transfer here. But I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I got here, and it's really bad if you're undecided on a major here: Every major that could land you a decent job is extremely competitive to get into, so you can't just waste your time exploring options. You can always transfer to a different school, sure, but my parents are dead-set on the idea that this is the *only* school worth its price, especially because the school is giving me a $5,000 grant per year. I think it's also important to note that my parents are immigrants, so I don't think they really understand the concept that school ""rankings"" are bullshit and that just because a school is listed as ""tier 2"" doesn't mean it's actually a bad school.

Anyway, the more I think about it, the more I think I want to be a dental hygienist, just like my mom. I look at my mom and see that she's happy with her life - the job improves people's lives and gives her enough money and time to do the things she wants. But my school doesn't offer dental hygiene, which would mean transferring to a community college or a private school offering dental hygiene - neither of which my parents approve of. 

In addition, my parents seem to have these grandiose expectations of me and think I'm destined to go on to do great things. They're under the delusion that I'm a genius, which I'm not: I just liked to impress adults as a little kid by spouting off random facts I read in books, and the idea stuck in everyone's minds that I was a child prodigy or something.

TL;DR: I just want a simple life as a dental hygienist, but my parents are pressuring me to waste my time and money on an education I don't want.

63,"And I’m not saying I don’t agree with the military, or, that I’m “not letting him do what he wants” because I am, he’s been gone for weeks already, but I really started to hate him for it. 

I didn’t send any letters although he wrote me many. I didn’t respond to any of them, and it’s the very fact that he didn’t want to go in the first place. He cried and cried, on his way there he said he’d hope the “plane crash” and other crazy things. Before he left, he got arrested for abusing me.. but I didn’t go through with pressing charges. Dumb, I know.
I’m 19. I’ve been through a lot of abuse, abandonment in my life. From both my parents. And it still happens today, he already did not want to go in the first place.. but.. still did to “prove a point” to strangers that barely even know him that say he’s SPOILED. the thought I keep having in my head is how dare he leave me behind to prove a “point”, when I’m going through absolute hell right now. Why even join the military all of the reason to prove a point to people who’s opinion DONT matter at all?

64,"So I (20M) met this girl (26F) in class like a week ago and we hit it off. So a little backstory, I noticed she was looking at me in class so I confronted her about it and she said she just looks at people and then I left and she thought I was gonna ask for her number and thought I'd come back in a couple days to ask for it. Then she started talking to me randomly. I've never been able to hold conversations before but with her it was flawless, and it helped that I was into her. So for the past week we've talked/texted everyday about whatever and I even opened up to her that I've never talked about my feelings to anyone, said how I overthink everything, and how I'm not really sure what a real friend is, and she handled it really well and I feel comfortable being with her. She told me that when she was waiting for me to come back for her number, I looked good and I got the vibe that she was into me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then two days ago, we were talking instead of studying and there were a couple more lulls in the conversation than usual (which is fine) and then she casually brought up how she tried to talk to her boyfriend's cousin in her class. It caught me so off-guard and my heart just sank but I told myself it was fine cause she's still a great friend and person. But now every time I talk with her, it just seems kinda off to me. She also wanted to eat but did so in a way that I had to ask if she wanted me to come (she said she wanted me to come), and then she canceled.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we were talking about the gym and how she thinks her boyfriend wants her to get fat so he can lock her down (all a joke) when she gets her doctorate, and it just killed me. I kinda played along and switched the topic but I really hate feeling this way, so any advice?

&amp;#x200B;

65,"About a year and a half ago, a new guy started at work. He seemed like he might be into me, but me being shy, I didn’t reciprocate the attention or flirtiness right away as he had only just started and I didn’t know what he was about. Very shortly after, another coworker put the moves on him and they’ve been together ever since and are pretty serious, live together, and will probably get engaged. 

For about 6-8 months after he started, we all hung out after work (others in addition to the couple). We got along, but I always felt like the girl did not like me (snarky comments and certain looks) and I hated feeling like I was hanging out with people who felt that way. Even though on the surface I liked her enough, a part of me deep down resented her even though I didn’t like the guy in that way (there was never time to develop a crush before they got together). So I gradually distanced myself; no drama, just hung out with the couple less and less. I wanted authentic relationships and I felt that, from both her and my side, it was not authentic.

The girl left the job and her absence made me face my feelings and confront the fact that I felt sad about losing out on what “could have been,” especially since he seems like a good boyfriend. When she was in the picture, I didn’t allow myself to think about him in that way, but her being out, it just brought my true feelings to the surface that I did not know were there. Of course, I did not, nor will I, try to put a move on him. But knowing that I can’t have him makes me feel a certain way and I lash out by ignoring him and being cold with him. In return, he has become the same way with me. So even though we used to be friends, now we barely talk, even though we work together.

 I could never tell him how I feel. For one, he’s taken and it would be an inappropriate convo. Secondly, I have treated him so coldly that I’m pretty sure he probably dislikes me now and would likely just laugh behind my back.

To make things worse, this year has been my loneliest year (I feel like I have no true friends in my city and clearly I’m still single) and this situation has made me even more depressed. I will not be staying in this city for much longer, but what can I do in the meantime to fix my situation?",26Oct2018,1

But I find myself always worrying about not finding someone for me in the future, I think it could be my self esteem issue, since many of my friends have rather unique qualities. I can't even seem to hold a meaningful conversation for more than a minute.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not going through my introverted, pubescent, reserved phase, but I'm still awkward when approached off guard. I know that a times I can click with someone and we can talk for literal hours about random stupid things, but it's usually a once in a while. I've also had the unfortunate experience of dating for ""fun"" a year back with someone I had a crush on. They seemed to be attracted to me, they complimented me and they loved embracing me, it was every teenager's dream. But rarely ever talked to me in public, all our conversations were either online or when we were alone. Maybe they were shy, but I gave them 2 months after I told them how I felt and it couldn't wait any longer.

The whole thing left me anxious about the future, I'm worried I won't be able to hold meaningful conversation with my future lover. Maybe I'll become more talkative? But I'm not sure if I'd live up to meet someone's standards. So many people I just picking up gfs or bfs on the spot like it's nothing. I'm relatively attractive I suppose, averagely smart, I know how to cook some meals off of memory, and I try to be modest and polite but I'm pretty indecisive.

In high school things changed, she stopped being there for me but expected me to always respond to her. We've had a few huge blowup fights about it and she always said she would try and work on it which would last for a month or so.

I'm constantly complaining about it to my family and they all say end the friendship. The last two months have been hell for me, I've been in the hospital twice, had 2 procedures and a surgery. She didn't text or call me once. That was the final straw, and I think I'm finally ready to end it for good I just don't know how.

72,"It's 3:30 am for me, apologies if at any point this sounds super fucking depressing.

Right now, I just exist. I feel like the center of a compass in the sense that there's all these directions around me, all these different roads I could go down. All of them will lead me somewhere, and maybe that somewhere is great. Maybe that somewhere ends up being horrific. It takes too much time to explore every route and you've got to work out which one is the best for you. Just right now it feels like that center has these long passages in every direction - I won't know how things will turn out until I go down. There's no way to guess, everything looks the same. That's my analogy for life right now.

The analogy aside. I started university a few weeks back on a Computer Science/Maths degree. It's not for me. All my life, I've done maths and I enjoyed it. And then as time went on, and especially the last two years, I did maths because I was good at it - not because I wanted to do it, but because it was the easiest career path to go down. And now when that spark is gone, when it's stopped being easy and when I've needed to put that effort in, I've really learnt this isn't where I see myself. I'm a creator, a visionary. That's what I do. Computer Science was good because I could create and it was still maths-based. And I still get along with Comp Sci, I still enjoy it now and then. But again, that's also being killed for me. And now I just. I don't know what to do. There's nothing else I have specialised knowledge in I could do. The ideas I come up with, they're the ideas of a visionary who gives up easily once someone goes ""Well we can't do it because X"". My other passions that I could pursue, I've not practised enough to have them as a career option. I'm not good at them but I enjoy them. It's the compass all over again. I'm stuck in the middle and have all these different options around me but just. I don't know. I can't really move towards any knowing it's going to work out. And I don't want to fuck myself by taking this huge risk and it not working out.

76,"So I am part to blame for this situation.

  
I recently left my old job due to certain conflicts and broken promises. I accepted a position elsewhere.  I was desperate and running low on cash due to to uncertainty of  my new jobs hours. I called my old job and asked if i can come back. They agreed. I work at least 10 more hours to make up for the missing hours from my new job. after working with my new job for a month in. They tell me they needed help and willing to give me the hour i needed. I am stuck in a dilemma.   my impulsive decision to go back to my old job costed me flexibility. I'm going to college this semester and this situation is effecting it.  
My old job i feel like is best to leave, i had a couple of managers stick out for me to come back. But the fact that i now have a lower chance of getting a promotion within my old job are very slim. I feel like i burnt a bit of the bridge there. What demotivated me more today was hearing a fellow coworker telling me. How people do not like me, felt like i didn't care about my job, already shit talking me. This now adds more fuel to the fire.   


There is rarely room for growth with my new job, but they aren't two faced like my other job. Pay is a bit better and people are a bit more down the earth.  


I just really don't want to call my old job and say ""hey i'm actually leaving for real this time."" If i have to then i have no choice. If i do leave, it would leave a huge burden off my shoulder. Yet the managers that told me i can stay is the reason why i didn't walk out today. This was because of me. Desperation and Uncertainty. Wanting to have money to buy a new used car for work and school. Needing to pay bill and college. I don't want to fail this semester of college because of stress from jobs that i don't need.

79,"This is embarrassing, so embarrassing that I am scared to put this out there. So, when giving advice, please try to understand where I am coming from, we all make mistakes. I am very depressed and am in the worst state of my life that I have ever been in. Currently I am 14, and I turn 15 tomorrow, which is a day that I am really scared to go through. I made a friend two years ago, and I was very happy to be around her. She made me so happy that I cannot put into words. The happiest moments of my life was around her, and I love her so, so much. I have never felt loved or important by anyone until she came into my life. 

But, this year I felt like she would never love me again, and it made me go through several mental breakdowns, because she always talked to her other friends, and made them all happy, all of them other than me. I always get jealous when she hugs one of her friends, or tells them that they will always be important. When I try to talk to her she just says ""Hi"" in an uninterested manner, or pushes me away a little bit. She still tells me that she still loved me over text, and that she still cares for me, or that I was nice or cute. But, she never talked to me in public, or was never interested in me, unlike how when she sees one of her other friends she would get really excited and give them hugs and act happy around them. She hasn't acted happy talking to me since the last two years, and all of this pounded into my head made me think that she stopped being interested in me or just thought I got annoying.

Here is where I made a big mistake, something that I can say, is one of the worst decisions I have ever made in life. Don't judge me when reading this, please. 

I felt like I needed to stop trying to talk to her, at least for now, so that my feelings wouldn't get hurt, and so that I wouldn't spiral into a sinking feeling of sadness and loneliness like I always do. So, what did I do? I went to my instagram story to express my feelings. ""I never thought I would have to do this, but I  think I will stop trying to talk to (her name), at least, for now. She seems uninterested in being around me. I feel like she has stopped liking me a long time ago. She always talks to her other friends and makes me feel left out."" I rambled for a bit, and at the end I put ""We had some good times &lt;3"" Which was a huge mistake considering that I put the words ""for now"" earlier on in the paragraph. This is easily the most OBNOXIOUS thing I have ever done.

I think I made this looking for attention. Looking back at it, I don't know what I was thinking. It is like I am screaming at other people to feel bad for me. The fact that I put it on my Instagram story was even worse, and I wish I could go back in time and just delete it already, but it's too late and she seen the story, and went to my DMs to express what she thinks about my awfully structured, and horrendously written cry for help.

""\[my name\], look. I am not in a good place mentally and I have been distancing myself from everyone and idk what made you think it would EVER be okay to post something like this on your story and it is seriously fucked up. If I had the balls to say some mean shit to you I would but I'm just gonna leave this with a ""this is fine. hope you do well."" And go on with my life. I'm sorry I made you feel like shit but you don't have to worry about me anymore.""

She then sent another message.

""Actually, you will have to worry about me. I'm not getting into this over TEXT with you so tomorrow whether you like it or not, I'm talking to you."" The whether you like it or not part really hurt me, it made me wonder if she thought I never wanted to talk to her, which is not the case. She continued. ""You can believe or say what you want but it baffles me how you can be so harsh and think for a second I don't love you.""

She went to her story and posted this. This is the part where I started to feel like the worst person to walk the face of the earth. 

""Honestly, I know I've been pushing people away lately and I can see it hurts everyone's feelings but I am doing it for the better. I personally believe everyone is better off without my negative self in their life and when people say that they are giving up on trying to be around me, it shows me who is actually willing to be around me even when I am at my worst. There has been so much stuff happening lately that I cannot comprehend.""

I never gave up, I just wanted a break for a while, but I never specified because my dumbass never thought about doing so. I have never felt more like a bad friend, or a bad person in general. I feel like nothing can solve the situation I am in...

""I am not even angry about this either. What this particular person put on their insta was just uncalled for and if they had a problem they could have talked to me about it. Now along with other things everyone thinks i am an asshole and there is no other way to phrase it. I know this is just me complaining but I cannot do anything about my mental health.""

This is the one that made me feel the worst. She not only made me feel bad, but she did it respectfully while not even namedropping me. She made me feel like I sent a bunch of angry people over to hate on her. Like some fucking psychopath that hates every bit of someone's guts. And I love her more than anyone else in the world so reading this made me feel like the scum of the earth. I am a villain. An awful person. I said I was scared of her loving me again, but after this I 100% guarantee she will never love me again. It is all me and my sensitive ass. I feel like I can not bounce back from this. I am terrible, and I hate myself for this. If anyone knows what I should do PLEASE give me an idea or two. She said she would meet up with me tomorrow, but I am afraid that if I say one word to her I am just going to start bawling my eyes out like I have done many times today.

82,"Preface: I'm new to reddit (have mercy)

Okay well maybe I don't forget everything but if probably isn't an exaggeration to say 1/3 to 1/2 of all somewhat important things in my life I just strait up forget. For instance, last week I forgot 3 homework assignments and a quiz (I actually forgot the quiz, and then forgot to turn on my alarm to wake up for the class the quiz was being administered in--I'm in uni). I have forgotten my work schedule many times (despite having my calendar app notify me in time to get ready and leave, I still forgot and missed my shift). I have forgotten appointments for business, friends, etc. I also tend to forget small things like responding to txt messages--I've left people on read for weeks without meaning to. But enough beating the dead horse.

I've tried paper calendars/planners, but I either forget to put whatever it is on it, or I forget I put it on there, or I forget that I have it at all (or sometimes I'm just to lazy). Same problem with pocket booklets, reminder apps, and calendar apps, although calendar apps are probably the best since they notify me of upcoming events.

I don't want to put words in people's mouths, but I suspect the way to conquer this is to get into a very, very consistent habit of writing down just about every little thing that I hear that I may need to remember in the future. This doesn't sound very pleasant tho. It's possible that this is literally a mental problem and I should see a psychiatrist (I could point to one or two concussions when I was younger), but I'd rather exhaust simpler, cheaper options first.

85,"Hello Reddit,

I'm sorry for creating another ""Should I go to grad school post?"" But after searching previous posts and reading the advice, it really is a circumstance specific question.  Based on my circumstances, should I got to grad-school?

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 33 year old California native, born and raised in the Silicon Valley. I am not married and have no children.  I took out approximately 36K in student loans and I am on my last semester at SJSU.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always a bad student growing up.  I never paid attention in class and preferred socializing.  I dropped out of high school to join the work force and I never thought I would go back after receiving my G.E.D.  After a decade of working in corporate security, facing the real world, and learning a few life lessons, at 27 years old I decided to go back and enrolled in junior college.  I worked hard and transferred to a state university, double majoring in Political Science and Spanish. (I am a non-native Spanish-speaker.)

&amp;#x200B;

Going to school full time and working full time has made it difficult to take on an internship or gain any real experience outside of security.  My Spanish is not good enough to work as a translator and entry level jobs for Poli-Sci majors seam to pay well below the cost of living.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my professors has been encouraging me to go to grad-school and I have been giving it some thought.  I have considered getting a masters in social work, public administration, Spanish, or a teaching credential for special ed.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have measured the pros and cons and I am having a hard time deciding what to do next.  If I go to grad-school, I am much more likely to find a solid career path.  In the Bay Area, unless you are tech-savvy, it is hard to stand out to employers without a masters degree.  I would also go further in to debt and be in my mid to late 30's before finishing the program and beginning a career.

89,"I’m a 17 year old guy (gonna be 18 when I move). I’m going to move to Austin, Texas this summer. If I happen to get into college with enough money, I’ll end up just going to college immediately. Otherwise, I’m gonna get Texas residency and try to get into Texas A&amp;M the following year. 

All I know is that I am going to move there this summer, I don’t know what I should do as far as a job, housing, transportation etc. I haven’t really started thinking because it’s still quite a ways away. 

I’m going to be moving to Austin, and I have one cousin who lives there currently. He offered to help me if I needed it, but I’d rather not rely on him unless I really need it.

91,"Crosspost on TwoXChrom.

I'm not sure what to do. This is so long and complicated but I will do my best to condense this mess into something just short of a novel. 

I am a woman in construction,  I am a young woman, fresh out of college, and I landed a government job in utility construction work. I work with all men, and they are all great, they treat me as an equal and I've proven myself useful when someone small enough to fit and work in a tight space underground is needed. However there is one man, we'll call him Steve, that is crossing a line and I'm not sure what to do.

The problem is that he is definitely socially challenged in some way, it's just obvious when you get to know him,  he is very insecure and that us also very obvious. No one on our crew likes Steve, he is difficult to get along with and can be lazy. I have a soft heart, and I felt for him, being an outcast is no fun, so I made sure that when it was the two of us on a crew, I tried to include him. He started coming into work happy again, and I was glad that my support was able to bring him out of his shell. 

However, I am beginning to see why he was hiding in his shell in the first place; he is incredibly sexually inappropriate. The things he has said to me are just…..out of this world inappropriate,  especially as a government employee. Here are some examples so you understand that I am not fuckin around when I say he is inappropriate:

1)One time at lunch I brought salmon, I sit down next to him and open the dish with the salmon, he looks at me and says “Hey, close your legs.” BROOO.

2)Once I was driving and rubbed a curb as I was backing the truck around a corner.  I said “Whoops, well if you aren't rubbing you aren't racing amiright?” and his reply was “So does that mean when your fingers are inside of yourself you are racing?” MAAATE

3)Once I was talking about how I saw this chick I knew from high school in one of those bikini barista places and it just shocked me because she never struck me as someone that would be cool with being naked in front of folks, his reply was “Yea I like girls with daddy issues, I'm old enough to be your dad, just so you know.” EW

4)He once eluded to the idea that we would date if he wasn't married and we weren't coworkers. He knows that I'm in a wonderful relationship with the love of my life, and dude….just….no. I didn't know how to respond to such a weird comment so I just changed the subject. 

And now his actions are weird. I was trying to get down from a high spot and was struggling, and before I could say anything he says “Here let me help you” and he grabs me by the upper waist UNDER MY SHIRT and puts me down. Now I have to preface that I was hanging, so my shirt was probably riding up, but it still weirds me the fuck out.  

It was that incident that got me in the HR office, because someone else saw it and reported it on my behalf because they see the way Steve  acts with me and they are all creeped out and concerned. So, I did what I always do, I protected him. He is the black sheep of utilities, no one likes him, and I know that he trusts me, and I ain't no snitch trying to get someone fired. I have worked SO HARD to gain the reputation that I have of a good worker that isn't working for the city to get a sexual harassment lawsuit out of the city and walk away rich (it has happened twice, even though one had video evidence that it wasn't true). The men here aren't afraid of me anymore, they know that I am here to work hard and go home.  But protecting this guy is getting so exhausting. Because on one end I so badly want him to stop with these comments and weird stares he gives me and the finding excuses to touch me, but on the other I don't want to be the person that someone works with for 6 months and loses their job. 

BUT, everyone knows the way Steve is around me, everyone has come to me asking what the fuck is going on, and if I keep protecting him, I'm worried people will think that something CONSENSUAL is going on. Which is definitely not the case. So many guys on my crew have come to me asking me to talk to our supervisor about Steve because they are all really creeped out by the way he is around me. Now I'm starting to see the writing on the wall, that he really is a creeper. 

But this is a government job, I don't want him to get fired, but I don't want to work with him anymore either. After my HR interview they have decided not to move further with the case because I made it seem so innocent,  but once I found that out I realized that I WANT something to change. My crew lead wants me to talk to our supervisor again and tell him that I want totally honest with our HR, and tell him the whole truth. But I know that the whole truth will get him fired. I don't want to talk to him personally because I'm honestly fearful, but talking above him to management makes it feel like I'm betraying his trust.

93,"I take a German class and today the teacher let us play Kahoot! to practice some grammar. 

For those who don't know Kahoot! is a web-browser game that displays questions on a large screen in front of the class. Players connect to the game with their phones, and use them to answer the questions displayed.  The fastest 6 people who respond correctly have their 'names' listed at the end of each round, and there are then 3 winners at the end.

Before it starts, everyone must enter in a ""nickname"" (which is how you can see your rank). Most people go by whatever they want. Once entered, it pops up for everyone to see, and if a funny or strange one comes up the class usually laughs or makes a comment about it. It's anonymous as long as you don't obviously reveal yourself.

Well, today I was sharing a phone with a partner since my phone didn't have enough battery. She is white like literally everyone in the class except for me, and happens to know some Japanese. For the hell of it I told her to put in a random Japanese phrase. (nani desu ka?) She puts in the characters and we laugh super quietly. Keep in mind I'm not Japanese but get mistaken for being it once in a while. 

My teacher is laughing and looks amused at some of the names, like ""drei-gang"", Sharkfin, or whatever. (lol such funny names!!) 

Then the Japanese characters pop up. He immediately stops laughing, has a really stern face, then says seriously aloud, ""Um, guys, like please don't with the Japanese names..."" then looks straight at me. (Keep in mind this teacher is very nice and humorous and everyone likes him so this was kind of out of character of him) He keeps staring for 5 seconds which results in all the other white kids to turn back and stare at the section of the class where I sit. I don't say anything, and act like I didn't do it. I wait a couple of seconds, turn to my partner and blurt out, ""Haha, well that's fucking racist!"" and she laughs out loud in turn, out of politeness I assume? )

A  few seconds later I start feeling really self-conscious when I realize how loud it came out, but I continue playing and looking down on my phone.

94,"Hello everyone!

A couple of months back, a friend and I had a falling out because I thought she was changing herself for a guy that clearly wasn't interested in her. She kept doing things that were out of character for her and I remember us butting heads about it.

I told her how I felt and decided it's best to let the friendship go. In mid-July, she reached to me wishing a happy birthday (my birthday was in June) and saying how she wanted to patch things up, etc.

I began to notice that our personalities and perspectives were different? I think because I used to have an idealistic view and began to have more a realistic one, she doesn't understand me. I think she's become more idealistic. In my own opinion, anyway. For example, I was telling her about a friend who I thought was lacking perspective about a situation (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but she couldn't read between the lines about how if someone says something negative about someone else to her, what her think that same person wouldn't do the same to someone else about her?

She couldn't understand where I was coming from and felt like that particular person needed to grow up and whatnot. Fine.

Fast forward to today, where I said that I thought a particular singer was bland and she basically said she thinks my opinions are always rude.

Nothing wrong with that, but it really winded me up when she told me that I needed to grow up and wake up when a few months back, she was telling me that people are learning to grow and such. I don't have a problem with people giving me constructive criticism but I just found it insulting in the sense that she believes I'm inferior to her. The way she sent the message was hurtful. 

I think she had an issue with me calling someone uncivilized, which I genuinely believed that this person was a bit rude and lazy. THis was just an observation of mine. I could be wrong because I haven't seen this person in a year. We've only been communicating through text. She thought it was disrespectful for me to say this. I'm a very honest person and like to open with how I feel about people but I don't understand why she feels the need to tell me how to act or carry myself? It's one thing to give constructive criticism and it's another to just saying something without any sort of context.

I just told her that I didn't like this person because they're lazy in my opinion and that's just my opinion.

I guess my question is: Should I let this friendship go? This isn't the first time we've bickered; this is our third time, I'd say. I think that our conversations are stale as well because I'm coming to a point where I've been connecting with more older folks and they've been giving sound advice as to handle things with friends, parents, etc. while she just says a few words. I tried bringing an event that happened in the US yesterday and she was just a little bland about it while my other friends would've offered more to the conversation. In addition, I had a disagreement with my mom where I felt she was being passive aggressive and I told her my mom was being passive aggressive and she just said tell her that. Whereas my older friend asked about the context of situation and provided with more sound advice. 

How do I approach this? I don't care that she said my opinions are rude but it genuinely annoyed me that she said I should grow up when quite frankly, we're all growing up and learning things every day. (I'm 22, she's 20.) I personally think I should cut things off as we've been friends since high school it's evident we have different perspectives and we're always clashing. ",26Oct2018,1

98,"When I say B is my best friend, I truly mean best friend.  We're in each other's wills.  So the situation I've become stuck in with him is painful beyond belief, and I really need advice on how to deal with it cause I just don't know what to do anymore.

I've know B for almost 10 years now and we're more open and honestly with each other than anyone else.  While I love having someone I can tell literally anything to, it does also lead to some pretty intensely emotional exchanges.  I'm an extremely empathetic person, so I feel hard, and over the years (fairly soon after he moved away, actually) the emotional truths he shares are way more negative than positive and there never seems to be anything I can do to help him.  I'm even beginning to worry I'm the cause.  This mounting tension kinda has three basic roots; health, intimacy, and finances.  This is gonna be a long ass post but I need real advice and that's gonna require the whole story...

HEALTH
B was in and out of children's hospitals a lot as a kid due to complication from asthma.  But he also played a lot of hockey and was really into pro wrestling.  Playing the former and imitating the later, he suffered two bad concussions and never got any treatment for either.  He also went back to playing sports much early than he should have.  This all culminated in a compressed spine, two heart attacks, and a stroke by the time he was 24.  When we first met, he was addicted to pain killers.  I helped him ease off them a few months later, and he stopped taking medication of any sort for fear of relapsing.  He was fine for a long time, but over the last for years things have started declining fast.  He has near constant migraines, his left arm has started to atrophy, he frequently looses feeling in his limbs, he's started walking with a cane, he only get about two hours of sleep a night, and on top of all that has started suffering from memory loss.  The only solutions seem to be surgery (which he doesn't want), and physical therapy (which doesn't seem to be working).  I'm the only one he really talks to about these things, cause he doesn't want to scare anyone else.  But he scares me, and it's even becoming frustrating because all my suggestions or encouragements to pursue helped are dismissed.  He always just seems to know that whatever it is, it won't work.

INTIMACY
As if all the health complications weren't enough, his family life was a wildly mentally abusive one.  His father didn't want him, and his mother took off when he was 6.  He was raised by a variety of aunts and uncles until his mother showed back up when he was 17 and claimed to have been there the whole time.  She sticks by this belief to this day and will often bring it up to try and guilt trip him.  At his wedding, she asked him why he didn't have a middle name, and then made him drive her to the airport at 5am the next morning.  I have seen her, more than once, threaten suicide to get what she wants from him (usually money or validation for all the ""sacrifices she made to raise him"").  Not a great foundation, but he managed to persevere through all that and came out the other side a wonderfully kind and caring guy.  He has no problems being emotionally or physical intimate, but again, over the last couple years, that's changed.  His wife of five years, who is lovely, had to have an emergency operation when a cyst the size of a football was found in her pelvis area.  She lost an ovary, and has suffered from hormonal imbalance ever since.  Having a child (something they both really want), became a slim possibility and to make matters worse, her menstrual cycle flipped so now she's on her period every day of the month except for one week.  This has ground their sex life to a halt.  They don't even really cuddle or hold hands or even spend time with each other much anymore from the sounds of things.  I've suggested couples counseling, and he's at least open to the idea, but the problem is he's really started relying on me for the kind of intimacy he's not getting from her.  I want to be EXTREMELY clear here.  We have never had sex.  I'm a lesbian with a practically non-existent sex drive, so that's never going to happen.  But like I've said, we're best friends and a love the guy.  So I've hugged him, kissed him on the cheek, cuddled with him on the couch when he's had a bad day, hung out in Ned with him watching shitty movies.  We're both adults who know where we stand sexually and communicate openly, so this affection has never caused any 'mixed signals'.  I've seen him be just as intimate with his straight male friends.  He's just a really intimate guy.  But now that he isn't getting any kind of affection at all from his wife, he's relying solely on me.  This has cranked his needs from me up to borderline uncomfortable levels, and since I only see him about twice a year, the demand has become overwhelming.  As with all his health problems, I'm the only one he comes to for this, or even talks to.

FINANCIAL
Of course, all those other issues really come back to money.  Proper medical and psychiatric help for all his physical and mental problems?  He can't afford them.  His mother?  Legally stole $450,000 from him (and blew it all on two BMWs and a bad investment on powdered baby formula).  The family he and his wife wanted to start?  Every alternative option requires roughly $50,000 that they don't have.  But he's struggling through other financial problems even on top of all of those.  He's been running his own businesses since his early 20s.  He's owned and operated three different comics and games shops, and is in the process of opening a third one where he lives now.  This new store is shaping up to be at least triple the size of anything he's done before, and as such, a lot of money is moving around.  One of his uncles, we'll call him C, has been his business partner for several years.  C is working with him on this store too, and has gotten investors from overseas involved as well.  They were pushing hard to open by October of last year, but with everything happening in America, the overseas investors started to get nervous.  They were still interested in the store, but the money wasn't coming.  October came and went and it got to the point where they were going to lose the building they wanted to lease.  The landlady wanted a deposit of 100,000 or she would relist it.  Neither B nor C had the money, and the investors weren't coming through, but they asked B and C to find another source and they would pay them back with interest.  A friend of B's put him in touch with some private lenders, and after getting full approval from both C and the investors (as well as a repeated guarantee that they would pay him back in time), B took out a 100k loan.  I bet you can see where this is all going.  The money was supposed to be paid back by February, and in June, he messaged me to tell me all of this ""just in case something happened"".  The private lenders turned out to be a Vietnamese gang, and he'd been getting beaten up by them once a week for the last three months.  C had completely ghosted him, and since he was the middle man between B and the investors, he hadn't heard anything from them either.  Ashamed and embarrassed that he even got into this position, B kept it from everyone else.  He didn't even tell his wife.  But he told me.  He also told me he was 15k short of a 25k ""good will payment"" to get the lenders off his back long enough to remortgage his house to pay the remainder.  I've lent B money before, and he's paid me back on time every single time.  In January last year, I lent him 30k to just have in his account to help with an adoption application.  That all fell through, but he kept the money in the account and wouldn't touch it to deal with these lenders.  I couldn't convince him to, and worried one day someone was going to hit him too hard and he'd wind up in a coma, I wired him the remaining 15k.  This completely emptied my account and dipped into a line of credit I hadn't touched since college.  He was mad, then grateful, and made the payment, buying himself the time he needed to get the rest of the money from the bank.  He promised me I would have the full 45k back by September 10th.  This was good news, because I had been really struggling with stress at work and had planned to take the last two weeks of September off (literally my first vacation in 8 years).  So B gets everything sorted at the bank, but when he reaches back out to the gang to make the final payment and get this all over with, he doesn't hear back.  There's nothing for weeks.  He was supposed to come down and see me over my two weeks off with the money, but he's scared to leave town until this last payment is made.  Then he finds out they're chasing down some con out of town, and won't be back for a few weeks.  I'm pretty anxious at managing everything with negative money and two weeks of no pay, but I'd considered that worse case scenario before even sending him the money, and I knew I'd have enough to make rent and scrape by until my first paycheck.  B waits, and in that time, does some playtesting for a prominent board game company located in France.  They pay him in store credit (roughly $300 worth), so he goes to their online store to spend it.  He ends up hitting a total just over $300, so he adds his card to pay for the remainder.  The checkout screws up, and the full amount is charged to his card.  He contacts customer service, but this is a company with famously bad customer service.  There's a lot of back and forth, and lot of charges and refunds as they fail to process the credit properly, and suddenly B is locked out of his bank account because from the outside, it looks like he's laundering money in France.  He goes to his bank to try and clear things up, but the board game company has to contact the bank themselves to confirm all the transactions are legit.  They are incredibly slow to respond, the bank gets suspicious, and now his account is fully locked down and being audited at the federal level.  He has no access to his money, no way of getting me my money, and wouldn't you know it, that's when the lenders start calling.  He can't get them the money, so the last two weeks he's back to being beat up.  Injuries are getting more serious, and there is nothing I can do to help him because every cent I own is already in his account.

All of this is just...killing me.  Even just typing this all out, I don't believe it's real.  But it is.  I love B, and I do everything I can to help him, but more often than not I just feel like I'm drowning with him.  He recently relapsed into pain meds to the point where he didn't even know what day it was, and only stopped because he ran out and can't afford more.  I want to me mad at him, and I feel terrible even thinking that.  But still...he's said he's going to come down and visit when this is all over...he wants to take me out of town for a long weekend...but I'm starting to feel like I don't want him to come.  I feel like I don't want to see him.  But I get so many text from him out of the blue saying he wants to ""just get in a car and leave"", or ""throw myself off a bridge""...I'm terrified if I take a single step back he will actually kill himself.  Per his request, I haven't told any of our mutual acquaintances (which is pretty much everyone I know) how bad everything has gotten...but I can't cope anymore.  I can't think straight, I can't even begin to deal with any of this.  I'm at my breaking point, and I need an outsider to give me any advice at all.

Tl;dr - My best friend relies on my for absolutely everything, helping him has put me in a very bad financial situation, and I'm worried if I put even a shred of distance between us he's going to commit suicide.",26Oct2018,1

While I was on the way home, I found this creature lying on the ground. I took a closer look and saw that there was a red ant biting its tail. It was struggling and shrieking, probably in pain, so I got rid of the red ant. I feared for the creature, I was worried that someone might step on it, ants might come back or stray cats might gobble it up. Not knowing what to do, I brought it home and now it's in a shoe box with torn up tissue paper. 5 years ago I also brought an abandoned kitten home, so it was not the first time I did something like this.

We talk about sex in text messages and she expresses that she wants to have sex, and that she likes me to take charge and stuff in sexual things.

We've done some sex stuff, but only when I basically initiate, but she's fully into it then.  


But the issue is she's got a guilt complex over stuff, and if I literally ask like can I do something, she essentially always says no. So we haven't fully had sex yet.   


I'm thinking if I just do it, and say nothing she'll just do it too and like it. And she's essentially said she likes me just moving her around and taking the initiative.

But It's so against everything I've learned and especially the way the world is lately, I'm very uncomfortable having sex with someone who won't actually say 'Yes' in the moment. 

She's not a virgin or anything, she's like late 20s, but it's just like she's averse to actually expressing herself.

I got school early (on 7:25) on Tuesdays and Fridays. Because I live a bit away from school that means I gotta get up at 5am. 6am if I have at 8.) I also give private tutoring for an hour after normal class Tuesday and Friday.

I've also got exams coming up. One today actually. And we have a presentation in history class, which probably no one in my group studied for. I could do it all by myself which would probably give me a good grade but I don't want them to look bad since they are somewhat friends.

I also write a lot with this girl. We like each other and, without having said it directly, we probably both want a more serious relationship. I wanna meet her everyday if I could but 1. Im somewhat broke and 2. I don't know what I'd do with her.

111,"Hi, I could really use advice! 

I graduated this spring and I've been working in my first job (programming/research) for a few months now and I enjoy it, but I'm not sure if I want to work here more than a couple of years. I'd like to eventually move into something more like software engineering/human centered design/urban planning/spatial analytics and would like to go to grad school at some point for one of these things.


I just feel really overwhelmed right now. I have no idea how to determine what I want to pursue. 

Plus, I feel stuck and unhappy in the area I'm living because I chose this location/branch of my company to be with my boyfriend, who I've now broken up with because I learned he'd been cheating on me. It's a small town and although I was happy to compromise and live here to be with my boyfriend, I really miss big cities. I'm planning on transferring to a different branch of my company in a different city by next summer. 

I just feel overwhelmed by the amount of transition. I just moved here after college, I'll be moving to a different office branch in the summer. Probably a year later I'll be moving who-knows-where to go to grad school somewhere.

How will I ever connect with people, make connections, be happy if I'm always moving? How will I date??

How do you deal with feeling stuck in one place? I really wish I were somewhere else right now. I've been making friends but nothing close to the connections I had in college. And even if we do get close -- I 'll be moving soon anyway. I feel like suddenly I've graduated and time is slipping through my fingers and here I am wasting a year in this small town.

How do I figure out what I want to go to grad school for? What if I figure it out and none of the programs I apply to accept me? 

How do I keep myself from reconnecting with my cheating ex? I don't love him anymore but sometimes when I'm sad I'm stupidly tempted to reach out to him because I'm very lonely here and he knew me so well and gave me a lot of career advice and was a good  sounding board (he and I were in similar engineering careers, unlike a lot of my friends most of whom studied liberal arts). But that's stupid because his lying and cheating is a big part about why I'm in this position in the first place...

Anyway. Lots of questions. If you have similar experiences or advice or perspective about navigating early 20s post grad life I could really use it!

Hello dear reddit.

This question is directed toward anyone that has had an exchange experience as a former exchange student or host family.

Im a 17, im from a country in Europe and im staying in Texas.

Ive been here for three months, hoping it will get better. I feel like the host family I got is just not a good match for me. Ive been having loads of troubles having to deal with them. My situation is:

Im having to share a room with someone. He has asthma, and snores like a pig. It wakes me up 4-5 times at night and its hard to fall asleep. I usually wear my bose headset and some whitenoise to counteract this, but I really just need a quiet environment to fall asleep so it takes a while, and I have to repeat this 4-5 times EVER SINGLE NIGHT. I get max 5 hours of sleep when I go to bed at 11 and wake up at 6:30. And I can’t go to bed earlier because that’s when people go to sleep in the house.

I can’t stand my roommate as he doesen’t get social queues(if that’s the word) so sharing a room with him gets annoying. Like, trying to do smalltalk while im obviously trying to relax or wearing a headset, even after ignoring him intentionally he doesen’t understand it. The environment we’re in just really sucks. 

I can’t stand my host mother either. She is gross in many ways. And she is on a low carb diet and then kinda shoves it down our throats because she makes us dinner. Since we don’t really eat together, I try to buy some food I can eat as dinner at Walmart or go out with friends to eat. She then gets mad at me because of my “bad eating habits” even though I feel like she shouldn’t be allowed to force that on me.

She is very Christian, tries to make me to go to church every Sunday. But she can’t make me because of my organizations rules, but as she told me herself: “she can’t make me, but she can give me a hard time”.

She never drives me anywhere. Period. 

She has tried multiple times to put me on Life350 (GPS tracking app) and keeps haggling me even though I’ve explicitly said that I want some privacy, I added her on Snapmap so she can see my location but not exact.

Her personality just gets on my nerves, always shouting instead of walking 5 meters to talk to me, and just how overly controlling she is.

Im just not having a good time whatsoever. Ive tried to change familes but my organization doesent allow me to. What do I do? Am I expecting too much?",26Oct2018,1

117,"Hi everyone!

Contrary to the title: I am NOT lazy under any circumstances.

This is what I mean. Every year I plan a trip. Something bad-ass. It's been road trips across the country, mountaineering, skiing, I always try to try something new and push the boundaries of what I've experienced in the past. This has led to some dangerous situations but nonetheless exciting as hell.

So, I'm going to mexico for a couple months in three months. I've flipped and flopped between jobs for the past three years trying to find something I like while trying to finish college (It's hard to finish college, work a job you don't like, pay bills, and plan/execute yearly trips because that's the reason I exist right now). I'm currently working to have a lump sum, enough to move to a location where I don't have to travel thousands of miles to have fun and also a college in proximity so I can balance my hobbies with my responsibilities.

The problem is, after experiencing the rush of traveling and seeing that people make a living doing it, the mundane entry level jobs are only becoming *EVEN MORE MUNDANE*. It's like every second is a drag when I know in three months I'll be diving with sea turtles and backpacking coastline. 

Everyone I have every interacted with at a job doesn't get me. I'm seen as this cool ""gem"" of a person with interesting and foreign hobbies. Nobody I can truly connect with, i'm just that cool laid back dude.

It's really a bummer to feel so alienated, especially when everyone else is (in my ignorant opinion) boring. I'm constantly in this state of wanderlust and as I get closer to the flight date I wake up and say to myself ""Quit. Just quit and never go back. You have enough money now to move after mexico. Just don't go and work on other personal projects until then.""

This mundane job is killing my drive, making me depressed, and destroying my valued personal time. The weekly unpredictable schedule and lack of ease when requesting time off (I really truly am a spontaneous person and I can't always be bothered to plan. Sometimes I just want to go).

On the flip, It's good money and I could use this dough as cushion when I move to Colorado.

I have made my own money before by dog watching/sitting and that was always the most enjoyable work I have done in my life. I wish I could find a way to match the money I make now with this.

**How can I make myself stay focused at work and not slowly resent it the more time goes on? It seems 6 months is the max my soul can take before I say ""Fuck this modern human shit I need to go 2,000 miles away and climb this back country mountain""**

118,"I have a friend, whom I met 5 years ago and we are still friends now. I used to be a terrible person, someone who would never care about others, someone who would never consider another person's feelings and never care about their reasons for doing things. She got upset with me being like that and started changing me into who I am now. Frankly speaking, I'm grateful, because I felt like I have changed for the better and I don't really get angry at people that much anymore. 
However,  right now, it's just mentally draining for me to be with her, I used to draw, but she always give me too much unwanted critisim because she has personal training from an art teacher and she's a student in an art course. And I received plenty of complaints from others,talking about how she would criticise people's arts badly, then start flooding the chat room with her own artworks,telling others ""Oh but my art is so bad though"",and yet starts getting upset when she lack customers when she opened up commissions.Eventually I just stopped drawing because she would keep commenting on all my works,whenever I posted.I talked to another friend about this, and she went ""Hey hey hey are you even listening to yourself? How many things you enjoyed doing, you quitted just because of her? "" And I relooked back at the convo, plenty of things,and probaly many more.
Another thing is that she would always rant about me to her other friends, and have the cheek to causally tell me ""Oh person A has a really bad impression of you"". 
And rant about her other friends to me as well. 
Also we both play a game,and she would whine a lot when someone kept boasting about their own damage or gears. But she also boasts and brag aherself, and gets angry at anyone who outdamages her or wins against her.
I've also had complaints about her being irresponsible, like oversleeping when she has something important to do, not working on a 4 months overdue commission (and yet still does a bunch of other artworks, and had the cheek to tag her customer and say ""I bet you're angry that I haven't finished your commission yet"".Like yes, she is, she ranted to me.). I talked to her about her responsibilities, although I never told her that I received complaints, only to get a ""I'm too lazy and I'm busy with school"" from her. 
The closest person I'm with irl would be my ex. We broke up because we realised that we aren't properly committed and that we both cared about other things more than each other. The relationship ended on bad terms, but we managed to get over it and be good friends now, but my friend would always react negatively to him, although she has never talked to him unless it's to bug into our relationship. (I never asked her for help, she dragged the relationship on longer when we were both in the middle of discussing a break up) 
Also,She keeps making jokes about how I hate her, at first I didn't mind but she keeps pushing it that I'm starting to think that maybe I do. 
But just like how she stayed with me till I became a better person ,I want to be the same for her too. But if she keeps acting this way it's kinda hard for me to stay with her.
A person once stated that our friendship is rather toxic, but I am not sure if it's really toxic or not, because everyone has their flaws and me being upset with her could be me being overly sensitive about things. I've been raised in a way that toxicity is kinda normal so I don't really realize it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 17. I have been attending this very small private school for a couple months now and have found myself in a friend group, the youngest being 15, the oldest being 18. I genuinely enjoy talking to all of them, but I don't have very much in common with them. My closest friend actively smokes cigarettes, weed, and drinks alcohol. She has a history of being addicted to cigarettes and being suicidal as well as cutting. Another of my friends is completely addicted to cigarettes, weed, alcohol, and has done heroin in the past. Two other of my friends go to one of their cars everyday to get high, and one keeps an E-Juice in her backpack which she uses in the school bathrooms with the first person mentioned. The last two have gotten high and been drunk, but are pretty tame for the most part. All of them have had sexual experiences and shit like that. 

For starters, I'm not judging them. I'm not going to report them, although I do try to avoid enabling them. All in all, I don't care that they do any of this stuff, but I feel extremely out of place. I have never been 'high' per-say. I've taken a bunch of codeine cough syrup on two different occasions (in which I just ended up taking a nap) and I have never been drunk, maybe slightly tipsy at best. I've never so much as been asked out as I'm Aro-Ace and have never been interested in that stuff. 

In fact, I use the fact that I actively self harm as a way to relate to them, and I have started eating hand sanitizer. Drugs and Alcohol are something I'm pretty afraid of approaching because I tend to have strong reactions to medications, and because I fear for how they will mix with my self harm and suicidal tendencies. Basically, if I get drunk, I'd probably end up in the hospital getting stitches 

I mean, this is literally the most friends i've ever had at one time, and I like talking and seeing them at school, and the friend i'm closest with and I play FFXIV together. The issue is, sometimes I am uncomfortable being around them and they definitely think i'm pretty lame and a bit of a buzzkill.

Example: today I drove 3 of them to target during lunch as I am the only one with a drivers license. While in the car, it was revealed to us that one of them wanted to get soda and cough syrup (to make lean). I made it clear that I wasn't encouraging it, and that I didn't want to contribute any money to support her need to make lean. We ended up getting ID for the cough syrup, and I was filled with relief that there would be no drugs passed around.

My mom absolutely hates my friends group, and I think she blames them for my more recent decline in mental health. 

I've just been feeling like such a loser, does anyone have any advice to help me feel less uncomfortable around my friends, and to help me deal with this large difference in hobbies. Also, I'd love to hear that I'm not the only one who didn't do drugs or drink as a teenager, but I think everyone thinks I'm weird because I pull out my ds and play harvest moon while they talk about sucking dick or whatever.",26Oct2018,1

142,I normally don’t concern myself with te beliefs of others but at my first year in community college my sociology teacher spent the first two days fully discussing “the fact that god is made up and not real” she won over most of the class with a smile (she truly is in the field of psychology) but did so while promoting students to talk about their religion then exclaim how rediculous they are to her. This isn’t a personal religious vendetta I just despise people who use a public institution to push their own agenda. Regardless of if religion is better or not it can have a positive impact on people’s lives so I don’t believe their religion is any of her business. Needless to say after the second day I left the class early and dropped it after she was drawing pictures of Jesus on the board and laughing at it. I want to know if at a community college there are any actions that can be taken against this woman to prevent her from wasting students’ time,26Oct2018,1
143,"I'm trying to get over my fears and finally start dating. As an added little push I'm using my birthday to try and force me out of my shell. Kinda like a pseudo new year resolution thing.

The problem is that I have an irrational fear that I'll be laughed at for being as good as a virgin while in my twenties. I say as good as because I have had sex once, as a young child. After being molested by someone I thought I could trust, I've had trust issues that have made it difficult to form any kind of relationship, not just romantic ones.

Every time I get into a romantic situation with a woman, I always pussy out and back away, and I'm getting sick of it.

I've read about one guy who hired an escort to help him, but I'm not sure if that's the best solution for me.

So I guess I'm trying to figure out a good way to break this news to someone I'm trying to hook up with, without telling everyone I talk to at the bar (or where ever you meet people, I'll figure that part out next.) Especially since I've never told anyone this before. My hands are shaking even thinking about posting this anonymously.

TLDR: How do I explain why I can't even kiss without telling everyone I meet ""I was raped as a kid""?

144,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.  
Me and my gf have been together for 3 years. We are still in our yearly 20s. Last year I went to school abroad and we have been in long distance relationship since then.  
We do everything on video calls. We talk we laugh and then we do some very freaky sexual stuff on the video call. We also sext each other and sometimes we play along as characters. Tonight, we played along as me her being submissive. I sent her a bunch of really really freaky stuff and she forgot to delete them. She met her mom and for some reasons her mum was using her phone and went into her texts and read the conversation, looked at exchanged pictures, etc.  
Our families are super super religious. We are not that religious but obviously they don’t think we are that freaky.  
It is a very bad image for us and especially for her. She is in a tough spot because she will witness the aftermath directly.

146,"Hey Reddit, I wanted to get your input on what I should do with my life… Bit of background. I am soon to be 23, been going to community college for 4 years now. I started in computer science, and enjoyed it but I couldn’t keep up with the math I needed. I switched to Architecture and am about a semester away from having my AA in Architecture. Here’s where I run into a few problems. Architecture is a ton of work; I’ll still have to go to university for at least two years sink myself into a ton of debt, then take the 7 licenses tests along with almost 4,000 hours of work experience before I can get my license. I’ve talked to a few architects and they all say the job is beyond stressful for the amount of money they make. AKA they didn't think it was worth it. I’m now second guessing my choices… A family friend of mine works in construction management and he says he really enjoys it so I’m thinking about that.
A bit about the other jobs I’ve had and who I am as a person. I worked at an advertising agency for a while, then worked Apple retail for 3 years. I was so over that place wow. I then had a job kind of land in my lap that was probably the favorite I’ve had so far. I worked as an R&amp;D engineer designing and making products for a small company. I love 3D modeling and working with 3D printers to bring those models to life. I thoroughly enjoyed working with manufacturers to mass produce my product . Unfortunately since that was a small company they went bankrupt and I now work for a mechanical engineering firm doing MEP design on commercial and residential buildings. Basically I sit on AutoCAD for 8 hours a day cleaning drawings and designing. I’m also slowly going crazy sitting behind a desk for so long.
I guess my problem is that I have a lot of different interests and am struggling to figure out where to go next with my life. I think in an ideal world I would work for an outdoor recreation company helping design and test products… I’m not really sure how one gets into that. I’m really into photography and videography as well.  I’m hoping you guys can give me some advice on where to go next.

152,"Ok, I am gay. Met this guy that as far as I am concerned is gay, until I asked him and he told me that he was straight. Don't get me wrong, but I am 95% sure he's gay, the way he acts, the way he suddenly brings up topics somehow related to LGBT issues all the time, he follows LGBT pages on Facebook and just about every small things that I've noticed in him that only gay people would do. So, it didn't really occur to me that he could be in the closet. (Or not if he's actually straight.) I don't like to assume someone's sexuality, but I'm just 100% sure he is gay thus closeted (everyone in our group thinks the same...).
My attempts at flirting have been somehow weak, he's not exactly the most talkative person but always find myself panicking when I am talking to him, thus limiting how much I can speak to him coz fml. He has been quite responsive from time to time though, sometimes trying to invite himself to do something with me. Idk if he's just not interested or he's just not very expressive. And well, I've been thinking about moving on recently and just downloading tinder, but the thought that I haven't at least tried with him really hurts me. I don't know how to approach this situation... Never really dated, asked someone out... 
Should I just say fuck it and invite him out for some kind of date, talk to him, or just forget about everything? He lives in my dorm, so if things turn out not in my favor, it might get really awkward since we are most of the time in the same group... And if he does end up actually straight, then I'll probably look like a fucking disrespectful prick who chose to believe that the guy is gay for his own personal reasons. It's not that I am afraid of getting rejected (which I am ofc), but I don't want to make myself look like a disrespectful jerk. 
I don't think I have ever crushed that hard on someone. And I fucking hate myself for not knowing how to even try, or to simply approach the situation.

But I can't figure out for the life of me why this is happening in such a manner as shown. 

My bed is indeed next to a window, but it has barely been 3 months, and besides the point, it's not an overall fade, just in spots. The most I would think could've caused this would be spilling something, but a) I can't remember ever spilling anything and b) that still doesn't explain how these got on the underside of it or how sporadic they are. It's how scattered and all over they are that really gets me.

161,"Hello,  


So I \[M\] have a friend that I have known for a little over a year and a half \[F\]. We hit it off fantastically, and I had always been fond of her but never overstepped my bounds as her friend out of respect and the fact that we worked together. I always noticed her being flirty, but it wasn't until New Years this past year that she told me that she had feelings for me the way I did her. This of course got me excited, however the following day she realized she wanted to stay friends which frustrated me but I was not about to let such a little thing ruin a good friendship.  


This is where it gets odd for me, she invited me over to hang out one night and was being very forward in her flirting. We ended up making out for a bit before I stopped her and reminded her that the last time something like this happened I was the one that got hurt and knew she would regret it. She then went on to assure me that she wanted to, and we continued for a bit until I ended up going home.  


And wouldn't you know it a day later she goes to explain how big of a mistake it was and that it won't happen again. But here is the issue, I really care about her and the fact she has betrayed my trust twice now only to take it back really irks me. The emotional toll of it all has been rough, but nothing I can't handle I just question whether or not to try and continue the friendship or end it. She means a lot to me, but I can't keep getting hurt like that.

First of all, we commonly prank each other in very harsh ways, so it wouldn’t surprisd me that this was anoter prank, but if it wasn’t a prank this would make me kinda sad.

So the thing is my friend told me that our close friend (by close I mean like reeeally close to both of us) was talking with him and out of nowhere she started crying really hard and feeling like shit about some issues. He told me about another thing that also was “serious” but he told me that it was very personal so he wouldn’t tell me that. After that I told him “nah mate, you and Karen be on some shit”, but he kept insisting that it wasn’t a joke and that I shouldn’t tell her that he told me all that stuff.

The problem is why wouldn’t she tell me aswell, so that’s where I started thinking it was a prank.
But at the same time it could just be that she doesn’t feel like expressing it to me for whatever reason. And also he told me that she wouldn’t tell me that because I just wasn’t there at the right moment.

It complicates things that we left our families in the Midwest and moved to California three months ago. We graduated college and had profession opportunities out here. At the time we discussed his parents’ situation and  considered postponing our move but they discouraged it. After we had been out here a month or so we found out his older sisters had decided to move them into assisted living, the general situation was worse than we thought,  and that his mother’s confusion was not just a symptom of caregiver stress but in-fact a rapidly degenerative form of dementia. 

I can tell he is struggling. He is his fathers only child (his sisters have a different dad) and I KNOW he feels like his dads needs are being overlooked now that his mom has fallen ill as well. He also has family members who are taking advantage of the situation (think crack head uncles letting themselves into the garage etc) but when I ask him if he wants to go home or talk to a professional about his stress he says no. I’m afraid it’s partially because relocating has been the expected kind of difficult and he wants to maintain a positive attitude for me, but I also think he might feel defeated by the situation and is just suppressing his stress. He’s been my best friend for years, and this is the first time I can’t really tell what he is feeling and I can’t even imagine what it would be like. I recently watched my mom lose my grandparents but it was so different- they were old and so was she. She had friends going through the same thing and it was a normal thing for them to talk about. He just seems so alone. He acts apathetic but I know he cares about them deeply.

What can I do? What do I say? When I go Freudian or counselor on him (my degree is related) he gets frustrated or annoyed and I feel preachy. Talking about it makes him sad but does avoiding the topic not just make things worse? Am I a terrible person for keeping him 1500 miles from home? If you were ever in this situation what did you wish your partner had done for you? We are excited to start our adult lives in a new place but are we being selfish by thinking it’s now or never?

I immediately understood what was happening and realized why he had been so happy for the last 3 or 4 weeks. I didn't even get angry. At this point I find it almost funny.

Two years ago I matched with this lady on ancestryDNA. I sent her a message then. She just replied to me today. We are very closely related. We are listed as “close family- 1st cousins”. We share 2,055 cms (how they measure shared DNA). We started to talk about how we might be related, but she started asking me questions like “what’s your moms name”, “how old are you?”, “is my dad my biological dad”. She told me that i reminded her of her brother because of my big blues eyes. I didn’t think anything of it at the moment. But I checked what our CMS means and a number that high is listed as “aunt, uncle, half sibling, niece, nephew”. I know all my aunts. Once the thought entered my head that my dad wasn’t biologically mine. I sent her a message asking if her brother has ever lived where I live (she lives two hours away) and she told me yes. That’s why she was asking those questions. We figured out that she is my aunt. 

I confronted my mom about it and she told me my dad was my real dad but she kept texting me later on asking how accurate these tests are. She eventually spilled the guys name which turned out to be the name of the brother. 

Me and my mom do not have a good relationship. She is very unfaithful and is always dragging me into her messes. Me and my dad have a very strong relationship. I told him immediately once I had confirmation and he told me that he wasn’t surprised. He has suspicions but he never thought of me any differently.

They wanted to renovate the basement and make it an apartment. I told them I don’t have the money to do that - nor do I even want it since we don’t have permits (they were doing it on their own) and it will be an issue down the road with the town.

In the last letter he sent he told me he didn’t have a girlfriend or any kids. He was flirting heavily and telling me he wished he could see me as much as he thought of me. He then told me to look up his younger sister and his mother so I could add them. I had a little stalk and.. he has a fiancé. I was pretty annoyed. I hate people who cheat and lie. So I did something dumb and sent her a message through a fake Facebook account. I regretted it immensely, so the next day (today) I did something even dumber and shot her another message saying I lied, and that I was jealous and knew him from before. I then blocked her on the fake account. 

After posting this on an advice page on Facebook a lot of girls made fun of me, telling me he will probably seek revenge. He does have a friend that lives half an hour away from me. She’s his best friend. He himself is from another country. I’m now pretty scared and paranoid. He was only in prison for robbery but I am still anxious. Just seeking some advice on what to do.

176,"Hey all, this is my first time posting here, so here goes asking advice from strangers. TL;DR is at the end.

I'm currently attending a community college and had a plan to go there for four years to get a bachelors degree thanks to a program that connects other four year colleges to have their classes on the campus. It's close to home, I've lived in the town for all my life, I know the area well, and I consider it my home. Imagine my horror and dread when my mom said that she plans to move out in two years.

For some context, I live with my mom, grandmother (her mom), and younger sister. I love my family dearly. My mom is a single mom working to support us and I try to help out whenever I can. And I love my sister more than anything in this world a la Angelica Schuyler to Eliza in Hamilton. I love her to death and she loves me too. I know some people would kill to have a good sibling relationship, so I consider myself lucky. I love my grandma too, if just because she's my grandma, and she's the main homemaker while my mom works and I study. I help out with the money, and my sister helps out with the chores. We support each other however we can.

Which is what's terrifying me since it's the biggest influencer in my choices.

My mother wants to move to the state where her recently new boyfriend is at. For job-related reasons he can't move to us, and my mom makes a piss-poor salary that's nowhere near to how much you should make to support a family of four. He has a stable job and makes a lot more than what the two of us make combined. My mom gave consideration to my college career, so that's why she's waiting two years. I can't convince her to not move because it's a smart financial choice on her part.

She got out of an abusive household with my dad and his parents after 14 years of suffering. This area is not her home. She's just a renter while she's looking for a place to settle (despite the fact that we're currently living in our purchased house for nearly two years now.) This is her second boyfriend in 4 years, and they've been hitting it off. He came over several times to visit on the weekends, and he's a pretty cool guy. I know it's really early to tell, but I doubt that they won't be able to make the sparks fly, if you get what I mean.

The divorce between my parents was messy, and it messed me up too. I didn't feel stable until we moved into this new house, and less than two years living here, when I was finally able to call this home, my mom drops the bomb that we're moving yet again in two years, and to a completely different state at that. She plans to buy a house with him when she does move, so I don't even know what area we'll be moving into. I'd say my fear and stress over this is pretty warranted.

I want to be a PA (physician assistant) when I'm older, and completing a four year degree on a community college campus isn't an opportunity I wanna pass up. At the same time, I can't bear the thought of separating from my family. Do I follow the path I feel I need to follow to achieve my dream, or do I go with my family?

Another consideration is that, should I separate, my sister will be in a completely different city with just a year in high school. We were each other's rock when the divorce occurred, and she's just as scared as I am of what choice I'm going to make.

These are the options that I thought of:

1. I stay while they move, and I live in the same house, most likely with a roommate. I don't know if coming home to a near empty house is going to kill me though, and I don't know if I'll be financially stable for myself in two years time.
2. I stay while they move, and I go live with my dad. My dad's actually trying to mend the relationship between the two of us, and it's going decently. His girlfriend is my mom's ex-best friend, however, so I don't know if I want to deal with her. However, I get more support this way, and my other grandmother (dad's mom) is cordial with me as well despite her mistreatment of my mom.
3. I stay while they move, and I go find an apartment. This would happen if I couldn't stay at the house for whatever reason, and the only issue with this is becoming financially stable enough in two years to pay rent and bills.I stay while they move, and I go live at a friend's house. If the family drama becomes too much and I can't upkeep the house for whatever reason, I consider this to be a last resort. I have two sub-options from here.  

   1. One of my friends is commuting, and he understands the situation enough where he's offered a couch if things got dire. I don't know his parents at all, however, aside from the fact that they're old and strict and the house is pretty small.
   2. The other one has moved out of state for college, but his mother at the very least knows and likes me. The family is friendly enough, so I'm fairly sure if their son explained my situation to them, I could crash at his empty room for a little bit. However, like I said before I consider this a last resort.
4. Finally, my last option would be to pack up everything and move to the new state with my family. Transferring is going to be messy, but at least I would be at a new stable home with my family, and my sister and I can support each other while we swim through uncharted waters. I'm so fearful of this option though, but I also don't want my sister to go and be in a completely new city without me, since my mom isn't the greatest support rock.

Of course, two years is a long time, and things can change in that amount of time. This could all go away by then. The relationship could crumble, but I doubt that. Any help, advice, or just general support would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: Do I stay and pursue my dream and struggle without my main support group, or do I move with my family into a new state and postpone my dream in life?",26Oct2018,1
177,"My family is going through a horrible time right now. We’ve been through tough times but never like this. I’m 20, I just moved back in with my parents to save me money and pursue a career. Unfortunately, we lost our family business last year and we manage to barely make ends meet until now.
My dad does catering and just did a big order out of state for a lot of money, money that was supposed to go to our bills, home, car bills etc. At the time of the order it was the last of our money and it was supposed to be a big boost for us. 

Well we do the order and we were supposed to get paid for it but never got paid. The customer has tried to pay but it was through Greendot which my dad used a card from them from Walmart. I don’t know anything about greendot or the details. All I know is that green dot seems like they are trying to scam my dad, along with hundreds of other customers (customer complaints online) and after weeks he has not been able to get his money from it and has been working for Grubhub to get by until his catering business picks up again (we recently moved to a new location far from home, before we realized how much financial difficulties we were gonna face, we would not have moved if we knew) 

So his catering can’t get enough business to support anymore, Grubhub doesn’t help enough, I work but can’t make enough, my dad works but can’t make enough, my mom can’t work cause she is an alcoholic and just can’t do it, we can’t get our money from the Greendot problem, and my dad actually almost committed suicide today and I got him out of it. But I didn’t realize how bad or situation was until it was explained to me today, I didn’t realize how far behind we were. I knew it was a struggle but we are a out to be evicted and havent a huge amount of bills now. 

I’m at a loss of ideas and I’m scared for my family, especially my dad who I can’t live without. If he ended his life today I’d loss my mind. Glad he’s here still but that still leaves us blank. We simply have no money. We’ve done it, were done. Don’t know what to do. Don’t even know what possible advice people can give. We’re just helpless.",26Oct2018,1

186,"So, where do I even begin to start. Umm. I am 25 and he is 35. We have been married for five years. We share one child together he will be turning 2 soon and he is the stepfather to my son from a previous relationship, a 5 year old. We are always broke. We have one car. I own the home, it was my fathers whom recently passed away. Alongside my brother, mom, my grandparents and not to mention various aunts and uncles. I literally have no one. He works for 7.75 an hour. He has no drive to get anything else. On his days off he plays video games or sits on his phone. He never helps me clean etc. I pay the bills with my dads insurance check that comes monthly and my child support. We never go anywhere. Not that my truck would allow us to go far. We are on a spare. So day in and day out I sit and watch tv, clean and do everything around the house. He states that he is always busy etc etc. Well then why the FUCK am I the only one who has done laundry in five fucking years. He will finally get up and clean after I get to the point of having a screaming rage for him to contribute. ALL DURING MY PARENTS DEATHS I still had to be an adult, BUT I went on a solo hiking trip when my mom passed and he watched the boys for me. The house was in a horrid state when I got back. His mom made the comment maybe (we will call him Tom) Tom would have liked to have gone. Well fuck. I KNOW HE WOULD LOVE TO COME ON A TRIP. BUT I NEED A MOTHERFUCKING BREAK. I was a teen mom and got married to the first guy who told me he loved me because I thought well, shit, who else would love a shack up.

I had to quit school recently because he can't make more than he's making because apparently there is nothing out there and our car is shit. So we are planning on selling my home and moving to be closer to his family. Well the fucker has no driver WHATSOEVER to help improve our situation. I'm having cabin fever, so I begged for a ciggerate just to calm my nerves. I get it. It's bad for me, he doesn't want me to pick up the habit. He told me if I wanted one I'd have to go buy them myself. Knowing damn well the spare is liable to pop any minute. So after throwing a fit I finally get the cancer stick. Now I am here writing this.

I feel so fucking trapped. I have no friends, I was an exotic dancer in the Bible Belt. The entire town knows that history so alas no one wants to hang out with an ex stripper. He gets invited to go over to coworkers houses. Tom is so charismatic, he makes friends so easily. His family is huge in the state we are planning on moving too. He says that when we move he will be able to find a steady job with a higher pay (considering the minimum wage in this state basically doesn't cut it).

We never have sex and when we do he refuses foreplay. ACTUALLY the last time we exchanged bodily fluids he went soft. I couldn't help but laugh. It just felt so pathetic. I'm over this.

We had gotten into a huge argument about me being stuck in the house, literally I have been in the house for a couple of months straight. Well, long story short, I was a complete lunatic and threw my fathers ashes, after we had a yelling match. I wish I could redo the moment and keep his ashes in my hands, near me. Please don't bash me. We both got physical. The cops were called etc.

His mom was involved, he called her for a way to fly back. Well she texted me asking what I was doing to her son. Well I responded with we are splitting custody and he has time to save for an apartment. Well she was like no we are taking the baby, WATCH US. He stated that the wheels were already turning for the custody battle. All of this happened outside of my home. INFRONT of my super religious neighbors. While he was gone (walking to wherever) I started to feel the walls closing in. I HAVE NO ONE LEFT. I am going to be alone and die alone. Whilst my child first father was nagging for friends with benefits. I had to sweet talk him so he'd fucking lend me some money. My husband left me with 75 dollars. So with the notion of dying and decaying with my cat eating me and having to be in a position where my ex would gain control again (he is a bully), I drove and found him walking. He refused to get into the car. Etc etc. EVENTUALLy we ended up reconciling, after I begged him to come back. Even though I wanted the safety of not being alone and not actually wanting him. EVEN though his is beautiful. He is so handsome and his voice is usually soothing.

After the fight, while he was sleeping I went through his phone. His mom had screenshot everything I was texting her and sent it to him. EVERYTHING before that was deleted besides her saying OH I KNEW YOU WOULD GO BACK FOR THE KIDS. The next week, she texts, ""How are you? I'm worried?"" Tom: ""Everything is fine and yes."" FAT mil:""ARE YOU REALLY? with a snide winky face. (We have to share a phone sometimes because sometimes I don't have enough for my phone bill, his dad gave him one and pays for his so sometimes I have to use it and it just popped up that time.)

187,"Hello everyone.  I have a question and this might seem a bit personal for some people but I need some help. 
 Do any of you woman or men still stay wet after sex?  I honestly hate it.  To the fact it annoys me sometimes. My boyfriend and I use protection but I'm tired of it.  Even when we don't have sex I'll still be wet if we have some fun.  Did I not get enough pleasure and is that my body's response or am I still aroused?

188,"So I run an Etsy shop where I sell obsidian knives.  It's a hobby of mine that I have been working on for quite some time.  My shop has been open for about a year and a half, and I've done pretty well selling my knives all over the world.  The link below is for reference.  I'm not trying to market here.

[My Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ObsidianSprings)

Anyway, my problem is that while I love making the knives, I hate  listing and marketing them.  like seriously hate it.  It take a lot of time and skill to make a knife, but it also takes a lot of time and skill to list it.  After the knife is complete,  I have to take pictures of each knife (every knife is different, and I'm no pro photographer), list the knife on my shop complete with pictures, tags, and a description, and then when there's a purchase, I have to package the knife properly, and ship it off.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this.  If I were to find someone locally looking to make a few bucks that I trusted with my shop, and they would do the listing, photographing, shipping ect. (it would be no more than one or two knives a week), what kind of percentage do you think would be fair to give them?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I love making the knives, but the selling part almost (but not quite) makes it not worth it.  I'm not making tons of money, so I can't hire a professional, I'm bringing in maybe 80.00-100.00/week on a good week.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  what percentage of the profits do I offer someone for listing my product on my etsy page, and shipping it?

191,"I had this amazing opportunity handed to me at my college - the director of the honors program reached out and asked me to join. This program entails nearly fully funded study abroad for 2 weeks, free printing, a scholarship upwards of $1,000, and a significantly higher chance of getting a job past graduation. On the other hand, you have to put in volunteer work, demonstrate leadership, and basically be a model citizen. It's not just ""once you're in, you're in."" You have to dedicate so much time and energy once you're in to stay there, including maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I'm mentally not there, but I feel like I can't give up this chance of a lifetime. I'm depressed and have been for the past few years. I'm in therapy, but I still barely manage getting through school. The only reason I excel at school is because I don't have friends and have way too much free time to dedicate to academics. I am afraid that if I commit to this, I may live with regret past college if I don't get a job, but I am also afraid that if I commit, I will become overwhelmed with the volunteer work I have to do and maintaining the GPA and potentially (and likely) become even more depressed and stressed than I already .

198,"So, I think I'm a fucking idiot and this has only just dawned on me. 

For months, I've been reporting illicit pornography on Tumblr. Not ""risque"", not "" hentai"", although that can border on illegal in my country, proper illegal pornography. 

I hate it, and I know it exists on Tumblr in such a high amount that it isn't even hard to find. I get a kick from finding it and reporting it, although when I check up later the website has done nothing to take down certain blogs that have such a high amount of illegal content that it blows my mind. After all, children use that site, it should be safe. 

And now I'm fucking terrified, all the time. Reporting this stuff has become as addicting to me as viewing the content might be to it's huge audience online. The rush I get from actually hunting it down and sending the report makes me feel amazing; I'm probably just full of myself. 

This morning, however, it dawned on me: what if the police come looking for me just for looking at this? I know that's a crime, a big one, and it's not one I want to go down for. 

My life has finally gotten good. I live with some amazing friends, I've got a girlfriend that I love so much, and I just got an amazing new job.

I couldn't joke around like we used to, he appeared more cold to me, or maybe he just matured more while I still acted like a highschooler. Though we like similar things its really hard to find common ground for us to talk about stuff. Tbh it may be because we had such a lack of contact between us. It was also unfortunate that the year he came back was the year I left for university. I really did try when I left to contact him as much as possible since I could finally afford to buy a phone and laptop. But with all my efforts he hardly replies to my messages, yet with his friends he is always prompt and has a better relationship than I do with him. 

I feel really depressed about it. Sometimes I think maybe it was my fault that it got to this stage, or I did something to make him this way towards me and I really want to change it. I miss the times we spent and how we opened up to each other about anything. Even if it's not in the same as before I really just want to be comfortable with him again.",26Oct2018,1
209,"...so there’s that, but here’s her:
approaching 50, two kids (me and my younger brother), has had a pretty tough life, used to collect little Buddha statues and work away in factories to sustain us once father walked out and never returned (well for another ten years, but it’s a nice turn of phrase. They’re back together now and pretty happy. A different story for a different day). 


In the last few years, she’s become a devoted Christian and I think she’s fallen into the trap of watching a YouTube channel recorded by a vicar who has straight out right wing views on the world and how it should be run. So from there, she’s gone on to right wing news webpages, right wing podcasts, all of it presented as not so much “right wing” as just “national” or “hidden truth”. It’s like she’s on a constant drip of poison and quite addicted to it. I wonder whether she’s found something she’s always identified with or just fallen into something mindlessly. For the record, she’s not the smartest cookie out there. Doesn’t have very many chocolate chips at her disposal, but hey. She’s always been a kind mother, unbelievably devoted; having kids was essentially her life goal and the both of us (me and bro) are like pupils in her eyes. 


But we’ve got to talking last night and some difficult subjects have cropped up. I actually don’t want to be going into excruciating detail, because that in turn causes excruciating pain. I imagine this is what it feels like to have one’s heart ripped out and then stomped on in front of you. And that done by someone who grew your heart inside of them from scratch for nine months. 


Anyway, some of the things said included her going on about how the Germans are a guilty nation (perpetually apparently), how I’m a bolshevik (in our native tongue this equals to calling someone a filthy communist), how refugees rape and kill and have no shame and no rights and shouldn’t be “praised” just for their being there and surviving, and how regular citizens don’t get the same benefits for just sitting around and doing nothing. She said she couldn’t believe she had raised someone like me - not in a nice way. You can probably imagine the rest of her repertoire pretty well now. 


I also said things. About me: I’m a liberal, wholeheartedly so. I consider myself a rather neutral human being, too, and when I fall prey to prejudice, I try to call myself out on it and slap myself with the hand I wear my big ring on. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, I try to consider the complexities of the processes in the world both on an individual and global level (never succeed), and I rarely ever pass judgment. That’s only because I know how complicated I am myself, just because I’m human, and I imagine we’re all the same so unless I’m sat in someone’s head watching the neurons fire, I can’t ever tell what’s going on behind those foreheads.


But I also said things. I told her she was like Winnie the Pooh (just to make it clear I wasn’t finding her very smart), that she can’t ever see past the tip of her nose, that people rape and kill everywhere, and advocated her just looking at humans as humans. Not black or brown or red or green, not gay or straight, not pineapple on a pizza lovers and pineapple on a pizza haters, just humans. Yeah we’re beautiful, yeah we’re fucking ugly. We’re all different, we’re all the same. We’re tender and empathetic but we go to wars and go past less fortunate people begging in the streets without even winking. We’re creatures of habit, we’re creatures of evolution (she doesn’t believe in evolution either), and we’re creatures of circumstances. I feel like I’m rambling all to myself but it’s freeing to write it, because I’ve been feeling like I’m going crazy, so it is good to put it all down on paper and think: “no, this makes sense, this looks good, I’m not nuts”. 


Finally, after a long escalation I can’t even recall so much anymore because she just kept yelling and I was on the defence repeating: “I never said Germans didn’t start the war, I only said the contemporary German didn’t start the war” and things to such very basic effect, anyway finally she said: “I think black people should have their own buses”. Because they litter apparently. 


That I couldn’t stand, I just started crying. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I got up and left. She tried to stop me, I said I was ashamed of her, asked her not to touch me and stormed out without looking back. 


I feel terrible. The person I’m supposed to cherish, the person that co-made me and pushed me out, believes in racial segregation, demonises everyone around her, wants, quite actively, inequality and white privilege, and thinks vaccines........ cause autism, yeah you got that right. What on earth am I supposed to do now? ",26Oct2018,1

After I took the cover off in favor of my own, I started feeling very odd. I would have no energy, be bedridden, sick or nauseous.

238,"Throwaway account because my main is VERY Christian and I don't want people to see this.

Basically the title. I'm in my 20s, and have been lgbt for nearly my entire life. I identified as bi at 12, lesbian at 14, and then as a straight trans guy from the age of 16 to now.

The problem is, my family is not supportive (shocking). I've been through therapy for my dysphoria and extreme depression, and almost got approval for hormone therapy until I backed out at the last minute. I just couldn't afford it at the time, and couldn't handle the stress of transitioning alone without the support of my friends and family.

Since then, in the past year I've kind of....stopped. Everything. I started going by my birth name again, grew my hair out a bit, and started wearing girly clothes. I also found religion and became a pretty hardcore Christian---reading the Bible every day, taking it literally, turning against all sins in order to be born again. I went from an openhearted liberal to the standard Midwest conservative anti-lgbt Christian.

Now my dysphoria is creeping back yet again and I've never felt so lost. After so many years of being dysphoric, I feel like I KNOW that I'm trans. I always said that if I could flip a switch be born male I'd do it in a heartbeat. But now I have such a firm belief in Christianity that I don't know if I could handle the guilt of such a permanent sin. Plus my family would be so disappointed if their good little Christian girl suddenly went back to saying she'd rather be a man. 

I have a better job and could afford hrt now, but I don't want to be the family outcast again. I don't want to be alone again and I don't want to turn my back on God. Should I just suffer through this ""phase"" and wait for my dysphoria to quiet down again so I can ignore it, or should I just give in to who I've always been and start transitioning for good?

Transitioning would do wonders for me physically/mentally/emotionally, but I feel like the cons outweigh the pros (it's expensive, a lot of legal work, I'd be less accepted by society, my family would turn away from me, I'd no longer have my religion to fall back on). I've just never felt so horribly conflicted and I don't want to be fighting this for the rest of my life.
 
 

tl;dr: I identified as a trans guy for years, then became a hardcore conservative Christian after everyone disapproved of me. Now my dysphoria is back and I don't know what to do.

241,"Hi all,

About 1 1/2 years ago I moved abroad for a temporary transfer of my job to a European office, about 6-8 hours by plane from my home city.  Soon after I moved I met someone, fell in love, yada yada, now we're living together and have been going out for about a year and are talking about getting married.  She's really wonderful and supportive and I'm sure she's the one. 

The issue is twofold: the first is that she is from this country and does not want to leave.  I'm personally very cool with staying here at well and am in no hurry to move back to the US.  The second is that she is not Jewish, and my family are observant Jews (not black hat and beard, but fairly observant nonetheless), although I am and have been agnostic for a long time and have no desire to have Judaism in my life or raise my future kids in that religion.  She is also an agnostic/atheist and similarly wants to steer clear of religion, so it works out great. 

However the combination of both of those things is just intolerable to my family.  Out of the two the most difficult is the living abroad part for sure, but the non-Jewish aspect definitely does not help.  They feel that I have betrayed and abandoned them.  I go home every 3-4 months and call all the time, but its not sufficient for them.

The way they are going about expressing it is not ideal.  Saying I am destroying their lives, subtly blaming me for their health problems (e.g. stress is causing me X problem and Y problem and you being away is crazy stressful, or my mom just flat out saying I am slowly killing my father), sending me pictures of my grandparents to try to guilt me, saying I am betraying and abandoning them, mom having panic attacks, dad saying I wake up 4 times a night thinking about how you are not here and I have nothing to live for, etc.

They have been amazing parents in a lot of ways, always financially supportive and as long as I at least marginally toe the line, supporting in all other ways as well.  And to be fair, my dad does have a lot of health problems that prevent him from traveling and I'm sure this stress is not helping.  And I get that having a kid you love move abroad is very difficult for a loving parent.  But I want to get to a place where they can respect my decision and where we can still have a good relationship, because I do love them.

What do you guys think? Any tips and strategies, or even confirmation I'm not a bad person would be greatly appreciated lol.",26Oct2018,1
242,"**TLDR** bf spent 8 grand on a course which had terrible terrible reviews, is unrealistic and too hard to study alone for someone who didn’t get a proper education and with a full time job. what can i do to help him ? should he pay off the loan then look to college or attempt to do the course. 

Hiya! My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 9 months now and things are cool :) I moved to this city to study at university and he has lived here all of his life. He has a full time job and is still paying off a course he bought which by the end of it will apparently give him the credentials he needs to become an electrician.

He is paying monthly for this course but unfortunately hasn’t really been doing much of the work. This is due to him having a full time job, being a semi carer for his mom and little brother and because he didn’t go to school so in my opinion, he never developed the skills nor experience needed to self learn anything using a textbook. 

Not only is he paying for an 18 month course which usually takes 3 years to complete (one year for each level), it’s extremely bloody hard, I have many GCSES and struggle to understand what a lot of the book says. 

I really wish he never signed up to this as there are very bad reviews for this company ( trade4skills ) which had he done the proper research beforehand he would’ve saved himself 8 grand. 

He beats himself up for not being smart enough or dedicated enough to do his course but actually he just should’ve enrolled in college and attended adult evening classes, which overall would’ve been half the price and have teachers to help him.

What do you suggest I do to help him ? Should i encourage him to continue the course or just to pay off the loan and seek the college route ?

246,"My office recently hired a new assistant and I've been tasked with training her. She sits in the cubicle in front of me, our desks face each other with a half wall between them. 

This girl is kind of a loose cannon. I've found out a lot about her in the last two weeks and all of it concerns me. She got fired from her last job (not quit as she told us at the time of hire) and she deleted almost everything off of their system when she left. She receives angry emails from her previous bosses and coworkers almost daily because of what she did when they fired her. 

She's found one of our associates on a dating app and is messaging him at all hours of the day, emailing him through the work email and then she shows the messages to other staff. This associate has no idea that this is happening as far as I'm aware. We have a strict no office relationships policy. She is aware of this. I have reminded her personally of this at least 3 times in the past 2 weeks. 

She also talks loudly and constantly. It's gotten to the point where people are complaining. This puts me in a difficult situation because I sit across from her and we do talk. I try to keep my voice low and try to shut her down when she starts in on a personal conversation, but she won't take the hint. I do have to converse with her regularly throughout the day as she has work related questions.

This girl is very sensitive and does not handle criticism of any form well. Even if it is something as mundane as ""please make sure you're scanning the documents in straight"". She freaks out. I don't know how to get her to stop talking without being rude or making things incredibly uncomfortable between us.

250,"I previously worked as a defacto campaign manager in a competitive political campaign (""Campaign A"") -   it has received national focus (including being targeted by both national parties), has had national surrogates (sitting Senators) come through for candidates on both sides and is all the talk locally. It will probably decide who controls our state government these next two years.

I was forced off in the late summer by one of the two candidates on the ticket and some people at the state party. Sine I was being paid through some weird independent contractor setup, I wasn't necessarily fired - but had pay noticeably cut (to the point of it being withheld the last month) along with an increase in responsibilities. This was done to replace me with a hire said candidate was close with and ""vibed with better"" (I'm a guy, said candidate is a woman and wanted a woman working for her in my position). 

Although I hated getting ousted, I taught this new hire what she needed to know (which was a lot, she had barely any experience going into this...but that's a story for a different time). I left the campaign after doing so and sought employment elsewhere. While I wasn't generally rooting for the candidate who booted me out or for the new staffer to succeed, I still was a close friend of the other candidate on the ticket ( and of the political party in general. While I'd rather a different race gives them control, I understood the need to elect potentially flawed people personally (and seeing some inexperienced newcomer succeed in what was once my job) if it meant passing good policy.

Recently I was having lunch with aunt and uncle, and they invited one of their close business associates for me to chat with. This turned out to be none other than one of the candidates from the opposing party in said race - ""Campaign B"" (neither aunt nor uncle know of my political work). Candidate informed me that they had evidence proving that the new campaign manager for Campaign A was previously actively involved in a religious club on college campus (said manager is a recent graduate so this isn't dredging up shit from decades ago) that preyed on vulnerable students.

I knew partially of said information from her back when she was initially hired, but she downplayed it as a minor ""follower"" role, never rising up into actual recruitment. Apparently that was a lie, as the candidate for Campaign B mentioned an incriminating video involving my replacement at manager as well as testimonials from two college acquaintances about new manager's role in the club. Candidate announced intention to go public with this, pending them figuring out just how bad this cult was (the answer they'll find: pretty bad).

I am now at a moral dilemma. Part of me wants nothing better than to see the inexperienced newcomer who I got ditched for fail at their job, and by extension, see the candidate and state party staffers who pushed to hire said replacement fail at their jobs. But simultaneously, as someone who earnestly and honestly believes that the candidates my party fields are by and large the better option for my state, I want to see this race (and consequentially, control of state government) go to us.  I'm also rather angry the replacement hid from me the full details of their past in the cult.

I obviously will not be able to stop the opponents from going public with this info - as they should. I'm currently weighing whether or not I should warn the candidate I'm on good terms with that they need to come out in front of this story or stay silent and let them get caught off guard. There is a third option, which is to speed up the release of the info by leaking to an amicable journalist at one of the political investigative papers covering this race.

Boy am I indecisive on this. But that's why I'm here.",26Oct2018,1

I've asked him to quit multiple times and even let him know that it pisses me off and that i dont like it yet it continues.  He will also start working very loudly on something (he's a mechanic)  like using the air hammer or impact as soon as I start talking, I'll look over and he just smiles. He's even started blasting music he knows for a fact that I hate.

The past few months culminated into today. He started in on me with the ""hey"" crap the second he walked in the door. I lost it on him and just yelled at him. I than went to my boss and told him about it, my boss talked with him and he didn't say another word all night however now his friends are doing it and one guy literally did it until I looked up and told him to shut up.

I asked his buddy if hes going to start doing it now and his response was ""Yeah, probably"". I left it at that. The final issue of the night was when I got back to my desk there was a hand written note that said ""hey"" with a smiley face.

This may not seem like a big deal but pestering usually happens at least every hour and has become such a huge annoyance that I cant perform my job well when it happens.  And now that his friends are doing it I dont know what to do, especially since one of them is the son of a guy that has worked there for 20+ years and could make my life very difficult if I went to hr.

I became more social, much more confident as a person, but as of the last 2 years its has take a turn for the worse. I feel like i don't care about the future at all, and i will make choices that will fuck me up in the long run, just cause i can't be bothered RIGHT NOW. I know it will fuck me up but yet i don't act on it. Like studying for an up coming exam, i can't for the life of me, even if i try my hardest get my self to do it. Its not the only thing i can't get my self to do. Applying for jobs when i lived at home was another thing. I really want to, but for some reason i can't make my self do it. I don't know how to explain it. Every cell in my body wants to do it, but something (blamed lazyness at first) just prevents me. I will sit down on my pc, look at job postings (not even apply) and call it a day... 

I know everything i do do now or didn't do will have consequences, but still i can't do it. wtf is wrong with me. 

I have for a while (last 4 years) suspected i might be depressed and that i needed to see a doctor, but again... i can't get my self to fucking do it. I have never been suicidal, and i am not yet (i think).
for as long as i can remember i have joked about dying. like shoot me please or fuck my life. its always been a joke, but recently i am not sure. Every time those words leave my mouth i have second thoughts whether i meant it or not.

But for some reason i feel like i am not far away from having those thoughts. i feel like i am headed down a very dark spiral i just can't get out of and i am too proud to admit it to anybody in real life. 

nothing gets me emotional anymore. and i haven't left my house in 5 days... fuck... 

i have messaged my doctor, who doesn't have time until the 4th dec. Which is a little long away and i feel like this is gonna get much worse soon. 

I having a really fucking hard time admitting this to anybody. I am the eldest of my siblings, i am a big athletic dude, super healthy looking. and i feel like my ego is the only thing that hasn't changed with all of this. i can't ask anybody for help, or rather i don't want to.

254,"I have an honors bachelors degree in English so I would just need a minimum TEFL course (which is two days) and depending on where I want to work a years experience which I could get over there.  The only thing stopping me right now is that the contracts for most of them are two to three years minimum. My sister has lived there for a number of years and loves the atmosphere and promised me a place to stay until I get sorted. She also offered to pay for my plane tickets because I haven't visited her yet since 14 hours on a plane in the space of a week was always quite daunting. 

I wanted to get my masters in Psychology but it's about 15,000 without any extra help.  I was thinking that I could work part time for a few months and see how I feel about it in the new year.  I would also prefer to do the 300 hour TEFL course because it looks like it would be more competitive.  I have always wanted a job that worked with either children or young adults because they respond best to me.  

There is still a few things I need to do in Ireland that would also be a big help before leaving, drivers license, saving up for the months over there so I can secure a place as soon as possible and I want to work more on myself and make a few more connections over here first. I have never moved away from home but the fact that I would be staying with my sister and her roommate would help the transition greatly and she would really like the company.  They both work for emirates so they would be gone a lot of the time but could still show me around the city when they come back.  The apartment looks amazing and my sister has a few friends in the area that could take me out and show me around when shes not there.  I was never one for going out and meeting new people but I've got a lot better at it recently and enjoy the new interactions.  My sister thinks that I have matured greatly recently and is so proud that I have got my degree and wants me to go for the opportunity.

My moms a bit worried about me moving far away (youngest of eight) but she's on board as long as she knows my sister and her friends will be there for the transition.  It's a great opportunity and the job would be tax free which is extremely motivating.  I guess i'm just asking is there anything you wish you would have thought about or done before moving country?

However, I had several friends, not bullied, and always had straight As. But I had to replace my highschool diploma with a GED because I have been almost kicked out or forced to drop out of school three times last few years.

As some of you may know, Korea has one of the harshest educational system..and parents and students stress over it very much.

I have already passed the first step where they pick out 3 times the final number of students they are going to admit. 

(if the school admits 50ppl, they have 150 ppl come over for an interview)

There are three questions in the interview. One is given the questions for 20 minutes for preparation, and gets 10 minutes to present it in front of the professors. 

Number 1 and 2 being a 'Academic Question' where one reads a provided passage and answers 2\~3 questions for each passage. (Have to answer it in Korea)

Number 3 is a 'Personal Question' where they ask you personal things like What do you think of this statement by Jean-Paul Sartre... or such. (don't really think that's personal but that's what the school calls it). And I have to answer this in English.

Since English is my first language, Number 3 isn't a hard question as I can just talk to the professors, but Number 1 and 2 is stressing me out since even though I can speak Korean, I am just not familiar enough with it to cover some academic or philosophical topics..

First of all, i had a picture of user ""rosemarys\_dead"" downloaded from ""ask.fm"" on my device.

I did a reverese search on this picture on google and the sources of this picture and as well visually related images were shown.   
 

One of the related pictures was this

A typical Emo girl with stripped shirt, skinny jeans, black eyeliner, lip piercing and the special hairstyle. This is a the common and original style of Emo girls. This picture had my attention. I chose to find out who is the girl in this picture and find her on social media. So i have reverse searched it on google images to find its sources. This picture was reposted on several websites labeled as ""Emo girl"". I wanted to find the oldest source and actually where it started. The oldest version of this picture found by google was used as a profile picture by user named ""dashpunk81"" on ""flodeo.com"". Flodeo was a spanish language photo sharing website that was active since 2007 to 2015. It was since removed from the internet but some of the logs are being kept on Google. Besides this user, 5 other users on this website had used this picture on their profile but the one used by ""dashpunk81"" dated back to february 2008 and the others were uploaded later.   
 

r/http://imgur.com/tWP4AgU  
 

Anyway there is no way to pay a visit to ""flodeo.com"" as it's unavailable. So i decided to use ""archive.org"" in order to find saved screenshots of this website from 2008. There was just 1 screenshot taken exatly from ""www.flodeo.com/dashpunk81"" from late 2007 without any picture. A few comments can be viewed on that page. Including a comment from another user who used this picture for her profile named ""pathetiicaprincesita""  
 

r/http://imgur.com/vKiYjLX  
 

I've searched for username ""dashpunk"" and ""dashpunk81"" so maybe i can find something but nothing was found. I aslo searched for ""pathetiicaprincesita"" and surprisingly there was a account with exact same username on youtube. Judging by the activity of this account it was also used in 2008. I tried to connect with her hoping to get information about the picture. No contact details on her profile. I found afew people who wrote comments on her discussion page. I checked their profile and found contact details of their facebook and email. I connected with one of them who seems to have been active recently and messaged him. Still no answer.

Story is flatmate who is a good friend of mine really struggles at social interaction. This is definitely noted when we have a few drinks (alcohol) with friends. I'm not saying hes awkward, it's almost the opposite. Hes quite out going, joins in all sorts of group chat but he ends up  taking jokes/discussions too far. Hes repeatedly left groups of people scratching their heads trying to understand if he is serious or not. You have no idea of how to interpret his moods. My friend and I confronted him tonight when he took a joke/discussion too far. We literally asked calmly what he meant and if he was angry (majority of his jokes are about myself or friends kind of thing). He sat in silence while we asked the same question a couple of times. He almost acted like a child.. huffing and puffing, rolling his eyes, putting his hands on his head. Then once my friend left pretty much told me we attacked him and that he had told us all his reasons for how he conducts himself (yet he really just sat in silence kind of tossing around being angry) this guy is a high ranking military man. When at work he is extremely professional. I feel like I dont know how to interpret his actions and when I try speak to him he acts like a child.

268,"Hello! So like I have an issue here I’m trying to resolve:

**Tl;dr** I’m a biology graduate student thinking about pursuing music instead due to my gut instinct, professors and friends trying to convince me, and my overall general unhappiness with my graduate program.

1. I am 22 years old and currently a graduate student studying biology. This is my first semester in grad school and even for the last two years in undergrad I’ve been questioning if this is the right path for me. I’m just not enthusiastic about it and I find myself really stressed and negative and incredibly unhappy most of the time. My gut is telling me to follow my other passion, which is music, but I don’t know what to do. For me, music isn’t just a hobby; it’s something I’ve been doing basically my whole life. I’ve sang in choirs since I was 8, played clarinet since I was 9, and have always found myself working hard to be the best musician I can. In undergrad, I was a member of 4 choirs, my university wind ensemble, and held music leadership positions. I’ve tried telling myself I’m not good enough to pursue this field but it’s gotten to the point where my professors and friends have pulled me aside and questioned why I’m not fully pursuing music. I agree with them and I don’t know what to do.  I was considering talking to my current choir director about obtaining a voice performance certificate or even a degree.",26Oct2018,1

270,"Can you REALLY love somebody in a non romantic way? There are always people I fall for romantically and sexually, but sometimes there are people I feel like I love, but in a totally different way.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, it's more than considering it a friendship. Sometimes I ""obsess"" over people, but not in a creepy stalker way. I don't stalk their social media and I don't build altars for them in my bedroom haha. I have normal friends and pals too, whom I act and feel normal towards. But:

&amp;#x200B;

I would find myself going out of my way to spend all my time with them and sometimes I would feel like I want to be all they have and they should be all I have. It's a bit egoistic, I suppose. I want to help them and make their lives easier and more enjoyable. I truly care for them, and would be willing to do almost anything for them. When I'm not around them I think about them all the time. I'm honestly starting to believe this is unhealthy. The point is though, I feel no romantic or sexual attraction towards them. I really can't explain what I feel, because I have no clue either, that's why I'm writing this here.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all this, I'm not a clingy person myself and I act normally around them, but the feelings are still there.

Does anyone either feel the same, or know why I feel this way towards some people?",26Oct2018,1

(We have a Seizure Alert Dog.)

I want him GONE. 

so any ideas on how to gt him to stop coming over? I'm open to anything! except murder. no murder.

I was going to ask her on a date by the end of the week but now my friend has made out with her and they are even closer so I feel like my chances are basically fucking ruined.
I don’t know if I should still try and get her, if I should just give up or If i should wait a bit of time to try and make a move

Over the past couple of months my best mate if 16 years has begun experimenting with drugs. We are both 17 years old male. He started off with weed but is now experimenting with MD (pills and shit). It really pains me to see him doing this to him self but he wont stop, and I'm worried he's gonna keep trying harder and harder stuff.

Realisticly I have a couple of options here:
Cut ties with him completely.
Only hangout with him when he is not off his face.
Try and help him.
Pretend nothing is wrong.

278,"First of all I'm sorry if the formatting is bad, I'm on mobile. Secondly, I'm sorry if this is quite long.

My mum is a SAHM and is at home with the pets (a dog and a cat) most of the day. The dog was never properly potty trained, but he usually goes outside. However recently the wooden floor at the back door has started to rot as he has begun peeing there.

I've noticed that this doesn't seem to be because he doesnt want to go outside. He does bark and whine at the door and we will open it to let him out. However, what bothers me is that my mum will sit at the table (which is very close to the back door) and finish her food or keep on looking at the Internet for about five more minutes before deciding to let him out. If I am not around to let him out before then, he ends up not being able to hold it in (or gets tired of waiting?) and pees at the door. I then have to clean it up.

I'm getting quite worried, not only for the unhealthiness of the floor, but for my dog. Surely being forced to hold in his pee until he has to let go is really bad for him. And yet my mother doesn't seem to care and it makes me really upset.

What do I do? I can't always be around to let him outside. And at the same time my mum is extremely touchy and I will be shouted at if I accuse her of not looking after the dog. He's a good boy, and I'm worrying that he's just not being looked after properly and deserves better.",26Oct2018,1

Last December we had a rough patch. He became very withdrawn and blamed it on his new job, as he had to do a lot of extra hours and was exhausted and stressed. We're obviously now in a great place in our relationship and very happy and in love.

Today he left his computer unlocked. I know it's wrong but I couldn't help but snoop... and I feel awful about it but I wanted to know what was really happening last year.

I found a conversation with a girl he was working with. It contained plans to meet up, lots of sexting,  him telling her that he was going to/had broken up with me, saying he wants to be with her etc etc.

Obviously I can't tell him I was snooping, and I really don't want anything to go wrong between us as we're so happy now. But I feel so betrayed, and so heartbroken after seeing him talk to her in the same way that he used to talk to me.

How can I get past this? I know they no longer talk or work together and haven't spoken like this since January, it just stopped. By the sound of the messages, they kissed once at a work party but never did anything else or met up alone.

283,"Hey 👐🏼 so like in recent times I’ve noticed that a lot of my “friends” are taking advantage of me in some way, usually emotionally. Ever since I’ve known them I’ve seen that my anxiety is increasing, my depression is returning, and I’m limiting myself from my full potential.  I don’t know if I should just blatantly remove them from my life or not and if so, how?

Here’s a little synopsis of the main friendships I’m reconsidering:

**Friend 1 (Let’s call him John):** Been friends for 4 years since freshman year of college. I had a bad gut feeling when I first met him and I have tried to steer away from him. We lived together for senior year. He is extremely harsh with jokes and makes me feel insecure about myself and all of my decisions. He’s also slightly misogynistic, homophobic, and racist with his “jokes” and I call him out every time but he doesn’t get it and I don’t mess with that. We also have absolutely nothing in common.

**Friend 2 (Don, I guess):** I’m his emotional punching bag. Serious drinking issues, to the point where he would drink a bottle of liquor every day alone and cry about either personal scenarios or his own personality. He also had feelings for me but I didn’t want/can’t handle a relationship. I’ve tried helping him but I just couldn’t do enough so I referred him to a professional. We stopped talking for about a month because he wanted to get better and not use me as an emotional punching bag. During that month I realized that his thinking habits rubbed off on me and I’m starting to think and act the same way and I’ve noticed I have pretty bad anxiety, maybe even depression. After the month long hiatus, we talk again but he solely talks about himself and doesn’t ask about how my life is going or anything.

All in all, I’m not happy right now. These are people who I talk to every day but they always leave me feeling terribly about myself somehow and I try hard to be a good friend to them but it’s not really reciprocated. They just aren’t who I am and this bump in the road is holding me back from truly being myself.

If anyone has advice I’d greatly appreciate it 🙏🏼",26Oct2018,1

287,"I’m a young kid (early 20s) and ha[d] a part time job at this company for nearly 2 years now. So recently, a temporary full time position was offered to me after the company received no applicants for it (person was planning to return in 4-5 months). Now, I had knowledge about another full time employee who was planning on resigning.

Now, since this is a unionized workplace, I knew that when they resigned, I may not have the highest seniority to “win” the full time position. So, when this temporary position was offered (this was like, 3 weeks ago), I took it because of a loophole where full time workers are chosen for the position ahead of any part time ones.

Now, should I get this permanent position, how do I deal with this guilt of throwing others under the bus? I already have to deal with leaving the first department to take this temp position, and now not even a month in, I screw them over too by potentially leaving to a third department. 

I personally just feel like a scumbag for doing this, and I guess just needed somewhere to vent to people I don’t know.

293,"I'm so sorry, this is very long because there's a lot of factors. There is a tl;dr at the bottom.

So I've been with my SO for around 6 months (me 26F him 23M) , I get it, it's not a huge amount of time, but I truly love him and believe he loves me.
He spends pretty much all his time with me, he loves me unconditionally. I'm going through a pretty savage bout of depression at the moment and he is looking after me and takes me completely as I am, even when I'm a sobbing wreck. He is kind to me, is always helping around the house and has the best sense of humour - we think very alike and I believe we are meant to be together. He has expressed on multiple occasions desire to get married and have kids with me, and I want the same (we haven't wanted this before). Again, I get it's early days but we truly are in love. 

The issue is that there's one place that he isn't very considerate - the bedroom. We have sex on average about 11 or 12 times a week, sometimes more as we can rack up 3 times a day. I always instigate it and he is reluctant or maybe hesitant to insitgate it? He is quite dominant, which I enjoy (and he always stops/releases when I show any discomfort and alternates with kisses etc) but I've only ever orgasmed about 4 times, twice brought on by myself. When we have sex, it's basically a case of me on top most of the time doing the work, after giving him oral sex, then after he has orgasms, him rolling over and going to sleep and me lying there feeling dissatisfied and a bit un-tended to. 
He doesn't seem keen on giving oral sex, although I regularly give it to him. He only really likes to perform oral sex on me in the 69 position (I.e. when he is also getting stimulated) and doesn't seem to like doing it solely for my pleasure (I enjoy giving him oral sex often as I enjoy giving him the pleasure of that). When he does do it, it feels rushed and 'Going through the motions'.

Now, I'm not sure if it's perhaps a little bit of inexperience on his part - he had a 3 year relationship when he was 15-18 years old and then was single until we got together (he is 23, I am 26). I'm pretty sure he had multiple one night stands and regular hook ups, especially when drunk, but althought thats fine, it's not the same experience as a loving relationship where you can explore each other and get to know each other's needs. But I don't want to ask him too much and make him feel like he's not capable and I don't want to belittle him. 

I tried broaching the subject the other day. I told him in a nice way that I would like to orgasm more often, as he always does, and explained how he can help me to do that (need clitoral stimulation). I stated that I feel he may be bored when giving me oral sex, and he denied this profusely and got upset, saying that it was my fault if I wasn't enjoying it. (I have enjoyed it very much in the past but can't enjoy it when I feel he is bored). 

Since the chat, however, nothing has changed. E.g. today we had sex, he went straight in with no foreplay, tried to perform anal sex a few times but I definitely wasn't feeling it, then asked me to give him oral sex which I did, then asked me to get on top which I did until he orgamsed and then he promptly fell asleep. So it doesn't seem that he has taken in my thoughts. 

Most importantly- and what I really need advice on, is that I discovered that he had made a payment (£5) to a website which offers prostitution, web cam, phone sex and other stuff. (I believe you have to have a membership to pay). I believe he has been possibly webcamming with someone or paying someone over web cam (as I don't think that for £5 it would be anything significantly worse than that). 

Looking at the date this transaction was made, it was just a couple of days after i discovered that he had used an app used for classifieds (things for sale) to look up women looking for men in the area (there is a personals section of the app). 
He apologised profusely, assured me he had just stumbled across this section and was probably just horny and looking for masturbation material. He didn't seem to have an account on the app so wouldn't have been able to message these women, so i forgave (but having been hurt before, I don't forget)

I can't help thinking though - why would you pay £5 for something or search on an app for something when there's free porn all over the internet. I mean, it's hard NOT to find porn! 
I don't watch it even though I'm dissatisfied at the moment  though, because I want to be faithful to him in every way. 

I pretty much left my ex to be with  this guy, and although never get back together with my ex, it's upsetting because he would have never done those things, and was very considerate to my needs in bed...

What do you think he is up to on that website? 
Should I confront him?
How can I once again make my needs known and why hasn't he taken note from the first convo? 

**TL;DR** - I have a nice boyfriend whom i love, but caught him paying on a prostitution/cam website, looking at dating section of an app for women nearby and he's inconsiderate in bed",26Oct2018,1

I'm trying to come up with a way to work with a friend who routinely runs 45 mins late or more. It was annoying when I was younger but it's genuinely troubling now that I've started a medical program and don't have much free time.

I'm hardly a paradigm of punctuality but I strive hard and get to places on time 90% of the time. My friend isn't malicious but she bites off more than she can chew (one extra email, one extra meeting), and that adds up.

I don't mind much during the day since I can bust out the computer and study a cafe, but when we're meeting somewhere nice for dinner and I'm chilling for an hour, I'm not happy.

My compromise would be that we only meet during the day, but I know she likes going out to dinner. What can I do at night so that I don't feel frustrated at her lateness (which isn't going to change)?

If someone tries to contact me during this time, it won't get noticed. On top of this i usually go to bed at around 11pm, so if someone has called me it'll usually be too late to call them back so i'll leave it until the morning (unless it sounds like an emergency). If someone has sent me a text i'll quickly respond after 10pm. The people usually contacting me are girlfriend, friends or family.

She tried to call me several times to ask for help, but my phone was in the other room, so i didn't find out until 10pm. She's okay now but i do feel bad for not being there for her when she needed help. Part of me just wants to say it's unfortunate timing, but part of me wonders if i'm being selfish for just cutting off the world like this. I also tend to feel bad if she or someone else calls me during this time and i don't see the missed call until several hours later. I suppose i also worry that one day there could be a big emergency and i don't find out for several hours, by which time it's too late.

I could just be obsessing over something small here but with everyone owning a mobile phone nowadays i'm no longer sure what's considered socially acceptable when it comes to ignoring my calls for long stretches of time. Any advice would be appreciated.

So I have a bit of an odd situation I’m dealing with. My wife (37F) and I(36M) have a mutual college friend (35M) who’s parents have recently passed away (both were sick). We are all originally from San Francisco, but after college my friend and his wife moved to New York. 

My friend and I were talking in September and he asked if my wife and I could help him out. He offered to let us live rent free in his parent’s house until August 2019, when it’s hopefully cleared probate and he can sell it. All we have to do is pay utilities and bills, and just generally upkeep the property. 

This is very mutually beneficial situation: we get to live rent free for about 9 months in San Francisco, and he has someone he knows to live in and watch/upkeep/prevent squatters in the house while it’s in probate and he’s in New York. My wife and I obviously accepted immediately.

Here’s the problem: now we’re moving in and it’s really uncomfortable and creepy. Nothing has been touched since his mom passed. They both opted for at home hospice and passed away in what we want to make our living room. We’re moving into their master bedroom. It’s an old house and makes a lot of noise at night. It’s just been hard adjusting. 

I talked to my friend and he told us that we can do any rearranging/small projects that would make our stay more comfortable. We’re just not sure what to do. On one hand we know it’s ridiculous to pass this up, and we don’t want to let a friend down, but my wife and I are worried about the stress this might cause in the coming months (and worried that if the unsettled feeling doesn’t get better it may affect our relationship). Also my friend is really counting on us and we agreed to help, so backing out and finding another place feels shitty.

Does anyone have any ideas of what to do? Are we being ridiculous, or is there something we can do to make this less weird? Thanks!

306,"(sorry for the long post)

Hey guys, so my withdraw deadline for courses is tomorrow at my college (Langara). This is my first year, first term and I'm really struggling with calculus I. My quizzes are worth 8% of the course and I've done 3/5 of them so far, getting 75%, 33% and TBD (just took it on Wednesday but I know it's going to be shit like the second or worse). I got 57.5% on my first midterm which is worth 20%, and so I have a 25% midterm and 40% final left. 

Oh yes, we also get assigned homework which is worth 7% of the course and I am getting 100% on that.

I have test anxiety that acts up pretty badly during assessments so no matter how hard I study and practice questions (doing all the homework and some textbook questions for hours), my heart pounds and mind goes blank when the time actually arrives. Even if I initially understand concepts and how to apply them, throughout the quiz/test I start to doubt myself and don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

I've always struggled with this on a small scale but it wasn't a huge issue in high school because they gave us enough time to do it and look over it, which gave me some time to cool down. (Thus I've never struggled with math that much, grades are always in the 90%-95% range) I've also always been a relatively slow test taker (usually the very last person, or the last few) so the short times for the quizzes really stress me out mentally.

This course is a prerequisite for the paleontology specialization (competitive, 2.3 gpa to be considered) bachelors science program I want to pursue in U of Alberta, and looking through the future courses I would take if/when I get into the program, there doesn't seem to be another calculus course. (Statistics are heavily used anyway, I honestly wish that was the prereq instead of calculus, though idk how hard stats is since I haven't taken it)

I am determined to work harder (got some advice from my prof) if I go on with this course, but after going to the counselor yesterday she recommended me to withdraw (I didn't tell her my grades specifically, just said that I'm close to failing, and my anxiety issues) since the deadline hasn't passed, and I don't know if anything would improve if I work harder anyway due to my anxiety and my studying not seeming to help.

I was initially on board with withdrawing and taking it again next term, but after a night of thinking I'm on the fence again. Do you guys think I could salvage this course and maybe get a C- or C, or should I just withdraw and not risk it? I don't know how badly a C- or C would impact my gpa compared to an F and retake, and I honestly don't want to retake this course because I probably won't use this stuff as much in my program again, and also because I don't want to deal with it, but then idk if my program will accept me then.

I'm currently taking 2 other courses, bio and chem, and are doing okay in those (actually stoked that I got 96% on my first Chem midterm). I guess courses with memorization or set facts are easier for me than churning my brain on a time limit.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

307,"Whenever one of my friends comes to me with a problem or when theyre feeling down, I always help them. But that then (with some of my friends, not all of them) leads to a vicious cycle where I get used as a personal therapist, and used for nothing other than fhat service. Its extremely taxing on me, and while those friends would probably be there for me when I'm down, I feel like theyd just make it about themselves and then into a pity party, but most the time I'm unhappy because of them and how they dump their negative emotions onto me.
I've tried setting boundaries, I've cut off friends in the past over this, I've tried simply not giving advice and letting them get it out of their system, but no matter what I do there's always a new person to come along and treat me the exact same way. There are at least 6 friends i can think of off the top of my head that have treated me like a soggy cry pillow in the past, so I think the only thing keeping this pattern alive must be me.
Some things about these friendships: they begin as good healthy friendships with give and take, then as soon as i give advice 1 time, it suddenly turns into the person only talking to me for advice, nothing else (i also have friendships that do not end up this way so i'm able to compare the healthy behavior to the unhealthy behavior). It makes me feel like a disposable psuedo therapist that they dont really care about enough to be a real friend to. How to I break this cycle? These people also usually have mental health issues that need professional help, but I live in a very poor community so no one can afford therapy. Ive suggested healthier ways for people to process their emotions rather than dumping it on me but so far no one actually takes my advice they just shit on my day then leave. The worst part is that in the past when i tried setting those boundaries one boy attempted suicide because of it, so i am terrified that that will happen again. I dont want peoppe to depend on me but they make me feel guilty whenever i dont dedicate my time to helping them.

I got a job and went on my first date and everything seems to be trending positively but I feel empty and confused. 
My entire life up to recent years I've been addicted to video games and other media forms, which have made me extremely oblivious to my social life and real life passions. I did well in school which has put me into a position to be pretty successful and land a good job. But university has made me aware of my own flaws. I dressed poorly, had no self awareness of my own appearance and never discovered my true passions. I blame this on my own ignorance and video games feeding into that ignorance. Slowly over the last year, I've stopped playing games completely and now there's this empty void in my life that I can't seem to satisfy no matter what I do.
I feel lost about every aspect of my life now. What are my passions? What should I do with my free time? How do I meet new people with shared passions? etc. I have a decent amount of friends but not any that I can hang out with immediately and I just feel empty, purposeless. I want to wake up every morning and have a plan and a goal I can pursue but there's nothing. I just wake up and distract myself and avoid the glaring problem that faces my life.

Next day i get exam papers, only one that gets a full mark in year 10, i try improving my notebook, i do the missing lesson, but nothing fucking changes.

I have this coworker who is a very nice and sweet lady, we'll call her Victoria.
So Victoria lost custody of her daughter two years ago. Her daughter was supposed to move in with her father but since he allegedly sexually abused her, Victoria took her daughter and moved to a north african country, which happens to be my home country and where my parents live. 
Victoria was brought back to europe by the authorities (i don't know why they brought her and not her daughter, and they also confiscated her passport) and got separated from her daughter, who now lives with a friend and his family. She is forbidden from any form of contact with her daughter so i feel like there's more to the story that i don't know.
Anyway, i am going to visit my parents in two weeks and Victoria asked me to take a suitcase with a few things for her daughter, then her friend would meet me at my home town to get it.
I do want to help her because i can see that she suffers a lot from being separated from her daughter, but the one thing i was always told is to never ever take something that's not mine to an airport. I really feel sorry for her and kinda feel like i would be the a**hole if i refused.
I really have a bad feeling about this especially that i don't know all the details to why she can't communicate with her daughter and why her passport was removed.

320,"Basically, we have a very old machine that's been consigned to us by one of our clients and started malfunctioning. The client wants video proof of the malfunction.

Now, I'm fairly new to the job and when I attempted to set it up for a video capture, I made a mistake and broke a part of it. And the machine is old enough that we have no spare parts to attempt a replacement of this one even though there's plenty of spare parts for more modern machines. Attempting to repair the part didn't help.

Naturally I got a tongue lashing from my boss which I was fully prepared for. What I wasn't prepared for was him asking me to proofread the incident report that blames the machine's age and other outside factors instead of admitting that his subordinate made a mistake and broke it.

I was shocked enough that I just proofread it without really thinking. And I'm even seeing a bunch of people, some outside our department including the guy who witnessed my mistake firsthand being in on the the cover up.

Part of me is grateful for my boss covering for me but a bigger part of me is also frightened about this whole affair. It makes me wonder: if this kind of behaviour is encouraged by the company culture, what other defects are being covered up? How many of our customers have been lied to? What if I'm in a company with a culture that basically discourages employees from owning up to their mistake due to fear? 

Part of me wants to speak up about this incident (the lying bit) but I have no hard evidence. There's no CCTV camera in the room and the way the part broke could reasonably be attributed to old age. If I tried, it's my word against theirs.

Ultimately, I am wondering what I could do to change this kind of culture. Certainly I can't do it alone and even though I'm technically a nepotism hire by my cousin, we're not particularly close and outside of getting my resume to HR, I never leaned on him for anything in the company and still had to go through the rest of HR's vetting process and got placed in the bottom rung.

321,"Bit of backstory: So im in 8th grade, and my new class is great. Last year was a terrible year for me but this class really feels like home. 
I began to see how more and more people started to notice how last schoolyear was a mentally terrible one for me (left with clinical depression and severe (social) anxiety).
And everyone had extreme respect for that and told me that they’d help in any way they can which is just....i think they’re the best.

Now lets start with the subject, theres a girl in my class thats very nice and wouldnt hurt a fly. Didnt even consider talking to her since im really shy and rumors spread like wildfire when you talk to someone of the opposite gender in 8th grade. But we were in a group project together, since her mom was diagnosed with cancer a bit before the project started i said i’d take her work load and do all of it so she can have a bit more room in her life.  (One of my friends recently lost his dad to the terrible illness and i wont allow someone to be even more stressed out and sad if i can help it.)
And she started talking to me more and more after that. She asked me normal questions : how have you been? And more emotional questions like: if you want to talk to me, i’ll be there. 

She also sits next to me frequently when she gets the chance and noticed how she looks at me from time to time when sitting in class. I only came to the realization 2 days ago that she may have a crush on me. And it really made me warm inside. 

I doubt asking her would be effective for me, again i have severe social anxiety and that combined with rumors about me and her wouldnt go well together. 

What are signs that a girl likes you? And in this case does she like me?

323,"Hey so I’ll cut to the point and any specific question I’ll answer later. We’re a family of 5, brother (24), sister (15) mom(48) , me(17) and my dad (65)who has dementia and hasn’t been himself in over 4 years, he is disconnected from reality and is almost always aggressive with others. Anyways this has obviously forced my family to become more united but at the same time some problems have arose that are tearing us apart. I get along pretty well with everyone but sadly my brother and sister have a lot of problems and it seems they are always angry at each other. One of the biggest reasons is that because my brother feels the responsibility to be a father now, he is worried about my sister going out to parties. He has every right to be since we are from a country where drinking is extremely common and nowadays there’s people who start drinking at 14, I’ve even seen 13 year olds at parties in which most of the people invited are 16-18. So I do understand why my brother is worried even if he is kind of exaggerated, he is always saying that he never went out when he was younger (which is not entirely true, when he was my age he went out a lot) and that’s the reason he doesn’t want me or my sister going out to parties and the such all the time. My sister is a great person, but she has an explosive personality and can sometimes be too aggressive. I’m all for her going out and living her life, she deserves it, but lately she’s been way too aggressive and obsessed with parties. Maybe it’s because she sees me going out all the time, which is different since I’m a 12th grade senior and she is in 9th grade, I do have the right to go out more than her since I’m more mature but she feels that she should go out as much as I do. Maybe it’s because she looks older than she is so maybe she is obsessed with the idea of growing up now but still I’m worried she’ll turn into an awful person. I know many people who are obsessed with only going out and most of them tend to be shallow and have no personality at all and I don’t want my sister to be that way, I don’t want her to drink until she doesn’t remember each time she goes out and I want her to realize that life is much more than partying. Thankfully my sister isn’t an alcoholic like many other people her age and my age are, but I’m worried she’ll become that way. She gets angry when things don’t go her way and her attitude becomes annoying as hell when they don’t let her go out Saturday and Friday or when she isn’t allowed to go out one week and the next one and the one after that etc. I’m all for her going to parties but I didn’t even get to go out as much as her when I was in 11th grade let alone 9th. Nowadays I do go out a lot but it’s because both my mom and brother agree that I should be free to do what I want and enjoy my last year here in this country, my sister she believes the same thing  but she is way too young to be going to parties all the time especially parties with people that are older than her. I really want to protect my sister and make sure she grows up to be a good person, someone who isn’t shallow and who doesn’t just focus on things that are skin deep.

The guy clearly said he knows I Always I stare at him but he almost Always stares at me back or stares when I am not watching. His friend too smirks at me or looks at me like he knows something.

He commented about a girl 'having a nice body' and he said 'If I was a girl I would -' (I didn't hear the Whole thing), also something about being fuckable and passable physically.

He Always seems to be around and he tries to be virile, makes stupid comments out loud etc, when I sat in the front row with him, his friend and other people he started acting dumb as fuck, making lewd comments , loud noises and we made eye contact more than once. He asked me to call him by his name instead of his last name like everyone does etc, during art class the teacher said something like 'I understand we are talking about a romantic painting of a kiss but we are calm down right now' directly at him and some girl said he was getting too excited as joke. Idk why he said that because I wasn't really looking at him in that moment.

In the next hour of class, I moved seat because I had to take a test I missed and when he saw me moving he had a disappointed look and said whatever, then I randomly caught him and his friend staring at me with a smirk on their face and we all laughed at that point. The teacher asked why and one girl said she couldn't say it out loud but 'the Whole class knows'

A few days ago I said hi to him and his friend but they ignored me (on purpose, they both saw me) and after a while I caught him staring at me in class wide eyed, so I looked at him like wtf. Then I was right behind and when I glanced at him briefly he gave me the same look.

Sometimes he seems serious but sometimes he makes me think he is an immature idiot. 

I feel tempted to ignore him now because I made too obvious I like him and I suspect he might just like me physically but nothing more since we barely talk, but he is generally the one who starts convos (about school stuff, like with other girls).

They might just laugh because he is flirting back but nothing more...idk what should I do?

327,"I should preface this by saying that the whole situation isn't anybody's fault and certainly not a super serious problem but it's still something I'd hear advice on.

  
Our son is 21 now and goes to college in a bigger city ca. 50 miles away, and he's been visiting us quite frequently at the weekends. That's something that comes in naturally as we've always had a great relationship. To be fully honest, to some degree we at least implicitly expect him to not, well, 'exclude' us from his life and only mind his own business, as I pay for literally everything in his life, from apartment, to car, to university costs etc. So at very least I want to have conversations from time to time, know if everything is fine, if college is going alright and so on. He's with his girlfriend for 1.5 years now, and since then he's bringing her with him every time he visits us. I didn't mind it at all for some time but slowly it's creating a somewhat uneasy scenario, there are multiple aspects to it.  
First there is the personality of my wife. That's neither my son's nor his gf's fault but she's a bit of a perfectionist and whenever we're expecting a 'guest', everything must be in perfect order. That's nothing that's going to change at this point, it's just her.  
So when I get home on a Friday after a long week of hard work and throw my backpack on the floor I immediately hear a nervous Nooo, don't create a mess Tom, you know that our son and his gf arrive later today!!!! Then she's constantly running around, cleaning everything for the 10th time, tells me to not wear those old trousers, and it's just very annoying for me, I was looking forward to a relaxed weekend with my family not perma-stress again.   
When our son and his girl are here, we don't really see him a lot. They spend most of the 2-3 days in his room and only seem to leave it together for short periods of time. Even though they're dating for almost 2 years now, she's barely leaving his side, literally. Even if I say I want to speak to him for a moment. I can't remember when I talked to my son for the last time without her sitting next to him and giving her own opinions on whatever he or I brought up. My son, I guess somewhat naturally, is obviously more concerned with her and what she has to say than with us.  
We mostly like her, we're happy that he's happy, but we and his gf also don't have the greatest chemistry ever. We're typical Germans I guess, one might say a tiny bit reserved and rather silent, she's extremely outgoing, instantly ""joins"" every conversations she overhears etc. Last week I was talking to my wife about buying a new car, suddenly she gave her input on what type of car we should get... 

  
I just feel like I haven't had a real conversation with my son in ages while caring about him, and also paying everything for him, instead I have my wife stressed out at the weekend and being told what car to get from my son's girlfriend who studies communication and knows nothing about cars. Now, this week I and my wife feel sickly anyway and we also have something to talk regarding his car insurance (which I pay), and his brother is here, which only happens 1-2 times a year (he lives in Germany). So I very carefully suggested to him if we can't see him alone for one weekend. He didn't want to hear about that AT ALL and basically implied he's coming together with his gf or he's not coming at all.  


It's a weird situation, not truly serious enough for me to 'threaten' any measurements but also annoying enough to not trying to resolve it at all. I simply don't know what to say or do though.

She said they had extended a few offers to people but would have an internal talk to see if it was an option to bring me back. Ten minutes later she got back to me and said “let’s chat over the weekend”.

330,"**Background About Me:** Divorced after ten years of marriage in 2014 no kids and I’ve been with my current boyfriend for three years. He has a 7 year old daughter that lives with us half the time. It’s a complicated relationship, but not one that will be ending anytime in the near future. I’m not trying to be self deprecating at all, but I know what I look like. I’m not really very attractive. Easily 80 pounds overweight, never wear make up at work, loud, a little weird.

**The Situation:** I (33F) set my coworker (36M) up with a friend of mine about a year ago because he’s a nice guy and I thought they might hit it off. They didn’t after just one date because they are just at different places in life, but the coworker and I became pretty friendly after that. Totally normal, basic coworker chat, about family, pets, plans, whatever. He’s asked me how to respond to texts from women from time to time... usually when they are friend zoning him. It’s always been totally platonic.

He gave me his number awhile ago and we casually talked about getting together for our dogs to play. He brought it up and we set it up, had to reschedule a few times and we finally got together and hung out last week. It was fine. A little awkward, we text like normal friends after. Nothing weird at all.

However my friends, boyfriend and a couple people at work have made comments ranging from how weird it is that I would go over there alone to that I’m dumb and he obviously likes me. Stupid comments that have needled away at me to the point where I’m now incredibly uncomfortable about being his friend and I’m worried that he might be hearing the same things from the same coworkers and is going to think I am interested in him or something.

I just can’t understand why anyone would every insinuate anything more because first, it’s not anyone’s business and I’ve maintained lots of male/female platonic relationships with no one hassling me. Including two other males (one married one single, one now attached) at work I have worked with several years and lunched with many times individually, had them over, etc, with no commentary from anyone.

**The Questions:** Is it acceptable to remain friends? Should I say something? Is this actually weird? Other thoughts?


**TL;DR**
My coworker is a single man, I am an attached, but not married female. My friends, a few coworkers and my boyfriend have made comments about how I just don't see that it is more than platonic. I am sure it is platonic, but now feel weird about it and I am wondering if others are hassling him too. Is it acceptable to remain friends? Should I say something? Is this actually weird?

332,"I'm a student \[22f\], currently living with my parents. I'm in my last year of university and I'll have a student loan debt of around 22k euros when I'm done. I have a few jobs besides university. It doesn't make too much money (around 300 euros a month) and I spend most of it on concerts, care for my cats and clothes, etc. I also have a car. So my situation is pretty good, I shouldn't complain. I could have some more money if I stopped spending it directly, but I'm just such an impulse buyer.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my 'problem' is that I get envious real fast of other people, mainly because I have no savings at all, because of my student loan. I have some friends that are content writers for websites, I do it myself as well. And I get so jealous when they land a gig that earns well. 'Why can't I get such gigs, they already have enough money, I'm so poor' - are just thoughts going around in my head. While I KNOW that if I'm more responsible with my money, I'd be able to save up more money.

I saw a thread recently about your age and how much savings you had. One 22 y/o guy said he had 40k on his bank account, and I'm currently on -22k, that just scares me but also makes me so jealous. Then again, that guy said he still lives at home and is working since he was 15, so it makes perfectly sense that he could save so much. I'm done with university in June and I'm a bit scared of the future. How can I ever afford a house or appartment? How will I ever find a job?

I'm just getting tired of my own jealousy. But also my urge to spend my money on crap I don't need is annoying. Does anyone have tips on how to live without focusing so much on money? Or to spend my money better? I'm tiring myself out going on like this. I just don't appreciate the things I do have, only thinking about money.",26Oct2018,1

Selfies do not work due to lens distortion, pictures on a timer tend to look lifeless and are also affected by lens distortion, the mirror is extremely unreliable as we naturally see ourselves in the mirror as better looking than we actually are.

Everything is pointing to me being unattractive (Kissless virgin 3 years above the age at which an average male loses theirs, which already marks me as below average), but whenever I take photos of myself/see myself in the mirror I feel like I am above average, although on some photos I do feel like I look awful as sometimes my eyes seem bigger than they are/my philtrum and chin are disproportionate etc.

344,"Recently started university. In my flat is me (22f) and three others (23f) (20f) (19f) and a guy who is  heres one night a week. But all together we have only seen him twice. So he doesnt really count into this story.

The past week or so we have had flat mate join (38m) who is from Pakistan. Hes polite enough. 
But he will only talk to us when we are each on our own. 

The conversations are odd. Im not sure if its a cultural thing. Which i'm trying to be mindful of.

My first interaction with him was introducing myself and he stood in the way of the door the whole time whilst I was sat down at a table. I was kinda hyper aware that I couldnt leave the conversation, although I didnt wasnt going to  I was aware it would be difficult.

In this conversation he spoke about how if he liked my country  he would stay. (Hes let for a month but if he likes it here hes staying longer) 

He claimed to own his own hospital and hes a man of worth, being a doctor etc. Which, im not entirely sure off. 

In the same conversation he said how your seen as someone of worth if you can speak fluent English, and men are encouraged to find english wives because their kids will be native english speakers. Therefore are of higher status. (What?) 

He was also over complimentary about how I look. So this made me uncomfortable, but I am aware that this could just be a largely cultural thing.  

Later in the conversation after disscussing general politics of the country he spoke about how his family didnt accept the idea of a white wife. But with recent times his mother told him she would accept a white wife now, as he moved England. So he hopes to find someone here. 

After that comment he asked if I had a husband (lol no) and asked why not. (Got shit to do) 

Then we moved on and spoke about the city I grew up in. Then he asked if I had a boyfriend. (Lol no) and he acted all surprised. 

Ive been polite to him but very careful with how I interact with him. I spoke to the other girls who have had similar but not as odd as mine. But theyre all in relationships etc. But the bottom line is that we all feel generally uncomfortable around him.

Aside from this hes a bit irratating to live with. Spends two hours cooking each meal. So we cant use the kitchen etc. Just typical flat mate annoyances. But nothing to bad. He also has a couple of friends who see him most days.

He seems nice and polite, he comes across as humble. But at the same time I dont dress up around him because he will ask what im doing looking so beautiful etc. Ive completely avoided my flat as a whole when im ready to go out clubbing, because of how I dress. And the idea of wearing small shorts and a vest top (my standard home clothes) isnt even worth conaidering. 

One of the house mates spoke to the propety manager who said ""he seems alright with me"" - but hes a older guy who gets complaints all the time from 18year olds, about who they live with. So hes kinda deaf to it I guess. 


I really dont know what to do. Because I feel like I cant leave my room without having to stress about him being in our open kitchen lounge area.  So I cant relax in our kitchen or lounge anymore because he will hear me in there and come out straight away to talk to me about where ive been, what im doing and who ive been with. 

I dont want to come across as racist or ignorant. But even the other two flat mates who are from cyprus feel the same. 

Im unsure what to do. Hes not done anything overtly wrong. So theres nothing I can complain about to our letting manager. But it is affecting our daily lives. 

One of my flat mates really dislikes him. I can see shes getting steadily more angry about it.

We cannot find another apartment that is cheaper and nice. Everything here is either over 1200 or way cheaper and unsafe/extremely outdated. 
We started looking for houses with a max budget of 150,000. If we put 6,000 down our monthly mortgage is around 1200. We thought it would be so much cheaper but after taxes it ends up being similar.

And now she hasn't messaged me back in 20 days.

I've messaged her 2 additional times since my message from 20 days ago.

361,"I’m 24 years old. For the past five years I’ve been studying business administration and French at a well-reputed, internationally recognised university and by next summer I will have an MSc degree in sustainable business management. 

I have always been confused about what I want to do with my life; what I want to study and do for a job. I went to a very prestigious school growing up where the students are led towards pursuing academic careers in business, politics, medicine, research, engineering, etc. I felt that there was a huge pressure on the students to go to university directly upon graduating even though you might have no clue what you really would enjoy studying. I was young and got accepted to my degree, and although I was excited I was also really scared that it might not be right for me but my family and peers pushed me to do it and were very excited for me. 

As I’ve gotten older, it has started feeling very frustrating to feel like I still don’t know what I want to work with. I gave enjoyed many of the courses I’ve studied and I’ve had a lot of fun, and I thought that it’s better to be doing something rather than living at home doing nothing while I try to figure things out and a degree in business opens up to a lot of different career paths which felt comforting. Ive received decent enough grades but to be honest I have never felt passionate or particularly excited about my degree. Many times I have felt so lost and confused and scared and may I add bored to death by my subjects in finance and microeconomics, but my parents and closets friend that I’ve spoken with about this have always brushed these feelings under the rug and said that it would be a huge mistake to drop ou, it’s such a good school, you’ll regret it, etc. I don’t feel like I’ve received the right support and motivation to feel excited about “starting over” and studying something elseThis, making me feel like I would be a complete failure if I did and I’ve been ashamed to be feeling these feelings of insecurity. Nobody wants to be perceived as insecure or as if they aren’t loving every single minute of their lives, studies and jobs. My parents have always said a degree is a degree no matter what you study and it’s important to have a degree, and you’re not going to enjoy all the subjects in a degree anyway.  Not sure if I agree with this mindset. 

As the end of my MSc is approaching, I have of course given much more thought to what jobs I want to apply for when I’m done and to be honest none of the realistic career paths I can take or that my friends who have graduated have taken excite me. I don’t want to work with sales, marketing, business development, project management at a company, wear a suit and work in an office on a computer most of the day. I did a communications internship in the UN Development Programme Nordic representation office during my bachelor studies and it felt like an incredible opportunity to work for an organisation that does what the UNDP does but i quickly realised that I found all my tasks tedious, boring and repetitive and I hated not being close to the people in need. Everyone is different and these tasks are the dream for a lot of people but I want to work with real problems faced by real people who need care and help. Although I’ve never been sure of what job I want I have always enjoyed and been good at entertaining and helping people, and doing what I can to make them feel better. I do a lot of improv acting and theatre in my free time and when I was younger I dreamed of being an actress. I’ve also wanted to become a psychologist and a writer but have so often heard from other people that pursuing acting and writing is a waste of time and only a small percentage actually become successful, and that my grades weren’t good enough to get into a good psychology degree. Much of this is true, but still - made me feel like I shouldn’t even try and I should just be happy doing what I’m doing. 

Studying to be a nurse has never occurred to me, no one in my family works in the health industry (my dad is a biochemistry researcher but that’s not quite the same and definitely not something I would be good at) and it was never a career possibility that was discussed in my school. I’ve also not spent much time in a hospital, I’ve been very blessed to never have been very sick or in a serous accident. It was last year when my friend’s friend visited and told me about her job as a nurse that I was properly introduced to the job for the first time. It was the first time in my life that I was genuinely interested in hearing about a person’s job and I didn’t want her to stop talking, I had so many questions. I started visualising myself as a nurse and it felt so right but I quickly dismissed those thoughts as I kept thinking I’d be crazy to pursue a new degree at this age and after all these years of studying. I also got scared of how what my friends would say and how my parents would react to this with how much they’ve helped me throughout my degree both financially and practically. However, ever since then it feels as if the universe has sent me hints here and there that I should pursue nursing (cheesy I know, sorry) and I simply cannot let it go. I want to be a nurse. It feels like the job requires the perfect combination of my skills and interests. I know nursing is extremely hard at times and not everyone can do it but the blood, sicknesses, stress, possibility of patients dying etc doesn’t scare me. 

I don’t regret my business degree and all the friends, knowledge and experience I’ve gained from doing this but I am sick of living a lie and feeling like I should live up to other people’s idea of what’s successful. Also, if I want to apply for an admin-related job at a company or an organisation that means a lot to me in the future I always have this degree to fall back on and studying is always an investment in yourself no matter the subject. But right now I think I would love to work as a nurse. I should probably add that I study in Scandinavia where education is free and I have no tuition fees, and we receive a grant from the government every month to help finance daily living costs while at university. I will have no debts to pay off when I’m done with this degree, but starting a new one means that I will be living on a tight student budget again for another three-five years and not be able to work or save much money. 

I don’t know what I want with this post but I guess I just wanted to ask for some support before I talk about this with my parents and friends, and see if someone here has been in a similar situation in their life. It’s scary to change paths in life and if anyone here actually reads through this whole thread I would be so happy to hear from you and talk more about this.

362,"I had a really good friend a while ago. She was so awesome to talk to, mostly about a lot of the shitty situations I was in. It was a long distance friendship, but we still texted and stuff. Back in January we had a big fight (mostly instigated by myself, I own it). I tried talking to her about it but then got frustrated with myself and didn’t text her back for a couple days. Then, when I finally worked up the nerve to apologize, I never got a reply, and she had blocked me.

I’ve just felt really shitty about the situation since it happened. The least I could do was apologize because we were pretty good friends beforehand And I felt guilty. I tried reaching out to her via Instagram recently because she popped up in my recommended. I was really polite and non confrontational, but was blocked anyway.

372,"Burner here, hope this is the right place to bring this up. The title is a brief summary. Long story short, I'm an exec assistant to the CEO of a multi-million dollar company. Been here for about 18 months and the position can be demanding but I feel I've got a pretty good handle on it overall, which brings me to my current issue, my mom is in the last stages of a three year battle with breast cancer and I'll be lucky if she makes it through the holidays.

I've never been one to share details about my personal life at work. Most of my coworkers don't even know my mom has cancer, let alone is at the end of the road. This is her second bout over a ten year span and things have gone really different this time. Things really took a turn for the worst about 6-8 weeks ago when circumstances led to the recommendation it would be ""better"" my mom stop oncology treatment, and I've been really preoccupied which has led to a noticeable work slippage.

I've tried to stay on top of things, but I've fallen behind with some of the requirements of the position and my boss has pointed out a lot of mistakes I've been making and I get the vibe he expects something is going on anyway. My goal was to get back on top of things by the end of this week, but even this morning I got some bad news from my dad and am having a hard time focusing.

As fate would have, the other EA that works for the company has accepted another position somewhere else, which means taking on a bigger workload for me while a replacement is found and then I would train them. This gives me confidence I won't be fired or asked to resign anytime soon, but I'm wondering if I should tell the CEO about the situation just for awareness and not to make it seem like I've just been a poor fit.

Online articles are about 50/50, mostly saying no unless the situation is causing issues, so I thought I'd bring it up here. If it matters at all, I'm in my late 20's and would actually be right in the middle age wise of the CEO's children, and I live close to my parents and have been very involved in the care taking process of my mom.

373,"Hi 
Here's the quick run down, I run events for a local non profit tabletop club.

Recently people been suggesting we do an event to get new members to join, I agreed and planned something that was well received and so started to arrange it.

A few days later I asked people if they would be would like to expand upon it and make it  into a longer event over a period of two months in addition to the event day. Once again people agreed and I started to plan it. I sent out a reminder today about it and people no longer want to do the 2 month event, I pulled that event but I don't particularly want to run the main event day now as I can't participate as otherwise I would not be impartial, I was going to participate in the longer event but now cannot. 

The club itself is a pay to play deal so I have to pay to run an event I cannot take part in. I expressed that I was no longer  interested in running the event for the above reason and I'm not being pressured into for the good of the club. I'm debating pulling the event as a result as so far I'm the person who has planned most of the events for the club the past 7 months and have only received criticism on all events that have  been run.

386,"To start things off, I do not intend to offend anyone and/or cause a problem. This is from my perspective so the least that I can ask for is respect of what I see and you can show me what you see. If you are an American it may be hard to understand and also if you aren't Indian but I can answer any questions that you have below. Also it's hard to believe, I don't blame you, so you can move on if it's setting off any alarms.

I am a British boy with Indian origins. I am currently attending an Indian faith school for my secondary. I am an atheist from a religious family.  You can (hopefully) already see some problems with the atheist part. I try to stay out of trouble but sometimes I get caught up in the moment which causes problems. (I really don't want to sound narcissistic) At school I am known as the jack of all trades except I don't hang around with any of the really cool ones or have a girlfriend  (which I don't care about). I don't really have problems with the teachers and some of them are really good. The school is very good. I eat healthy and I do daily exercise. I will try to not talk about myself more.

I don't really like Indian culture. I don't like being called an Indian or associating with Indians because there is a lot of racism, sexism and homophobia. I don't intend to paint EVERY single Indian in a bad way but it's quite common from what I've seen. I will give examples for all of them: Racism- Indians are not fond of other Indians marrying outside their culture and it is seen bad to do so. Sexism- Within Indian culture, there is an injustice between women and men. A normal Indian woman particularly doesn't work and is a housewife. Homophobia- Indians hate gay people and they engrave it into their children's minds. 
I don't want to paint Indians in a bad manner and this shouldn't change how you perceive Indians. Everyone's allowed to have their own opinion but when it's harmful to certain people then that opinion is then wrong. 
Also this is just Indian culture and I am sure there is a dark side to every single culture.

This is only one reason to why I don't like my social life at school and it's because I don't like the message that they give. I hear it straight up of them saying the n word even though they aren't black. Today they just learnt what f*ggot meant and are probably gonna be using that a lot. (I am a non feminist by the way but only when we are on the topic of 1st world countries) The males in my school still believe in ancient gender roles. I don't like the message.

Another reason is that they want to focus on the boring things like: who has a romantic interest on someone, materialistic things, being rude and doing stupid things. I like some of the things they do like: play on your phone or revise for a test but the other things are completely worthless and entertain stupid minds. I wish that they would grow up and do something that's actually fun but we are stuck in this endless loop of (mostly) boring activities.

I don't have a bad social life as for some it would be great but I wish for my peers to grow up for once, it's completely moronic what they think and do but change needs to happen. I find that I prefer talking to adults as they are the most level headed people that I can trust. It's weird, I know.

I was invited to go to Scotland (that's where her brother lives) and stay there for a couple of days. Of course my mother didn't concur. When I confront her to why she wouldn't just let me do the stuff I want and that it's hurting the relationship she simply replies: ''if she loves you, she will adjust to you''. Implying she needs to live my Islamic standards, which I absolutely don't want her to do or force upon her. 

My girlfriend is tired of my mom intervening in our relationship and kind of making up the rules, which I am as well. The fact is if I disobey or anything in similar fashion, this will hurt the relationship with my family the most. For the past few days we have been talking about breaking up, because it is just getting too much and ridiculous for my girlfriend and I'd hate to lose her. This has happened with previous girlfriends as well, whereas my mom would be too involved in everything and such resulting into a failed relationship. 

If I lose this girl I will really start to get hateful feelings towards my mom which I of course don't want. But if this keeps going on, how will I ever be happy? She wants me to go with a Muslim girl and have a very casual relationship, which just isn't me at all. 

How do I go against this? I'm so lost that this will go on for a while. I can't move out for at least the next couple of years and I hate her controlling my life. A 20 year-old shouldn't have a curfew. ",26Oct2018,1
392,"I work in an area of California where minimum wage is about $11 and I make $14 so I make a little more than average. I am currently looking after my 17 year old brother because my parents are homeless and unfit to do so. We both work and make enough money to pay for an apartment ~$1000.

Problem is, a year prior I got into a roommate situation and they ended up bailing on the lease and left me with an eviction because the landlord wouldn't work anything out with me. To make a long story short, I have an eviction on my record, previous roommate got off scot-free and I've been living at a friend's house paying rent for the past year. The room I've been staying in will no longer be available after the 6th of November and I've applied to about 5 apartment complexes and have been denied for 3 so far. All because of the eviction on my record. 

I've attempted to reach out to the past landlord about making amends and removing the eviction from my record but he won't answer phone calls.

She's like with 3 guys and tell me about it even after the rejection and that shit hurts to hear. She doesn't mind being friends but I don't feel its the same, and idk if it's the best thing for me tbh. What do I do. How do I handle the rejection.

396,"Hi Reddit,  


For a couple of months, I have had a bit of a ""mild"" toothache (not too bad, I can still sleep and sometimes it doesn't hurt). Sometimes I can taste it. I think I have it on most of my molars or at least half of them. I can see some black lines, but not a huge whole (maybe there's a huge decay inside the molars but I can't see it, since there's pain). Sometimes, although rarely, I get a bit of very small abscess on the roof of my mouth that naturally bursts. No swelling. I haven't taken antibiotics - I won't die, right?  


I have a dentist appointment next week. Assuming money isn't the issue, should I get a filling for them, or is a dental implant actually good?  


Luckily my other teeth don't hurt.  


A filling I heard (white composite) would last around 8 years? Does it last that long? What has been your experience?  


If I need a root canal, does that work?  


I feel the tooth cavities have given me brain fog and headaches. What were your symptoms?  


I know teeth implants will last much longer, but what has been the real experience? Is cleaning the teeth implants easy? Can food get trapped under the implant and do my gums recede due to the implant?  


Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

So my day started at 4am when I had to go to work in my crappy retail job, which really wasn't fun. But, I finished at 2pm and I went straight home and sat down and tried to go to sleep.

About 10 minutes later, I get a knock at the door, and it was this post man. He had my neighbours package, and wanted to give it to me and sign for it. HOWEVER, my neighbours hate us. They have phoned the police on us before, due to mentally ill sisters screaming and shouting. They have told my parents to fuck off many time, and one of them even threatened to hit my mother. They tell us to shut the fuck up at 9pm if we're making any bit of noise. Pretty much they're bullies

Anyway, so since I don't respect my neighbours at all, I said to the man: ""Sorry man, but they don't like us at all and are very horrible to us, so would you mind if you took it to the other house next to them""? I said this as polite as I could, since I've been working all morning and I know how much it sucks. So this guy tries to get me to change my mind, but I just told him no and sorry. The next thing he does is storm off and mutter under his breath. I then shout ""really""? and he goes ""well youre making my job so much harder, so fuck you"", then steps on my plants and leaves.

Usually I'd be able to brush this sort of thing off, but I just can't, it really upset me. Nothing really seems to be going good for me at the moment. Does anyone have any advice for me to help me get over this? I really just want anyone to help me out

408,"I wanted to ask for advice on how to handle a situation where there was a student causing distractions during a midterm I took. 

So the way the midterm exam was administered was a little different than usual. Our professor has multiple sections of the same class, and instead of each class taking it at their designated lecture times, all of the professor's students took it at the same time on a day where none of our sections have a lecture. Instead of splitting us up by section time, we were separated into two different testing rooms based on our last name (i.e. Students with last name starting with A-K in one room, L-Z in another room). These are small rooms by the way (~40 students in each room).

In the testing room I happened to be in, there was a student who unfortunately suffers from tourette's syndrome. This caused the student to make sudden outbursts every 15 seconds or so due to their tic. I hate to sound so insensitive, but it was incredibly distracting, and it was clear that a lot of people in my testing room were distracted by it too (noticeable huffing, looking over where the student sits, muttering stuff under their breath, shaking their head, etc.).

Being a slow test taker who takes all the allotted time to finish, I didn't finish a good portion of the exam in time, nor did any of the 10 or so people I talked to about it who were in my testing room. Meanwhile, everyone I know who took the test in the other testing room finished the test in time. 

The problem is that the professor grades on a curve, and takes the average of all of their students' scores to calculate said curve.  I was wondering if there may be anything that I can do about this, as I'm really concerned about my grade. 

What I mainly wanted to ask is: 
Should I go with a handful of students to our professor's office hours and ask if there's any way they can do two separate curves for the two testing rooms? Should I send an email to the professor beforehand to indicate the nature of the meeting? Am I being way too whiny about this whole situation? I understand the student cannot help it, and I honestly feel like a piece of sh*t for putting blame on something that they cannot help. At the same time, this test makes up a huge portion of our grade and I studied my ass off in preparation for it.

Any advice on how to handle this is greatly appreciated. It is really not my intention to offend anyone with this post. ",26Oct2018,1

He's also tried to finish his HS diploma multiple times, only to drop it again (*bc depression*). The farthest he got, he got because I (and maybe his mom?) bugged him about it. He's got one roommate and three pets to help support, and the roommate has been carrying the dead weight. He can do SO much, but...can't.

He wants to do better, but he's caught in the ""I've failed this many times, what realistically is going to keep me from failing again?"" self-fulfilling prophecy. He's also got the ""I'm sad because I don't do things, and I don't do things because I'm sad"" cycle. And many, many more.

Nothing is fulfilling for him - all he sees is this big rat race where you make money being someone's bitch for the rest of your life, and the idea of getting up in the morning to go to work crushes him until he crumbles, calls in, and never comes back to work. He has accountability, but just can't seem to bring himself back up again.

I don't want to leave him, but I don't know how to help him. It's not as though I can just up and love him back together. He has a whole world in his head and it's beautiful. It's just that he can't shake this thing at all, and it's not as simple as ""just grow some balls and do it"", he can't get a therapist(and has said that he could be honest with a therapist anyway), and meds terrify him (he's never been on any, but how they can change a person is scary).

So I live in a seasonal tourist town and part of life here is 6 weeks off in the spring and fall followed by 7 day weeks throughout the high season. In the past year I ran into a few financial hiccups and needless to say I was left without savings 3 weeks ago when I finished work but that shouldn’t have been an issue as I had banked enough hours for unemployment insurance. My rent is not yet paid for this October and my landlord is graciously giving me until I get on my feet to pay him. Last week they told me I would not be getting UI because they had lost my record of employment (they literally said someone quit and they misplaced it) so I was obligated to send the papers in again and today I was informed that I won’t get paid for at least 3 more weeks, basically when I go back to work. Now this is a pickle but it’s only a part of my pickle right now, you see, I planned the year around my tax return. I hadn’t done my taxes in three years and knew I had money coming. My accountant told me I could expect 4200$ when I filed in April. All summer I counted on that money to live through the fall and pay my debts. Seven months later I have yet to receive my taxes, they requested another copy of my federal tax slip 2 months ago telling me because I was receiving a large refund that my papers had to be gone over with a tooth comb. I have neither the means nor the knowledge of how to cheat on my taxes, I gave my paperwork to an accountant and he did everything. Yet somehow, today when I called for my weekly checkup of ‘hey, where’s my refund’ they told me I could expect it in 6 weeks and I was excited to finally get a specific date, however they told me it had been adjusted and I could expect 6$.

419,"So, I have 2 friends. We will call them Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill were high school sweethearts, and I was 2 years older than them. I was never friends with them in high school, but when I was in college, I was introduced to Jack through my mutual friend. Jack and I were good friends, he was super chill and we often had great conversations. Jack's girlfriend, Jill actually interviewed at the place that I worked and got hired, and I became super close friends with Jill as well. For a while I was very close with both, though I talked more frequently with Jill, as we world together daily. Jack and Jill had their on/off moments in their relationship, and when they'd have a fight with one another, they'd both often come to me for advice. Because I was friends with both, I was able to help them see one another's point of view in their quarrels and then they were able to work it out. At the beginning of this year, they broke up. I immediately found out from Jill and realized that their relationship had become very toxic. She wanted space, but he believed they were meant to be and wanted work things out. She did not. She was done being with him. I told Jill I supported her with whatever she decided, because she is one of my best friends. Around the same time, Jack, of course, messaged me, seeing me for advice. We met up and I tried to tell him that things were different, that this break up was final for Jill. I tried to help him with other at home issues he was having and we talked like old friends. Both Jack and Jill knew that I was friends with both of them, and both were okay with this. At one point, however, both Jack and Jill tried to bash each other, shine talking to me, almost as if I were being made to pick a side. I really hated this. Jill got the point and immediately apologized and we moved on, helping her move on and heal from this break up. Jack took the breakup harder than Jill, and he closed himself off, because he knew I was friends with her and he was paranoid that I would choose sides. He was also going through some other stuff, but we won't go into details on that. Jill and I, to this day, have talked almost daily. She is happy, and is in a new and healthy relationship. However, Jack and I have not talked since May. Today, as I was clearing up my messages and deleting ones I didn't need anymore, I stumbled across my thread with Jack. I wondered how he was doing. Now my dilemma is this: I am still unbiased in this breakup, because I was always friends with both of them, neither of them having ever done anything to me personally to change that. It happened a long time ago, as well. Jill has definitely moved on. Buy I have wondered how Jack has been. He was going through some things, and I want to check in on him. However, I don't want to upset Jill, if there is a possibility of her being upset that I've reached out to her ex, to check in on an old friend.

424,"So, I'm 26, and I've been looking to switch jobs where I could learn more and grow professionally in the field of administrative work.

Of the ones I heard back from, one was for a medical department within a nationally acclaimed public university. The other was for a start up business that manages a rapidly growing chain of restaurants. 

&amp;#x200B;

The position at the public university:

\-I applied through referral, but it's a competitive position 

\-They're able to offer higher pay than the start up

\-However, I feel more pressured about succeeding in that particular work space as it sounds a lot more high stake and where expectations are high with little room for mistakes and learning

\-It is not in a city where I would prefer to live or commute to and from

\-There is plenty of room for growth here, but there would be more competition

\-In the long run, this would be a more stable path for me to stick to as it has great benefits for the long run

&amp;#x200B;

The start up:

\-They recruited me through my LinkedIn profile and asked if I would be interested in the position. They find my resume impressive and have stated I would be a great fit for the position they are looking to fill.

\-Since they've been around for a number of years, it's simply a matter of growing the brand and company, so there is lessened risk of business failure than other brand new start ups

\-It's in a location I would hope to relocate for the future

\-The role would be generally administration, but also cross-departmental, so plenty of dynamic, lots of things to learn, which is something I rather enjoy. It also means, I could train to work in different departments and explore my career interests diversely instead of being stuck with one thing.

\-The pay is right along the lines of what I am expecting

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly speaking, I feel a little under qualified for the university job and feel like I wouldn't be able to perform as well. I guess it's great if they hire me, but I'm afraid I might not be able to survive for long because I may not be experienced. I think working for a start up may be a great transitional position for me to learn a lot more about different fields, and I think that might give me confidence and knowledge to hone my skills (I've been working in administration for 3 years since graduating college) more specifically towards a more defined career path.

425,"So long story short I met these two chicks a month ago while traveling in one of my favorite cities and we got along really well, after talking on Instagram a lot we agreed to come back to this city for Halloween, and I would introduce them to my friends in town and we would go to Halloween parties, etc.

They were super friendly and cool and seemed real down to earth and trust worthy, and generous me offered to book their hotel room for them in the same hotel that I was planning on staying. The duration of this stay is Friday and Saturday night and checking out Sunday.

Everything is going according to plan, they arrived in the city before I did and kept me updated on their progress about checking in. Once they checked in, however, they went radio silent. Nothing - not even looking at my message.

I knocked on their door and waited a while, couldn't tell if they were in the room or not,  and then I just gave up and went out on the town. Still no reply from them.

When I came back just now, the light was on in the room, so I knocked, still no answer. This time I 100% for sure saw that one of them came up to the peephole, looked through it and then went back. Starting to feel like I just got tricked for a hotel room, I go up to the front desk and ask for the key to their room, which they give to me since both rooms are booked in my name.

However, when I tried to open their door, they had the door latch on it so I couldn't go in. The lights were on and one of them had definitely just taken a shower judging from the smell and the humidity in the air.

So I say ""fuck this, they're not gonna stay here on my dime"" and I go to the front desk and explain the situation. I ask the front desk if they can refund me for the second room and cancel it, they said they could cancel it but no refund. And there's always the chance the girls could just stay in the room despite the cancelation.

The only thing I can think of to do to get revenge is wait until they're out of the room (probably night time, going to Halloween parties) and use my card to get in and take their shit. At least one person has to have in the room for them to have the door latch on. But, I also feel that this could get me in trouble as well (theft?)

Any advice?  I can't believe that these girls would do this just to get a free hotel room for two nights.

432,"I have one sister and one nephew. He attends a very expensive private university. He was offered scholarships to other schools that would have essentially paid him to go there, but he chose the super expensive one. My sister is taking out parent loans to cover a deficit. 

Last year I co-signed a $5,000 loan. My sister is a hot mess though. She declared bankruptcy a few years ago, is constantly complaining about being ""poor"" and just makes stupid decisions. Case in point, her car was giving her trouble so she just stopped making payments and ""bought"" another, figuring they'd just repossess the older one. She also walked away from a house to screw over her ex-husband. 

Anyway. She's asked me to co-sign a $6,000 loan this year. And I'm uncomfortable about it but then feel as as though I am letting my nephew down. 

Other background: he had a major then decided against it, so he's at this super expensive school with no clue what he's going to study. He can't get along with people (went through two roommates last year) and so now has a room to himself (which costs more money). 

I'm also just not happy with her as a person and our relationship is not great at the moment, so I wonder if I'm letting that cloud this.

433,"My mother is two people: A wonderfully kind woman who is thoughtful and remarkably intelligent. She loves me and I know she cares for me so deeply. She has helped me out constantly, financially and emotionally.

But then, because she is always alone, spending her days in her flat, not speaking to anyone, with bad arthritis and some breathing issues, the depression folds in on her. And then:

I go over, or I phone, and this absolute, unbelievable torrent of negativity and hopelessness descends towards me. She hates this, she hates that, she sees no hope, she tells me how she contemplates killing herself, she then starts to cry, to accuse, and so forth. It takes a lot for me to keep my emotions and empathy in check, having dealt with this for two decades now. The slightest bit of forceful language and she will cry and say that I am shouting at her. 

She then says this will never happen again, apologises, cries some more, and I manage to bring her out of her shell and think about other things. 

This cycle then repeats itself.

I managed finally to get her into therapy this year, but she stopped going blaming the cost and how she dreaded going there. 

I do think the answer is her opening up more and getting out of that fucking flat, but I do realise how trivial it seems to a depressed person when you tell them to join a bookclub or something like that. She sees herself as coming to the end of her life and seeing no point in doing anything.

Now I'm at a point where I really feel nothing will improve, the cycle repeats itself ad infinitum. I have reached the point where I'm on the phone I mouth 'fucking pathetic' as she's crying, which I hate to see myself doing. I'm afraid to say it but I really do think she has become incredibly self centred where everything is about her.

Because of all this I absolutely dread going to her flat, as I know what will happen. I dread Christmas and Easter as I just know there will be an 'event' with her.

So I am a senior in high school graduating early in December only taking one semester class at my high school, as it is the only credit I need. I'm dual enrolled at a local college. It is an EMT class, so we practice skills on each other.  There is this kid in my class who we will call Matt. At first we never really talked, but then as the class went on I guess we became friends? We had that sort of make fun of each other relationship, and everything was nice and light. Then it suddenly switched and he started saying really nasty things to me that were ""jokes.""

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, everyone in that class thinks I'm a hoe or whatever, even though it's not true. He calls me ""a fucking hoe"" ""hoe bag"" telling me I suck dick for money?? ""slut"" he also says that my makeup makes me look like a whore, etc. Basically just thinks I'm some whore, because I have had more than one sexual partner. Oh, and for a halloween party I dressed revealing, and took like one hit of someones blunt, so that makes me a ""drug addict"" and a ""prostitute"" At first I just thought he was joking but all of this is too far. Now on to the touching aspect of this. Yesterday we were sitting down (I was wearing a skirt btw) and he started rubbing his legs up mine and I just sort of laughed because what the fuck? Then I looked away, and he continued doing It and was smiling. The teacher was right there. Another instance is we were the only 2 left upstairs and he was motioning for me to walk down first and I was like no (don't want him looking at my ass) so I was walking behind him then he reached behind and touched my inner thigh/vagina. I had a skirt on again. Then today I was his patient he full on touched my boob and didn't even acknowledge it, so I pretended I didn't even notice.

It made me want to cry, and I don't know why. Am I overreacting? I feel like if I told the teacher he wouldn't believe me, because the teacher thinks that I'm the one mean to him.

I have about 5 close friends here, which is great, but I'd like to meet some more people and make more friends. I like to do things with my evenings amd weekends, but the few people I know here are usually very busy when I'm free so I often find myself with nothing to do. I'm an extrovert and I really don't like spending time alone too often. I have a large base of people in my home town, so it's a bit of a shock to the system to suddenly be alone. I have met a few people at work, who are lovely, but I work for a small company in which there are only really 2 people my age working there. I would always meet a lot of people when at school or uni, but since graduating I have no idea where I can meet new people.

How can I meet new people outside of work?",26Oct2018,1
466,Idk why but I’m sketching out like hell. I have a drug test tomorrow for probation and I’m 4 months out of a year in done. I was at my buddies house 2 weeks ago and he was smoking in his living room a small bit like 4 rips of the bong. I was sketching so I left after an hour. He’s got vents but the smoke was blowing a good bit. Then I went to his house for like 20 minutes after work 9 days ago. He just got done smoking. The drug test is 5ng/ml. I passed the at home drug test 50ng/ml cut off. I don’t smoke at all anymore so any real advice to calm me down would be great.

473,"Hey!

    The title is a little weird, but I don't know how to put in words really.

     I'll start off with this- me and my partner had a lot in common before we even started dating, but over time we've grown to love the same things and share interests. The thing is, we are working in the same field and I've started to adapt and use a lot of my parner's techniques. Just started to care about stuff they care about and feel like I'm not doing enough to be on their level, if that makes sense. I hate feeling like this, because I know it's not really coming from me. It's just this weird thing of wanting to fit in? Or something else, which is just bothering me, that I even feel this way.

    I guess, it's more about how to keep your lives seperate, but not. How to keep your own interests, but still have common stuff, and stop comparing yourself to them? Of course, it's good to listen to advice from someone you trust and who cares about you, but at the same time it's important to keep your own identity.",26Oct2018,1
474,"**TL:DR. My husband's 90yo grandmother is likely to pass soon.  I was due to travel interstate tomorrow to trade at market event (a big one for me)  and am not sure if I should stay and give him emotional support, or go ahead with my commitment, and hopefully make back the money I spent on stock prepping for this event. I feel shit and uncertain either way.**


Oof.  I feel like such an arse hole.  

I mostly freelance for work, as well as import and sell jewellery on the side, mostly vending at market's and events within my specific community.  
I'm not super flushed with cash and have to take ever opportunity I can to make money.  

This weekend I was supposed to be traveling interstate to trade at a market that would have been my second biggest event for the year.  I spent all of the money (actually slightly over) I had put aside for business buying new stock, and got more expensive/ rare pieces than I normally would, and I've spent the last few months making things for it. 
My partner and I were meant to drive instate today (9-10 hours or so) to vend there,  and take a few days back,  stopping along the way to enjoy our wedding anniversary.  

We got a call from my his grandmother's nursing home (as the closest family member where we live, he is the custodian), to say that she'd fallen and was shaken, but otherwise ok. 
We packed to leave as planned and stopped in to visit her on the way out.  
Once there, we found out that she had hit her head when she fell in the morning and had a seizure during the night. She's essentially unresponsive today.  Not eating or drinking. In accordance with her wishs in this type situation, her medication has been stopped other than pain relief. DNR instructions. 
Now it's just waiting really.
She has said before that she's been ready to go for a while.  She's surrounded by people who love her and care for her and there is someone with her all the time. 

We love her, of course, but are not as close to her as others and honestly I felt very awkward and in the way today and like I didn't belong there. Definitely we/I am nowhere near as close to her as the people that were around her while we were there. 

My husband decide that he should stay, and his dad is flying over tomorrow morning. As much as he would like me to stay around, he told me that I should go tomorrow, to vend at this event.  

I've committed to going, and hate to ""pull out"" even though this is obviously an extenuating circumstance. It's possible that cancelling may jeopardise me being able to book in for the next event in 2 years. 
It's a long drive to do on my own both ways, and due to a miscommunication with the event organizer, I'm not 100% sure I'll have the space I booked and paid for, to display all of my stock and it's very clear the woman organizing the market doesn't like me. Just from correspondence, I'm getting a bad vibe from her. 
It will be the last time for a while that I have a chance to vend and sell stock to make back the money I spent, which financially I really need to do. 

I feel like such a callous arsehole for even thinking about still going, but also feel like if I stay I will be just sitting around with people that are grieving and i really don't know what to do/ say. I will be staying just to lend emotional support to my husband, although he will mostly be staying at the home much of the next few days and says I should go.  I'm not really sure what I can so for him.  

I feel like such a jerk.

478,"to preface:  back in june, my brother's friend (let's call him nate) came to stay with us for a week.  he was initially supposed to be here to help my brother prep for a big yard sale, as my brother tends to hoard things.

it ended up taking them about 2-3 weeks to actually get around to the sale, and they have since clogged the garage with the stuff that did not sell.

my stepmother, bless her heart, tried to start helping nate get his things in order, including food stamps and social security.  (a note:  he is about 32, and is NOT homeless)  however, as far as i am aware, he has barely done what was asked of him.

i have tried on multiple occasions to talk to my stepmother about the matter, but she has ceased to listen.  after slogging through october, the month we were told he was going to be asked to leave, i'm done waiting.

Since i was 8 or 9, ive had speaking problems, body problems and weight problems. these are permanant, and i will have to live with these problems with the rest of my life.  Before high school i thought I was norma just like everyone else. I was so wrong. in year 5 and 6 it was actually pretty alright, not many people bullied me for who i am, and i seemed to be actually making friends. Everything changed once i started high school. 

The friends that was once actually nice to me in primary school all turned into bullied, well, not all, but at least 70% of them. They didnt bully anyone else but me. Up to now, i have been bullied at school for around 7-8 years, and i am 17 male. thats half  my life right there.  The social anxiety kicked in, and by  the time i was in year 9, the bullying was daily.  Every single day at school. I get laughed at in every subject im in, almost every lesson im in.  Mostly it is because of my voice, which sounds like shit. Every single time i talk people just hate it because they dont like my voice. This decreased my confidence heavily. Sometimes when i want to ask a question in class, i want to put my hand up and ask them but  Im scared because i might get bullied for my voice. When i was in year 7 i was a pretty good student, getting  above 70% in most of my subjects, and then that went down and down, and now im failing almost every exam and assignment, mainly because of these fucking assholes that i have to deal with every single day. I tried to stay away from them and not think about them, and i thought the only thing i thought i could do was to be addicted to something, (not like drugs  or something) so i became addicted to my phone, games and tv shows. Every day when i came home from school i just watched my shows, played games eat dinner and the day was over. 

I know that some of you in the comments would tell me to talk to a school counsellor, but i mean, these problems i have are permanant, and even if i do tell them what are they supposed to do? Move me to a new school, expell everyone who took the piss out of me all these years? That wouldnt change who I am.  Maybe by some miraculous reason i do get a good job with good pay, but how am i supposed to tell everyone who works there that i was bullied for 8 years and that i was suicidal, especially if a girl came up to me and said hi?  People are coming up to me at school just so they can annoy me, because they think it is funny. Sometimes they tell me to kill myself, sometimes they call me 'autistic cunt' for no fuking reason. I want to punch them in the face, and scream FUCK OFF to them but i know that i am too weak and scared to do that, and if i did, i would probably start a fight and loose.  Sure there are some people who arent that mean to me, but i can tell by their  faces that they didnt like me being around them. Im literally a living meme to those fuckers.  Maybe i could tell my parents, but im not good at explaining this in my own language, and i didnt want them to know that i was being bullied because they were really busy at their jobs and housework etc and i dont want to cause them any more trouble. 

 Sure i tried to do homework and i got all my assignments done on time, but i didnt get good marks on most of them.  I know that i should do well at school so that i can get into a good university, and get a good job, but i think in my head that, even if i do well,  what kind of business will employ me? And i dont really have any talents either, so i dont know what the hell im supposed to do as a job.  for the last 3 years,  I have had 2 parts talking inside my head. one part is saying ' Just kill yourself, get it over and done with. you  wouldnt have to give your parents or anyone else any trouble.' Another part keeps saying 'well if you kill yourself you wouldnt be able to watch all your movies, shows or you wouldnt be able to play any of your games, and what would your family think if you did it?' I guess for now i will try to do my best at school since i am in my HSC now, but its almost like i have no motivation to study. 


After all these years Ive realised that there are things that you have to accept in life, and i guess that this is it for me. These things that you cant change, no matter what you do.  Ive livee like this for 17 years and maybe my life has come to an end.  ",26Oct2018,1

I moved back to my hometown so I'd have friends nearby and a sort of social safety net. The problem is I am having trouble getting back out there. I recently started trying to date again and it hasn't gone great. I don't make a really good first impression because I'm really anxious. I can't seem to help it. I went on a couple and they went okay but the other people weren't digging it as much. And that's fine, but I just don't really know what to do. I'm an average looking guy and I've lost a lot of weight so I'm about as healthy looking a person as I can be. Dating apps I hardly ever get help with and I'm a teacher so meeting someone through work or anything like that is unlikely. I've tried going out but the nervousness just sort of ruins any chemistry I have with anyone. I also don't really have close friends so its hard to meet someone through them.

So a distant cousin of mine moved to the U.S. about a year ago and has been staying with my family and myself I think her plan was to become a registered nurse and then get into the military (through her dad, she has U.S. citizenship). However she's been working at a clothing shop since early this year. 

She had gotten her learner's permit to practice driving, but has mostly been relying on me to give her rides to work; for a few months, she has not attempted to practice at driving at all in order to actually get her license. At first it was okay for me giving her rides. However, it really is starting to take its toll on me, especially since she works in the evening (when prime time traffic is everywhere in the city) because I don't get off work until around 4 PM. I also haaaaate driving when the roads are super busy. The place were she works is about 10 mins away by the freeway (when there's not traffic), and maybe about 15-20 minutes using the back streets. So I have to take her then drive all the way back home The only reason why I give her rides is because she does give me gas money. However I'm thinking about not accepting her gas money. Should I just stop accepting her gas money so I can stop giving her rides and let her take Uber/Lyft instead?

She has tons of photos and videos of the cockroaches in action. They crawl everywhere: the fridges, the counters... they’ve completely soiled all the employee dish-ware and cutlery, to the point that it had to be thrown away. 

My friend used to eat lunch from work from time to time and has been inexplicably and violently ill a handful of times afterward—she suspects that the cockroaches have found their way into the food storage containers, too. 

The board of health have been called and they’ve come in to inspect the restaurant. They keep insisting the employees just continue to kill the roaches and eventually the problem will go away. This seems massively unprofessional and very fishy to me. 

The owner/franchisee of the restaurant has been intimidating his employees out of making any formal reports, insisting the board of health was right in that the cockroaches would go away come the cold weather. But they have not. It seems to be getting progressively worse, and dealing with the roaches is causing my friend emotional distress. Just watching the videos makes me sick to my stomach—having to deal with the infestation has reduced her to tears more than once—she says it’s like something out of a horror movie, and the videos confirm it. 

What can be done about this situation? I don’t want to cost my friend her job, and since she’s been very vocal about the problem to her boss, I worry that the fingers will be pointed at her if things go south. 

Should I be posting this in legal advice? Is there any action she could take for the emotional distress of being pressured to cover up/handle an issue that is way out of her pay-grade and job description?

I'm not sure if I'm being a total douche-canoe or if this situation is just entirely awkward?

Sister-in-law (SIL) went through a bitter divorce about 4 years ago. Husband was cheating on her while going through a mastectomy to remove breast cancer (she's fine, they caught it very early). The guy is just your typical money comes first and everything else (family, friends, even self) be damned. This guy would make the [/r/frugal](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugal) group cringe. She is so desperate to get out of the relationship she settles the divorce out of court taking a HUGE hit on the potential alimony and even worse she takes only half of what the court would have given for child support; big win for the ex-husband. She bounces from the state she lived in and moved out of state closer to us and her parents, the ex-husband is fine with this because he won’t have to spend on the kids at all.

From day one moving out here she has allowed the ex-husband to come visit, stay in her house, eat her food, and not pay a dime. In fact, he constantly haggles her about spending ""his"" money he gives her and badgers her about reducing child support. He even re-married within the first year to another woman. The SIL bashes him constantly and she shares horror stories about how terrible her treats her and the kids. But even more awkward when she is so chummy to his face around our family and never truly confronts him nor holds him accountable. 

Just recently she asked me for advice on what she should do with him asking for child support to be reduced, mind you it's already super low. Reading through her settlement the only provision to change child support is when the last of her children turn 18, there is no provision to reduce for their child that just turned 18. I told her she really needs to drag him into court and petition to have the support brought up to at least the standard rate and that she in no way should agree to a reduction. Thank goodness she listened to me and told him no to the reduction, but I think she still needs to get him back into court and get her child support fixed, she took a very bad deal. 

But her finances are even more upsetting with her and the rest of the family when she is constantly trying to peddle money out of us and get us to pay for things but won’t confront the ex-husband to get the child support fixed. We’re talking going to the church pantry while her husband sits on stacks of cash. Top that off with her terrible spending habits, constantly going to movies, trips, splurging on junk, etc, then she asks for money from her family; all while her ex-husband sits in her new home constantly visiting and being a total dick to her about helping out and money. It just makes no sense she’s chummy with him and then complains he doesn’t pay anything, she would rather try and score charity than face the music. To me that is beyond frustrating.

Now today we're discussing Thanksgiving plans for this year, we have been alternating hosting Thanksgivings between our homes for the past several years. I'm not the most joyous person, but Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and it sucks not to host it but I endure in the off years :-)

I let it be known I’m not comfortable with this and she can sense that I am not a fan of this and she never even asked if it were okay. Now she wants to have separate Thanksgivings ""for the kids"" so that the ex-husband and company can come. My wife and I are concerned that the SIL is also going to get other nearby family to go to her Thanksgiving rather than ours, she has no qualms about pulling the ""pity-card"" and going on with the single mother story. Basically, she’s the emotional bully type that pulls on everyone’s heart-strings to get her way. The wife and I just feel like the SIL has taken over our rotation to host Thanksgiving and with the ex-husband recently moving nearby we feel that this is basically going to be the status quo. 

How would you handle this? Are my wife and I being rude for not inviting the SIL’s ex-husband, his wife, and her kid, to our Thanksgiving even though the whole extended family hates the ex-husbands guts and has cause to hate him? Or is the SIL imposing? Personally, I’m at the point to say have our own Thanksgiving with the nuclear family and let everyone else be on their own.

Tl;dr SIL’s ex is a total dick to her, she invites him to Thanksgiving at our house with his new wife &amp; her kid. SIL is the type to pit family vs family fight.",26Oct2018,1
503,"So i dated this girl for a few months and we really hit it off. Like we fell for each other pretty hard, pretty fast. Tbh, I really feel she is special and i won't find someone like her again. I've been with enough people to realize this and that it's super rare to find this sort of relationship. The reason we called it off is because her dad doesn't want her dating anyone. He went through her call history to find out she was calling someone (me) and she ended up telling him about me. She didn't even tell him she was seeing me, just that we were talking. He told her that he'd never let her be with me. She deals with anxiety issues and this just created too much pressure for her to continue seeing me behind her parents back. She initially told me that we should stop and try this again later when she graduates from college and gets a job. I convinced her to remain friends until then but it just created a stressful situation and it didn't work out. She ended up telling me that she doesn't see this working anymore and that i should move on since she doesn't think her parents will ever accept me. We are Indians brought up in America with traditional parents. We're from the same part of India, follow the same religion (although we're both not religious), and even the same caste (not that we care but the parents do). Her parents' problem with me is that i drink. I find it very difficult to move on from this girl because of the special connection i had with her that i never really got with anyone else and the fact that the reason we can't work is cause of her parents drives me nuts. Please, some kind of direction or advice would really help. I've been having a pretty rough time.",26Oct2018,1

510,"First time using a throwaway.

Also, not antisemitic, but like anything else in this world, it's complicated.

I'm an overly educated white atheist, if that helps, over 45. My mom taught history in the town I grew up in.

I grew up in a very ethnically diverse town on the east coast. My highschool class was about 40% African-American, 20% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and of the 35% that was white, about 10% were Jewish.

Growing up, I was exposed to many different people from many different cultures, and as much as I hate to pull the ""But I have Jewish friends!"" card, I do have Jewish friends, and black friends, and Hispanic friends. I've been to Bar Mitzvahs, and Seder dinners. Gods, I feel shitty right now.

My town also has one of the top Rabbinical schools for the Hasidic Jewish community, and one of the largest populations of Hasidim outside of NYC. All of their children were sent to private schools in the town; they did not use the public schools at all.

The Hasidic community by and large kept to themselves until I was in middle school. They began running for the school board, and eventually had a majority. When they had a majority on the board, they began slashing the school budget, and voting things through like the school system paying to bus their children to their private schools.

Between this, and the practice of getting the public school system to pay for them to place their disabled children in private schools, eventually they bankrupted the school system, and our town had to be bailed out by the state. At least twice that I'm aware of.

Non-Hasidim began moving away, and now, years later, pretty much only the Hasidim are left, and those too poor to get away. Reform Jews left as well, because they used the public school system, and also the Hasidim by and large do not recognize non-Hasidim as even being Jewish, so the two communities did not get along.

SO anyway, enough back history, here is the point. I still live in the same state, but moved out of the town I grew up in after I graduated. I am a member of a small gym in the town I live in now.

After a workout, a fellow member brought up the subject of the towns we grew up in, and I mentioned that I grew up in [town]. He said, ""Isn't that the town with the Jews?"", and I began explaining that it had actually been much more diverse when I was growing up, and explaining what happened, pretty much in the same words as the description above.

One of the senior employees, who is Jewish, overheard part of this conversation as he was passing by. I did not see him, as he was behind me, but the person I was talking to immediately clammed up and got weird. Later, as I was leaving, the employee was talking to a different member about possibly moving to the south, and said something like ""It's beautiful there, but I wouldn't move there BECAUSE OF THE WAY SOME PEOPLE ARE AND I'M JEWISH.""

Now I'm worried that this guy, overhearing only a small part of the conversation out of context, is convinced that I'm antisemitic. He is in a position that he could speak to the owners and get me kicked out if he wants to.

Should I approach him and try to explain things preemptively? Or should I wait and see if he does anything and take it from there?

Tl;dr - I'm not antisemitic, but grew up in a town where the school system was wrecked by people who happened to be extreme Orthodox Jews. An employee of the small gym I go to overheard a small part of a conversation about this, and now possibly thinks I'm antisemitic and could potentially kick me out of this gym I'm very happy with.",26Oct2018,1
511,"My grandmother is putting her affairs in order.

&amp;#x200B;

If she didn't have a will, her assets, by default, go to her brother, with whom she's not very close.

&amp;#x200B;

My aunt mentioned that when she had talked with my grandmother about the will, Grandmother would usually change the topic, as if she was uncomfortable dealing with the reality of her death coming sooner than later.  Aunt said that Grandmother had initiated the process before, but not ended up completing the will.

&amp;#x200B;

During an emotional conversation a couple months back that I can't recall very well Grandmother mentioned to me that she planned to leave me something.  She mentioned something about an ""administrator"", but I can't recall who that was.  I believe she may have asked me if I was willing or able to do something related to the will, but I can't recall.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to seem rude, entitled or otherwise unsavory.  I am very close with my Grandmother and talk with her about all kinds of deeply personal topics.  Her will is something we've talked about a couple of times, but I'm just generally concerned/anxious about handling it tactfully.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like it's important to ask her again, that this is something I would be remiss to not mention now that it's on my mind.  Because there's no fixing a mistake like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd give this woman everything, anything she wants. Time, space, love, courage, strength, support, fuck idk possessions etc. All she has to do is ask, start a conversation. Her explanation for the text was that it was just easier than face to face. I can't even believe myself that it's completely worth fighting for after all this, but I love this woman and don't want this change to happen in my life if I can help it. Would this have happened had I never spoke about my dream? Did I trigger this in some way?

518,"My mother is a nice woman, there's no doubt about that. Yes, she's not that lovey-dovey as other mothers may be, but she always takes care of us, there's no doubt there. It's just that if she's feeling terrible whether she's depressed, tired, hungry, sleepy or whatnot, she will take every last bit of her energy to make you feel terrible. Her verbal abuse is the most painful thing I've had to hear all my life. At a point in my life among other things I was depressed abd it became so unbearable, that I was on the verge of suicide. I remember a day when I actually made an attempt, but was stopped by my brother, my mother told me the next morning ""If I knew what you were doing, I wouldn't have stopped you.""


It's as though everything that goes wrong with her or her life is someone else's fault. But I do forgive her. She's had a life that was underwhelming at best. Abused by my father into dropping her dreams, aspirations and education to raise children with a lack of support from her parents. Now at an older age, with nothing but these mere children to show for her ambitions. Every time she retells that story, I die a little inside but I've learned to look past it. I wish I could be ""not-born"", I hate life anyway, maybe it would have given her a better chance at her dreams instead of being burdened with children. 


I mean, which mother wasn't mean at some point, right? It doesn't mean that she doesn't love me. She might not love me as much as I love her, but that's okay. Even though my touch revolts her, it doesn't mean that she hates me, she just hates me touching her. 


It's been like this for as long as I can remember. It's the basic structure of our family. Mom freaks out, loses her head, screams at everyone over small or big issue and we all accept it and later apologize to her hoping she calms down again. She never does any wrong, we are the ones always wrong. The same cycle with anyone challenging her destructive behavior.


It's as though she refuses to help herself and expects things to be readily delivered to her so she can ""grind"". She says that's what she did for us all out life. 


At this point, I have dreams of my own. I want to get into shape, I want to learn to love myself, I want to meet new people and so many more. However, at every point along the way she feels like an obstruction. I'm in constant emotional turmoil. As I'm writing this at the very moment, she is lying her room refusing to talk normally because this morning I was 5 minutes late to get ready to go out with her. She did not leave. She spent the entire day berating me, telling me ""I hope you never get this life"" almost like a curse. 

Guys, I love her but I also so hate her. I can't just leave her either. What do I do guys? I've read on r/raisedbynarcissists that these are the characteristics of a narcissistic parent. But how can she be narcissistic if she gave her life raising us? It sounds like I'm the one being selfish.

I changed doctors to see if a different doctor could diagnose, he also recommended that I had blood tests done aswell as an ECG, Mouth and nasal swabs, urine tests, etc. All tests came back negative and he suggested I was healthy and I just needed a lifestyle change.

527,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the best subreddit to post in (if not, please let me know and I will repost elsewhere!) 

My boyfriend’s best friend has struggled with depression for at least 5 years now, possibly more. 

In the past, he’s alluded to feeling hopeless and thinking that he has no purpose/doesn’t think it matters whether he’s around. He’s said things like “if I’m around” through text to my boyfriend, but had never actually mentioned or talked about acting on any suicidal thoughts.

Just this week, however, he revealed to my boyfriend that he’s tried to kill himself four times. We don’t have any specifics about when these attempts took place, but I recognize that it’s a pretty big thing for him to acknowledge to someone that he’s tried ending his life (and not just once, but multiple times). 

My boyfriend has always done his best to be helpful and supportive, but it’s apparent now that this is a lot more serious than we thought. We’re worried and know that he needs help if we want him to stick around. 

Probably the biggest obstacle in all of this is that he doesn’t trust many of the resources that we’ve looked into for him. My boyfriend said that his friend reads a lot of online theories about the government, hospitals, etc. being out to get us (poisoning the water, medicine being designed to kill faster, ‘Big Brother’ always watching, that sort of thing). For this reason, he is absolutely against taking any sort anti-depressant, or anything else for that matter. He also doesn’t seem to trust doctors. 

My boyfriend doesn’t think that he would even want to see a therapist because he’s said before that no one can help him. 

I am just at such a loss for what to do. My boyfriend and I just called the national suicide hotline to see if they could suggest any resources, but they said there was nothing in our area they could recommend, aside from calling the non-emergency line (which we also tried, they gave us info for a walk-in therapy clinic, which we’re definitely keeping in mind). 

Any advice or suggestions? I really appreciate any feedback, especially from anyone who has been either in our shoes or in our friend’s. 

TLDR; suicidal friend doesn’t believe anyone can help him, doesn’t trust institutions, doctors, medications, anything of the like.

I do like her so I’d like to try again if possible but I also need time to work on myself and idk if I can be dating someone, even casually, while doing that. I was thinking about waiting sometime between next Monday and next weekend to ask what’s up with her asking to hang after ending things and not really offering an explanation, also so I can explain how I need to work on myself, Is that a good idea? Or should I just ask to hang, or move on or something? Sorry but I’m pretty lost here 

TL;DR My non exclusive relationships ended because she said she was getting serious with someone else, so I basically said ok let me know if it doesn’t work out but good luck, and she wished me the best too. But three days later she texted me “scratch that do you want to hang tomorrow?” And said I can’t  because I was busy.  Should I wait a bit to ask her what’s the deal or what should I do?

I dont even know how paypal credit works. If I have 2500$ in debt right now and its telling me the minimum to pay is 80$/month does that mean it will get paid off in 2500$/80$ months?

I understand how fucked up this situation is. For the past 2 years I've been trying to save as much as I can. I wear walmart/target clothing and never eat out. I'm not going to high school senior prom or senior field trip. I havent used any drugs since I was 14yo.

I know there isn't an easy way out other than suicide but I want to save that as a last choice. The last time I've talked about suicide my mom and sister were devastated. I love my mom and my sister so much I dont want then to see me dead. Im so fucking dumb and I need help...

534,"I work at a retail store. I recently got a tattoo on my forearm. Now I will openly admit the tattoo is dumb. Honestly it was something I doodled and I jokingly told someone it was a tattoo idea and then a week later I got the tattoo.
Now a lot or people mention it. And I always just laugh and they laugh and its great. 
But today a cute Asian girl came in. I complimented her sweater and as we were chatting she complimented my tattoo. Like not in a joking way. She actually liked it and i told her i drew it and she seemed like impressed I guess. I'm not bragging. Anyways. I really enjoyed talking to her but idk how to find her. And in an inoffensive way she is a transfer student and has a name I couldn't pronounce. Would it be weird to look her up on Facebook?",26Oct2018,1
