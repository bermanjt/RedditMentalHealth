0,"I've been best friends with E for 35 years. She is in a really awful (emotionally and physically abusive) marriage, has 3 girls, and is extremely churchy. Everything is “God’s will”. 

All 3 of her kids are extremely talented athletes, (think NCAA, national competition, elite travel team, near Olympian level). She and her husband have poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into private coaches, lessons, travel and equipment; I think the kids’ activities are literally the only thing they can talk about without fighting. They are deeply, deeply in debt over their kids' sports, and show no signs of slowing down. It’s utter madness, totally warped and unhealthy.

Lately I can't even have a text conversation with her that she isn't trash talking CHILDREN and coaches...she is completely obsessed and one dimensional (she knows every single thing about her kids' teammates, she stalks their parents online, same with opposing players, etc; her husband, I am not kidding, actually built an APP to TRACK THE OPPOSING players' stats - the kids are TEN YEARS OLD!! TEN!!) She is viciously trashing ten year olds’ abilities! Like it’s totally normal and reasonable!

I miss my friend, and I am really worried about this....it's gone very, very far. The girls are homeschooled so this level of competition &amp; obsession is all they know. They are incredibly driven and talented, but I can’t help but feel it’s not healthy for an elementary school aged child to be pushed to this degree. It is hours and hours a day, and they are open with the kids about the financial struggles they face to do this. The kids break down when they lose- it’s heartbreaking to see. 

E openly admits and even laughs that she and her husband are living vicarious through their kids. And she is the kindest person in the world UNLESS your kid happens to play with or against her kids- then she will trash you to the ends of the Earth. It’s completely out of control- and out of character for the person I’ve known her to be since we were kids. 

Any advice on how to gently talk to her about this? I feel I've lost my friend and I know she really doesn't have anyone else she confides in. Everyone else in her life is a sports parent too. I truly don’t think she gets how messed up this lifestyle is or what it’s going to do to her kids. ",06Mar2018,14

6,"First , Thank you for all your help. I need some help. My father came from overseas to visit us for a few weeks. A month and half into the visit he had to be admitted to ER (1 day) for a TIA. He was on Blood Pressure medications but he never had a TIA before. He went back to his country to origin after about 2 weeks.

Few days later we received a letter , in name of my father, from the Visitor insurance co. notifying him that the bill raised by the hospital for about $50k for the ER Visit has been declined due to pre-existing condition.  We appealed this decision twice over last 12-18 months but was shot down due to pre-existing condition.

Now , before we could reach out to the hospital to talk about the bill. He got a notice from a collection agency based in US-CA in his country of origin.  We called the hospital but realized that the bill had been sent to collections without sending us a statement. When we tried to clarify the hospital said that this is the process where they do not send bill overseas and neither to the local address provided since the patient ( my father ) is from overseas. Essentially , we never got a chance to make a payment before the bill was sent to collections.

What can he/we do next ? Has anybody been in this position before ? We have yet to contact the collections agency and have yet to respond to the first notice sent by the collection agency.",06Mar2018,3
7,"tl;dr: My best friend was day drinking and tried to have sex with me that night but I stopped before anything considered sex happened. It's been over a year and I don't know how to feel about it or what to do to make things right again.

With the recent #MeToo and #TimesUp movement I've been nothing but concerned about the events of my Earth Day last year. To give some brief context, I graduated high school in 2016 and after I started going to college I started talking more to my friend from high school ""D"". It started out as just simple text conversations since D was trying to keep in touch with everyone after we all dispersed to different universities, but that soon changed. Over the course of my first month at college, D and I decided to become pen pals and mail each other letters for the fun of it. I went first, detailing my experience of meeting new people and adjusting to dorm life. She received the letter which she responded to a week later detailing her time away. I found out she was having a rough time meeting people and sticking to who she already knew. Even her roommate was from our high school. Mind you, I had a girlfriend at the time and D had a crush on another guy who went off to a different university than either of us, but the point being that I had nothing but friendly intentions regarding my interactions with D and I assumed she was on the same page since she was still talking to the other guy. Shortly after the penning started, we additionally would Skype each other during the day when we were on break from our classes. I saw nothing from it, except that I also Skyped my girlfriend every night before going to bed. Fast forward to the end of the semester. I'm still with my girlfriend but D isn't talking much about her guy anymore since they realized their distance was just too complicated. D and I are still penning letters to each other once a month, each of us alternating. Besides penning and Skype, we're talking on a daily basis. It feels like a day without talking to D is a day unfulfilled. We give each other advice, we talk about our issues, and we make each other laugh... a lot. The time came for us to head home to enjoy winter break and the first thing on my mind was spending time with D, not even my girlfriend. I felt so indescribably warm around D, just the way we connected was like any other that I've experienced in my short life. I decided I would break up with my girlfriend over the break because I knew it wasn't fair for either of us to keep going while I felt nothing there any more. My heart knew what it wanted but my brain hesitated to tell me. I went on a family vacation to Florida (God forbid) during my break and on the last day of my trip D and I were texting, joking about a pornographic superhero we came up with. We made plans to hang out and brainstorm the script over coffee when she admitted that she missed me. I didn't know in what kind of context but the words were there. I returned the gesture and told her that we should hang out as much as possible before we have to go back to school. I came back home to find out that she had a boy toy ""S"" and that he was trying to entice her into coming over to his place and sleeping with him. It hurt knowing that she was just looking for easy hookups and nothing serious because I felt that she deserved better, she was my best friend. We planned a day out together which also ended up being the day I dumped my girlfriend. We got breakfast and explored a graveyard while she coached me on how to properly break up with someone and before I knew it she had to go somewhere. I went home and called my girlfriend over and nailed the coffin. I called D over along with my other long time best friend to comfort me and for the first time I held D's hand. Oh my goodness what a feeling and oh my goodness where was my mind going? Was it really happening? I had developed feelings for D and boy were they strong from being suppressed for so long. Shortly afterwards D invited me over to her place specifically because she was home alone, if you think you know where this is going I'm sorry but you're wrong. She had some weed leftover that she bought from one of her few college friends and a tobacco pipe that she was borrowing. We went to a 7/11 to pick up a lighter and went back to her place to smoke out back. It worked enough to where we felt something so we laid on the floor in her living room and turned on music and tripped out together, alone. These occasions continued for the next 2 weeks, whether we were at a park after dark or just in my car. The new semester started back up and we went back to texting, Skyping, and penning. This time I admitted to developing feelings while penning a letter. I waited, and waited, and WAITED for her to address it in her letter back and she did, unfortunately she didn't think anything could work out although she admitted that she too felt something there. I decided to give up on that fantasy and stick to friendship as difficult as that was because I really did value our friendship. A month into the new semester she called me letting me know that she wanted to make the 6 hour drive and come visit for the weekend. I was ecstatic and immediately told my college friends to get ready for the weekend. To prep for her stay, we got edibles and rented a movie for all of us to watch while we were high. Unfortunately they night didn't go as planned because my friend had a seizure after ingesting too much weed and we all had to focus our efforts on comforting him for the rest of the night. By 4 am he had calmed down and D and I went to my room to sleep, in the same bed. We woke up the next day actually feeling the effects of the edibles and walked around town (bad idea). We got ice cream, her favorite dessert before she had to hit the road but I still felt like something was there. I ended up having a brief stint with a girl hoping I would be able to get my mind off D but that ended with me getting hurt. On the bright side I understood why she was sleeping with slutty guys which was probably to get her mind off of me. I learned that before she came over to comfort me after my breakup, she had been over at S's house having sex with him. This time I told myself that I have to let it go. I started talking to a girl in March ""H"". She took all the Skype time away from D and wanted to meet up with me next time I was back in my hometown. I began a relationship with H while D was talking about sleeping with other guys. We still talked daily though so we updated each other about our current affairs. I dumped H after 3 weeks realizing how awful it was for me to lead her on, thinking I wanted a serious relationship and I was single yet again. D wasn't talking about any specific boy, just cute guys she's noticed around town.

With all that context out of the way I can get into the real story: D invited me to come to her university and go frat party hopping with her and her friends on Earth Day since I was back home drug testing for a summer job. She bought us flower head bands to wear so we could look cute and I wore a shirt that had paper airplanes on it, like the tattoo she had of one. We looked ""hella cute"". I'm not a frat person at all by the way, I am more of a hipster type of guy who likes 90s music and beach bonfires, but since I was with D I was willing to do whatever. We jumped from one trash party to the next drinking beer mimosas until we got to one specific party in which someone handed D a handle of whiskey and she took way longer of a drink than she should have. D is 5'2"" and skinny so it's not even an assumption to label her as a lightweight. I'm 6'1"" and 145lbs and felt completely sober after 6 mimosas which shocked me since I'm a lightweight too. In a sense I was happy to be sober since that whiskey demolished D and she immediately got drunk from it. I walked her back to her room from the party and she walked out with the whiskey in hand. We left the party around 4 pm by the way. D inevitably rejected the whiskey and began to throw up in the toilet while crying. I sat down next to her scratching her back trying to comfort her. I picked up a pizza after an hour of her vomiting. She transitioned from the toilet to sitting down in front of the sink talking to me. I continued my efforts to comfort her, suggesting she try to eat some pizza so that alcohol wasn't the only thing in her stomach. It took awhile but she eventually tried eating. It wasn't easy but she managed to down half a slice very slowly. She had blown up a mattress for me on the floor to sleep on assuming I would have been too drunk to drive home, I suggested she lie down on it. She did so and tried to eat more pizza before giving up and just laying there. I asked how she was feeling and she said ""better"". A good while had passed when she asked if I could lay next to her. Thinking nothing of it I complied. She comfied herself up and cuddled next to me. This was surreal but I tried to think of it in a friendly way, she trusted me. I was taking good care of her! She then said ""you're a really good friend, 'R'"" and kissed me on the cheek. My heart skipped a beat. Everything froze. My brain was mush and I couldn't gather a single thought. As my heart continued pounding she kissed me on the cheek again, this time a little bit closer to my lips. I didn't know what was happening but I felt my body lock up completely. Was it about to happen? Is this right? She went for another basically on the side of my lips before going for the real deal. I stopped her. ""I can't"" I said, ""I don't think it's right"" I don't quite remember her response but it wasn't dismissive. She started over, kissing on the cheek and moving closer until I went for it and let out all of my feelings. The sun was almost done setting and it was getting dark out. The clothes started coming off until I alone was down to my pair of boxers asking D for a condom to which she said was in her purse. I reached in her purse when the disconnect from the action made me think twice. I couldn't go through with it. If I were to have sex with D I wanted it to be 100% by choice. I wasn't sure how conscious of her decision making she was at the time and didn't want to risk it any further. I told her I couldn't go through with it and started putting on my pajamas. She offered to let me sleep in her bed with her but I turned it down in the case of more things happening. The next morning she had to go to work early so I slept in. I picked her up from work and took her back to her room, she began joking about the time we had and I started to feel okay. I got hopeful that maybe something organic could start. That didn't happen, sadly. Once summer rolled by she didn't want to spend time with me. She stopped texting me daily, we didn't Skype any more, and she let our Snapchat streak die. I felt confused and didn't know what went wrong. She had let me know that we were beyond what happened on earth day and that we would continue being good friends. We even took a trip to Disneyland just the two of us a couple weeks after earth day. It dawned on me that she ended up not being okay with earth day and decided that she didn't like what happened and didn't want to let me know. She started telling other people from our home town and got some old friends to start loathing me because of that and the fact that I dated a senior in high school while at college. I was at a loss and still am not sure how to feel about what happened. I ask my friends and they take my side because they're good friends, same with my closest family. I decided to finally share my story with strangers on the internet to get completely unbiased advice on how I should feel. If you made it to the end then bless your soul that was about a full year's worth of storytelling mostly abridged.

He's had depression since his girlfriend broke up with him. So I swooped in and became good friends with him. I've been supporter of his dreams and been a good friend but all I got in return was cruel jokes toward me and rough physical contact. It made me want to cut ties for a long time and I eventually did two days ago. I might be overthinking this but I feel like I did it harshly. He was drunk and I made a joke that he responded negatively. I took this opportunity to use this fight as a way of cutting it off.

13,"I'll keep this as short as possible. I'm a 22 year old dude who is going to be graduating very soon from college. Over the past week or so, I've been going through a mini existential crisis. 

Looking back with full honesty, Middle school was a terrible time for me. I was constantly trying to be buddies with a few other 'jock' types who never really saw me as an equal (although they did respect me). This school also was in a location with some very seedy areas feeding into it. I'm all for equality, and many of my friends were immigrants, but my school also had some absolute 'thug' types who likely grew up in messed up homes. I was never directly bullied, but I was in fear of physical danger a few times. 

High school was a bit better, but had its own problems. Again, I think I tried to be something I'm not, which was the jock type. I actually made some good friends in high school, and tended to float across several 'cliques.' I wasn't unpopular in a Mean Girls sense, but I certainly wasn't on the inside. It hurts to think about, but I was never really invited to a single proper boy-girl drinking party. The way to describe my time was I was 'never anyone's first choice.'

My time in university is coming to an end now, and it has been better than the previous two phases. However, I feel like my experience has been hugely lacking in some ways. The good thing is I'll be graduating with a very good GPA in a solid double major program, and I have no debt because my parents were kind enough and able to pay most of my tuition. I also got involved, studied abroad, and made some very good friends. However, I feel like I lacked the quintessential 'college' experience. I went to a major university where most people commute from within this major city, so it's almost like more of a high school atmosphere. I literally went to about 10 parties and out clubbing 15 times in the total of 5 years. And even though it's an embarrassing subject, in two months time I'll most likely still be a virgin. Other than a few tinder dates and other very casual stuff like that, I haven't been dating much. And in all fairness it's not a 'pitiful me' thing because there's been some out there who are available to dating me, but I'm simply not interested in them. 

See, I feel like I can make something really good out of my life here. I am graduating soon, can likely get a good job pretty quickly, and feel that my dating life can turn around with the right person. However, it really worries me when my parents and so on say that 'high school/college is the best time of our life.' My time in school was painful at the end, and university has been somewhat forgettable. I can't help but think how much better it could have been if my parents pushed me on the right track. I certainly would have fit in better at a better public school or private (we could definitely afford it), but my parents didn't really have the wisdom in my time through. They know better for my little siblings now. And more than that, I wish I could have gone to a potentially 'better' program at a university away from home. While I would have chosen something similar, I definitely underestimated how smart I was at a young age, and hate that I missed out on 'the best years' away at a campus college.

And on top of all of this, I don't feel like I'm growing up. When I see some of these young kids coming into the college, I realize I need out soon and can feel that I'm more mature. But just looking at myself, I haven't changed at all as a person, and am certainly not ready for this change. ",06Mar2018,2
18,"Hi, I am 29 years old with a job, car, good looking, and a lot going for me in life. I have been trying to get a gf for years with no luck. I see woman line up for abusive jerks that destroy them and the people around them. I have been told many times that I suck as a person and I have a shitty personality, that is my problem. I am starting to believe that I need to abandon my thoughts of helping my fellow people. I need to learn to become a sociopath narcissistic if I am ever going to earn the love and respect of a woman. I am 10 years without a relationship and I am in my third state. I see these awful men get the woman every time. So I guess the question is, should I be alone forever or start learning how to hurt my fellow humans to gain love.. sigh. I hate this.

**EDITED:
The best thing I heard was why do I need to be in a relationship to define myself. I already love myself, everyone has the problem of assuming that I wouldn't, your wrong, I do. The problem is why am I defining myself by relationship status. And the question is, why have I listen to people that installed this into me. I must learn to prevent this and solve it. I am not defined by being single. I am defined by being a person that cares about other people around me.

19,"For the record, I speak German because I am part German and wanted to connect with my roots, so I taught myself. My family left Germany some 50 years before Nazi Germany, and they were not Nazis. I have ABSOLUTELY NO affiliation with, admiration of, or connection to Nazis or neo-Nazis, or any hate group. I have many Jewish friends and don’t usually think twice about their religion or culture.

So, besides English, I speak Spanish and German, and have them both on my resume in the same section to show my foreign-language abilities (speaking a foreign language is not integral to my industry, but I think it looks good anyway). Whenever I mention my German to a non-Jewish person, they say something like “Cool, how did you learn it?” When I mention it to a Jewish person they’re almost always silent, not commenting on it at all, which I fear may be for obvious reasons. 

I’m afraid that having German on my resume might make some think that I learned it for the wrong reason. My fear is that an employer will see it and (either consciously or subconsciously) put it aside because of that. 

(Note for my German friends: I‘m aware that Germany isn’t like this anymore. Last poll I checked showed Germany with the lowest anti-semitism in Europe. But Americans still often associate it with that, especially Jewish people, understandably).

So my question is: should I remove my German-language proficiency from my resume because it might be misunderstood by the large amount of Jewish people in my career’s industry?

Professor [Name],

I noticed you graded my submission for the Unit 1 exam and you said to contact you about the grade. Also as mid-term approaches, I would like to inquire about my overall class grade as well. 

I have no intention to challenge my grade because I know I’m capable of submitting better work. But due to working and an excessive amount of family obligations, I admit I’m not prioritizing this class as well as I should be which ultimately effects my grade. Since I am projected to graduate with my Associate’s Degree after this semester, is there any advice you can give me to do better throughout the remainder of the semester to earn a higher grade to avoid prolonging my graduation?

If you would rather have this conversation in person, please let me know so I can go to your office hours.

Here's my previous post. I'd recommend reading it before this. https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/81veuz/serious_tomorrow_is_my_17yearold_dogs_final_full/

We spent the morning with him today, gave him lots of treats and held him as much as we could. After returning from the vet we all just fell apart. We all know we did the right thing for him but we just don't know what to do after losing such a crucial part of our family. He would take hours of our days for cleaning, feeding, walking, and we were glad to do it, as we all loved him so much. Now we are all just empty, mostly my mom and I. We've just been laying down all day crying and I don't know what to do. My mom has said this is the first time she hasn't had a dog around in over two decades, and as he was older than me he was more than a brother, he was my best friend. 

Well, now he's gone, and we are just at a loss. The house is so empty. His area which used to be littered with his beds and blankets is just.. floor. His water bowl is gone. We all are just empty, physically and emotionally. 

My mom and I have no idea what is going to happen from here on out. I'm getting to the point where I want to go with him, my dog. I want to be with him. I don't know where to go in my life. I want to go with him to wherever he has gone after death.

35,"Hey everyone, thank you for taking time to help me out it really means a lot. So I'm currently 15 and 1st grade in highschool (that's how grades go in Croatia) and in elementary school I had great grades, but now it looks like I will be failing the year and will have to repeat whole 1st grade again and it really hurts me because it would just feel like I wasted a whole year in life for nothing but I just can't focus on studying something I just don't like (Biology, Chem, Latin...) and I will fail those subjects (here if you fail 3 subjects you have to repeat the whole year again) but I'm still doing great on things that interest me like Maths, Comp. Scinece and English. And now for almost 3 years I have been trying to follow my dreams that are mostly to either become a musician or an Esports player one day, but every time I would really go for that kind of stuff I just end up giving up after 3 months or so because I'd just think I am not making any progress with that stuff but at one point or another I would come back to it again and give up again and just repeat it all the time. Now I just feel lost, I don't know what to do... I would really like to go after my dreams (to be a musician or and Esports player) but everytime I would talk to someone close to me about it they'd just tell me to stop dreaming and that it's not realistic, I also tried to learn more about music by taking piano classes but my parents refuse to pay any classes because I'd just study even less. But to me it feels dumb to learn about so many subjects that don't interest me and there are so little that I actually like. And now at this point everything is going downhill, I'm afraid to risk it all especially because my parents probably wouldn't support me and take away my PC and everything and then I'm left with highschool which at this point I will most likely waste a whole year by failing a grade and then learning so much stuff that I don't care about for like 4-6 years until I get to learn about what I want to. Would really appreciate if you guys would tell me what do you think about this, because I'm at the point where I am trying to force myself to learn something for an exam at 3 AM and am getting little to no sleep and I just can't seem to force myself to learn during the day and this learning during the night isn't efficient either as I am mostly crying thinking about my future and thinking how I might just end up homeless at one point. Thank you very much for your advices, also sorry if I am unclear with a lot of stuff I'm at this point desperate for something good in life and just want to find something good and hope in all this",06Mar2018,3

41,"So some backstory, a couple of things - Im a 25 year old guy living in Florida, my parents live in NY. The backstory thats important, is that my brother died in Iraq back in 2006, and every year we do a big run/walk in his honor up in NY.

Anyone, over the summer, one of my best friends of almost 6 years asked me to be in his wedding party, I of course said yes. The wedding falls on the anniversary of my brothers death and the night before the run/walk. I told my parents immediatly about the overlap in times, and committed to traveling to the Run/walk (In NY) the morning after the wedding. I have traveled morning of the event before and made it in time. I have brought up this fact multiple times throughout the past couple months.

So tonight, I brought it up again and it just now clicked apparenlty with my parents that it was actually happening. My mom started crying, said that I didnt care about my brother or the family. She said that she had never even heard of my friend who is getting married (despite me hanging out with him all the time for many years - my mom has even met him before). My dad basically tried to guilt trip me with the ""do what you want"" thing.

This is really frustrating for me because I have attended the walk every year no matter what. My parents are acting like its not big deal that one of my best friends is getting married. They dont even hear the fact that I plan on coming the morning of the run/walk.

Am I crazy here in thinking my parents are being outrageous? My brother died 12 years ago, Ive made every single walk since, what do I do?",06Mar2018,2
42,"My best friend of 6 years put on Facebook that she’s engaged to her boyfriend. She is 17 and in high school and has no job or college plans finalized. He is 20 and served a year in theAir Force (was discharged for medical issues), has no job, and lives with his family. She hasn’t told me about it, and she posted it yesterday. She’s had a string of abusive and shitty relationships and severe mental and physical health issues. She literally said a few months ago that she feels like she would just be settling for him if they were to get married. He is publicly pissy and rude with her (snappy with her in restaurants, making rude comments on her social media, tweeting bad things about his relationship). She met him on Tinder less than a year ago. When they started dating, he said he had deleted the app and he hadn’t. She’s in an uncomfortable family situation living at home, and I feel like this is just subconsciously her trying to get the hell out of her house the second she turns 18. She half jokingly talks about how much she hates him, and when I agree that I’m not too fond of him, she defends all of his shitty behavior. I don’t get it. I’ve lost her to an abusive ex forcing me to cut her off before (her ex took her phone and texted me posing as my bestie saying that I was standing in the way of their relationship for saying they should not get back together after they went on a break. I couldn’t talk to her for 3ish months), and I don’t want to lose her to another shitty relationship. More importantly, I don’t want her to ruin her life! She’s told me that once she’s getting married she’s quitting birth control. Pregnant and married to a prick with no college education or stable income at 17-18 is not what she deserves. I just don’t know what to do when the subject comes up. I will be in their wedding (she’s said before that I would be a bridesmaid when she gets married), but I just can’t say that I support this because that would not be true.",06Mar2018,2
44,"I was dating this middle eastern girl for about 4 months, confidently can say it's the first girl I've ever loved (I've dated others). She was extremely limited by her parents in terms of what she could do, so I barely got to see her, maybe once a week at best, sometimes longer, we lived about 20 minutes away from each other.

Eventually her sister found out and demanded that we stop dating, so we had a chat and basically agreed to call it quits because it'd never happen, this broke me and it's been the focal point of my life for the past few months.

I can't get over her because it doesn't feel final, it's not like she doesn't want to be with me (or so she says) it's because her parents won't allow it, or something else, there's always an excuse. Recently I caused a bit of a scene at a bar we were at because I saw a guy hitting on her, after that I told her I can't bare to be just friends with her, it just causes me so much grief, and after that we agreed to not speak anymore. I made her block me on all social media so as not to tempt me.

Having no contact with her is killing me, I've never felt this bad in my life. I don't know if I need to hear something or see something in a different light, I'm just so sad right now. I think i'm holding onto a pipe dream she'll just suddenly change her mind and want to be with me despite her 'obstacles'.

45,"I work in a small office with just two people. The boss has an office abroad and actually works there full time. 

The boss has asked us to find a camera so he can be sure no random people come in, but we have a lock code on the door already. I think it's an excuse to spy on employees since there is already a security camera at the entrance, administrated by the building security. He wants a surveillance camera with specifically 'high resolution' for the whole area where he can control it from his side, turn and zoom with perhaps audio too for 'video conferencing'.

I'd feel uncomfortable having someone unknowingly watching me at any moment. 

Is this reasonable?

Any surveillance cameras you can recommend that are less invasive?

47,So here is my story. I met a girl online back in August. We talked and video chatted everyday. We talked about meeting in person so I took a vacation time off in February so I can visit her. We talked about living together. We were what I thought was ”in love”. So back at the end of December end of January her baby daddy got a DUI with the kids in the car. So he is most likely going to see jail time. So we talk about it and decided the best thing was for me to move up here. So I work at Walmart so transferring my job was no problem. So I before I get my transfer I asked her if this is what she really wanted to do and she said yes. She can’t stand not having me there with her and she wants me to go up there. So I put in the transfer got accepted got my LOA. So I get rid of a lot of things I have including my vehicle because it would not have made the road trip. I rent a car so I can take the little I have after getting rid of everything. I spend all the money I have coming up here. I get up here. Things are good for the first couple of days and then boom she starts shutting me out. Giving me attitude pushing me away. So basically this girl wanted me to come up here and now wants nothing to do with me. ,06Mar2018,3

49,"Early 30's.  I work for my family's micro-business.  The business has never made great money.  It was well known if we came to work for the business, we'd never make great money.  The problem now is I'm stuck.  I started working there several years ago full time after leaving another job.  My sister &amp; father were working there with my mom helping on an occasion and business wasn't great but it was starting to pickup so they needed some help.  The business has grown slowly and my responsibilities have increased dramatically.  Now it breaks down to me doing about 40% of the work, my father doing about 40% of the work, and my mom and sister splitting about 20% of the work.  If I left the business tomorrow, it would be a major issue as I've made myself too important.  All family members agree and have stated this.  I'm paid essentially the same as my sister despite this fact.  In fact, she makes more than me when figuring in some benefits I do not get.  Generally speaking that number is less than $25,000 with no real benefits in a high cost of living area.  The result is me being forced to continue to live at home which is becoming a big issue for me.

Without going into the general dysfunctions of being a family business, my major issue right now is money.  At different times I could justify taking a lower wage to help the family.  The reality is I've simply enabled them for years with no real benefit.  This is further complicated by my parents getting close to retirement and not being properly setup for it.  It leaves me to further enable them.  I've outlined 4 different ways to increase wages and I've been shut down on all 4 and I'm unsure what to do.

1.  Over time I've been told my sister was going to quit.  I would take over her salary and cover her work and it would be a living wage.  That hasn't happened.  It likely will never happen.  She's in it until the end is the best way to put it.  My sister thinks we should sell the business in the next 5-7 years but at that point, we'd both be jobless and 40.  I do not want to be in this position.

2.  Move our business to a location that is less expensive to operate in.  Right now we pay more than we should to operate our business.  At one time we needed the space, we no longer need it.  I have money for a down payment on a property but I need the business to be the tenant in order for the project to work.  The family has unrealistic expectations on what we can afford.  I've found 3 properties that would potentially save us money and allow me to build equity and they shut me down fairly quickly.  Some of their concerns are valid but many are not.

3.  Re-do our budget.  Right now, there is a lack of tracking where the money goes.  We started an experiment last year and tracked one piece of their finances they never did and they were shocked by the dollar amount.  My opinion is simple.  There is money that is being spent by my family that shouldn't be.  If that money wasn't spent, it could go to me instead.  I've also discussed potentially selling our home and moving to a smaller home.  Lowering expenses, thus allowing more money to be funneled to me.  My father will only do napkin calculations and my mother loses her shit any time any of this is suggested.

4.  Increase business.  We could make a push to grab more business.  We don't do a lot of things right in that regard.  We have a bad website, don't market ourselves at all, and have essentially no social media presence.  A lot of this can be done for not a lot of money and my mother and sister definitely have time to do some of these things.  Again, shut down about actually following through with the ideas.  The other big issue is if we get more work, it can become a big deal for no reason.  Although we shouldn't be, we're very close to being at capacity.  I just can't get more work in the shop with the employees we have and not have it cause major issues.  Hiring someone else puts money in their pocket and not mine.

So basically I'm at a loss.  My gut says if I were advising someone else, I'd tell them to get another job and move on.  I'm very very close to being at that point, but then comes the guilt and enabling.",06Mar2018,2
50,"Bit of a long story but I'll try to keep it short:  
I was in mandatory army service, during basic training and we were doing a trench exercise for a few days. I was tired, dehydrated, digging in 45C weather all day..  
There were these arses in my platoon that would bully me incessantly for the past 3 months, but they were assholes to everyone. At night while sitting in the trench I saw their leader running off into the shrubs, probs to piss.  
idk why, but I suddenly felt angry, like angrier than I've ever been in my life, my heartbeat was like 1000 and my head was spinning and I was practically seeing red, I followed him and beat him with a helmet till I calmed down.    
  
This was 6 years ago, the anger came out of nowhere that time, and I've never had something like that happen before or after.  
Whole camp got punished but I never got caught.   

I'm afraid of it happening again, I've rejected so many relationships with girls I was interested in because I'd think ""What if I did it again?"", it came out of nowhere and I don't want to hurt anyone like that again  
I've been through a few anger management courses after, and the instructors there would be surprised every time and wonder why I was there.  
please, I don't want to spend the rest of my life afraid of myself

58,"I took today off as a sort of ""I'm not trying to deal with any teacher's bullshix"" day. Lately, I've been feeling really down and depressed. It's my 4th year without a decent phone. I still only have one friend. I'm still sitting in classes with a bunch of judgmental bastards. It's discouraging. After 7 years of imitating other people to make friends, I finally decide to be myself. Now, I only have about 4 people i talk to in the course of the day. 3 of which I only have one period with. Then, I act myself and no one approves. Yet, I look around and see people acting how I used to act and I see people acting like I do now, only with less confidence but more social skill, and for some reason when they do it, it's all cute and funny but when i do it, it's ""what a weirdo"". 

I guess, basically, I'm fed up. I don't understand how when I'm myself, It's weird, but when I watch other people that arent as funny, interesting, cool, or generally amazing as I am, do the act same things that I've *been* doing, and they're accepted. It's a double standard. I would even call it a race thing. When the white kid is weird and outgoing it's cool. When the brown kid does, It's ""what a freak"" ""what a weirdo"". The white kid can let anything they want come out of their mouth. But, the brown kid has to watch every word he says because if i so much as jokingly say something mean, it's an issue, but if a white kid does it, it's cute and funny.

61,"This is my first time ever going on reddit for advice and first time posting anything in a while but I really value this community’s opinion and wanted to run this by anyone willing to read it.

I started dating this girl off Tinder and we’ve been seeing each other for about a month now. We’ve been on 4 or 5 dates, finally just got the courage to kiss her for the first time (seems like a slow path on this one) but I’ve been struggling with some internal issues underneath that I’m scared to talk with her about. 

I really enjoy my time with her. I didn’t think I would because Tinder seemed so silly but she’s my one interaction that’s carried through for some time now. I don’t want to assume but after plenty of jokes here and there, I believe what we have to be at least somewhat “exclusive.”

Here is my problem:

I have some pretty serious attachment issues from when I was young. It manifests itself now by me throwing myself headfirst into relationships regardless of whether they are good for me, opening up way too soon to someone, and most importantly freaking out over texting behavior and communication distance. What I mean by that is, I have the common concern “if she’s not texting me back right away or leaving me on read, then it’s probably something I did or said and I really screwed up.” I internalize everything and have unrealistic expectations of when she should respond and what it means if she’s not. Even as I write this now, I feel crippled by the fact that she left me on read even though I KNOW she was at work and has a midterm tonight. She left my message about our date we have planned this weekend on read and I can’t help but freak out about it. 

It seems so irrational but this behavior plays out time and time again and seems to only be assuaged once she texts me back and so far, every time I’ve been concerned, it was for no reason and I was just freaking out. Sometimes it will manifest itself into me spamming her phone, watching to see when she reads something, or waking up throughout the night to see if she responded. I know the behavior has to stop and I need to distance myself from the situation. But I’m so worried about telling her of my concerns as we’re not “bf/gf” and I don’t want to scare her away with my attachment issues. But I also am a huge believer in communication. 

I guess my request is simple. Even with the aforementioned information, do I tell her about my tendency to overthink and freak out so she at least knows? Or just figure out a different way of handling it until I feel comfortable enough in
Our relationship where I can just be completely honest?

He’s a very open and very friendly guy. He’s constantly joking and laughing in class and in office hours. He’s always teasing other students and in general having fun with them. With the female students, he’s very soft spoken and constantly smiling with them. However, he doesn’t act that way with me. Like ever. He’s extremely professional with me, and he doesn’t joke around with me. He also doesn’t talk to me in that soft spoken way like he does with the other girls.

He also gave me an extra point on a quiz for no reason. He just doesn’t like me as much as the others/treats me differently for some reason.

TL;DR: I wish it were me and feel like I'll never be happy again. She was 33, I am 29. She's been my best friend for ten years. I doubt anyone will ever understand me or connect with me in the ways that she did. Three years ago, the doctors told us she had about twenty years left, which is why I let myself become absorbed in work and school, to try and reach a place where I could comfortably move back to southern California again and we could ""pick up where we left off."" That was the goal of leaving the state almost six years ago, but once I got here, I found I had resulting PTSD from my last job and had trouble finding steady full-time employment. Everything I did was geared towards getting back to where she was. Now I feel like the past six years were a mistake and my current life is a hopeful lie to myself.

68,"First of all, thank you for reading and for the advice in advance! I could really use it. I am 27 years old, living in Louisiana. I just graduated with my undergrad in biology and am in a Public Administration grad program now. 

I have always known I would like to own a farm, but decided to get both the undergrad and the Masters degree as a fall back. I'm starting to get a little bit antsy, and am ready to begin planning financially. I'd like to start a family soon and same with the farm. As soon as possible. 

Here's the thing, though: I have nearly $40k in student loan debt and bad credit, so I'm at ground zero. I have to build capital, credit, and I have to get a full-time job to do these things. I can go to school and work at the same time, but my first question is, Reddit, is it prudent to continue with the masters degree if I'm just using the job to save for my dream and pay off loans for as many years as it takes to get started. I have seen some financial bloggers who worked off their loans by living frugally on a $30k a year salary and saved to invest and buy property and it feels as if spending money and possibly incurring more debt on a degree I don't intend to use long term is not as good an idea as I once thought. (I plan to start paying for my classes instead of taking out more loans as long as I an get a full time job that allows that this semester.)

Next question: ideas on the best way to pay off the loans and build credit? Public Admin isn't going to make me a ton of cash. I have some management experience and can get great recommendations so I can make a decent salary to live on, and I would prefer to work in the public sector because that's where my heart is. I can live frugally, lord knows I'm doing that now and I'm good with money, so I can save. (We won't go into how I got the bad credit but it wasn't my fault.) I can find a good job in the city I'm living in, but I want to optimize my earnings, so job suggestions are welcome. Resources on saving and paying off debts are also very needed. What has helped you pay off student loans quickly? How did you save up to start your dream on a meager salary?

Next question: ways to learn about organic/CSA farming? I have some farming experience and am a very independent learner. I'm good at asking questions when I need to, finding resources, etc, and the farm doesn't exist yet so I'll cross the more specific bridges when I come to them, but what are your expert opinions on good places to start getting into the farming community? I'm in an urban city right now (New Orleans) and I have access to resources I can start with now, but I don't know where to start! There's the Young Farmer's Coalition, but it isn't active where I live and I don't know any farmers personally. I plan to move to a more rural area right outside the metro area, and could start going to Farmer's Markets in those communities to talk to folks, but if any of you have any suggestions, they're greatly appreciated. 

Last question: Resources on solid planning for a farm?? I'm talking books, blogs, documentaries, but also I don't know the first thing about financing or how much acreage I'd need, how to get a CSA up and running, etc. Are there firms or conferences or organizations out there that will help me in this endeavor?

I am very serious about this dream. It's my life goal and I plan to devote as much time and energy as I can to getting this thing going. I'm at the starting point, but I've done enough in my life to know I'll make it happen, so your advice is going to a cause you can bet will come to fruition. Again, many thanks in advance!

TL;DR: I need advice on paying off student loans, building credit, getting a job in the public sector and getting into farming as a novice in an urban city. I'd like to start an organic CSA!",06Mar2018,2
69,"I'm a sophomore in high school gearing up for my junior year. I got the class 'sign up sheet'  which has us show which classes we want to take next year. One of the options I want to do is welding. I'm in the basic welding class right now.  I want to go into the advanced next year but I'm unsure if I am able to. I have only been in the basic class since the beginning of the semester. I'm almost through all of the required welds though. Since getting into the class I have quickly wanted to make it a career.

My parents on the other hand want me to not do the advanced welding (if I could) and want me to knockout two years of a foreign language class (they say foreign language as if they offer more than Spanish at my high school). Even though it is not required to graduate (it is in turn needed for a Four Year University) they want me to do that to get into a University. Unfortunately I can't see myself getting into one. As of last semester I was ranked at number 150 of a class that had 203 students. 

I have also wanted to go into Firefighting. I am wanting into Wildland Firefighting. If I do that I could fall back onto welding after being laid off after fire season. That way I'm not scraping together unemployment over the winter.  

Long story short I need your guy's opinion on what I should do.",06Mar2018,2
71,"Let me begin by saying that I’m aware that she’s a teenager that does not excuse behaviors. 
     I am a 42 y/o dad to my 17 year old daughter. I love my daughter (both of them I also have a 2 y/o from different moms). I have fought for my daughter since her mom and I got divorced when she was 4. I was awarded emergency temporary custody then temporary custody. She has always wanted to live with me. 
     Her mom took every chance to punish her for me and using her against me. I spent tens of thousands to get every other week and to have the system fight for me as hard as it did for her mom (her mom alienated her older half sister from her bio dad and they have NO relationship)
     I like most parents wanted to be the good dad and let her do as she pleased (I’m pretty laid back in general) as long as no drinking/drugs/sex grades are good. I’m not on her about her room, chores etc. is what I’m referring to as laid back. I wanted her to know at my house she had the freedom to be herself and do as she wanted.
     Two almost 3 years ago her stepdad gave my daughter a hickey on her neck while her mom was in the room with her. I have no doubt it was the worst moment of her life and she pressed charges. She was so strong and brave going through the investigation. I was inspired by her courage and strength and conviction. Her mom stood by her husbands side. Her mom has basically abandoned her and I have full legal and physical custody since. 
     I have provided unconditional love safety and security, she never goes without she’s had everything a teenager could ask for and yet there’s no appreciation. I don’t expect her to worship me. But I just paid off a $1700 senior trip for her, got her her first job so she could earn money. We take her to work and to her bf’s house occasionally(they’ve been together for almost 5 years). 
     She’s unappreciative of what she has. She won’t help out around the house brings her trash down and throws it in front of the van that needs emptied (she gets out of school 3/4 hours before we get home) doesn’t help around the house, Just plays games until 12 every night. Grades are good. But it’s like she’s emotionally detached. Selfish.
     She’s short and disinterested in her little sister who idolizes her and loves her with all of her heart. I’m tired of feeling taken advantage of and plan on making her bills to pay and chores once she turns 18. Until she starts college. 
      I just want her to help out and feel like she cares about us and how much we love and care and provide for her. I know I created this issue but am open minded to thoughts and suggestions. Thanks

74,"I don't know where else to go with this.She's 14 (Going on 15) and I'm 17 and we both live in a very rural, very small town in KY (If that helps at all).

She is constantly abused in her own home. Her father is constantly angry and he's an alcoholic, which leads to a lot of physical abuse. He'll hit her and yell at her and whip her with belts not out of discipline, but because he's angry, and he tries to justify it as discipline. Just the other day she was making jokes at the dinner table so as to not sit in silence and be awkward (And they weren't even dirty jokes) and her little sister was laughing but he just eventually lost it and began to yell and push her against the wall and yell some more. Most of the time he just hits her.

And if it's not her father, it's her mother. Her mother is the one that hit her the night she made jokes. Her hand was also red after it for hitting too hard. And she tries and justifies both his and her actions by saying shit like ""It could be worse"" or ""I know abuse better than you do"" (She was abused by her father but at such a young age she doesn't remember it. She even admitted that) and she downplays how she feels and how scared she is. It leaves my girlfriend feeling trapped and she can't do anything.

She would call child services or something, but she lives in a home with foster kids. She's terrified that if she got taken away, she wouldn't see both her actual sister and her foster sisters, who she cares for like a real relative. She's also scared of being put in custody with other family members cause they're a bit unhinged too. Many of them don't even like her purely for the fact she's bi. She's so scared to call that she's scared that if she does her parents will literally kill her. That or her other crazed relatives.

I hate seeing her like this, and seeing her cry and be hurt all the time and her feeling alone in a house that has six people in it. But she doesn't want me to call child services because she's scared of so many things happening. I don't know what to do or if I even CAN do anything. She wants out but she's terrified.

Recently she got a box of cookies and my brother has been sneaking them (He’s 10). My mom has also been putting them in his lunch. Today she looked at the cookies that originally had 24 and now have 7. She and my dad started screaming at me saying how unhealthy I was and how much of a liar I was. I told them that I only had 3, which was true. They didn’t believe me but they moved on to my brother who basically had the whole box and he said he only had two and that I had given them to him. They turned back to me and took my computer and phone away for the week. I didn’t care because usually it’s a month for little things like feeding my dog too much or making a mess while cooking. She also doesn’t let me close my door at night because she thinks I’m sneaking my phone and texting. One more thing which isn’t that crazy but whatever. She won’t let me have Instagram (I’m 13 and no joke the only one in my grade who’s not allowed to have social media) because my friends made “bad decisions” on it which include doing those survey things about other people like for example: Me or Julia. I don’t blame her for being cautious about this but I’ve told her many times that I’m more mature than them and she knows this. I know taking about this like how I am sounds like I’m 8 or something and I know that compared to my mom there are ways worse parents out there. I also know that she does try to do things for me and I love her but sometimes during these moments I feel like I hate her.

80,"A friend of mine recently told me my text messages are somewhat condescending. I have had this thought before, and tried to avoid it, but I am unsure how really. It seems to me that whether a text reads as condescending or not is largely dependent on an absent tone of voice. Maybe I just have a condescending style of writing? I am feeling paranoid about this now :/

I think emojis can help, but they are not always available as an option I guess. Maybe a smiley face would be too enthusiastic, or misinterpreted as overly friendly. I asked my friend for some specific advice, and she recommended changing my text, 

""I ask because I was going to suggest that you maybe try using it,""

To 

""I ask because I was thinking maybe it could be good/useful for you.""

I was trying to suggest that she use Facebook to keep in contact with people she meets on campus and be more aware of events. I feel that her change is better, but I don't know that it is all that major. It also occurs to me that it may be the nature of my text message which makes it condescending, being that advice can often sound condescending, even if well intentioned.When I asked for more direction she said that I should

""Seriously just text less formally""

Could the formality of my texts be an issue? They are similar to my reddit comments in style and can run a little lengthy.

I know this is ultimately a small thing, but I have struggled with being condescending for much of my life. Early on in grade school I had a reputation of being a know-it-all and have heard complaints about my condescension at various other points in my life, the above being the most recent. I have tried to work at it for a long while, but every time I hear a complaint I feel like all progress has been lost. It makes me feel helpless and incapable of constructive communication.

81,"Hi Reddit - 

I work in IT for a company and have been with this company for about a year and 9 months now.  I worked professionally for another company before this doing IT as well - I'm not a big stranger to office politics and how the ""game"" is played.    



Short backstory - the user is a PITA to most people in the company - she's difficult to work with, needy and not many people in my department like working with her.  However, she and I have fostered a pretty good relationship towards one another and I usually am the one to volunteer to pick up her tickets.    She is also a sales genius, works hundreds of hours per month and is pretty much our number 1 sales person (last year in June she hit her yearly sales target, while other people were struggling to hit their June numbers).  

This past week, my company rolled out a really awful background picture to everyone in the company - we got dozens of tickets complaining about it this morning and this user and I had talked about it earlier today and that a fix was being implemented.   

However, I received an email just a bit ago that has taken me aback and I do not know what to do with it.   She had included my on it, as well as her boss.  I am a non-manager role right now (soon to be promoted to a manager role).  She is a director of Sales and her boss is a Executive VP of Sales - big fish.  

Email:  

&gt; Hi Daefish,  
Thanks for checking in with me again after we talked about this [Crappy Company Background] boondoggle this morning.  It’s confirmed, [Other Office] IT has totally lost it.
I rebooted 2x tonight after IT said they sent out the wallpaper fix and I continue to have this ‘white snowstorm with massive lettering’ (attachment) --- since Friday afternoon.
Hopefully you can help me Tues morning.  I can’t continue to work like this --- my job is hard enough without all these HQ side shows (not you as we discussed).
 
&gt; [User Boss's name here],  
What the heck is going on around here lately?  Do some HQ people not understand some of us are trying to do honest work.  Every five minutes it’s something else thrown our way as a diversion. Also, the person who decided this policy should have enough guts to sign their name to the email rather than hiding behind “[Company Name] IT”. HR does that too -- very irritating. No accountability.  

End Email

I do not know what to do about this.  My initial reaction was to forward it to my boss (direct manager) and his boss (Director of IT) and let them deal with it.  But part of me worries about the fallout from this.  

If I forward this on and she finds out I did, and now is hostile to me, it's going to make my life a living hell at this company.  
If I forward it on and they are REALLY unhappy about it, it could even lead to her being written up or worse.   
If I do nothing and it comes out that I was on this email and did nothing about it, it could end up being bad for me.   
I feel like she crossed a line here - I personally am not offended by this email - I know I did my job and I do my job well and I didn't cause her this issue.  However, this is a pretty inflammatory email to my department (IT) and HR and I'm pretty sure I know how pissed off my Director of IT would be at this email.    
The other thing is, she emailed me with her boss on it - VP of Sales - do I let him handle this and hope he has a conversation with the VP of IT?  I don't know if he will or not.  I just don't know. 

I feel like she put me in a shit position.  I don't appreciate this, I don't like it and I don't want to get anyone in trouble but I don't feel like it's fair to me.  

I do not know what to do Reddit - please help.  This is a potential minefield and I don't want to make the wrong step.

84,"I am a third year student at a university. Last semester I was reported to the school police for sexual harassment against another female student via text messages and social media. I was found responsible for the charges put against me and have been suspended immediately from school for 2 years. This news has devastated me, although what I did was irresponsible and inexcusable I did not intend for her to feel as though she needed to go to the police, but I regret with all my heart that she did.
I want to give a little insight on me, I come from a family that does not like expressing their feelings, so I grew up shoving my feelings and thoughts to the back of my mind. As a result, I became detached to myself and others, I have trouble really expressing myself. For the past year and a half, my family had been going through some rough patch, personally and financially; my parents confided in me theirs problems and their regrets. I was conflicted in my own personal feeling on the issues at hand and on my own personal issues, my grades suffer and my focus and determination dwindled. It came to a point where I was just going through the motions and not really living life, I was stuck daydreaming almost everyday.
I felt hopeless and unsure about my future, I lost motivation and became little antisocial, I was feeling depress about my actions and what consequences they will have on my future but every time I worried or panic my mind would just channel it out and drift to some fantasy or just become blank and not think about anything at all. I was worried and thought about seeking help but was afraid of how my parents and my family would look at me, I knew my parents would support me but I was still afraid that they will feel a certain way about me (it's hard to explain).
This pattern of behaviors and some alcohol led me to text and harass a student without thought of what consequences it will bring. I have apologized and let them know that I regretted it and that I will take responsibility for my actions. However, this does not mean I am thrilled of the decision.
My question to anyone who has gone through something similar or has an insight into my situation, what can I do to move on from this? I am completely devastated, I feel like I am at rock bottom, I'm 20yro and i really cant see anything good coming out of this. I lost friends due to this and I feel like my life is over. I dont mean to whine or excuse myself but I really need an advice on how to pull myself up and try to move forward. What can I do?",06Mar2018,3
85,"Title pretty much sums it up.
So I was on Tinder &amp; I saw this guy that looked really familiar but I couldn’t quite place his face. Regardless, I found him cute &amp; his bio made him seem like a really cool dude so I swiped right. Turns out we matched, but I’m super shy so I tend to not message first. Not to worry though, he messaged me first.
The conversation wasn’t too exciting, just asking how I was &amp; how my day went. Then he asked for my snap, so I gave it to him. Moments later, he added me back, which is where I saw his full name. I instantly recognized him &amp; I felt sick. He’s dating a girl I played rugby with last year up until she broke her collar bone &amp; was out for the season. I don’t know her very well, but the few times I have met her I like her.
Just to make sure I wasn’t jumping to conclusions I went &amp; checked both of their instagram bio’s to see if they had broken up, but unfortunately they’re still together (not unfortunate for me, unfortunate for her). He messaged me over snapchat, asking things like what my body type is &amp; I was having none of it. I asked him point blank if he had a girlfriend &amp; he pulled the “um, what are you talking about?” then proceeded to block me on snapchat &amp; unmatched me on Tinder. Worry not though, I have screenshots of the conversations on both apps.
I know I need to say something to her, just so she knows, but how exactly do I do that? I’m not sure who her ‘friend group’ is, so should I just message her over facebook or something &amp; ask her to meet up with me at some point when she’s free? Is there a way I can do this without absolutely crushing her &amp; ruining her day?
I’m almost certain I’m not the first girl that he’s matched with &amp; messaged, and even though I don’t know her very well I want this girl to know exactly what he’s doing behind her back. Can anyone give me some ideas of just how to do that? Thanks guys.

TL;DR ~ I matched with the boyfriend of a girl I’m not too close with on Tinder &amp; I’m thinking of the best way I can tell her ",06Mar2018,4
86,"So if you want to know a little more backstory on the information, you can read my previous AITA post where I was worried about confronting administration over the issue.

To give you the TLDR version: My school is a victim of a school shooting, and we have had multiple threats about another shooting occurring the first school day after the 20th anniversary. Most of the threats were people screwing around, but we recently had one that was so serious it required police investigation. [(best proof I have while retaining privacy)](http://imgur.com/trna8aK) 

The staff is “doing everything they can” but our school security is horrible. Every classroom has an entrance to the outside that has to be manually locked (leaving many unlocked), and entrances such as the breezeway and gym remain unlocked from the outside. We don’t practice lockdown or active shooter drills at all, and we don’t have student ID’s, uniforms, or any form of identification.

The investigation hasn’t turned much up except for that the threat did not come from a student. After this info came to light, the staff acted like there was no longer any worries. But because strangers can walk into the school anytime (and they have many times before), it doesn’t really matter does it?? 

I simply feel that the school board isn’t taking our fears seriously. I understand downplaying the dangers so students don’t panic, but they seem so naive thus far that it seems like they’re lying to themselves just as much. The previous shooting happened at the middle school, but I still feel that the high school needs extra security too..

We recently had a false shooter alarm. No one was prepared, and they did nothing about it or made any changes. I’m becoming increasingly paranoid that something could happen, despite knowing there’s only a tiny chance. The fact that there is a chance, that seems to be growing greater every day, is causing a lot of tension in the student body.

If someone wanted to pull this stunt, they so easily could. It’s not a matter of “there’s a tiny chance they could pull it off” its: “There’s a tiny chance anyone would actually do it, but if they do it, we’re screwed.”

I can think of a million ways someone could sneak in a gun and pull it on the cafeteria. I live in the midsouth and go to a southern, admittedly redneck school. Kids can get guns if they wanted to. Our last shooting was done by two very young boys with their grandfather’s shotguns. It could happen again.


My mom has already told me I’ve missed too many days this semester (2 or 3) and doesn’t want me taking off unless very necessary. I don’t want to ask to skip, especially because the reason for it feels like a guilt trip. She’s a worrier, so I don’t want to take advantage of that. But I am genuinely scared that something could happen, despite the small chance.

97,"Hey, Reddit. I'm (18f) a student attending post secondary school in a town that is notorious for the lack of rentals. I was able to get a room rental in a house this September with my boyfriend (19m), sharing it with another lady (37f) who initially has the lease for it. We are renting month to month, and only asked for a one month notice should we decide to leave. It was agreed to be a short term rental (no written agreements were done), since she was asked to leave by Jan 31 by the landlord, who lives a couple houses down. The reason he asked her to leave was because she has roommates moving in and out constantly (she can't afford it on her own). However, she didn't move out by Jan 31 and we are still living in said house. She justified it because it is only a legal requirement to move out if he gives a written request (which he has not). I graduate in mid April so my boyfriend and I were planning to give our notice soon. However, this evening she spoke to me about wanting a two month notice instead, and that if we leave she will have to move out of her home (she's lived in it for years) and give away her puppy she recently adopted, as well as threatening unsettling behaviour due to the stress. My boyfriend and I are in a dilemma since she isn't financially stable, has two dogs now, and has no family or friends to turn to. However, my boyfriend and I cannot stay here any longer. She has shown disturbing and harsh behaviour around us and made us very uncomfortable for the time we have been here. I have anxiety attacks daily living at this place because of her and avoid being at this home I'm paying rent for. I I don't feel safe living in the house after giving a one month notice, let alone two. This short of notice for two month request and the emotional baggage has me stressed out to the point I can't focus on school or anything. I was planning to go to a good job in another town after school but I can't if she wants us to stay. I want to move on with my life, but I don't want her to suffer for it. What do I do. Thank you.",06Mar2018,2
98,"My Latin girlfriend is, to be frank, materialistic to the core. She loves lavish gifts and I love to spoil my woman. I’m a successful businessman so money really isn’t a big deal for me. But with my busy schedule and constant focus on my work, I find it hard to keep a woman. So, during my vacation, I signed up for a Latin international dating social event to increase my chances in finding someone. I thought to myself that if things don’t work out between us then at least I can always try something else and charge it to experience. But luckily (and surprisingly) enough I met a Latin woman from Costa Rica and we’ve been together for a year now. Aside from the material things I normally buy for her, I want to surprise her with something new and straight from the heart rather than my wallet. I was thinking of surprising her at her place and bring her back with me to the States to move in with me. What should I do? Is this a good idea, or should I start out with something smaller?

However, recently communication has been poor and it has been hard for me to even meet up with the kid. I either communicate with the kid or the dad. Whenever I text the dad recently, he has been not giving me a response or he just says okay and then the kid is not there when I arrive.

I've tried contacting the kid through Facebook, but he has not been online. I tried contacting his cell phone, but it was taken away from him by his dad.

111,"So I have a dilemma. I am from Oklahoma, my entire family lives here and has always lived here. About two years ago my dad decided to apply for a job at a church in Arizona for no reason other than he liked the weather there. Well he got the job and him and my mom and younger brother(10) and sister(15) moved out there two years ago. I, being an 18 year old, decided to stay in Oklahoma because I had a boyfriend and my whole life was here. Long story short, I moved in with my boyfriend and we broke up last August so I moved in with my grandparents and that didn’t work out very well so I went to stay with my parents for a while until I got things figured out. So I moved to Arizona in September, planned on coming back in January but decided I really liked it there, I had made good friends and felt like I got a fresh start and it was really nice. Well, I was working at Target seasonally and they ended my seasonal position a few weeks after I decided (and told them) I was planning on staying. The day after I found out, I got an email about a job I had applied to back in September asking to schedule an interview. The job and interview were in Oklahoma but they were going to be opening a location in Arizona soon, so I explained my situation to them and they told me if I wanted to start out in Oklahoma that I could transfer when the shop in Arizona opened. I agreed to this, flew to OK for a week to do interview and such, came back to AZ to pack up all my stuff and move back. I moved back in with my grandparents and it’s been going really well with them but it’s everything else that’s gone wrong. I found out that they hired a full team for the AZ store and already opened so they basically forgot about me even though I kept in touch and kept asking about it. I am now frustrated because no one can answer if/when I am going to be able to transfer and I have plans that I had made that I would like to get back to AZ for. Also, all of the friends I still have in OK (lost a lot of “friends” when I broke up with my boyfriend) I don’t get to see much because we all are busy with jobs and school and such. I honestly feel like I talked to them more when I was in AZ. I just feel really lonely and have been very depressed since I’ve moved back to OK. The only reason I did it was because this job pays extremely well, not something I’d be able to get anywhere else with my experience and education. But, I really don’t even like my job. I just could use the money to pay off some debt and get in a good place financially. I’ve applied for some jobs in AZ within the past few days, but am needing to get back before April 8th to watch my brother and sister while my parents are out of town for work. So I guess my question is do I just quite my job and move back and hope I find another job quickly or do I take a week off of work, fly out there for a week to watch the kids, and come back to this job I don’t like and wait to be able to transfer? I’ve honestly never been happier than when I was in AZ but I really keep going back and forth and am not sure where I am supposed to be. There are pros and cons to both. I feel like if I could just get out of this funk I’m in and try to enjoy my time in OK more, I’d be having a better time here. I’m just not sure what to do or where I’m supposed to be. ",06Mar2018,3

113,"So I am 19, working full time and my sister goes to high school, she has 3 months left but she does all these activities and AP classes. She got accepted into some really great schools so far.

Anyways, I took life for granted a few years ago and didn't feel like I needed my license.

Now, I am 19 and have been lyfting to work or riding a bike 10 miles 10 miles there and back.

I am either financially or physically exhausted getting to work, I have money for a downpayment on a car ready for when I do acquire my license.

My sister has to get up for the bus around 5:30, goes to school and starts at 7:30, and doesn't get home until around 6:30.

I KNOW how to drive, I just need to perfect braking and turning. I also need to learn how to reverse on a curb.

I took it early February, that is why I failed. My friend took me, but due to circumstances he can no longer help me nor take me, he wishes he could.

Look, I know saying sorry or that I felt bad fixes me being a dipshit, but not a single friend or family member wants to help my sister ""haha that sucks"" or ""Gotta do what you gotta do, you know?"" But that's so easy for them to say, they didn't lose the person they depended on emotionally, financially, and mentally. 

I know I am on a rant, but getting a license would change our lives.

I looked at driving schools, but I am afraid they won't tell me if I am really improving or not just to charge me for more lessons, or if they'd let me go over just what I want.

Even if I somehow get to do this, I still don't have a car for the actual test. I can't rent one from the DMV, everyone I know says they can't or straight up doesn't trust my driving.

I would honestly commit suicide, if it weren't for my sister.

So right now my issues are:

1. Learning to perfect my driving
2. Having a car for the test

What do I do? My life is basically getting paid $850 every two weeks to pay it towards bills, lyfts, food with little to none leftover. Thankfully my tax refund came in as a downpayment for the future.

Honestly, you can be harsh and call me a dumbass for slacking on getting it. I just need advice on what to do after you say that.

114,"Alright. So this is gonna be a wall of text. 

This story has to do with three people. Mitch, Brandon, and Brittany. Let’s get some back story going. I’m going to type in third person to hopefully avoid any confusion. 

Mitch and Brandon are best friends. Have been for years. Pretty strong friendship, been through a lot together. In a band together. Mitch and Brandon are mutual friends with Brittany. Brittany has been in the friend group for a while. Brittany is recently single from a three year relationship, not looking to date, just being herself for a while, nothing serious. 

Brandon knows that Mitch used to take a liking to Brittany when they first met, but he was always locked out because of Brittany’s relationship. Brandon takes a liking to Brittany, thinks he might like to casually date her, not for sure. Anyway, on a night where Brandon, Mitch, and Brittany are about to go out with the group for drinks, Brandon has a sober conversation with Mitch before they head out. Brandon says to Mitch he might be interested in Brittany, at least casually dating her. Mitch says he doesn’t care, Brandon can do as he pleases. The night goes off without a hitch, nothing is ever brought up about the subject. 

Brandon decides after a couple casual group hang outs and a match on Tinder(which he told Mitch about), he doesn’t want to casually date Brittany, but if she wanted to get together for a night of fun, he wouldn’t say no. Brandon tells Mitch he has stopped perusing anything with her.

Months go by. Nothing happens. The subject is never talked about again between Mitch and Brandon. Not a word. Brittany is still single, living it up, still regularly hanging around Mitch and Brandon. Sounds regular so far? Here’s the turn. 

It’s a Saturday night. The gang is out at a bar. Brittany had a ride, but, the ride had to go home, they weren’t feeling too good. Mitch agrees to take her home, no big deal, that’s what friends do. Couple hours pass, and a move to a different bar. Mitch brings Brittany, Brandon has his own vehicle. 

Spend a little while at the next bar, and then it’s last call and closing time. The group all start to go their different ways. Brittany turns to Brandon, asks him what his plans are. Brandon says he’s gonna head home, he’s pretty tired. Brittany asks if she can come with? Sure, Brandon doesn’t care, knowing from his conversation months ago, that Mitch won’t be bothered by it. Brittany says that she’s gotta go get her stuff from Mitch’s car. Brandon says ok, I’ll be in my car. Brittany gets her stuff, tells Mitch she’s going to Brandon’s. Heads to Brandon’s car. Mitch gets in his car and starts it up. Brandon is waiting for Brittany, she hops in, and off they go to Brandon’s house. They have a good romp in the hay. 

Brandon receives a “fuck you” text from Mitch.  A little confused, he tells Brittany about it. She checks her phone. Similar text. Brittany then explains that she had drunkly slept with Mitch about three weeks prior. 

Great. Brandon is in a position. A rough one. He now gets why Mitch is mad, but not sure why Mitch is mad at *him*, and not Brittany. 

Brittany explains that she told Mitch it meant nothing, and was a one time occurrence, and that he had understood that it was a one time occurrence. Brittany and Brandon go to sleep. Nothing that can do about the situation at this time of the morning. The next day, Brandon and Brittany talk more, decide that Mitch clearly thought more was going to happen between he and Brittany, but Brandon didn’t know that to decide the night before not to take Brittany home. Ten hours after receiving the text from Mitch, Brandon sends a text back to Mitch, “what did I do?” Brittany apologizes for putting him in this situation. Brandon takes Brittany home.

Mitch does not respond to Brandon for 31 hours. When Mitch finally does respond it says “you knew I had feelings for her, you waited till I had to leave? I’ve learned I can’t trust you to do the right thing. You’re out of the band. Get your stuff sometime when I don’t have to see your face.”

Brandon explains he remembers that conversation between he and Mitch. Where Mitch said he didn’t care if Brandon went after Brittany. Mitch says the friendship is over, he doesn’t want to see Brandon again. Brandon does not reveal to Mitch he knows that Brittany and Mitch slept together. He thinks that needs to be done in person, and with a third party present. 

What does Brandon do? How does Brandon get Mitch to: 
-calm down
-believe him
-repair the damage that may be done to their friendship

115,I have a very close friend of mine whose got a very bad habit which is gambling. This only started to get worse about two years ago.

There are a few cliques already formed and it seems like most of the class have already hit it off and are getting along. I've tried talking to them but the instant classes end, everyone disperses. I've made a few acquaintances but no actual friends yet and I'm feeling pretty low. I've never really had any trouble making friends in the past, and I really miss home.

I'm pretty quiet, so I mainly just sit and take notes in class but I do participate in discussions, and always contribute during group discussions.

117,"So the fact is I have the funds to buy more expensive things than others. I never try to brag about my spending or show it off. I try to be as humble as possible and never talk about buying expensive things. The problem is if I buy something, and my friends see it (which is inevitable for most items), they'll either already know the price cause it's a popular product, or they'll ask how much it was. The reactions I always get are things like ""Why did you buy something so overpriced?"", ""You're wasting money man"". Overall they seem disappointed in me and think I don't have financial responsibility. I understand their concerns since they're not in the same situation as I am, but I'm just spending money that I earned myself, and I'm buying things that are within my spendable range.

I was texting her a day ago and then she ignored it for no reason I know of. She hasn’t texted back but has been off and online all the time. I haven’t texted back after the text she ignored because that would be bad, got to play smart. I know she is playing a game with me, testing me to see how I handle it. I realised I have been a bit to needy as of lately (showing to much interest) so I’m backing off now and giving her a break. I have picked up on that she does have a low self-value, she doesn’t see how someone like me could like her. I think this might have something to do with me being interest in her a lot recently and the whole situation. but I can’t work it out. So, should I just leave it up to her if she wants me? wait for her to text me or is she wanted me to fight for her and text her? I hate this part of the game I’ll fucked up here before, never again though! I’m not giving up on this girl but I don’t know how to tell/show her that. 

I feel like I need to act almost uninterested in her cause she knows I’m interested.
I have a few options to try. 1. Text her in a week if she doesn’t reply… “I hate it when girls play games, do you want to talk and work things out or I’m just going to assume you’re not interested in me anymore. 2. Wait until she texts me again and when she does be myself like it never happened? 3. text her something on the lines of I don’t want to lose you, because I value you.

I worry about what a future partner would think of me having these, and that my guilt will prevent me from branching out to anything beyond missionary sex, because lately I've found that even thinking about other sex positions while masturbating makes me feel guilty.

So I have no one the last friend I had I don’t talk to anymore because we’re both always just so busy. So I literally have my bf and that’s it. So when fights and shit happen then I feel completely alone. It really hurts my heart. He gets annoyed with me for everything. And I am so tired of getting hurt or being told I am a bitch or I am mean that I have been made into this meek little freak. I am always apologizing for everything and he can’t stand it.

Or everything I haven’t done today. It’s horrible. I am constantly getting yelled at. I feel defeated when I get yelled at. There is no such thing as a normal conversation between us anymore. Everything turns negative eventually. Because he says something really arrogant that really hurts and then I try to defend myself and the circle just goes round and round. I want to get through this shit so I like to talk through my problems find a solution apply it and be done. Move on. But him no he likes things to just happen when they happen.

124,"As any typical he broke my heart story, I’m here needing the advice or assurance of what is the right thing to do even though it’s pretty clear. 

I’m 20 years old and I met him when we first entered high school. I’ve never been with anyone before this point. He was my best friend. He wasn’t the most popular but fell for one of the popular girls. As your typical best friend I helped him get her but it was pretty obvious to everyone, including her there was something there between us. As his status started to raise, mine stayed the same as the quiet girl who wasn’t the prettiest, nor ugliest but was his best friend. We spent every night talking on the phone but eventually I wasn’t the only one who he would talk to. With status, came looks and came all the girls admiring him. He became the biggest flirt throughout the grade. It was hurtful knowing he was like that to everyone but I knew there would come a day. When he turned 16 his parents gave him a car despite not having a license and being his best friend, I was the first person he picked up. That day I got my first kiss and I knew my time with him would come even though I wasn’t anything what he was looking for (pretty, popular, etc). He continued to talk to multiple girls but would kiss me any chance he got in his car. One day he picked me up from school and we lost our virginities together which wasn’t ideally how I thought I’d lose it (not in the back of a car to a guy who I wasn’t dating). Next day came around and he told me to keep it as a secret because he didn’t want the other girls knowing but obviously it got out and he ignored me for awhile. He was ashamed people knew it was me who he lost his virginity to... but it didn’t take long for the guys to congratulate him making it okay again. Prom came around and I was so sure he’d ask me considering since his mom suggested that he should but of course at the after prom party which was held at his house, he was with someone else. That summer we still spent everyday together and I met all his family. With so much hope in my heart I was sure he would ask me to be his and finally the day did come. With all the bullshit I went through with girls calling me names and crying every time I heard he was with someone else, I knew it was all worth it. We dated for a few months and those were the happiest months of my life. I don’t come from much and I don’t have a lot of family but he made me feel like I had the world when I was with him. For once I knew what love was. As a guy he couldn’t stay faithful for long and broke up with me so he could live the single life again. I was still with him everyday doing everything for him despite the title. I was still the person he came running back to every time it didn’t work out with a new girl. Eventually  we dated again and this time I was so sure to prove myself again. I did it all for him even though he was never around and always out with friends partying. I would stay at his house for hours waiting for him to come home so I can see him for those 20mins before he fell asleep. Despite being an outgoing individual he always made time for his education and to help his parents with their business. At that point I wasn’t in school because I didn’t know what to do with my life (I always felt like a bum for not being in school and not being as successful as he was). To show him my appreciation for him I saved up as much money as I could and borrowed the rest from a friend to buy us a trip to Cuba for his birthday. He was so happy when I told him but 2 months later he broke up with me again. As usually I was still over at his house everyday being a girlfriend without the girlfriend title. He promised that no matter what he would still go on the trip with me. Day before we were to leave he told me he wasn’t going to go because he wanted to impress a girl. The next day came and I cried my eyes out but still hopped on that plane. I cried everyday in Cuba and was so sure that i was done. I came back home and that night he came to visit me. There’s always been something about us that always draws us together no matter how bad it had been. He continued to talk to girls while I remained trying to get him back. Last year he met a new girl and she made it clear he had to cut me out of his life if he wanted to be with her. He tried to but I could see he felt bad because we had been apart of each other’s lives for 6 years now. She would constantly send me threatening messages or follow me when she saw me driving. The day of his college graduation he invited me but as soon as she saw I was there she called the cops on me trying to get me arrested. I’ve spent the past year waiting for him to call me whenever he got a chance to not being around her. He continued to tell me about his life and problems with her and I helped him with all of it. I’m not saying this because I’m jealous of her but she isn’t the greatest of people. She’s a rich girl who thinks she is entitled to many things and can step on whomever she pleases. She got pregnant 3 times being with him. First time she got an abortion because she wasn’t sure if it was his child or someone else’s. Second time an abortion. Now third time is the charm because they decided to keep it. He’s expressed to me he didn’t want to keep it because they constantly fight in their relationship and feels like she makes herself pregnant so he can’t leave her. On Valentine’s Day he posted an official photo announcing he will be a father (when I was with him he would never post photos of me.. I guess because I’m not “pretty” enough). My heart dropped seeing the photo. I didn’t think he would keep it because he was still sleeping with me (I know it’s horrible I still engaged in sex despite him having a girlfriend). Now I don’t know what to do with myself. He got her a ring and they plan on buying a house soon all at the age of 20. I love him with all my heart and I thought there was something noble about wanting to be with a woman who has only ever loved and been with you. She’s wild and not the type you’d marry but yet treats her like god. I believe he loves her but I know he still loves me too. I just don’t get why he chose her and this lifestyle over me. I can’t help but to think because I wasn’t good enough. I can’t simple walk away either and not talk to him if I know he still loves me. 

Sorry for being so long but this is the shortest version I could type. I’ve been through a lot of shit fighting for him and I don’t want to give up fighting for him now if I believe he still loves me but I also know it is wrong if he has a baby on the way due in a couple of months. Someone give me some guidance. I know I’m still young and I have the rest of my life ahead of me to find someone but I want him. ",06Mar2018,3

126,"When I was younger about 4 years ago i was 13 years old. I was given an option by my mother. it’s either I stay with her and give up everything. like being able to eat good food, buying good things, good education (transferring from private to public), a comfortable home etc.. or I go with my grandmother and get to keep all of those things. For a year I got to experience what it was like with my mom. Life was hard. We were relying on the money we had in our bank and we had to be careful with our money or else we’d have nothing to eat. The monthly dues were tough, the daily maintenance was tough and her having no job would add up to it more. Another option I was presented with was to live with my grandma. That meant i’d get to keep everything for the expense of being mentally exhausted. My aunt has schizophrenia and my other aunt and uncle are abusive. Ultimately my mother made the choice to give me to my grandmother. It was one of the worst times in my life. I’d go home, lonely, unloved but i’d have a full stomach and all the materialistic things I wanted. This went on for 3 years while my mom tried to look for a job in another country. After 3 years my mom came back and somehow I grew a grudge. I didn’t feel love eminating from her anymore. I only felt a sense of responsibility or guilt coming out from her. She’d give me anything i’d want, but in turn she’d use that against me as well. We’d often get into fights, she’s always tempered, pissed, blamed for everything, gets mad at small things and it happened again. This time she left me with my grandma again. she didn’t give me, she left me. She was sick of it, she was sick of me. Sick of me turning into a depressed pessimistic person. She was wondering why it couldn’t be the same way it was before. It’s my 3rd day without her today. I can’t help but to think about it. The most striking words she’d said was i’d never see her again. I love my mom, but it’s just that i’m greatly hurt.

Note: I don’t live with my dad/ have any form of communication with him because he kinda cut me off. he’s living with his new wife right now and I hope they’re happy. I just hope my mom is safe and doing well wherever she is now. I’m 16 now.",06Mar2018,4

130,"Been living underneath 4 stomping superstars for a little over six months.

132,"Hey everyone, the biggest change in my entire life is happening/has happened recently and I have found myself to be more unhappy than I have been in while. It's a long story and a lot bares to be explained so I'll give it my best:

About five months ago I finished high school. For the longest time I felt so trapped in high school and wanted to leave so I could finally leave behind those I disliked, do what I wanted and interact with people I wanted. When the time came and it actually ended, I must admit I felt somewhat empty and lost, but quickly with my friends, and more specifically my girlfriend, I found myself over this feeling relatively quickly.

Life went on for a few months and the relationship with my girlfriend began to diminish quickly. For a while I knew I had began to fall out of love with her, as I found myself not wanting to spend time with her, and feeling like more time alone or with friends, etc. I decided that I would break up with her after the transition between high school and university so it would be smoother for the both of us and we would be ready to move on. Much to my surprise, she ended up saying we should break up with me, and I had no denial and said I think so to, and it had ended. (I know we can focus on the fact I kept her around so it would be smoother for me, etc but I realise that was wrong and blah blah, that's not the issue.)
There's a whole other story behind that relationship, but I'll refrain from blasting that at you too. But fundamentally we dated for almost two years and she was VERY in love with me, at the beginning of it I had helped her get through her anxiety and depression, and stuff like that. After that stage we were like best friends, and she would say stuff like ""I always want you in my life"" and ""I'll never get over you"" and ""We're meant to be together"". This impacted me so much as of course it was my first girlfriend and I just wanted to see how it went, etc because the truth was I didn't know what I want as I had never had anyone before. Of course because of this it surprised me extensively when she ended up bringing ending it herself. Although she did the sweetest of things, I had always wanted something different, like having her text me a cute message in the morning, or be diplomatic in arguments, or just ask how my day was, but she never really improved for me, and I was constantly improving for her. Maybe all the 'sweet' things she did made her feel like she didn't have to improve. Anyway it was over.

And here comes the now. After that I didn't find myself extremely hurt, although I was somewhat hurt, which I hate because i wanted it over, but I am fully aware she wasn't the one for me and I fell out of love with her. For some reason though, currently, and for the past couple of months since the breakup, I have found myself in a somewhat uncontrollable state - not physically but mentally. It varies but I have come to realise every day I feel different in some negative way. For example some days I wake up and only feel empty without a girlfriend and feel like no one would ever love me like that, and I couldn't help but focus on all the good memories I had with her, despite all the bad, the good was all that was there. Other days I have been lonely and I have found myself feeling like I don't have any friends, (I do by the way I have a few good and decent friends), and basically feel like I am isolated. Other times I just feel like the change is too much to handle and I'm not going to find better friends or feel like my life will be complete without school. Anyway as these feelings are happening by the time night hits or some other time, I tend to find myself over it, or in a state of happiness like I had finally come to terms with everything, but then when the next morning hits, some other negative feeling hits. It's like a cycle.

Furthermore, I have come to realise it appears to be my memory has an extreme impact on this. When I am home and not talking to someone or am not preoccupied, without my initiation my mind will bring up old memories. For example it was just the other day when I chilling playing some Playstation and all of a sudden I got up to get a drink and as I left the room a random happy memory of my ex hit me like a tonne of bricks. What's annoying is that some of these memories weren't even that relevant or serious happy moments, they would just be like the times I went to her netball games and stuff.

Overall I'm just stuck in this strange and uncomfortable state that I don't know how to escape. Maybe it'll go with time? I don't know I'm just so lost, confused and uncomfortable, everything seems to be so out of place and I want to feel normal again. Please help with whatever advice you can, I'd greatly appreciate any form of discussion or knowledge.

Just for some further context to help you understand my current life: I am currently in university and am literally studying my passion, which is another reason I'm so confused I'm sad. I have only been there for one week as of writing this, and I have found some people who are friendly and I hope I can form relationships with, but I'm struggling to feel as if I'll ever get another close friend again. Also I have not been indulging myself in any drugs or alcohol and have actually been very fixated on improving myself by learning more, trying to control my emotions (which I drastically need help with) and have been trying SO hard to develop a positive outlook, but I'm severely struggling. Another thing to note is I am 18 but I don;t have my license yet, and I not all of my close friends are 18 so I haven't gone partying or anything yet. Also most of my friends are quite introverted so they don't go out of their way to arrange stuff, etc. In regards to the memories, I have had a close (about 12 year) friend of mine drift away from me and we are no longer friends, however I do not feel the form of anxiety that I get from memories of my ex, etc. with memories of him, which is strange? Also when just last night, when I finally felt free of memories from my ex, I actually had a dream about her (nothing too interesting) but that had an impact on my mood and memories today too, which is a massive pain!

P.S Thank you so much and I am so sorry for the extremely long statement, I hope it's not too long. Also If you do NOT believe I have posted this in the appropriate SubReddit or believe it would be better in another SubReddit and/or even a whole other forum then please let me know, I just posted it here because I had to get it out.",06Mar2018,1

136,"I've been mulling about this for a very long time. For context, I'm still in high school.

I used to have a somewhat close friend named A. Somewhat close as in we could make decent small talk and make fun of each other, but we weren't close enough to truly connect emotionally. I always felt as though A didn't try very hard in the friendship--as in, I'd always message her first and she'd only message me for homework, little things like that. In our trio, I felt like the odd one out, because she and my other friend would often share things with each other and leave me feeling excluded even when I tried to join in. We'd often partner up with each other for class projects and I thought we worked great together, because we'd share the work equally. This is important to the story.

In calculus class, we had to do a project. It was a very time-consuming, difficult project, and A and I worked on it together at her house. I felt that we both split the work fairly equally and I worked really hard to make the project perfect, but then I screwed up big time on a portion of the project, and had to rush to her house in the middle of the night to beg her for help. We did finish the project on time, but she held a grudge against me for making her do my portion of the project.

Fast forward to a year later, in a club project, I discovered that she formed a team with two other people and completely excluded me. Having been so used to teaming up with her, I felt extremely hurt and wondered what I must've done. I messaged her personally, and she delivered a mini diatribe about how difficult it was to talk to me, how she had to clean up after me that night we worked on the calculus project, and how unreliable of a group member I am. She said frustration built up not only over a single event, but over the years, because I would often use her house for projects without her permission. However, there have been other friends who've also used her house for the same exact projects, and she didn't get angry with them?? If she spoke up to tell us she didn't want us to use her house, I'd have been more than fine to go to the library. Also, she's never tried to maintain conversation with me, so how is it difficult for HER to talk to ME when she's never tried???? I've also worked on multiple projects with her, and we were fine and dandy with all of those. Why cut ties with me over a single project I clearly unintentionally screwed up on?

I spoke with another friend about this, and the conclusion is that she never really thought of me as a friend in the first place, and the calculus project was just the tipping point she needed to cut me out of her life. After this, I felt so upset with the whole ordeal I simply stopped talking to A; she doesn't seem to care and has not tried speaking to me once. It's been almost three months over the incident and I still can't get over losing her as a friend.

So my question is: any advice on how to get over this, maybe things I should've done differently or should do differently in the future to avoid this? I want to hate her, but there's just this nagging feeling that I did something wrong. ",06Mar2018,2
137,"I had a friend who I was super close with. At the beginning of this year, a project came up and put immense stress on me, and I tried to vent to said friend, who was by far my closest friend. They aren't very good at social ques or consolidation, so I could never initiate it and never offloaded my problems. Because my problems were never resolved, I became very negative (sad and depressed) and my friend saw this as my rejection of them, and they started to become stressed. This resulted in a downward spiral where now my focus shifted to them and I started noticing them ignoring my texts, until eventually they only talked to me when absolutely necessary. (This was because I was stressed about them and became clingy because I thought every action they took was them disliking me)

I don't believe anyone was in the absolute wrong for that, although I could be wrong, but it was this that really got to me. So obviously being kicked when down hurt, and I've been very anxious and upset the past month, but I took comfort in my other friends. Due to being in close proximity to this person nearly every day with no way to avoid such, I just had to try and deal with it (I should mention all my friends are friends with them as well). But now, just recently, I found out that another one of my close friends has been secretly skyping with them and excluding me from such. I would be less offended if it wasn't a group of 3 doing this, and the fact that I explicitly asked if anything like this was happening and was lied to hurts as well.

I haven't done anything yet, and advice would be appreciated.

138,"Hi, I'm not sure this is the best place to post this but it's something I'm really struggling with and really wanted some non-bias opinions on...
I've been with the girl I love for the last 8 years, and we've had a lot of ups and downs, and I’ve had many doubts along the way (as does everyone), but we've always got through it. 

I'm an entrepreneur, and don't have quite the same stability in life as most at current; I face a fair amount of pressure, and the next few years of my life is looking pretty unpredictable. As I’m sure anyone else who’s started their own businesses can appreciate, in 3 years a huge amount can change. 

Now at age 26, the one I love has said that she really wants to have kids and get married within the next 3 years, and if I cannot provide/guarantee that, then essentially we can’t continue, as that’s something she needs within that time frame…

Now I’d love to have kids, without a doubt. However right now I’m not ready for that, and I really don’t know what I’ll feel in 3 years time or where my work will take me. While I’d like to have kids in the next 5-6 years, 3 is certainly a lot quicker than I would ideally want.
Additionally with numerous health issues myself, there is always that concern of what if that is passed on… That wouldn’t put me off children, but it would mean my life would need to become about any potential children, not work.

I’m really stuck, how can you predict how you’ll feel or where you’ll be in 3 years… But do I really want to lose the person who’s stood by me for 8 for the sake of a bit more time to get to where I want to be personally…  

Maybe I’m being selfish and maybe to some this is a simple decision. But I’m really not sure what to do, so I hoped a bit of unbiased advice may help me work out what I think.

Any feedback is really appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

140,"TLDR: Stuck up for a young girl who was getting harassed on a bus, I was threatened to be shot. I didn't see a gun and was not shot. Do I file a police report?


I was riding a city bus yesterday afternoon home from work. A man sat in the seat next to me and started hitting on a teenage girl, who made it VERY clear she was not interested in him and to leave her alone. This turned into a yelling match between them that went on for over 5 minutes. The girl was literally screaming at this guy, and the bus driver did nothing about it. On every other bus I had been on, drivers don't let this kind of thing go on and tell them to shut up or get off the bus. That didn't happen. And I know for a fact that the driver heard it, because EVERYONE on the bus was tuning in - even the people standing up front next to the driver.


After being rejected by this girl, he starts saying she isn't even that cute, how he has all this money and a fat wallet (and then pulls out his wallet and starts waving it at her), all this money in the bank, is wearing 12,000 dollars in jewelry, etc, and how this girl ""ain't shit.""


It was a really gross situation. As a 27F who has been in similar harassment situations in the past, I felt awful for the girl. And since I was sitting next to him, I told him ""Act like the grown-ass man you claim to be and leave her alone.""


Then it escalated to him saying something along the lines of ""Shut the fuck up bitch, why am I even sitting next to your ugly fat ass?"" He got up and moved to a seat across the aisle but one row behind me, berating me and how I looked and threatened to shoot me a few times. I said ""go ahead, do it!"" 


He continued to verbally abuse and belittle me, and a couple of his buddies even chimed in and started doing it to me, too. And he continued to say in so many slang ways about how he could/would shoot me. So I asked rather loudly, ""Are you threatening to shoot me? Should I call the police?"" and took my phone out of my pocket.


All of a sudden, everyone - including the girl who was being harassed that I initially spoke up for - was like, ""ARE YOU CRAZY? DON'T CALL THE POLICE! We're black and they're gonna take your side 'cause you're white! This is some Black Lives Matter shit!""


So I didn't call the police and just sat through 20 minutes of verbal abuse. I smiled at him, not breaking eye contact, saying ""Mhmm, you're right. Tell me more. Show me how creative you are. What else you got?"" I think that eventually got to him, because his face went blank and he paused, and he said ""Naww, I'm not playing into this."" He eventually got off the bus, still lingering and being verbally abusive to me as he was getting off. One of the people near the front of the bus next to the driver said ""Who needs TV when you got this? Better than Jerry Springer!""


After he got off the bus, no one said another word to me. I got off 3 stops early to take the long way home just in case I would be followed. I felt a deep pit in my stomace like I was going to throw up and started shaking and sobbing. I've never been in a situation like that and I guess it hit me harder than I thought it would have.


I just feel sick about it. My anxiety is through the roof and I haven't been able to work or sleep or do anything since. I don't think it's right that he threatened to shoot me, idle threats or not. But I also don't want to potentially put someones life at risk because of the color of their skin.

141,"Yeah, as the title says I'm really in need of advice for the relationship between me and my friend (Please keep in mind I'm actually still in school and I'm prone to making extremely bad decisions, before this incident at least). So, around a year ago, I was fucking around with my friend on a chatting app and he and someone else lets say ""B"" made a joke about some dudes dick size (we'll call him ""A"") and me being the absolute fucktard I am asked ""A"" about it but did not mention the names of my friend and the other one. After this, I didn't hear about it for around an hour until he left the group chat and told me to fuck off. I was confused at the time but when I found out that he got suspended I apologised repeatedly and offered to go to his school (he switched schools just the year prior) and fess up but he just purely told me to fuck off. Fast forward about a week and we sorted everything out god knows how, after around a month or two I sent ""B"" a message and apologised to ""B"" for everything and she said it was all cool. So another fast forward to right now, my friend just cussed me out telling me to kill myself and a bunch of other vulgar things and when I asked why he told me it was because I talked to ""B"". I explained to him that I only apologised to her but he would just keeping saying ""Fuck you"" or he would tell me to kill myself, what should I do? ",06Mar2018,1

144,"A few years ago, I fell in love with a guy and around 6 months after meeting him, we formed a close romantic relationship. This relationship started after he asked me out to prom, which I accepted. He kissed me in the bathroom, considering our school is pretty small and will make a big deal out of nothing. The kiss went a bit far, though, because making out in a public school dance wasn't my brightest moment, but I don't regret a second of it. We got caught by a chaperone, and was kicked out of the dance. Then, rumors started to fly about what 'went down' in the bathroom. Typically, no one would care, but a school with only around 40 people are desperate for student drama. 

This obviously made me and my boyfriend uncomfortable, but we brushed it off after a few weeks, as the drama subsided. Then, he asked to talk to me behind the school, which I accepted. We talked for an hour or two, catching up with each other, and we kissed for only around 20 seconds, before a girl walked over and yelled ""oh my god"" before running off. 

Ever since, we've been getting rumors- false and true. Here are some examples-

-having sex behind the school (we were kissing)
-having sex in general (yes, but I don't know how people found this out)
-rape rumors (completely not true)
-”sucking him off in the school shed“ (no)

145,"So, usually I can think of some logical answer but this is driving me crazy. I need advice on all of thr complaints that'll follow. 
My husband's 17 year cousin just moved in with us and our 10 month old baby. We drive her to school everyday and pick her up in order to help her not lose her scholarship and she can graduate on time. We had also been taking her to church every Sunday and Wednesday. Her church and school are about a half hour away. Due to work purposes the 10 month old has to rude along as well. The 10 month old hates being in the car unless she knows we're doing something fun. The 17 year old never shuts off tne lights or TV. Note this TV is the TV my husband and I loaned her from our bedroom. The only way my husband and I can watch anything is if we get to the family television area first, otherwise she won't share. When in the car I naturally sit in the back seat with the baby, but every time my husband and I plan a date she always comes along too and then is convinced she can't fit in the back seat (even though she has before), so on my date with my husband I'm stuck in the back seat. She will also play whatever she wants to listen to in the car. No matter if it's highly inappropriate for a baby learning to talk to listen to. (I've deemed the car for toddeler radio only now)  
She binge eats a lot. She's 337lbs and supposed to be on a diet, though she doesn't follow it. We take her to the park or somewhere else active everyday and then she'll eat extra food. She eats all of the yogu pick I ouck out for myself along with hers before I even get to it. She has high blood pressure but doesn't seem to care. She makes a mess everywhere she goes and doesn't do any chores. Anytime my husband or I begin to her idea of helping is playing with the baby's toys and not allowing the baby to play with them. Or holding the baby as she screams. (Each occasion husband or I intervene)  
She smells awful and now the old nursey does too. We've bought her all of the needed hygienic items to be clean but she doesn't wash properly. She's supoosed to get a job and pay us rent each month but she won't even look for a job. Every night we feel like she fakes a panic attack because as soon as you mention going somewhere fun she'll calm down.

146,"Last time I used this account was when I first got to where I am now

I’m a college freshman who just can’t seem to find stability and confidence.

When I was in High School I seemed much more put together. I played sports, good grades, musician. I was a much happier person 

I injured myself horribly junior year from throwing too much and I found myself lost and without self image of confidence

I found a sweet girl my senior year and then when that ended I found myself even more lost and sad 

I decided over the summer to abandon my course to go to a top university to pursue a career in the military through ROTC, moving to a different college far, far away from home

Physically things have been much harder for me, but it looks like i’m making improvements in everything

However, recently I found out that my injuries are disqualifying for military service, and I’m currently undergoing the waiver process

I feel like every time I find something I like life takes it away

Life gets pretty sad still, I’m not as social as I once was and I find that I like to keep to myself a lot. I think I’m still upset over stuff that’s happened in the last two years.

Sometimes I just wanna get away from school, I’m really starting to lose motivation in school after 12 years

I just get scared that I won’t be able to accomplish what I want, I still feel like I have something to prove to the world and myself.

Help?

147,"I am in a predicament over my future, and I was hoping for some insight. 

I was in a really bad living situation (in England) with my father and stepmother which I left due to being borderline suicidal. If you would like me to elaborate on the situation please ask but i'm trying to keep the post short and simple. 

At the moment I'm trying to regain control of my life and I am now living with my mother and stepfather in Australia. I am being supported by the government as a jobseeker (centerlink). I am unable to find a job (part time or full time) even though I have a degree (in Tourism Management). I've been trying for several months and I'm just finding it difficult to feel like I'm in a good place even though I am happier than I've been in the past 5 years. I don't know what kind of job I want to specialise in or where to start but every job i'm interested in (i.e. admin/reception) now requires a degree in that field or a certificate. I just don't know what to do about it or where to begin to build a future. 

Furthermore, before I left England I began a postgraduate degree in international business. I did not complete any of the modules but I had valid excuses and they all have a prolonged extension until August but due to the fact that I'm not coming back they basically forced me to put myself into intermittence which means that I can't complete the course or submit the extended assignments unless I go back to live with my father in England. 

Now I am at a crossroad of whether I should go back to put myself in a toxic environment in order to complete this degree or to stay in Australia and essentially start from scratch. There's a lot of financial issues thrown in there as well. 

I'm sorry if this post is confusing but it's complicated and I tried to explain the situation as simply as I could.

156,How do you get over what you've done? I loved this girl so much and I was forced to leave her with no options. This happened when I was leaving high school. She was a junior and I was a senior. My mother did not want me to date my girlfriend because I would be turning 18 when I graduated and she was turning 17 at the end of the year. For now we can call her. Sam. Sam had a difficult life and had problems with trusting another person just as me. So we both were able to find comfort just by being with each other. I didn't want to leave her but what other choice did I have? I was a 17 year turning 18 in a month and had no job no car no nothing and sam's parents did not want to have me stay with their daughter at a young age. Its been a year since I've spoken to her. I tried to explain the situation to sam but she did not listen. She moved on with her live started working out and doing good in school. Of course I was happy to know the girl I loved was doing amazing but now It's 5:13 am and I cannot sleep. This has been multiple nights where I can't forgive myself for what I did. I don't know how to move on. I don't want to date other women because it would not be fair for them because I would always love sam more than them. I know time heals all wounds but I don't know I feel insane. I care so much for someone who does not care for me. Is that bad? I'm confused because this was the first serious relationship I had. I don't have anyone to speak to about this matter but reddit. I just want to be back with her but at the same time I get the feeling shes better off without me. I guess I'm just bitter that she was able to move on so easily. Almost if she didn't care. I don't know what to do now. What steps would you take to get out of this feeling? Start dating more? Forget and move on?  I just don't know anymore. This is sorta the last resort. Thanks for reading if you have any kind of advice it would be appreciated!  ,06Mar2018,1
157,"So, for starters, we haven’t been dating forever. Maybe a little more than half a year. Not too stupid right? 

Well, recently I’ve started to realize that I don’t think I’m as in-love with her as I thought. 

I remember when we started dating and I was actually ecstatic; she was all I could talk about to my friends, and she was all I thought about really. I was truly head over heels for this girl. However, for the past month, maybe two, I have started to think about other girls a lot. And not even particularly in a sexual way (although I do), but more in just a ‘being attracted to their personality’ way. 

This has gotten to the point where I have started to admit to myself that I might even have “crushes” (for lack of a better word) on other girls. 

I haven’t mentioned this to her, and as far as I know she thinks our relationship is going fine. I would like to stress that my girlfriend is one of the nicest, genuine, funny, caring and sweet people I’ve ever met, and it’s killing me that I don’t like her anymore. 

I’m trying so hard to force myself to have a crush on her,  to like her, to love her, but I just can’t get myself to feel that way. I don’t have a real reason not to love her which is what bothers me so much, I just don’t. 

Only recently, maybe one or two days ago, I have admitted out loud (to two personal friends), that I feel this way. They have both suggested that I break up with her. However, (this next part is pretty stupid), to summarize, I am still in school and we have prom coming up next month, and I don’t want to go alone. 

I feel like such a asshole for that being the reason I’m staying with her. 

Any advice? ",06Mar2018,1

159,"I have an acquaintance (who for various reasons is impossible to avoid) who I would like to maintain a good professional relationship with.

Unfortunately, they don't understand the concept of personal space and cannot read body language/verbal cues at all. On multiple occasions I have sat through a 30+ minute conversation where I never once looked at them and only responded with ""I see"" and ""ah"".

On other occasions, I have straight out said ""I'm sorry, I have a tight deadline coming up soon so I need to focus on work"" and they keep standing around and talking while I wear my headphones, slowly and relentlessly creeping in on my personal space.

They follow me in and out of rooms and around hallways, into bathrooms and to the parking lot. A standing conversation with them involves moving 5-6 meters per hour in order to maintain some semblance of personal space.

160,"So, I has this friend from college who introduced me to his other two friends about 4 months ago. The other two friends of his are in a relationship, we had a group chat with all 4 of us in it until one day we where going to go out but one of them cancelled plans last minute, the two that where in a relationship removed him from the chat and started saying how weird he was and that they don't know why they still hang around with him. They planned a meetup with him and then to also cancel last minute just out of spite, (but it never happened) So anyway after a few more weeks of hanging around with them one day I mentioned that I was seeing other friends then they remove me from the chat , it was only for a few hours but I didn't think anything of it. They then said they where only messing around.  

I told them that in the past I have suffered with depression and anxiety and not to go to far, my confidence had gone right up after meeting them and I genuinely trusted them 100%, I told them that they had helped me overcome it.   

There was a few more instances where the two in the relationship would remove me or the other guy from the chat,  but they just said they where only joking and didn't mean it. So I decided to try and join in on the banter, just casual mocking like they did to the others in the chat, they said most of the time they just mess around and didn't mean it. 

So one day they where talking about there internet speeds, and how crap it was, so anyway one of the guys in the chat works for the said ISP, and they know, he screenshotted what they where saying about the said ISP and posted it in his work chat, put the caption ""roasted"" (just jokingly) Then the guy of the relationship was pretty angry, he removed him from the group chat and reported him to his own workplace, (not sure what's happened as of yet) so anyway after a day or so they added him back to the group chat because they wanted to go out to MacDonalds,   

So skip forward to a week ago and one of them posted a picture of there dog into the chat, I was bored and decided to mess around with the editing tools within the chat itself, I rubbed out the dogs face, not really thinking or paying much attention, just messing around with the photo editor. I posted it in the chat then I got removed, I didn't think much of it and assumed they where only messing around, 4 days later I messaged one of them saying ""okay, I'm sorry, can you add me back now?"" 

I then noticed that I could still see the group chat even though I wasn't in it, for pretty much two days straight all 3 of them where calling me weird and saying that they all should ignore me, how every time I messaged they cringed etc... I felt like pure rubbish after reading it, pretty much brought back my anxiety. So I asked them about what they all said and they told me that ""it was just weird what I did, but they did't really care that much anymore"" so anyway they added me back, They told me that they where only messing around and that I need to stop taking things to seriously and they didn't really care about it anymore.  

So the girl in the relationship started being really nasty, they all organised a meet up to the cinema but I didn't participate in the chat I just watched, they didn't invite me and they all went to said cinema without me and she started posting in the chat of all of them out having fun, making sure I saw it. 

Am I being oversensitive? is it me, or is it them?

174,"I’ve had a friend, for the past 13 years we have been in each other’s lives and celebrated big moments. She wasn’t always the best friend whom went out of their way to do special things for someone; she was just kinda selfish. It was as, I was a step ahead in life, being in a committed relationship- while she searched and failed to find one, getting engaged and having her in my bridal party- her not showing up to wedding events and just being really uninterested in the whole process, her actually doing MDMA at the wedding reception- not telling me, but keeping it a secret until I found by accident from another friend at her own batchelorette party. The resentment started to grow there. I put effort into her wedding planning and she really ignored mine. She has made friends with a new gal now, whom is also getting married. My friend is putting and taking much better time into it than she did with mine. I feel like I got the short end and the friend who didn’t care, and now this person is getting the better “improved” version of my friend. It is jealousy but it grew from that into major resentment, hence my issue. If I was just jealous I would have said to myself to grow up and get over it, however because I feel more now of an anger and frustration and because I know I might loose a friend of a long time in this; I really just can’t find it to forgive her. I will mention during the reception while she was high on MDMA she made a fool of herself by feeling up on my guests and attempting to do a hand stand in a short bridesmaid dress (yes she had no underwear on under the skanky dress she picked to “ look hot”) SHE EXPOSED HERSELF TO MY NEW LITTLE BROTHERS IN LAW. That really made a big difference in how I viewed our friendship from then on. Fast forward a few years, we have kept in touch but it has not been the same friendship for me and her as I have seen her be with the new gal. Yesterday it was my birthday; she forgot about it. I got a text at 12:30Am saying- “I don’t know how I forgot it was your birthday sorry” it hurt me. I think it would have been better not to get any message at all.

176,"Hey, 20 year old guy here, currently on my year abroad as part of my university degree. This post may get rambling but just bear with me.

My boyfriend of over two years decided to break up with me via phone late on Saturday night. I saw him just last week and everything was okay between us, but on Wednesday after I left home, I was kind of snappy to him over text. I basically said I was too busy to talk to him because during the day he had been slow to reply to my messages. It’s not the first time I’ve done stuff like that - especially when I’m abroad, because I’m working in a small town, it’s hard to see him having fun without me in a bigger city. I’ve promised that I wouldn’t shut him out anymore but I keep falling into that trap whenever I feel anxious or jealous, and I guess this was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. He said that that moment brought up a lot of subconscious thoughts but I just don’t know how he can make a decision like that in the span of just a few days when I’m not even there in person with him and we’ve barely talked properly about it either.

Suffice to say I really don’t know what to do. I’m absolutely devastated. I realise now how selfish I’m being when I shut him out and I would never do it again to him, especially now that I’ve basically lost him because of it, but I don’t know if he can believe me. I just don’t know how he can throw away two years together over this. We’re immensely close, we live together and have a pet cat, I’m very social anxious sometimes but around him I just feel safe and I can’t bear the thought of losing that. Over these past few days I’ve been messaging him and I’m getting mixed signals - he tells me that he wouldn’t have broken up if he wasn’t definitely sure it’s what he needs to do right now and that I shouldn’t base my life around us getting back together, but whenever I say “so you definitely don’t want to get back together” he always says that he can’t give an answer on hypotheticals. I think part of it is that our relationship has been very intense very quickly, and maybe some time apart would be good, but I’m trying so hard (and failing miserably so far) to not talk to someone who I’ve spoken to every day for over the past two years. I mean, we’ve planned our life together, we’ve talked about getting married, and for all that to just be gone in the span of a few days is just making me despondent.

I think the distance is putting a strain on our relationship and I don’t think it can work while I’m abroad but I don’t get back properly until August and I can’t bear the thought of him moving on in that time and I don’t think it’s fair either for him to do that to me while I’m in another country effectively on my own. I’m going to give him space for the next month as I get a week off to come back in April. Should I go and see him in that time? Should I try to change his mind? I’m hoping some time apart will make him realise that despite the difficulties we have a really close connection and it’s worth fighting for. He’s already said to me that I’m still his best friend and he still wants me in his life but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to be just his best friend - this has been my first major relationship, and to put that kind of emotional distance between us just wouldn’t work and would ultimately make me even more miserable. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer me advice then please do. Should I wait a couple of weeks before I contact him again to say I’m coming back home? Should I go and see him?",06Mar2018,1
178,"Hi Reddit, 

This is a long one. I (24m) recently had a career change from finance (i-banking) to neuroscience research (that’s another story). But because of this change, I took a significant pay cut in order to pursue a new path. 

My best friend’s (26m) birthday is coming up (we’ve known each other since we were 12. Every year for his bday we generally get dinner and go out. Usually it’s slightly more expensive than an average night out but still manageable. 

This year, my friend wants to go all out. He has chosen a club in the lower east side that is notoriously bougie and expensive, and wants us all to get a table for 15 people (which is absurd in itself). The table with service charge and tip will end up being $120 per person. Additionally, dinner will probably cost at least $60-$80 with drinks, food, and tip all included. Overall, it’ll be a very pricey night, all for a single birthday, and it’s stressing me out. 

I told him that I don’t think it’s worth the money to get a table at this club and offered him cheaper alternatives but he says I’m being unreasonable. The others in our group aren’t vocal enough to say anything. I feel like I’m arguing with a brick wall and my concerns are falling on deaf ears. 

I feel like I am strapped for cash. I’m currently in graduate school and paying for it with the cash I’ve saved from my old job. I’ve saved some money for a trip I am taking the following weekend with some other friends. Therefore, I feel like I don’t have the resources to spend $200 on a single night. It’s all just stressing me out and I don’t know what to do. 

Please advise. If you have stories of similar situations, I would love to hear them. Thanks. ",06Mar2018,3
180,So my bf and I have been together for over a year and a half and early on in the relationship he started volunteering with one of his friends. I was interested in volunteering but he didn’t want me to go and he insisted that we maintain separate friendships. Since then a lot of my friends have become our friends but he still keeps some of his friends separate. So I joined a group recently to do my own thing separately. I invited other people to join with me but not him and he knows this as he’s invited people to things in front of me where I’m not invited. He decided to show up to one of my meetings yesterday and joined the group too. I wouldn’t have a problem with this if I didn’t feel like he compartmentalizes me with certain things. I’m not sure how to handle this? Should I just let it go? I was doing it to show him what it feels like when he does it to me and to have a life separate from him. ,06Mar2018,1
181,"I received a call from my sister about an hour ago that my father, whom we've not spoke to since September 2017, called her from a strange number stating he was in trouble in Thailand and needed her to deposit $3k into his bank account.

Some background: My sister and I live in NY and NJ. My father lives in Ireland. We are all Irish citizens. When we last spoke to him he mentioned that a friend suggested he visit Thailand to find a wife. (He's 70 years old and lonely. My parents split about ten years ago and they do not speak. My mother lives in FL.) We did not hear from him on Christmas which was unusal but saw that he was visiting his brother in Australia via Facebook. I tried texting him a few times through WhatsApp but he never responded... and now we're here.

I told my sister that under no circumstances should she give him the money and if she wants to do anything, she needs to call the cops. I'm posting this to see if there's anything else that can be done. I feel like this could be one of two things:

**SCAM**- Possibly he met a woman and divulged to them that my sister is married to a very successful man and then explained that we're all very distant and don't speak. Maybe she turned it around and made my dad angry that we've ""abandoned"" him in his time of need and old age (which my dad has a tendency to believe) and she's convinced him to scam her for the money he deserves.

**LEGITIMATE**- He's in trouble. He's not a very smart man and has a long track record of poor decision making. If this is the case, I still don't feel it's right to pay the money since it does not guarantee his safety.

Advice?

**UPDATE**- I just got off the phone with my sister. She called him back and he said he agreed to buy a plot of land with a friend he met in Thailand and needs the money. She said if he didn't sign a contract then there's nothing binding him to this and he should just get on a plane and go home to Ireland to which he responded he can't leave because they're watching him and they're going to kill him and this may be the very last time they speak. 

I asked her to send me the number he's calling from and I'm going to call the police with it. Not sure what else to do. 

**SECOND UPDATE**- We’ve been in contact with his local police. My sister got a calling card and called him to provide him the information you all shared (emergency numbers, land ownership regs) He flat out said he’s not calling any help numbers and if she doesn’t want to send him money, she’s to stop calling him. He said if we get the police involved they’ll just throw him in jail. ??!!??!

**FINAL UPDATE**- Thanks to everyone for their help and support. The local police/Garda designated a detective to the case and in just a few short hours they found out who drove him to the airport, when he left, tracked his credit card usage, found out who fell for his scam within the town, and also found out he sold his Irish passport and travel visa. 

Apparently he met a woman and fell in love and of course she needs money so he sold his things and scammed anyone he could. The detective put out a message to Thailand police and they should be able to locate him in the morning and make sure he’s okay. Not sure if they’ll arrest him.

It’s bittersweet.. I’m glad he’s okay but it’s sad to know he could do such a thing to his children. 

Thanks again ❤️",06Mar2018,79
182,"I work in the Operations Dept. as the Operations Supervisor for a Shipping Agency. I'm about to finish college and get a Systems Engineering degree, and seeing this, the Operations Manager told me there was a possibility to switch to the Systems Department, although, not as a supervisor and without receiving the bonuses I receive now per monthly vessels attention but with the same salary.

The way I see it, if I accept this offer I wouldn't have to work overtime as I do almost every day and wouldn't have to work weekend in and weekend out. This would also give me the posibility to work on other things and it would take less time from my whole day.

183,"So the low down is, my credit is bad, if I tried to get my own place it probably would not happen.

I moved in with a friend. We lived together for a year or so, but then out of the blue he decides to move back home and I have the lease to myself (pay all the bills now). The place is in his name primarily I'm a co-renter.

While it is a favor that I have a place to live... I'm also wondering wasn't this an asshole move? Now I have to pay everything on my own? I can just barely afford it. But if I fail to pay it will hurt his credit. (not sure if this is true)

Where my concern is, I don't want to fail to pay because I will be homeless/have nowhere to go back to.

What's the perspective here. Am I too nice of a guy, or I did get a favor right and I should feel lucky?

So far I can afford the place/have 5 months left. I'm just wondering like what a normal person would feel about this situation.

What's sad is I don't think in 5 months my credit will improve much. Initially I was opening new accounts but I realized it was averaging my credit-age/making that worse and the hard inquiries (if it happened).

The truth is I wouldn't have a job/web dev from home opportunity without the stable environment (having a home) but I also don't feel free to speak my mind because I am ""under him"" somehow because everything is in his name.",06Mar2018,7

So throughout high school I had a friend I cut ties with because she was so toxic and generally very mean to other people, I stopped being her friend when I gradually saw myself coming to be like her. Now I have a great group of friends who I care about dearly.

The problem is, my younger brother has started his high school in the same one her brother is in, I came back from my own high school (I’m 17 so I’m 4 years older) to see my own little brother sort of sad (he’s 13)  I asked him what’s up and he replied that her brother had told him to fight him and pushed him around (her brother is 15) now I directly wanted to go into his school (his school is close in proximity to mine) and confront him myself, but the problem is that she and her brother live on my street, and I don’t want to make things worse for him.

186,"My school does not offer open campus. We can either walk to the cafeteria, go to the vending machines, order pizza, or not eat. In my High School there are about 300 people. The cafeteria is a longer walk, pizza is a minimum order of $10, and it’s not convenient. In my small town we have McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Arby’s, 2 Subways, Pizzahut, Mazzio’s, and a couple Mexican restaurants. We have from 12:40-1:15 for lunch. This is easily enough time to go get something for lunch. I want to propose it to the school board for Juniors and Seniors to be able to drive and go get lunch.

1. Does or did your high school have open campus?
        a-If so, what ages could go? How long was your lunch break? How did your school get around liabilities? What size was your school?

192,"Is this teacher being difficult or am I just the idiot student who dropped the ball? Should my teacher have responded to me or do they reserve the right to ignore students?

I missed the class when the instructions were handed out for a profile essay. According to a classmate, my professor did at one point mention verbally that the essay could be on someone you had the ability to interview however the subject had to be about a person who had overcome failure so I chose my subject to be Steve Jobs. 

Before I started on my essay, I emailed my teacher and asked her how long my essay had to be. She just told me to refer to the assignment instructions. (In my head, I’m thinking, “If you’re taking the time to respond to me, why can’t you just tell me how long the essay is supposed to be??”) I didn’t even know she’d handed out instructions. I responded to her, explaining that I was not present when the instructions were handed out and she never responded back. So much for “Email me if you have ANY questions.” 

I was lucky that my classmate had a copy and sent it to me.

The assignment instructions weren’t very specific. All it said was “Your assignment is to write a 750-800 word essay. The profile should be a portrait in words and provide an intimate look at the person and how they overcame an obstacle, failure or disappointment.”

The instructions then gave some examples of historical figures, some sample questions and things that a profile essay typically includes like a physical description, facts, etc. 

Nowhere in the instructions did it specify that the essay had to be about someone you know personally. I worked for hours doing research, sourcing and typing my rough draft which was due today. I turned it in to my classmate for the peer review who told me that the essay was supposed to be on someone you knew so I approached my professor and confirmed it with her. 

My professor gave me this confused/shocked/pissed off look and asked me why I didn’t ask her these questions about the profile essay during the writing conference that I had with her last week about a previous assignment. I told her that if I thought I was doing the assignment correctly, how would I have known to ask a question?

I do remember her asking if I had any questions about the profile essay assignment during the writing conference but I told her, “At this time, I don’t have any questions.” I personally don’t think that there’s only one time and place to ask, either. 

I’ve been in situations before where my supervisor at work told me she didn’t respond to an email that I sent her (even though she invited me to respond to ask questions) “because she’s my supervisor” and she doesn’t have to communicate with me if she chooses not to. This situation feels kind of similar only I’m a student and I’m at the teacher’s mercy so she doesn’t have to respond. It just feels like she’s trying to assert her dominance.

197,"I can’t figure out what to cook for a quasi vegetarian. A few years ago, after watching a documentary, I decided to go Vegetarian and my husband followed about a month later.

I cook quinoa regularly but he complains that it’s too bland and sits in his stomach. I make vegetable soup about once a week and he’s not interested in eating it. I roast veggies all the time and serve them with rice and he says “that’s not enough food”. I make beans in the slow cooker and he doesn’t want to eat them because of the fiber...”I have a long day at work, I can’t eat those”.  Meanwhile, his vice is eating chips and salsa. He eats them all the time, but there isn’t a lot of nutritional value there. I think he’d be happy to eat fish every day, but I’m worried about mercury poisoning.

198,"I’m going to try and keep this short.

Basically, this person and I went to high school together and we were friends in high school. After graduating, we didn’t really keep in touch, mostly by choice but there was never any confrontation or “cutting off” done. We both just stopped reaching out, if I remember correctly. Plus we both changed so much since then.

Then come college. My junior year, he transferred into my college and we reconnected and became closer than ever. We hung out all the time, studied together, smoked together, went out together, vented to each other about life, introduced each other to new people. There were so many fun memories and I miss how I was so comfortable with him as a friend. There are some friends you feel you have to put on an act around when you hang out, he wasn’t one of them. I like to think we had a special bond. 

Needless to say, though, I was going through terrible depression and maybe I was expecting far too much and being overly sensitive about things. He at times wasn’t aware of how certain behaviors or actions would come off as rude or would be hurtful to me. I was always under the impression that “were close enough to communicate”, but I think that sometimes when people are confronted, they dont want to feel like they are being criticized for who they are or feel like they should change. I think there were mistakes on BOTH ends, but the relationship ended with one final straw.

Actually, I didn’t want to stop being friends. When I had ‘confronted’ him about something I was in a terrible place mentally and didn’t want a fight but more so a discussion. He didn’t take it too well initially, and I assumed he was just hinting that he wanted to stop being friends so I told him he doesn’t need to feel bad, and gave him a final goodbye. We haven’t really spoken since.

After some time (few months), everything started to hit me. I went back and read our old conversation and I saw things from a completely different perspective. It seemed as though he *was* trying to show me he cares, but at the time I took it as him projecting that he didn’t want to be friends anymore because he doesn’t want to deal with constant fighting.

Here is my issue (TLDR): It’s been months since we’ve stopped talking, but I’ve always felt like there’s still a connection there. My feelings of missing him as a friend and wanting to reconcile have grown so strong recently, like it’s always on my mind...but I’m afraid to reach out. I’m not only afraid of getting rejected by him, because maybe he’s over all of this already and won’t want me back in his life after everything, but I’m also afraid of how to go about the situation. I realized that months ago, he had unfriended me on facebook but then added me back again. I didn’t think anything of it but looking back I should have known it was a sign of him reaching out in a way.. (Or maybe I’m overthinking it). A mutual friend also told me that he would ask her about how I was more recently to our friendship ending. I have also been seeing him more often in person lately. I take that as a sign.

These past two semesters, I have been dealing with SO much of my own issues and stresses that I just felt like I didn’t have the time to try and reconcile a relationship. Now I want to MAKE the time, because I still have a lot to worry about. I just don’t know when a good time to do it would be. It seems like I have so much to do all the time and I would need to sit down mentally prepare myself for this conversation if it would even happen.

207,"I'll keep this as short as possible. I'm a 22 year old dude who is going to be graduating very soon from college. Over the past week or so, I've been going through a mini existential crisis.

Looking back with full honesty, Middle school was a terrible time for me. I was constantly trying to be buddies with a few other 'jock' types who never really saw me as an equal (although they did respect me). This school also was in a location with some very seedy areas feeding into it. I'm all for equality, and many of my friends were immigrants, but my school also had some absolute 'thug' types who likely grew up in messed up homes. I was never directly bullied, but I was in fear of physical danger a few times.

High school was a bit better, but had its own problems. Again, I think I tried to be something I'm not, which was the jock type. I actually made some good friends in high school, and tended to float across several 'cliques.' I wasn't unpopular in a Mean Girls sense, but I certainly wasn't on the inside. It hurts to think about, but I was never really invited to a single proper boy-girl drinking party. The way to describe my time was I was 'never anyone's first choice.'

My time in university is coming to an end now, and it has been better than the previous two phases. However, I feel like my experience has been hugely lacking in some ways. The good thing is I'll be graduating with a very good GPA in a solid double major program, and I have no debt because my parents were kind enough and able to pay most of my tuition. I also got involved, studied abroad, and made some very good friends. However, I feel like I lacked the quintessential 'college' experience. I went to a major university where most people commute from within this major city, so it's almost like more of a high school atmosphere. I literally went to about 10 parties and out clubbing 15 times in the total of 5 years. And even though it's an embarrassing subject, in two months time I'll most likely still be a virgin. Other than a few tinder dates and other very casual stuff like that, I haven't been dating much. And in all fairness it's not a 'pitiful me' thing because there's been some out there who are available to dating me, but I'm simply not interested in them.

See, I feel like I can make something really good out of my life here. I am graduating soon, can likely get a good job pretty quickly, and feel that my dating life can turn around with the right person. However, it really worries me when my parents and so on say that 'high school/college is the best time of our life.' My time in school was painful at the end, and university has been somewhat forgettable. I can't help but think how much better it could have been if my parents pushed me on the right track. I certainly would have fit in better at a better public school or private (we could definitely afford it), but my parents didn't really have the wisdom in my time through. They know better for my little siblings now. And more than that, I wish I could have gone to a potentially 'better' program at a university away from home. While I would have chosen something similar, I definitely underestimated how smart I was at a young age, and hate that I missed out on 'the best years' away at a campus college.

And on top of all of this, I don't feel like I'm growing up. When I see some of these young kids coming into the college, I realize I need out soon and can feel that I'm more mature. But just looking at myself, I haven't changed at all as a person, and am certainly not ready for this change.

First, a little about myself. I'm currently 28 years old. I have a full-time job ( plus routinely being on call to answer phones) 9-5 Monday through Friday. I make about $55,000 there. I have a second part-time job Friday -Monday nights. I make about $8,000 there. This may seem like decent pay to some but i live on long island and i can assure you that I am not incredibly well-off.
A little over a year ago i returned to school full time at my local community college and so far it has been going well.

Here is my dilemma; I will be finished will my 2 year degree soon and absolutely plan on pursuing  a 4 year degree or, preferably, an accelerated masters (get my masters in 3 years after my community college). I'm not sure what to do regarding school. All of the ""local"" schools that offer the program I'm looking for are over an hour away. Plus, I'm assuming that i will need to spend more and more time towards school as i progress through the years. I barely have enough time to do my schoolwork as it is and i don't know if i could afford to leave my full-time job.

Plus, since I've been living as an adult I've accumulated some standard adult-like bills (Cell phone, some credit card debt, rent, car insurance...). My parents are in no shape to help out either.

209,"Let me preface by saying I don’t remember having these issues until, maybe the last year or two. I can breakdown my problem into 3 separate issues, which I think are directly related to one another. 

- When I’m trying to find a resolution to a problem or complete a multi-step task, although I know what needs to be done to achieve my goal, I overwhelm myself with the variables on how to achieve that goal. As a result, I’m now dealing with a giant project that takes more time than really needed. 

This seems to extend to even writing a sentence or a full message like this one. I know what I want to ask you, but then I get hit with this overwhelming/brain fog feeling because there are so many ways to put my words and sentences together. So this communication becomes an hour long project that tires me out. 

- When I want to complete a task I end up putting it off because that would require me to complete another one beforehand. Almost like that scene from Malcom in the Middle when he wants to change the light bulb but ends up needing to fix his car first. 

Here’s the link: 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0

- I keep trying to systemize my tasks so when I pull the trigger I’m the most effective. In theory it makes sense, but I end up tiring myself out over the preparation and don’t even implement. 

Thank you for any help and feedback.",06Mar2018,2

214,"I decided to start therapy since I feel like I need some help getting through life. I got to the office early, filled out paperwork and handed it over to the front desk. Some time later I was called in with my therapist, this was our first session, and she spent the first few minutes just going through paperwork. Then she asked me for my the names of my family members and wrote it down? Then went back to doing paperwork. At this point I just started scrolling through my phone and she got really upset saying that we were in session and I wasn't allowed to use my phone (we were sitting in silence for awhile before I looked at my phone.) I put my phone away, and tried to have a conversation with her. I asked her where she went to school, she answered, and then I asked her if she had grown up around there. She accused me of crossing a line, trying to control her, and that I was trying to find out where she lived? I'm from NY, and it's common to have casual conversations about where you're from, since its such a transient city. I've had this conversation before with other therapists, I was just trying to have a casual conversation and get to know her I guess but this is the first time I've ever had a therapist respond to me this way. I'm not sure if I should stick it out because I was in the wrong here and I'm not realizing it or if I should look for someone else. Please advise.",06Mar2018,2
215,"Background- 

Girl that I only like based on looks(this past couple weeks I realIzed the personality part part is bad) tells she “loves” me twice while high
After about a week she confirms it while sober . At the time I said that I liked her back, and also the mistake that I liked her since summer. 

This all happened this past month and after we shared that we liked each other , we haven’t spoken.  I don’t have to hang out with her to know she has a bad  personality that just isn’t for me. (Stories from friends and snapchat stories of what she does) Not to mention she does extremely stupid things(an example would be drive 100+ mph on highway with friends with no license). Side note, I am 2 years short of graduating high school and my goal is to join the coast guard(they expect clean records) my thought was if I hang around her, her bad choices can backfire on me.We were about hang out , but hours before we did I told her sorry it’s my birthday(which it was) and I was busy. Her response was just a “ok”. Not even a happy birthday.

Now this is how I feel. There are three things that influence my choices, my heart,  brain and dick(being Serious) heart and brain telling me to do the Smart thing and focus on my future and what’s the best for me. And it obvious what my dick wants, but I am NOT that low of a person. Yesterday she messaged me asking why I don’t talk to her, I tell her I don’t know and she finished of the conversation by saying “u tell me u like me then don’t talk to me”.  But from that I believe she is just stating her observations 

Goal- I need to somehow tell her I am not interested in her without her starting to ask questions. Because telling her flat out will make lots of confusion for her because we never hung out and don’t know each other. My plan was to say something like this “it’s hard to explain, but try to understand, in my life right now, I don’t have any free time, so I don’t want to start  anything”. In my head that’s the best I can do because if she asks questions about my life and what’s going on, I can just say it’s none of your business/concern.

Today, absolutely not the first time, I got asked: ""Are you a faggot?"", by my classmate. I had no idea what to say. ""No, I'm not."". ""What do you think of girls?"". ""What girls?"". ""Girls in general?"". He was clearly wanting to know if I liked men or not. And let me say, my whole class is really homophobic. And what hurts the most is that they're not totally wrong, I *am* bisexual.

I'm all about accepting yourself, I always tell others to accept themselves, but when it counts to me, I can't do it. I'm insecure about my sexuality and being reminded that I appear ""gay"" makes me feel even worse. 

I can't control my femininity and I don't want to change myself, but at the same time I want to change to please others.

long story short, my mom has a lot of debts. i am already paying one on a monthly basis (that's all i can afford) and it'll be done in a couple of years. 
but apparently she also owes some people money. the problem is these people only have a promissory note (i don't know if that's the  correct term in english) from her, but she has no copies or receipts acknowledging that she's been paying for over a year. 
In that time, she has more than surpassed the original quantity of the debt. Like... if she owed 100USD, she has already paid 180USD, and they say she still owes 140USD. 
These people are clearly abusing her, but she won't stop paying cuz she's scared, and i asked her to try to get copies and receipts but apparently they don't give them to her. 
So i'm at a loss. I could give her the money (in some months if i save up) so that she finishes paying, but i have no guarantee that these people will stop harassing her.

We don't really talk about ""deep"" stuff.

231,"Hi all!

Just wanted to know if this is just me, or something common?

As background: I'm currently doing a Masters in Literature so am doing lots of essays atm. I have had other jobs and I am capable of doing other work with less trouble, this only applies to essays as they require a lot of focus.

I tend to be pretty organised and work quite well when I get going. I usually work intensely for short periods then take little breaks to treat myself. This goes very well when I can stay at home for long periods of time.

However, when I have to go to class or go socialise it really takes it out of me. I get quite hyper and enjoy it but when I go home I feel stressed and it's harder to focus. To do my work I feel like I have to be home for the entire day to get something done which makes splitting my workload difficult. When I can't do the work I planned to do (as I do try and do it after going out) I feel very guilty for the rest of the day. I need a lot of relaxation time to get into the state of mind to do work and I don't know if this is normal.

I also do have anxiety (which I manage pretty well) and some odd things that happen which might be tics: I tend to tic more when I get home after being out all day (I also hesitate to call them tics because I don't have a diagnosis but have no other word to describe them, otherwise I would have posted to a sub more relevant to that particular difficulty) I also struggle in places like supermarkets because of the sensory overload which knocks my energy somewhat.

Might this thing with work be:
- An excuse not to get things done
- Legitimate tiredness
- Something that happens with introverts?
- Due to my particular difficulties?

Otherwise, any tips to improve my efficiency? 

tl;dr  is it normal that I have to be inside for long periods of time to focus well? ",06Mar2018,2

233,"First of all, it is a private school, Ive been attending it for all my life (currently 16 in 10th grade), although I wish I hadnt.

Anyways I like having long hair. But Ive never had long hair. The longest hair Ive ever had is barely reaching my neck. That's what is considered ""too long"" here. My school forced me to cut it at the beginning of the year.

My hair tends to cover my eyes occasionally, and I dont mind but boy they sure do.

I cut my hair a to about two thirds of its size, and 3 months later they wanted me to cut it AGAIN, which I did, and now, less than a month later, my mother gets a phone call demanding I cut my hair.

Meanwhile my hair is shorter than every single girl in the school, and they dont even have to bun it.

I know that you dont have rights in private schools, but the worst part is that noone wants to talk about this, not the council, not the principal. Id love to talk to the principal about it but shes just like ""lol demz de rulez xddd"".

Im fucking infuriated. Im thinking of just wearing beanies all day every day because they dont even let guys bun their hair.

""Just change schools lol"" heres where this gets complicated.

For 1), this is the only school remotely close to me.

2) the school has made a certain deal with my family due to illness, I won't go into detail, but that's basically another cudgel that they can use to beat me with

And 3) my parents hate the idea of me going to a public school. I mean I dont really want to but I wouldnt mind it at all. They used to say things like ""if u dont get good grades you're going to public school"" and I was like allright sure, but they never really went through with that.

There isn't much time left until summer, so I really want to find some way to not cut my hair until then. I wear beanies almost every day, but can't wear them during actual classes, so that's a no-go. I could use a bobby pin that's basically impossible to see, or just use really awful hairstyles that dont use too much hair. 

Or if they don't care about that go speak to the principal about it, she's a rather civil person and I'm hoping I could get something done with a calm, level-headed argument.

My hair's basically all I like on me appearance-wise so it's really important to me. Way too important perhaps.

Just for some perspective, even girls aren't allowed to wear earrings, and you can't wear shorts. Fucking shorts get you expelled. Shorts.

School isn't really religious, I mean it holds christian values but other than compulsory praying it doesn't force them

tl;dr private school forcin me to cut my not at all long hair for the 4th time, i dont wanna do it

236,"	My boyfriend (24) and I (20) having been dating for over 3 years now. We’ve been long distance for the majority of our relationship because I go to school 6 hours away from where we met in our home town. This has caused some strains on our relationship, as expected, but overall we are extremely happy together and he is who I truly see myself spending the rest of my life with. There is one issue though that continues to surface and has repeatedly caused arguments in our relationship, and that is his continued use of cocaine. 
	I knew he had tried cocaine when we first started dating, but I thought it was just experimentation, a “one-time thing”, which I was okay with. Two years ago, when he came to visit me at school he had a rough night, got very sick, to the point where I was going to call an ambulance. He had been at a music festival the night before, so I questioned if he had maybe taken something that I wasn’t aware of. After looking through his phone to try and find answers (he was too sick and emotional to tell me anything and I was scared) I found texts between him and his friend talking about buying cocaine and doing it.  The next day I confronted him about it and he admitted that he had been heavily using it for the past month. 
	After that night, I lost trust for him, but slowly started to build that trust back because he promised that something like that would never happen again. To the best of my knowledge this is true, but he still does it occasionally (maybe once every 3-6 weeks) even though he knows it hurts me. He’s both been honest with me and lied about it and told me after, explaining his reasoning was because he wanted to avoid a fight. I keep finding out about this and telling him how much it hurts me but he doesn’t seem to care. His reasoning is that he likes to do it, and it isn’t a problem because he isn’t addicted, and that he wants to make his own choices and not just do whatever I tell him (I will admit that I am the alpha in the relationship). I should also add that I’m scared about him using because there has been a lot of fentanyl related deaths from laced cocaine in the area that he lives. I need advice on how to handle this because I love him so much and want what’s best for him but he doesn’t seem to see how much this affects our relationship.

Parenting around the internet is some new and complicated crap. Advice?

263,"

My dad is always angry and miserable because he hates his job and he’s a neat freak so the Home is never as clean as he’d like. Plus he’s always stressing about bills and things like that.

My mom is always angry as well mostly because my dad gives her an attitude because of his own unhappiness and she feels unappreciated, and also frustrated at life because she is always in pain. She has lupus and a long time hip injury and back problems.

My brother is a social outcast so he is always depressed and complaining about life  and dumb things like having to do chores and people not taking him seriously 

My sister doesn’t live with us, but she comes over every once in a while to express her unhappiness with other crap..

I’m the only one with a decent attitude yet, it really weighs down on me when everyone just is so miserable... 

I try to make money to help my dad, I’m desperately working through highschool but it will take a while for me to really build a career and in my mind I don’t even care about my own future my Dream is to be able to pay all my dads bills and somehow make him happy for once

I spend extra time cleaning when I get home to try to make my dad happy for one day and he seems to not even notice what I did.. he simply finds that ONE thing I didn’t do a perfect job on.

I spend time with my brother even though I don’t find the games he plays fun, I don’t play games but he doesn’t know I pretend to enjoy it so he can feel good for at least an hour like he has a friend...even though I find it painfully boring I take 1 hour out my day to play a game with him and hear all his complaints about life 

My mother has told me she sometimes wishes she wouldn’t wake up the next day

Sadly my own dad has told me the same thing..

This makes me feel terrible.. I can’t make everyone happy... and they just make me feel sad.. 

I try to understand them, and hear them out but it doesn’t really change their mind much 

I can’t enjoy life that much because then I feel guilty. I don’t deserve to have fun when my dad or Mom is miserable at home ..

Maybe this was a rant more than anything, but I don’t know what to do.. I feel responsible but my help is worthless. 

What should I do .....  ugh sorry for the long writing ",06Mar2018,10
265,"Short Story: Rejected a job opportunity, and now I'm not sure how to find a job that fulfills me, or is at least tolerable.

Long story: I'm an employed, recent college grad (BS Public Health). I just had an interview today, for an Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Specialist position at a manufacturing company. It went well, but they were frank about the mess they were in (safety culture-wise), and I got bad vibes, so I contacted the recruiter who originally reached out to me and expressed I wasn't interested.

And I feel IMMENSELY guilty about this. The truth is, I didn't like this kind of work when I did this as an intern, and there WAS a firm safety culture in place. I just don't have the personality to revamp a broken system, when I couldn't tolerate when things were running smoothly.

I have since been promoted to regulatory compliance in my current company, which I don't like much, either (hence my continuing job search). I can feel myself fraying and I want to try something else; I'm ready to move on to the next thing, or quit with nothing lined up (I've been crying at work, and I'm not sure how much longer I will be able to hide it. Being emotionally compromised is putting me behind on projects, and I'm certain the mask I put on is thin).

I have applied to other positions outside my field of work for months with no success. The only interviews I've been able to get are for EHS or regulatory compliance, both of which I already know I don't like, and do not want to invest my career further in.

I continue to interview because any interview experience is good experience, and others tell me to try to do the same position in another company and I might feel differently about it. But the company I work for, while not perfect, isn't the reason I want to leave. The work itself is just so abysmal. Unfortunately, the job market is booming for these kinds of jobs right now (which is partly why I went into it), so I feel depressed that it's not working out. It feels like a long and ugly breakup, and my shitty ex keeps calling, and I keep answering.

I have considered going back to school, but I don't know how I would be able to afford to go back. I would still need to have a job , one that doesn't make me go nuts, while I study.

Have I made a mistake? Part of me knows that I would have hated taking this job. I already played that game and know it's not for me, but at least I would have tried again. At least I would be able to say I got out of my current crumby job.

I'm really at a loss of what to do. There is a creative side of me I want to pursue (I am currently maintaining a blog and collaborating with a local band), but I know I need a steady income while I nurse that metaphorical baby. But coming home upset every night makes that difficult. It puts a strain on my romantic relationship as well.

Any advice you all can throw at me would be greatly appreciated.",06Mar2018,2
266,"Once it was on purpose, the other times was on accident, they are really haphazard with their phones. When I was 14 for example my stepmother in a drunken stumble dropped her phone out of her pocket and it went into my uncle's driveway, before becoming drunk she was complaining her pockets were too shallow for her phone. What resulted was her shattering her phone screen, she tried fixing it months later but my dad insisted on doing it which resulted in her phone not turning on. I ended up without a cell phone for a week because whenever they break their phones they take mine until they get a new phone

Another time was when my dad had bought the Galaxy S3 when it was new, he was really tired but still tried to stay up. He apparently was so tired he accidentally put his phone in the microwave and shorted his phone out. 

And just recently my stepmother dropped her phone in the toilet because she was tired and falling asleep on the toilet. Her phone screen is messed up now and won't work properly. 

I wouldn't care if they didn't break their phones six months or so and they wouldn't take my phone to use while theirs is broken but seriously they couldve prevented their phones from breaking every time, they've bought cases for their phones too but they always take it off a week after they buy it !

After the first half of the school year I got kind of depressed, and I told my parents I needed to go to a psychologyst (I also have social anxiety issues I've decided to fix). I also told them I wasn't feeling well when it came to studying. They told me to just finish this year before thinking what to do next, and I said sure. But a few weeks have passed and I don't feel able to study at all. I feel extremely tired and unmotivated. I've fallen behind on my classes and now I don't even know what to do about it. I just go home after school and do nothing (or sleep), which makes me feel even worse. I went to my parents again and told them I don't feel capable of passing my classes this year, and that I believe I need a break. My mom started sighing and my dad got angry. He said if I leave college I won't ever come back, and that I'm not going anywhere the way I am now. He said he's not spending a single dime on college anymore for me (even though I told him I want to work for a year and pay back what he spent). I don't even know what I'm doing anymore, I feel sad and missunderstood. I don't think I would completely abandon college, I just think I need to get myself together... I'm sure what I said to them hurt them really bad, and they felt very dissapointed, but I also think I'm being mature enough to adress my issues and they should see that. I still have two months left of college and I'm so sad. I don't even have friends to talk about this.

It’s been frustrating because I can’t feel happy in my actions for more that a week before I’m into the next personality and perspective. I’m 25 and I’m still on this hunt for something that allows me to enjoy my time here, and when I look at those surrounding me, they all seem set. It’s almost like they’ve found out who they are, their hobbies, their aspirations, and what defines them as a whole. Not only that, but they seem capable of holding that character indefinitely with only the accepted deviations on good/bad days. 

Everyday is roulette for me and the skin ship I pilot. 

I grew up in a bipolar household, and I’ve read that that can have an effect on my passive behavior, but I’ve always written that off as mental health sensationalism.

272,"I’m a 33 y/o male, and I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life...
I never really had much of a family. My father passed away when I was a baby, and my mom spent most of her life working multiple jobs while trying to raise me. 
I was raised to figure things out on my own. I had no guidance and nobody to look up to. 
I was picked on in JR High and all throughout HS.
 I  eventually turned to drugs, dropped out of HS my junior year, and ran the streets partying and doing things I still regret to this day. It wasn’t until the age of 28 when I realized I was wasting my life. 
I quit doing drugs, stopped partying like I was 22, and parted ways with people who were a bad influence on me. 

The medical field was always something I took an interest in and I went the route of EMT and found my passion. Luckily, for me, they didn’t ask for my HS diploma or GED. I’ve been working as an EMT the last couple of years, but I want to focus on a career in nursing. I’m so close to finishing my GED (just need to pass math), and will probably join the Navy or nursing school. 

I feel like my timeline is way off.. the handful of close friends that I have are all married with kids. 
I’ve been single 6yrs. I’m a good looking guy, but find it hard to put myself out there because I feel like such a loser.  It’s caused anxiety, depression and late nights overthinking which leads to no sleep.

274,"I'm 4 weeks into this general carpentry pre-apprenticeship program. The program is 8 months, fully paid for by the government of Canada to try to get more young people into the trades. 

I took the program because I think I will enjoy working in sustainable building such as rammed earth, hay bale, and tiny homes, etc. I have no experience in carpentry and courses like this one are offered at various schools for people exactly like me. For those that don't have the skill set to currently work as a carpenter or gain an apprenticeship but wants to take that first step into the trades. On top of all of this, they find you a three month job placement at the end of the program and you are a level one apprentice. 

It sounds amazing and I'm very thankful to be in the program but the more I learn about the trades, the more it seems like this schooling is redundant for me. I understand it's a great way to get into the trades but they really hold your hand and it feels more like you are being herded along (when employers that I have spoke to said they would hire someone that knows nothing as long as they have a desire to learn) until they can drop us off to an employer who will then take over the babysitting. 

The program will not be finished until the end of September and today I received an offer for an eco tour guiding position in one of Canada's national parks. This is what I went to school for and nothing sounds better than spending the next 6 months playing in the woods. The only problem with this job, is that it's a seasonal position that will take me until the second week of October. 

So now I need to decide whether I go to school tomorrow and tell my teacher that I'm leaving, or tell the park that I can't accept the job..

-Isolating A from A's other friends
-Abrasiveness toward A's friends
-Extreme jealousy and lack of trust
-Extreme possessiveness
-Attempts at controlling A

After the months it took to build up the courage to ask her out, and once again seeing the end result of all of my mental labor being that dreaded two-letter word, ‘no’, I’ve been in a very introspective mood. The more I linger in it, the more I’ve begun to hate who I am. 

I don’t fit in to any social circle at school. Not the pretty popular people, nor the losers who the former look down upon. I’ve become convinced that I value the few friends I do have infinitely more than they value me. I feel like I’m not the star of my own life, but a D-list throw-away character in the lives of other people. I’m pretty smart, but not impressively so. I’m not introverted, but I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut because usually what comes out is stupid or something I’ll instantly regret. I love music with my entire being, but I’ll never be able to write lyrics as moving as those of my idols. I want to be something great, but I don’t have the motivation to work towards greatness. I’m privileged enough to go to one of the top schools in my country, but the idea of living modestly and working small jobs to focus on my music sounds infinitely more appealing that getting a engineering degree and making 6 figures. 

The worst part is that every day I become just a little more apathetic towards all of this. My bad attitudes, my low ambitions, the fact that no one cares about me beyond a passing glance and a wave, everything.

I’m a 27F in a QC/laboratory position at the company I work at. I walk the lines and have to talk to the operators/shift leaders to talk about the machines or the problems they’ve had while running. A lot of my job requires me to build good relationships with people, communicate well and be personable. 

A male operator messaged me on FB messenger and told me that another male operator was showing others a porn, telling them that I look like the female adult actress and that I *probably was* her. He brought it to my attention, and asked if it was true because “I didn’t seem too upset being told this, so was it true?” I told him that if I got upset over any mean thing someone’s said to me, I’d never stop being upset. 

I wasn’t going to let him know how upset I actually am, but at this point I’ll be considered guilty if I act upset or if I don’t. I feel really violated that this is being said about me at work, especially since I don’t know which operator has been perpetuating it or whose all been told/shown. 

Tomorrow is my first day back since I found out that this is being said, which was on Saturday. I know that by going to HR will make this “real”, and it may or may not escalate. I know that the male operator is guilty of sexual harassment by showing porn at work, and then guilty again by specifically referencing *me* in whatever fantasy that I’m this porn star. I plan on showing HR the messages and filing whatever formal complaint I’m able to to start the documentation process. 

I have nothing against sex workers. I am more worried about my personal safety because I’m worried this will escalate to the point where someone tries to corner me and extort me for sexual favors. I’m also worried about my work reputation, and how this rumor may affect me moving up or my day to day dealing with people. The state that I live in is a “one party consent” state, and I know it’s within my right to record an in person conversation without the other person knowing. If anyone corners me, I plan on recording the interaction. 

My BF has warned me that I might potentially lose my job over going to HR. We’ve talked about it, and worse case scenario we have an attorney we’ll go to. I’m just wondering what else I need to initiate with HR to protect myself in the event that this rumor starts to interfere with my work life? Anyone with similar experiences? How did it end up for you? Anything I need to start doing or remember to document? 

Thank you in advance!! I’m really nervous to address this, because I’m worried about drawing too much attention to it. I don’t want people to look at me and think this, or for people to feel like they can treat me like a sexual object. I’m just not sure what to do. ",06Mar2018,9

1. A lot of people simply weren't interested in putting the time into it, which is understandable and leads to the second reason 
2. There wasn't much to get out of it. All the science and engineering kids joined the robotics club (which I'm also in) for obvious reasons. There's a goal, a competition, it looks better on resumes, and it's established.

288,"I work at a Korean restaurant as a server. About 80% of my co workers are middle aged Korean women and they all have children about my age (early 20s). These ladies will not leave me alone. Keep in mind that they are not managers or even head servers. They are just regular servers, just like me.

I would be working, just minding my own business, and these older ladies about my mom's age will take turns to storm up to me from all the way across the restaurant (while ignoring all the customers who are trying to flag them down for service), to yell at me about something I did that they didn't like. None of them are about things like messing up an order or spilling things (I haven't done that while working there). For example, I was serving a family with two children and they asked for crayons. So I brought them some crayons and the coloring sheets that we have at the restaurant. It was pretty slow at the time, so I gave both kids a set of crayons to use, and one of the older co workers marched all the way from across the room to scold me for giving the table too many crayons IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN.

They don't wait until I've walked away from the table. They will literally yell at me while I'm in the middle of something like taking orders from customers and the whole place will become quiet and people would stare. What I find hilarious is that our Yelp reviews are full of customers complaining about the terrible and inattentive service provided by these older ladies.

My guess is that these women think that it's okay to do this because I am the same age as their children? But this is a workplace.

I consider myself a decent server. I pay attention to what the customers need and check in with the tables to make sure people are satisfied. I just want to put in an honest day's work, get my money and go home. I would be okay with this if it was my manager doing this, but it really pisses me off when co workers who are getting paid the same as me are dropping everything to yell at me and embarrass me in front of the whole restaurant. How do I get this to stop, without causing drama? Thank you!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that my mom owns a business that is well known among Koreans in my local Korean community. My concern is that if I confronted the coworkers, it may have a negative effect on my mom's business. ",06Mar2018,1
289,"I have a friend, I've never met them in person but have spoken to them for several months. They live in Quanzhou, their spoken English isn't very good, but reading and writing proficiency is very high which I why we've just chatted for months, I speak no mandarin.

The major driver of this is that they were sexually abused as a child, and their abuser has just got off free in their trial due to a lack of evidence.

They told me because it was easier than others like friends or family, apparently. They initially were looking for my blessing but we spent 14 hours going back and forth. I keep trying to get them to talk to their friends or mother with whom they are quite close, but they say they can't bear to make them worry. (I have pointed out over and over that they would prefer to worry about them than lose them.)

I have never spoken to, not know how to contact their friends and family. All I have is various messenger IDs and the city they live in. 

They have a romanticised view of doing this sometime in April.

Any advice is appreciated, I think I'm going to end up spending the next 30 days trying to talk them out of it, as it stands.

291,"So a few weeks ago, a few co-workers of mine + myself wanted to do something fun.  We're all firearms owners. So we planned a day at the range for ourselves and started to invite peple, but...

One co-worker I deliberately left out after having got into a fight with him.  It's always been my policy to stay away from people I'm angry with if I'm armed.  Even though I believe I have more than enough self control I just considered it bad practice.  So I opted not to invite him to the range at the time.  When asked about it, I even said that was the reason (that I was still feeling kinda mad and I didn't feel it was appropriate right now).  Later on we did patch our differences and probably today I'd invite him, but....

Should I be concerned for myself you think?  Was this reasonable prudence, or should I be worried for how I think?

292,"I live with my best friend and it's pretty freakin awesome. It started being a little less awesome when her drugging, broke bf moved in last month. He's used to her paying ALL his bills while he's been pursuing his ""dream job"", a failing Obama phone company, even though after three years, he still isn't self-sufficient whatsoever. Instead, just a burden on everyone else (mostly her but I have covered half of his rent and utilities so far). I get it, she loves him. It is really hard not to become an enabler in a complex  situation and just giving to a black hole when your heart's already wrapped up. Honestly, I've considered him a friend as long as I have her (4 years) so I've been trying to be a supportive friend to the both of them but I lost it last night. We went out as a house-night-out-thing and it was all good until on the way back when they got in some nonsensical argument. He was driving (on the freeway) and actually unbuckled his seatbelt, opened his door, leaned out and stuck his leg out! Said he was gonna jump and roll and leave us to crash. What the absolute fuck. 
I start yelling just that and he said he was doing it to her, not me, so I of course remind him (at the top of my lungs) that I'm in the fucking car as well and the back seat no less (since he was claiming airbags would protect us) and how dare he endanger either of our lives anyway.  As soon as we get to the first stop sign off the freeway I jump out still yelling (basically something like, ""Thank you! Now I know to never trust to get in your car ever again!"" As I start to walk down the street huffing and puffing, he also jumps out leaving my girl in the passenger seat and him still holding the keys so I went back and caught up to him, thinking i'd try to talk him into giving up the keys and at least snatch them while we talked. I'm a girl and I was ready to throw down with this taller, muscular, man right in the freakin street rather than just leave my friend in a keyless car at an intersection. Guess that was obvious 'cause he turned and immediately said, ""She has her own set of keys"". I look back and she's out, getting in the driver side  and starting the car so I say ""Well good fucking thing!"" and start walking away. He goes the opposite way and yells back, ""Thought that's what you wanted! You play with that every day!"" 
I have been battling crippling depression and anxiety and my friend basically had to twist my arm to even get me to go out with the two of them last night. I have been off and on contemplating suicide these past few months but I havn't made any attempts and if I did it'd be extremely planned and executed perfectly. Not just some b.s temper tantrum thrown by this little shit out of nowhere. I take off and when I finally come home this morning, she confesses that he pushed her, she thinks the intent was just""out of the way"" but the thing is he grabbed her two months ago for the first time which left a 3-week bruise. He made scrambled eggs this morning and apologized with a, ""sorry for last night"". What the hell can I do to get him to wake up and stop this shit? Should I throw away his testosterone boosting supplements that he clearly doesn't need? What should I say to him? I just don't want it to get any worse for my girlfriend. ",06Mar2018,59

295,"To provide some background, I'm about to quit my first job out of college after about two years and have saved up enough money to comfortably last me &gt;6 months with additional emergency funds included. I'm also in an extremely privileged position - not only will I be able to stay at home with my supportive family with minimal expenses (obviously paying my dues where necessary), but also have minimal debt coming out of a top private university; achieved through a combination of scholarships, financial aid, and family/self-funding. 

I won't get too detailed with my reasoning, as I'm aware that quitting without a job lined up is more often irrational than not and extremely uncommon. To sum it up, I went into college as an overachiever, managed to crumble and go through severe bouts of depression (abused drugs for a while, etc), somehow managed to pull a solid well-paying job offer directly out of school, and have spent the past two years working hard. Since then, i've managed to purge a lot my vices and most importantly, have regained trust and confidence in myself and my abilities; something i'd completely lost in college. 

Upon leaving my job, I intend on spending all of my free time reforming my life and getting back on track with where I want to be. I plan on keeping busy with the gym, learning new skills, reading, potentially dating, growing/utilizing my network, and working pro-bono on projects/companies that my friends are currently busy with. Note, also, that I was already spending my free time trying to be productive, though in a way, I want to make the most of the freedom I have now and to learn and grow as much as I can before this window closes (whether it's due to age and increasing pressure to specialize/attain stability, or wife, kids, etc) 

However, my biggest concern will be the lack of structure in my day to day life. I have a set routine/curriculum that I will be following but pretty much all of it will be on my own accord. What steps or tricks should I be employing to ensure that I stay on the right track? I'm not looking for a specific answer or anything, as I'm aware that a lot of my success through this will just boil down to my own discipline, though i'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation before and can shed some insight or advice on any of the above. Thanks again in advance.",06Mar2018,1
296,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm based in Ireland, I tried posting it there but could not due to  my account being brand new. Gardaí are Irish police.
Tile more or less explains it. I was renting my deliveroo account to a guy (lets call him A) for X euro a month when someone else (B) came along and offered me a higher sum. So I offered A to either increase the price or I would rent the account to B. A declined to pay me more, so I told him he could work the rest of the month and then I would start renting it out to B. For whatever reason, during the last 2/3 days of A working for me he sabotaged my account getting it shut down by deliveroo. Because of this I decided, and told him, that he was not getting his final two weeks of pay as he cost me a lot of potential money and broke the terms of our agreement (not to do anything stupid like get my account shut down). He is now threatening to go to the gardaí tomorrow to let them know I have illegally been renting out my account in my own name to someone else (whether or not he'll implicate himself I don't know). He cannot log into my account due to it being shut down, and the only tangible evidence he has are whatsapp messages between him and I. I cannot pay him his money back to stop this (I'm struggling for money and this was a serious source of income for me), so I guess what I'm asking is if he does in fact go to the guards, what can/will happen, and what should/could I do? Thank you all in advance.

I kept having to move his hand away. I told him not to take off his pants and he did anyway. I told him to take me home (I was very high) he took me to his house. To his credit, he did finally take me home when I started sobbing uncontrollably. I reported the situation to the police and charges were recently filed.

 I am asked to write a victims impact statement saying how this affected me and what I want to happen. I don’t know what should happen though really. What I want most out of the situation is for him to never do this kind of thing again. The penalty for this crime I believe is anywhere from 6mo to 2years and he’s being charged twice (once for in his car and once in his house) So he could serve up to 4 years on probation or a correctional facility or prison for this crime and have to be registered as a sex offender.

302,"Long story short we all started college, and I found four friends who I hang out with on a regular basis. Three of them I am very very close with, we're all on the same floor and planning to live together next year. 

The problem is friend #4 is a female who is dating someone, we'll call them Boromir. Boromir went to school with Friends #1,  #2, and #4 and was decent acquaintances with them, though a year older. He starts hanging out with us early on in the year but never really makes a powerful impression. The main reason is the only thing he has in common is marching band with friend #1 and #2. That's it. No other common interests or tastes. He is abrasive, an extremely lackluster conversationalist, and a sense of humor he describes as ""off-beat"" which to us means ""not funny.""

Additionally Boromir and Friend #4 are in what ALL of her friends call an unhealthy relationship. Boromir manipulates her, has attempted to cheat on her, and tries to keep her as near to him (and away from us) as much as possible. He's even said that she shouldn't go back to living in her dorm room because they wouldn't be able to make the relationship work across campus (6 minutes away from each other).

The difficult part of this is we all play dnd together. As you can imagine, Boromir is thoroughly just . . . there. We're just dragging him along and inwardly cringing when he says anything. But dnd isn't the point, it's just an event that we're all together in.

The point is, myself and friends 1-3 don't want to be friends with Boromir. We've listed as many reasons as we tactfully can, but we really like Boromir's girlfriend, also known as friend #4. 

So how do we break ties with boromir and keep our friendship with friend #4?",06Mar2018,0
303,"I'm an 18 year old student who recently (3-4 months ago) moved out on his own. I moved into a rather cheap apartment with rather thin walls, but everyone here is quiet in the night and I honestly have nothing to complain about other than my downstairs neighbor. He has complained multiple times to my landlord, she has called me, asked what's up. 

Now, the first time she called I knew exactly what's up, my chair was grinding against the floor when I would get up from the chair, I wouldn't have noticed if the downstairs neighbor wouldn't knock on his roof every time I got up. I fixed this by putting a small carpet underneath my chair. Ssince then, a new problem arises: apparent ""subwoofer"" sounds and ""war game sounds"". My landlord has called me 3 times in the past couple months about these mysterious subwoofer sounds. The thing is, I don't have a subwoofer, and I don't play games with speakers.

Today, about an hour ago, the police came to my door about a noise complaint. They told me that the downstairs neighbor had been hearing subwoofer sounds all day through the night (it's 12.45AM now). The police looked around my apartment, asked me to play some music from my speakers, and then they just said that they honestly don't know what there would be to complain about. 

What should I do in a situation like this? I plan to text/call my landlord about the police and talk to the downstairs neighbor personally. 

**edit:** It seems I forgot to mention that the first week of me living here were noisy, I was constantly building Ikea furniture in the day. After I was done with the Ikea stuff though, i've been rather quiet. I never got a complaint during the week I was moving in, or even a couple weeks after that. Since I got the complaint about the ""subwoofer"" sounds, I started having showers earlier than before, because I had a feeling it might've been the pipes. I've been changing my lifestyle as much as possible to ensure I am for sure quiet after about 8PM. Nothing helps.",06Mar2018,13
305,"So, this is a super weird, kinda complicated story. But I need help. Bad. 

I've been in college for two semesters and I have absolutely hated it. I had a full ride, but lost it after the first semester because I failed most of my classes. It wasn't for lack of trying, I just hated what I was studying and couldn't keep up. (A rough breakup with my long term girlfriend and my best friend's suicide didn't help, but that's whining for another post) So, I told my parents I was dropping out. They IMMEDIATELY shut it down and wouldn't talk about it. I didn't even get to the part where I, you know, flunked all my classes. I'm a coward, so I completely gave in. I also never told them that I failed all those classes and lost the scholarship. I was too afraid. 

I would've just told them I was still a student and not be and shittily lied about it for a semester, but I need to be a student to stay in my student housing. So I decided to only take two classes. It's a cheap university, so I thought it would work out fine. My parents still think I'm a full time student with a full ride. Then, I lost my job (This year fucking rocks, huh???). I have no way to pay my tuition. I've been on a payment plan,(student fees as a full time student are about equal to the total fees of only taking a few classes, which is why my parents weren't suspicious) but I can't keep up with it anymore. My mom told me she'd help out, which means a lot because my family is really tight on cash, but she refuses to just transfer me the money. She wants access to my university account. That means she would have free reign to look at my past grades, see that I'm only taking two classes, and know that I'm paying tuition in full, not just student fees. That CANNOT happen. And I mean, CANNOT HAPPEN.

 I know the simple answer is to tell the truth, but you really don't understand what my family situation is like. My dad regularly was violent with me growing up, I got sent to conversion therapy for being gay, didn't have a door to my room for a year because I ""didn't deserve privacy"", got screamed at if I didn't get A's, the whole nine yards. (I love my parents, they're good people. But they're also strict Mormons who care a lot about their image and lost their shit when they Sherlocked their way into finding out that I'm a massive lesbian two years ago). I'm living with them this summer, and if they know I was lying about another thing, I don't think I would be able to live with what they'd do to me. Things are good with them for the first time in years, and I really want to keep it that way. I'm so grateful that my mom would offer to help me financially with school and trust me, I feel terrible about all the dishonesty, But she can't have access to the account. 

My next pay period is coming up and if I don't have the money, I'll be screwed. I've looked everywhere for a job, but this college is in the middle of nowhere and nothing is open. There's no friends I can stay with if things go badly or I lose my current apartment. I'm so lost and I feel like there's nowhere to go from here. I'm sure there's no good answers to this question, but if anyone has suggestions I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for reading this, I'm sorry if you think I'm a bad person. I kind of am.

307,"I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for several years, living together in a 1-bedroom apartment for several of those years. We are in our late 20s. We live in the San Francisco bay area where housing prices and rent are extremely high. We do okay financially and aren't struggling to pay rent or save or anything, but buying a house is still a distant ways off unless we move or win the lottery.

Her parents are extremely wealthy. They own multiple homes, some solely as investments. They are considering buying another house in the area, and have offered to let us live in it, for free or for well below what we're currently paying.

The upsides are obvious: we'd be saving $25,000+ per year on rent, and it's a much nicer place than where we are currently, with much more space, a yard, and so on.

Downsides: firstly, it's just a bit uncomfortable for me to accept such a huge gift. We're talking multiple millions home value. Then there's the loss of independence: I don't think they would be bursting in on us unannounced, or making lots of demands of us, but they aren't necessarily the most hands-off parents either. They still passive-aggressively let my girlfriend know they don't approve of her job (it's not the most ""prestigious""), comment on what she eats, comment on her life choices, etc. Basically they've had a tough time accepting that she's an adult and she's not following the exact path they imagined for her. Currently this is kind of fine since they have no leverage or anything, but moving might change that. And lastly, maybe this is silly, but I have a sort of pride thing about totally supporting myself - it's something that's increasingly hard for people my age in the US, especially in an expensive city, so I'm kind of proud that I've been able to do well since college without much outside help at all. I guess I'm imagining explaining to my friends how I could live in a nice house, and it's not something that would feel good.

My girlfriend has similar feelings, but obviously is not uncomfortable just from the size of the gift since it's her parents. So she's a bit more on-board with the idea.

So a friend of mine tells me how she was looking at her razors and how she was thinking about cutting herself last Tuesday. 

Slight worry.

She’s gone for a day of school(Wednesday), and I text her if she’s ok. She says she’s fine, but she’s not saying the real reason she’s out. 

Worry.

Next day(Thursday), she comes to school ***in all Long Sleeves*** + a little fingerless glove on her right hand. Basically the red flash to end all red flags of self harm. I ask her if she’s ok and she says yeah, but there no way that’s true. 

Mucho worry.

Friday, and this time she’s wearing a bandana on her left wrist, and the fingerless glove, and we have gym. She’s taken off the bandana but still has the fingerless glove on her right hand. She seems normal, but I noticed she was more depressed than normal.

Excess amounts of worry.

Monday, comes and it’s obvious she’s been crying, but she’s covered that up with a bit of makeup. Very irritable and also angry with herself for being having to much socially anxiety. Around the end of the day, she’s getting her stuff to go, and I’ve already got mine. She starts crying when I ask how her day went. I comfort her for a minute since we have to get on our buses.

If worry was equal to 1 bean, I’d have enough worry to feed a starving African nation. 

So now it’s today(Tuesday), and she seems a bit better, but she’s still got the fingerless glove on her right.

How am I supposed to ask if she’s cutting herself, and what am I supposed do if she is. I don’t wanna tell anybody in the school, cause they’ll without a doubt tell some staff member, cause as a formerly cripply depressed person, I wanna respect her privacy and I’ll tell a teacher only if I’m 100% sure she’s gonna kill her self. 

Tl;dr, pretty sure a friend is cutting herself since she’s wore a glove on her right hand since she was or for a day after saying she might go back to cutting, and I don’t know how to approach the topic, and I don’t wanna tell anyone in the school for privacy reasons.",06Mar2018,4

In terms of my music atm, I primarily drum in a punk band, I write lo-fi(ish) songs with my friend, and another friend wants me to drum in an indie emo band.

316,"Hi. I would like to get advice on my career choices. 
Some context: 
I live in a controlling family in which the only way to be successful is with a career. Due to my family situation I’ve planned to move out since I was 13. I live in a third world country with shitty salaries and excessive work hours. So it’s extremely hard to get a decent job even with a career. I barely finished high school due to emotional issues and failing a lot of classes,  When I finished I was exhausted and I didn’t know what I wanted to study so I wanted to rest and figure myself out. I was 17. Of course my mother didn’t allow it and forced me to choose a career and filled the papers for me so I could present the university exam. 

I chose psychology because it seemed to me at the time that it had good job opportunities. But still I told my mother that I didn’t wanted to go to university yet because I was exhausted and didn’t know what I wanted. She forced me so I did. 

Now I’m on my eight semester (out of ten). And I’m miserable. Every semester has become harder and I just feel more and more incapable and incompetent. I can barely do schoolwork and I feel super mediocre. I’ve been thinking for a while of dropping out one semester to figure myself out and work, because I feel like I’m wasting my mother’s money. I’m not a very social person and I feel incapable of working with people and getting a decent job when I get out. 

If I don’t get a job I’ll never be able to move out. I feel stuck because I don’t have other talents or skills that I could use to get a job. I don’t want to study another career either, I feel stuck. I’m the family scapegoat so I can’t fail. 
My cousin got pregnant at 18 and only has high school education and everyone is happy. 

I feel like I’m trapped at my house for at least other 10 years. While other people are able to move out since their mid twenties. 
It gets harder to go to class and I’m extremely unmotivated. My mental health is not good and I’m going to two therapies. The thing that kept me going was that I applied for an exchange program to go to Europe. I got told that my curriculum is good but my mental health is so bad that it would be dangerous to leave here. I was counting on this trip and now that it’s almost certain I will not go...idk what to do anymore.

322,"Im a male btw

She lives around 2 hours away and the next time I see her I will be at her house. Her parents will most likely be home

Ive been talking to this girl for a long time. We met over the summer and have gone to each others dances, got each other xmas gifts and valentines day gifts, and for her birthday Im making her a claymation. We both like each other in a romantic way. I don't get to see her irl that much, and if it matters I will see her before I give her the claymation (Ill mail it later for her birthday). 

I'm also not sure if she is OK with premarital sex. Her and her family seems pretty conservative. Is there a way I can find out what her personal boundaries are without looking like a horn-dog? I obviously dont want to pressure her into sex or do it if shes not comfortable. I actually really like and care about this girl, and the last thing I want to do is alienate her. But she might not even be a virgin, I dont know and havnt asked. TBH I dont really care, I just care that shes her.

So I guess my main questions are

1) Should I tell her I want to have sex with her?  
2) How do I tell if she is ok with premarital sex / if she wants to have sex with me  
3) Im at her house, should I let her make a move and not make any of my own?  
4) Im a guy so its considered ""gay"" (at least where I live) to wait for the right person for sex. Should I tell her that I dont talk about waiting for the right person because its considered gay, and tell her that shes special to me and I want her to take my virginity?

Im not going there with the expectation of losing my virginity or anything physical happening. 

Im just kinda lost, and I dont have anyone irl I can talk to about this stuff

323,"Ok ok. So i know what you are going to say ""Just get a job"". But honestly ive tried to but it doesn't work. I want to help pay the bills and also save up so I can move out (I have permission and its for educational purposes) However we move every year (LITERALLY EVERY YEAR) and I don't know what to do. I had a job but we moved and it interfered with my education so my mother didn't want me working. I then taught myself how to edit video's thanks to a friend but got no clients no matter how hard i tried. I ended up selling my computer so I can help pay bills. Today i heard my mom get up at 3am to go to yet another job and it pained me. She wants me to do something I love, but honestly im willing to do anything. I love music, fashion, social media and films but i feel like i'd have to be much older to pursue those things. The best advice I was given was to make friends but im not sure where I should even go to do that. Im a mess and im lost honestly. I don't think I can even get a job at some standard retail store because we move all the time. I also don't want to make quick cash, I want to make a living. ",06Mar2018,1
324,"Hey everyone. I hope I could get some insight on something that's bothering me lately. So my mom has been an alcoholic pretty much all my life, and I can tell when she's drinking even when she tries to hide it. She got married recently, to someone who I don't particularly get along with, let's call him B for now. So B doesn't really have a day job, and does little stage work here and there. He watches porn when she's not home since my mom works full time and leaves the house often to take me or my sister somewhere. He isn't honest about things, and she's caught him in several lies. He has blatant and awful anger issues, and has gotten violent when they've had arguments a few times (grabbed her,  put his hands around her neck) and I don't feel safe when they start arguing. My mom can't trust B because she's been cheated on before and she's caught him lying, so that certainly doesn't help. Twice in the last few months, counting today, she's bought alcohol after being sober for quite a while. It takes a huge toll on me because they always start fighting about it, and I'm worried he's going to get violent and I'll have to step in to mediate, and I'm not the strongest person. It seems like my mom doesn't understand when to call it quits and get a divorce. I can't even talk to B about it because he has anger issues and will snap at the smallest things. I feel weak, scared, and unsafe, I'm afraid everything is going to go south once he gets home. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",06Mar2018,3
325,"So I'm a 16-year-old sophomore. Closeted bisexual and atheist. Parents have talked to me about how much they hate the LGBTQ community and how as a ""true Catholic"" I should too. When I was talking about something secular about a year ago, I don't remember what, my dad thought I didn't believe in God (I don't but downplayed it like I do) and he was threatening to kick me out or send me to some sort of conversional school. I'm thinking of running away - my grades are pretty high at a great magnet school that I could continue going to and I have a little cash saved up that I was going to use for a car. I really don't know what to do. I'm scared if I keep living with my parents I'll eventually slip - and I'll have to tell them at some point and then they'll hate me. Advice please. ",06Mar2018,4
326,"I should start by saying there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. I've had a crush on her ever since I could remember, and we haven't talked in a while. So I got curious and looked her name up online, to see if I could message her and catch up a bit on the time we didn't talk. I also searched a nickname she had out of curiosity, which is where I found her profile on the website. I'm not sure if it's BDSM or whatever that is, but it's one of those ""sexual domination"" things, which I'm pretty sure is BDSM.

Anyways, I wanted to just chat with her about stuff, since we hadn't spoken in a while, before I found her profile. Now that's kind of all I'm thinking about when I try messaging her. I know she can't really tell through text exactly what I'm thinking about, but...I don't know. I just feel weird about it. Like, she did nothing wrong, but just knowing that about her and not wanting to talk about it is kind of making me feel weird about the situation. It's kind of a situation I've never been in before.

So I guess what I'm asking advice for is how would I go about messaging her like normal without thinking about it? Like I said, it's a bit weird. But I figured Reddit would be the best place to post about it.",06Mar2018,1
329,"I know I’m sure it’s a familiar story.  I’m deathly afraid of leaving because of my child.  He’s on my insurance and I’m his only source of financial support.  Taking a dive into something I’m passionate about is basically a pipe dream at the moment.  I can’t sacrifice anything for him for my benefit.  I’m not college educated which makes this harder, I do okay right now.  I make around 60k at my job but I’m so miserable and depressed going in there I can’t even describe it.  I get zero satisfaction out of what I do.  I answer phones in a very specialized sector of the stock market and basically am a tape recorder repeating instruction.  I either need to take a new look at my current position somehow and make it fulfilling or I don’t even know what.  I try not to let it show around my son, he’s only 2 but still I want to be a positive role model always for him.  He’s the only joy in my life and we spend as much time together as we can and do everything together.  I just have this feeling that I’m meant to do more and make a difference, have more of an impact.  Anyway, sorry for the lengthy post but if anyone has been on my situation and has positive outcomes please share.  Thank you",06Mar2018,3

332,"My laptop has been very problematic as of late. I will be on it playing a game or watching YouTube and the built in keyboard shuts off. This means that if I’m in full screen on a game I can’t close it. I have to manually shut it down, which I heard is bad for the computer. This has been happening very frequently. I tried to take it to the store and have them look at it, but they either don’t experience it or just ignore it. If anyone could give me some tips or instructions it would be very much appreciated. Thanks",06Mar2018,2
