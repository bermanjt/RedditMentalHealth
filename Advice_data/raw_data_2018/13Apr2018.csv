They're all 40+ and constantly do this. I am on the verge of either quitting or bitch smacking all of them lol. What can I do?

2,"I live in an apartment complex and over the last 10 days a construction crew (hired by my apartment building, not by me) of about 10 guys has been in and out of my apartment installing a washer/dryer in every unit of my building. They have been in and out of my bedroom, which shares a wall with where the washer/dryer is being installed, letting themselves in/out while I'm at work. 

I'm a waitress, so I make cash every day, which I throw into an envelope in my top dresser drawer (the drawer is literally right next to my bedroom door). Now, maybe I'm too trusting, or maybe I just expected that these guys would OBVIOUSLY not go through my dresser drawers, but I left the cash in this drawer knowing there would be strangers in my home. I keep very good records of how much I make each day and knew exactly how much was in this envelope. A week goes by and I never even went in to this drawer, but yesterday I go to grab the envelope so I can take it to the bank, and I noticed that ONLY small bills were left, and all of my 20's, 50's and 100's are missing. I counted that $1500 cash is missing which I desperately need to pay rent/bills. I don't know exactly which day it was stolen, but I KNOW that I had it before they began construction, because I had just counted it.

Now I don't know what to do. Construction is 1/2 way done. I have told the office what happened and their first question was, ""Well do you have a roommate?"" (Yes, and I've known her for 30 years, lived with her for 5 and she's never stolen from me. She's also been staying @ her boyfriends house all week so that I could use her bedroom to sleep in while all of this has been going on, leaving me with access to all of her cash in her room.) They want me to send the property manager an e-mail stating exactly what had occurred and also recommended that I file a police report. What else can I do? Is there any hope of getting my money back? Anything I should/shouldn't say in my e-mail? Does renters insurance protect me at all? Should I think about suing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel powerless and I'm afraid that it will be my word against theirs and that I don't have enough proof. :\",13Apr2018,2
3,"I’m 27F he’s 32M. He is pretty cute TBH, but looking at girls he has dated in the past, I think he is intimidated by my looks. He even makes jokes about me being “out of his league” constantly. We have been dating for a month and a half now. Honestly, he is great. He has a great job, he’s intelligent, he has a degree, he has his own place, he’s in a band, he’s hilarious, and also very in tune with his emotions and we have super deep conversations about psychology. What’s the downside you ask? He literally can’t keep his hands off me, I catch him staring at me constantly, and he always wants to hold hands or cuddle. Like 24/7. And he’s always talking about how nice the thing I said earlier was and how much he cares about me, and how great we are. I’m not mushy, I don’t wanna hear that shit 24/7. 

I address it a few days ago via text (I said he is very intense sometimes and it overwhelms me. I was vague, didn’t go into details) he apologized that he didn’t pick up on my body language. He said he would try and be more aware of it. He also tells me he loves me like 8 times a day. I only say it back sometimes. I do love him, but I don’t think we need to say it 1000 times a day, takes away the special meaning of it. And he’s always kissing me on the cheek, while we are watching TV or movies. Sometimes I’ll move to the other couch and he will make his way over and kiss me on the head. I enjoy my physical space, and he doesn’t seem to have a sense of what that is. What on earth can I tell this man to cool it? I like him back, we are dating, why is he acting like this? If he keeps doing this is honestly going to push me away and borderline cringe me out. 

The only time he is CHILL is when he is stoned. It’s so nice when he gets high because he just sits there and doesn’t talk a mile a minute about stuff and wrap his arms around me and call me “babyy!!” I enjoy it in moderation, but geez. We see each other like 5 times a week, it’s not like there are huge gaps here. Is he obsessed with me? I just need his behavior dissected and how to properly address it. ",13Apr2018,11
4,"Hey guys,

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I work for a boutique economic consulting firm. My current role is ""senior program manager"".

They have recently asked that I head up a new office across the country. My region of focus will be Texas and its surrounding states. I will be in charge of operations and sales. I will be reporting directly to the President of my company.

We are currently in the process of developing job descriptions, and they want my title to be ""Branch Manager"". When I look up information for Branch Manager roles, it seems to be predominately bank related.

I have come up with ""regional manager"" and ""sales/operations manager"". I really am not fond of Branch manager for this role.

Any other suggestions you brilliant minds may have as to alternatives?

6,"Two years ago, I had a group of friends online that I considered to be my family. We spent so much time talking with each other and helping each other with  problems. However, I eventually added one person who slowly turned my friends against me by accusing me of things I didn’t do. I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t exactly the greatest person back then, but I definitely wasn’t the manipulative asshole he made me out to be. Eventually, he conducted a vote behind my back to kick me out of the group over a misunderstanding he never gave me a chance to explain. I tried several times to reach out to one of them and tell them what really happened, but because he’d dragged my name through the mud over false claims over the past few months, none of them believed me. Then I fell into a deep depression, partly over losing the best friends I’d ever had in my life and partly because I believed this was my fault - not all of the points he made against me were wrong. This lasted a whole year and felt so crippling I couldn’t even go to school full time and had to be held back. Now I’ve moved on, pushed them out of my mind, and stopped debating over whether what he said was true or not. 

However, lately I heard that he and my former friends had posted a collaborative webcomic we’d worked on together for a long time. This made me sick to my stomach, because this was something we’d all planned on doing together back then. He’d never have been able to do it if I hadn’t added him to the group of talented friends I’d brought together, and he’d thanked me by stabbing me in the back. Now I can’t get them out of my mind again, because if this comic ever becomes famous on the internet, I think I’ll die of regret and disgust from having him rubbed in my face all day long. I’m worried I’ll eventually snap, try to confront them again, and just go through all that depression all over again. Does anyone know how I can just accept this and move on?",13Apr2018,2

9,"I'm 29 years old, unfortunately stuck at home due to financial issues and lately my parents have been forcing me to go to places I dont want to go.

But this time it's actually threatening my job. 

I am scheduled to work and I couldn't find anyone to cover me. But my mother wants me to go to this event. I've told her for a month now that I didn't want to go. Everytime I said no, she would brush it off like she just didn't hear me. Now it's the week of, I have to work and my parents are furious at me. My dad told me I should quit my job or just not show up. I'm terrified that they're going to make my life a living hell (as they usually do when I stand up to them).

17,"I have an embarrassing amount of insecurity and the only silver lining I guess is that at least I can admit it.

My first memory of jealousy was when my brother was born. I was 5, and from being the center of everyone's attention (we lived in a multigenerational home), I was suddenly set aside.

I remember feeling threatened by an intern who did a good job and was praised by my boss.

I was always jealous of my SO's female friends who share interests with him that I don't.

And now I feel jealous of my son's nanny who gets to spend more time with him.

I just always feel inadequate no matter how hard I try. Most of the time, this insecurity drives me to be better at what I do, but then I feel guilty about treating the other person as a competitor, or sometimes I just get tired by the relentless comparing of myself.


Maybe it has something to do with my formative years being spent in a traditional school, as a top student, who was always anxious whether I'd still be ranked number 1 by the end of the grading quarter. (Yes I'm Asian.) I remember my mom throwing a chair at me because there was one quarter where I was only ahead by 0.05 points from the student ranked number 2. 

I then spent the rest of elementary, high school and college looking out for someone who might be a threat from my goal of getting the top spot. I must be clear that I never did anything unethical like sabotage the other person, but my interactions with them were always awkward. And I always made sure that for every outstanding thing they did, I delivered someting better. That thing sure worked for me while I was a student with zero social life, but now that I'm a mom and wife with a full-time job, I can't possibly be the best at everything I do. Or can I?

In literature, insecure people like me are often portrayed as villains who are deeply unloved and unhappy. But in real life, what can people like us do to change our self-defeating narratives?

I've heard it all:
- Compete with yourself
- Don't compare yourself
- Stop being selfish
- Just don't be insecure
- Have better self-esteem

And I'm pretty sure some of those things would work if only I knew HOW to do it. So, say you're not an average person, but a terribly insecure person with a competitive tendency, how would you go about fixing your mindset?

And yes I am considering therapy for this, but I was wondering if there's a way to work on it by myself. I've been to some sessions but mainly those were just to treat a depressive episode.


TL;DR: How to be less insecure if you are really really insecure",13Apr2018,2
18,"For a bit of background, I'm 18, and I was going to community college but am taking a term off because I had no idea what I want to study. I live at home with my parents. Recently I got the opportunity to go work in Australia for six months (from September to February). It's honestly the opportunity of a lifetime for me. I've wanted to travel to Australia for a long time and the program that would let me is credible, not a scam or anything. The cost is affordable for me and my parents are very supportive. I feel I could use that time to become independent, meet new people, and explore my interests.

There's two issues, though: for one, I've never been independent from my parents before. I can't drive (hoping to learn soon) and am financially reliant on them for the most part. I've never lived by myself. I have anxiety that gets kind of intense when I'm away from home, and I'm worried what would happen if I just picked up and moved to Australia. I guess I'm worried that it's too big a jump to make, or too much independence all at once. The longest I've been away from home was for a week on vacation with a friend, and I was homesick a lot.

The second issue is my dog. It sounds lame, but we adopted a rescue puppy in October that I love so much. She bonded to me a lot and I train her, feed her, potty-trained her, etc. I do a lot for her, and I don't know if I could leave her for half a year. She helps a lot with my mental health (I have anxiety and depression).

I know this opportunity is rare and I feel like I should go, but these two reasons keep me from making a decision. I've debated moving into my own apartment in my hometown to learn how to be independent but that would keep me from traveling for at least a year. 

What do you all think? Any advice is appreciated.",13Apr2018,3
19,"I live in Rome. I have been fostering this dog for over two weeks. She has been living in a shelter for her entire life and she is almost 3 years old. She is a very scared dog, even with me. Sometimes she would tremble if I were to talk to her, while crouched on the floor outside the room facing the other way. She was generally a very scared and traumatized dog. 

When we had to go potty outside I would literally have to carry her in my arms to the stairs. I live on the second floor of an apartment. She would walk by herself down the stairs. At first she was so scared of walking outside, so much that she would try to hide under a car if a person approached us. During the time with me, she started being able to walk between big crowds of people. She enjoyed being outside so much that she never wanted to go home. 

This Sunday, I was walking her very early in the morning. A car passed by too fast and scared her, she hid under a car and her harness slipped. It was still dark outside so I couldn’t see very well. I tried to get her out from under the car. Unfortunately, I got distracted when I tried to ask somebody for help but nobody was around me and I lost sight of her. I ran around trying to look for her. I asked everybody on the roads if they have seen a dog running around. And the last person to have seen her said that she ran down Via del Corso in the direction of Piazza Venezia. I couldn’t find her. 

This was the morning of a very big marathon that blocked half the city. The streets were packed with people. I tried putting up flyers immediately but nobody called. I have since posted on social media and given flyers to all the shops in the vicinity. As well as taped them to street poles and near bus and subway stations. I have been to dog parks and given flyers to every single dog-owner. I have called the local shelter and they don’t have her. I don’t know what to do anymore. She must be so scared...

Has anybody ever lost a scared, traumatized dog in a big city? What did you do to find them? What is the worst case scenario that can happen to her? What can I do so that I don’t fall into sadness and grief every time I think about her?",13Apr2018,3

I am a Freshman in high school.  My parents used to argue constantly when I was 7 to 11 years old and I heard their yelling from my bedroom.  My dad would start shit by saying that my mother was afraid of him or that she thought that he was horrible.

He never hit us, he just said awful things to us and got pissed off at us for a day or two.  Me and my little brother hated it and would go into our rooms to wait it out.  Once he got really drunk-angry and trashed my little brother’s room (he was 9).

Our mother’s incentive for us to go to bed was to not “put everyone in a bad mood” and cause a fight.  I often felt like these arguments were my fault.

 I 26F have had a lot of hard luck since last year and am in a situation where I can't afford to live on my own. Almost fresh out of friends, and scared of stranger roomies. Main option right now is to move across the country to live with my mother.

Enter 26M, my ex fiancee. We were together for almost a decade, and even after we broke up almost a year and a half ago, we've still been going on dates, sleeping together, etc..

The relationship ended 'mainly' because of HIS problems, we both agreed. (Anger issues, etc) I was coping with anxiety/depression and was ill equipped to really help him with that. He's been working on getting better. Mixed results, but not the worst. I had firmly decided on not marrying him. Most of his issues stem from his godawful family and I realized it was a package deal. But... He's always saying he wants to try again. Get married. And well... not to sound dramatic, but the idea of putting the whole country between us makes me feel like dying. 

I still love him, and part of me feels like I should just stay and keep fighting for us since I've made it this far. But the other part of me is worried I'll end up wasting what's left of my younger years...

I just need some outside perspective.

I have been dating my girlfriend a little over a year.

During this semester of Spring I have slept over my girlfriends house twice a week so we can carpool a 33 mile commute to College.

These past two weeks the mother of my girlfriend has been accusing me of breaking and entering her house, multiple times.

I have suggested to change the locks, file a police report, and/or get cameras. She rejects all of the suggestions implying that the intruder will know and will stop breaking into her house, specifically her room.

I’ve become very close with a girl, we’ve  been through a lot and have told each other many personal tales, we’re both very comfortable with one and other. This, paired with how beautiful she is has driven me to become quite fond of her in a romantic sense.

35,"So I am a sophomore in college, on my fourth semester.  I enjoyed my high school experience, made lots of friends, explored many different interests, etc.  Then I went to Northeastern University initially, where I studied abroad, and transferred.
My reasons for transferring were because it was a lot of money, and because I felt like I was surrounded by people who saw life as a chess game, and that they were 'oh so lucky to go to such a prestigious university that could connect them to a high paying job after graduation'.  I felt like I was on the fast track to being just another cog on a machine, and someone who would be sucked into a high paying job that I hate because I had already invested so much money and time into getting there.
So then I went home for a semester, went to community college, got my grades up so I could transfer to my state's best state school which would be much cheaper and have more relaxed academics.  When I was home for this semester, I got very good grades, buckled down, and made sure as hell that I could get out of the house that semester in hopes that things would be better when I could start college again out of my parents house.
Now, this semester, I still HATE college.  I started off strong, joined several clubs, and was doing very well in classes.  HATED it (still do).

I also do film club and am on the school's TV station team where I have a decently good time filming stupid little 'talk show style' videos.  People keep telling me, maybe you just don't like it because you're not involved! get involed! I am.  I also was in a fraternity at Northeastern that I did not enjoy, so don't tell me maybe greek life will be for me. ((I also made some of my best friends last year at Northeastern and miss them tremendously, but left them regardless, so don't say that maybe I just need to settle in, because I was settled in at NU!))
I hate it here.  It's a cesspool of homogenous thought and losers, and there is no opportunity for anything interesting to me.  All anyone wants to tell me about is how fucked up their friends got on st Patricks day weekend.  I want to fucking DO something with my life, not sit here and convince myself that listening to mom and dad and the tv and taking the easy way out and letting myself get hypnotized into thinking college is right for me so I don't have to deal with reality, is the best choice for me (hard sentence to read sorry).
Yeah, I know, college is a great investment.  Yeah, I know, you never know if you'll regret having that degree.  Yeah, I know, ""COllege was the best 4 years of my life!""
FUck you and fuck that.
We don't live in fucking 1950.  College was a fucking pre-internet fad and it's only going to take about ten more years until the world realizes that. Times are changing fucking scary fast and the next 20 years is gong to bring some of the coolest shit we have ever seen.  Fucking AI, cross-industry platforms, social media platforms that integrate AI that haven't even been invented yet...!   Who are pioneering these projects? People at JP Morgan who want to see your 3.0? no.  Entrepreneurs who only want to see the fire in your belly and your ability to read how people tick.  Someone tell me why the FUCK I am here, grinding through depression day in and day out without the energy or ability to even fucking maintain a casual FRIENDSHIP because I don't RESPECT myself enough to fucking DO WHAT I WANT AND LEAVE THIS SHITHOLE IN HOPES FOR A BETTER TOMORROW FOR MYSELF

P.S. edit: if I come back to school next year, I'll be able to graduate at the end of it, so only 3 years of school for a degree.^^",13Apr2018,2

39,"I never thought I’d get to the point where I’d be asking for advice on Reddit but here it goes. So today I was talking with my grandma her life, to which she later spills the beans and tells me that both my dad and my mother had previous marriages. Both lasting 5 years each. She wouldn’t give me the details of my mother’s marriage, but she noted it was abusive and their were things “my mom needed to tell me herself.” I asked my parents about it and my mother flipped her shit. 

I’m 21 years old, and this isn’t the first time they’ve hidden something from me. I found out I had an aunt and three cousins I never new about. My grandmother has kidney disease and my dad has Parkinson’s disease and my parents both have hidden the extent of which their diseases were at to which I later found out, weren’t good.

45,"Please leave serious replies to this, as it has been something that has been very difficult for me to try and handle, and I’ve gotten to a point where I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Last year I (M) met this wonderful person (F) while at school. Both of use were biology majors, pre-med, and she was absolutely, jaw dropping-ly gorgeous. I’m more of a quiet type person, and somewhat shy, so I typically take things slowly. After building up a solid friendship over several months, it started to feel like we were getting closer and closer. We’d call frequently, and these phone calls would last hours. Sometimes so long, that we fall asleep while on the phone, and wake up the next morning still connected. We were like 2 peas in a pod, and unless you really knew her, you would’ve thought we were together. My advisor (who was the coolest professor ever) even thought there was something between us.

Now as I just mentioned, unless you really knew her, you would’ve thought otherwise. See, after some time, I felt like I was ready enough to actually ask this girl out sometime. Something simple, grab a bite to eat, walk around, hang out type stuff. Nothing over the top, just casual. But there was something that just didn’t sit right in my gut, I figured it was nerves, but I just had to double check to make sure this girl didn’t have a boyfriend. Now, all along, I’m getting these feelings that she’s totally into me, and that she’s single. I base this off of our time spent together, the amount of time we spent together, and her reactions to things I’d say in convos. For example, I mentioned a job I was wanting to get after graduating to help beef up my med school application, and she she was walking ahead of me slightly, turns around with the face of pure joy and says “Oh my God, you HAVE to apply to the hospital I work at so we can work together!” Things like that. 

Anyways, I text my one buddy just like “hey, she’s not seeing anyone, right?” And his response is that she has a boyfriend. My heart literally sank, and it turns out she had been dating some guy for several years and he lived and went to school out of state, which is why I never saw her with anyone. I was devastated though, because by this point, I was really starting to fall for this girl. 

My roommate noticed I seemed down at this time, and he asked what was on my mind, so I told him everything. After some time of talking with him, he told me to just go for it, and tell her everything about how I had felt for her. This would’ve been something huge for me, like it takes me a lot to do such a thing, but given that I confided in him and trusted his advice, I went ahead and told her how I felt. Her response was that she was actually really surprised because she thought we were just that good of friends and she didn’t realize that she was my type. I was concerned that she was gonna look at me differently at that point, but she promised she wouldn’t tell anyone and that it would be between us, and she wouldn’t let it affect our friendship. 

This is all happening towards the end of the final semester, so we start studying together a lot. These study sessions led to some very deep conversations and my feelings continued to grow. There was one time we were having a real heart to heart moment, and you could literally feel the electricity in the air between us. We were sitting on opposite ends of the table, and her feet were close to mine. We talked about how we could each feel the difference of whether our feet were close to one another’s or not. And then she put her foot up on my leg, and I just grabbed it, and it was like this special moment between us that we had both felt and talked about for some time. And it continued after that with the following study sessions. Conversations would get deep, we’d get close, and you could just feel the connection. 

Every day we grew closer and closer, and I could feel my love for this girl grow bigger and bigger, and eventually I told her that. She thought maybe it was just one of those puppy love things because it was something new, but I told her I knew it wasn’t. After school finished, I moved back home, and we FaceTimed and continued to talk all the time. I continued to openly express my feelings towards her, and she continued to be accepting of them. At one point, completely unrelated to anything between the two of us, she had a big argument with her boyfriend, which lasted sometime, and her boyfriend eventually said they should just breakup, and she was devastated. To say I was happy about this is quite the opposite, as I was actually hurting for her. To see and hear her in pain, caused me pain. I reassured her that things were going to be okay, to which she tells me “I should really just marry you”. She says that word for word, and it really hits me because of how I feel about her, but I know she’s being very emotional at this point and I just tell her that she’s going to be okay. Well, about 2 days after that, she’s talking to me and how he had tried contacting her mom or something, and her mom was very upset and said that “if you’re going to break up with my daughter, it’s not going to be over text” so this girl agreed to set up a time to speak with him over the phone. They talk for some time, and eventually work things out and agree to continue to give it a shot. She calls me back to explain what happened, and she asks me “am I crazy?” And I tell her no, because in any situation, when you’ve been with someone that long you want to try and work things out. I told her I know because I had been there. And she says that she “just has to try” and that maybe the argument got bigger than it should’ve gotten because she wasn’t trying enough. 

And from that point on, I’d say things really started to go south for me. I started reminiscing about our closest times our nightly calls that would go overnight, our FaceTimes, everything. The things that continued to run through my mind was what she had said about how she should just marry me (along with other things in that convo) and our deep connections that seemed to be on the universal level. After some more time had passed, it seemed as if she was all back to normal with her boyfriend, as if he had never actually broken up with her for a brief moment. My thought process had started to turn to “okay I’m never going to actually be with this girl or get the chance to be with this girl, because she really does love him a lot” and I started to feel the heartbreak as depression setting in. She could tell things were different with me, and I told her I was having a very hard time being in the situation I was in. I’m sitting here, unconditionally loving this girl, feel ready to give my life for this girl, and yet nothing is going to stem from it. It became very hard to handle, and so our conversations started to grow further and further apart. She said that I’d just need some time and I’d get over it eventually and that someone else was meant for me. 

It’s been a year since I told her that I loved her, and my love is still there for her. We talked last night, and I told her how hard of a time I was still going through, and she said that maybe I just need to cut her out of my life or not talk to her for an extended period of time. And that really broke me down, because I still consider this girl to be my best and closest friend that I’ve ever had. She tells me this has been impacting her as well, and I feel very conflicted and even mad at myself that I just can’t be a “normal” friend to her. I knew my love for her from the beginning wasn’t some little thing, and it’s tough to feel that those feelings haven’t changed. It’s also hard to look at her as just a friend, when I still look at her as being the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. Like idk how I can be “just friends” with her. She’s the type of person who deserves everything in the world, she’s very down to earth and a very kind person, and I feel like complete shit that I can’t just give her a normal friendship. If I tell her I can’t talk to her, it’s gonna cause her to feel like absolute crap, I’m probably going to lose that friendship, and I’m gonna feel awful. Because how can you go back to even trying to be a friend with someone down the road if they told you at some point they couldn’t talk to you anymore? I’m so conflicted, and it causes me to break down just thinking about it, and I just really need some help with what to do and how to approach this situation? I’m depressed due to feeling like I’m stuck in this love for her that i can’t let go of and that won’t be reciprocated because she’s in another relationship. I’m anxious and overwhelmed because she’s also my best friend and I don’t want to cause her pain by somehow telling her that I can’t talk to her. And I’m afraid if I do so, that I’ll just never hear from her again or be friends with her again. It’s all too much for me and I really need some help and advice with what to do",13Apr2018,3

I am currently beginning my search for a friendly peterbald cat! I recently became obsessed with the breed, had  always been a dog person my whole life but now am exited to become a first time cat owner.
I've done a good amount of reaserch and I firmly believe my roommate and I could provide a peterbald cat with a great home.

I am looking to learn as much information as possible and to hopefully get some help facilitating the purchase of the cat! I am new to this and haven't been able to find breeders that are very close so if I was to travel I want to make sure I am ready and knowledgeable as possible.

As for preference I would like a female peterbald. Color/size  doesn't really matter to me I would like one that is under 2.5 years of age.

I do not have a TON of money at the moment. I do know these are very rare and expensive cats  so hopefully working out a payment plan or saving up enough so I can provide the cat with the best home is  possible.

Thank you guys I'm looking forward to reading your replies!",13Apr2018,2

I guess I just can't see any good reason why I'm sitting in class. The things I learn just seem so pointless. The thing is, I love learning. I'm a huge nerd. I love science, but currently it's my least favorite school subject because my teacher is really bad. She puts on youtube videos, gives us packets, and never really even talks to us. She grades really unfairly too. Our notebook checks are about a quarter of our grade, and god forbid you color coded your notes with red highlighter instead of blue. Don't even get me started on my math teacher. She doesn't teach, she just gives out worksheets and gets mad when you ask her a question. The rest of my teachers are great. My English teacher is a really good teacher, and she can keep everyone interested during class, but despite the good teachers I have, I honestly feel like school is making me dumber. I used to love learning new things, but now I'm just trying to retain enough information to do well on tests, and then forgetting it all right after. That's not learning. That's mindlessly regurgitating whatever comes out of the teacher's mouth.

I'm really ambitious in all other aspects of my life. I'm 14, and I'm going to every business in my area that will hire minors and picking up job applications. I also plan to play my guitar downtown over the summer and get some good tips. I am extremely motivated to be successful in life, but I just don't see how school will give me the success I'm looking for. I know high school is important for getting into colleges, and I want to get into a semi-decent school, but I'm not trying to get into Harvard anytime soon. I want a business degree, and I'll probably want to go into sales or possibly even start a company, although I acknowledge that can be pretty risky. 

I just can't find the will to do my homework or study for anything. I didn't realize how bad it was until I completely bombed a big math algebra because I couldn't motivate myself to study. I don't understand half the shit in that class because I cannot get myself to pay any attention. I'm in 8th grade, and I'm just waiting for it to be over. I don't like being at this tiny school I'm at. The high school I'm going to is huge. It looks like a college campus. And that's what I want. There's over 100 clubs and really cool classes you can take. I am motivated for high school. I was never really motivated for middle school. I went through a lot of difficult shit during my middle school years. It's a chapter of my life I'd rather forget forever. But I've been getting my life together, and high school is an amazing new opportunity for me. However, if I keep up the laziness and lack of study skills this year, I could be screwing myself over for the years to come, and my parents have really high expectations of me. Both my older brothers have always been straight A students who always put tons of effort into their schoolwork. I'm expected to continue that trend. My parents haven't caught on yet that the reason my grades are dropping is because I'm so lazy and do not care about school, not because I have unfair teachers.

He eventually asked me about someone who he thought I had a crush on, and I said no, it wasn't the guy he thought. He then proceeded to play the guessing game by naming off every guy in our school (our school is a tiny charter school, there's 32 total students so everyone knows everyone and word spreads around quickly, yada yada). He eventually got down to himself and I had to admit yes. Keep in mind that I was friends with him this entire time so I felt comfortable. He then started asking why, and I said I didn't know, that he was just that type of guy. I had to hang up to do chores really quick, but I texted him back with ""You want to know why I like you?"" and then wrote a few sentences explaining my feelings. He then called me back and I answered, and we continued talking as if nothing had happened.

Eventually, he started saying that he was ugly and I denied it and actually surprised myself with what I said (something along the lines of: ""Try to think of specific details that you think are unattractive..."" ""...You can't think of anything, therefore there is no reason why you should think you're ugly, [his name]"" etc etc). After this, he said that I was the pretty one, and I was flattered. He then told me that he only says that to girls who deserve it, and that he hadn't said it in a while.

He continued making cute comments, asking me why I was so cute, and also reassuring me about my makeup (""I hear you complaining about your makeup to your friends and I'm like 'Why?' There's nothing wrong with anything, in my opinion you don't even need any"").

When I was 7-10 years old I was molested and manipulated to have sex with my older 18-21 year old male cousin MANY times. I didn’t want to do these things but I felt as if I needed to as he talked me into it and gave me no other options. 

I am now severely embarrassed and ashamed of the things I did. I told my mom and older sister about this when I was like 11 and my cousin denied it. My cousin is now a full out homosexual and out of my life completely. He denies everything and told my mother and sister that I made it all up. His mother also denied everything until about a year or two ago. I told her I want nothing to do with her as she still supports him and basically told me “he’s gay what do you want me to do?” when I spoke to her about what happened. 

I haven’t seen him since I told my sister what happened.

I have never had confidence with women. I have never had a girlfriend. I have made out with girls and gone on dates but that’s it. When a girl gets close to me I push her away or am afraid of her. I don’t know what to do. I am lonely and want to be with someone. I also want to kill the person who did this to me.  I want him to suffer. 

He killed me at 7 years old and doesn’t deserve to breathe. I don’t know what to do with myself.

Sometimes we are so incredibly happy and I enjoy his company.

77,"Just some quick background information. I'm 19 years old, I live with my parents and 'm not at risking being homeless, I'm currently saving up some money to move out and live my life independently. I've been working full time roughly 38 hours a week for a little over 2 months making a little above minimum wage (11$) at a job extremely close to where I live. I do not go to school. I feel this is relevant because maybe I'm being naive and don't understand how good I got it. Anyway to get to the dilemma.

I'm a busser at a casual chain restaurant in my town. I have absolutely no problems with my work itself. Its straight forward, the physical labor I can handle and the environment is chill. I'm always on time, I never slack, and I'm always willing to stay after my shift if asked which I have been.
I work alongside 2 other bussers, usually by myself or with 1 other at time, rarely all three of us. 1 of them is super chill, works hard, and very friendly, hes been there maybe 6 months longer then I have. 

Now to the other busser. He was hired same day I was. Completely shit attitude, complains, always on his phone or talking to the hostess. Now I'm mature enough to cope with it, I mean in the end it only makes him look like shit so whatev. But sometimes if were both bussing I end up picking up his slack, and if were closing together it really does delay us so that kinda does bother me. I'm not a whiner and I know management has taken notice so I don't really say anything. 

Last week he stole a wallet. He found a wallet while bussing a table. Protocol says stop immediately what your doing and bring it too a manager or back office. He finished up his table, brought it back to me and was bragging about finding it and talking about what hes gonna do with it. He opened it up and was showing my credit cards, IDs, money, all of it. He went on to hide it in one of the racks we put glass cups into to be washed. I told the other busser and he told the manager, the other busser took it from the rack and brought it in. 

This is getting pretty long now so heres how it stands

They didn't fire him claiming because he didn't put it into his backpack he didn't steal, the rest of the story is just my word against his and they said thats not enough. 3 days later I put in my 2 weeks notice and explained why IE: the wallet incident. I was told by my manager that they rather have me stay then him and told me to wait a couple days. We talked again today and she said they can't fire him without probable cause. She praised my work ethic saying she took notice and asked me to reconsider. I can say I'm leaving over my morals but in reality I just wanna see this slacker fired and pissed they didn't. Am I being petty?

I am doing my job remotely now, however the working from home (now multiple states away), lack of ""office presence"", and in-person relationships has pushed me to the point of finding another position (of which I was hired for today). 

My boss is a very good friend and she reached her neck out to keep me during the transition to CT. I have attempted to call her 4 times between yesterday and today to explain to her why my numbers are garbage and/or non-existent (I have been interviewing w/ multiple places at various times so almost no time for current position this week).

I have discussed my feelings regarding a change of position in the past month, to which she recommended I just give 100% now until I find somewhere in which I able to thrive and really enjoy my work. As I have searched for that this week, my current work has fallen to the wayside.

How do I go about this conversation tomorrow (today, technically) in which I quit? I am a very honest person and obviously want to make clear that this is business, not personal. It just may be a bit more for her because she owns/runs her own business, so my job performance this week tells a tale of me very much not doing my job.

83,"I have a job that I like. It's super-easy, I am left alone, there is zero stress and I can pretty much spend the whole day reading, most days. On the flip side, there is no advancement opportunity, it's only part-time and I make just barely over minimum wage. I've been there for about a year.

This week I started a second part-time job which is basically my ""dream job."" It's in the legal field which I went to school for and what I want to do as a career. I've only worked there 3 days so far, but my boss seems nice and says I'm doing good. If I can last at this job it would become a career. I make more money there and would be able to bring my dog to work if I worked full-time.

Today my new boss asked me if I would put in my notice at my other job because she wants me to work for her full-time. This is good news! But I am worried about the stress of this new job. I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up and could wind up getting fired or burnt out. If I leave the other job, I will not be able to get it back.

So from there she was taking photos while I was grabbing previously printed photos. I believe I had made some joke she laughed and when I looked at her I saw more than my boss. From there I noticed her eyes how beautiful they shined in the light, how when she smiled my heart melted, how her giggle made my heart race. If she accidentally touched me I’d  nervous as well as get a tingling sensation from it. 

From there I made it my mission to make her happy but to also to see if she could possibly have feelings for me as well. So far whenever I glance at her and just look a little to long she looks back and smiles at me. Whenever I joke or make faces at her about customers she giggles, busts out laughing or calls me annoying while laughing. She also stands very close to me while we are trying to get people to try the photos. Thing is she’s talked to me about her ideal guy, and how many kids she wants.

86,"I don't mean to brag, but I am a very giving and kind person to my friends... It has caused me to be hurt in the past, so this is something that weighs on my mind, especially with one whom I try to make efforts to interact online, such as sharing music or tagging him in interesting posts with no response from him 95% of the time. He says he checks them out when he has the time, but usually his attention span is too short to look at whatever I sent him; he said something along those lines. Which is fair for things that are over a minute in length, but I send him things under a minute too, and find out he didn't even bother to look at them for that long. He spends much of his time playing video games or practicing music by himself, I don't see why he wouldn't take the time to check out something that his friend finds interesting or thinks would interest him.

I would assume that this person is just someone who doesn't like me if this is the only way we interact with each other. But we hang out often, and generally have a good time when we do. But I always provide something that he enjoys, usually at least a few tokes of a bowl or two, sometimes beer, food, video games, movies, etc. Wonder if he actually likes me or just likes the way hanging out with me makes him feel.",13Apr2018,2

91,"One thing I've had to do a lot over the years is respond to someone who is very, very out of sorts and unhappy and is turning to me for either comfort or company. 

The problem though, is that I feel during these kinds of interactions, that person is not taking any steps to deal with their mood or move towards recovering. For example, my most recent phone call(s) tonight with someone:

* First call, they are hot off of very depressing news (they won't be able to do something they've been wanting to do for a long time, potentially not for several years if ever.)
* I console them and tell them I'm sorry it didn't work out, I'm proud of them, I love them. 
* I shoot the shit with them for about an hour. They don't really cheer up, and they get in their own head about it. I tell them to try and eat something, and we take a break from talking so I can eat dinner.
* When I come back, they still haven't eaten and are not hungry/going on about how they don't deserve to eat. I point out that that's crazy since they've also recently accomplished something great (getting into an MS program at a top-tier uni). 
* It doesn't work, and I get really frustrated and plead with them to please at least take the basic step of self-care and eat something. They won't, and then they feel guilty for making me frustrated and hang up on me.

I really don't like having to give up for the night on people who get like this, especially because usually when this happens they're someone I care very deeply for. 

It brings my mood down with them, and then I also basically have my evenings soured. I work 9 hour days at the moment and have very, very little time to myself. All of my hobbies have fallen by the wayside or been completely eliminated from my routine because of how little time I have to myself, partly because I spend 3-5 nights a week in this depressive rut of talking this person down from themselves because I love them and they've perpetually got something getting them down, whether rational or irrational (usually a little of both.)

I am leaving the details vague because as a rule I don't post anything about my relationships online anymore, and also because this isn't an uncommon dynamic in my close relationships. I am hoping I can get advice to better cope with these kinds of situations, though I am afraid it's probably going to be something along the lines of ""stop coddling people and take your me time"".

93,"Hey all this one's a long post. There is a TLDR at the bottom!

My boyfriend and I met in high school in the midwest and have been dating since we turned 18. We then went away to college: me to NYC \(the place it has been my dream to live since I was 14\) and him to Arizona. We've been long distance throughout college really successfully and are more in love now than ever before. We are now seniors about to graduate. The plan has always been for me to move to Arizona once we graduate this May \(in about 6 weeks\) in order to close the gap and me for to stay there with my boyfriend for a year while he finishes up an extra year of college to get his graduate degree.

Here's the problem: as much as I want to be with him and as much as I love him, I'm desperate to stay in NYC. I absolutely hate the city where he lives\-\-it's boring, hot, and reminds me of the midwestern city I escaped when leaving for college. After nearly 4 years in New York I finally feel established in my friend group, I know exactly which neighborhoods I love, and I have a lot favorite places to go out to and things to I love to do for fun. It took me this long to get adjusted to living here and now I feel like I'm being prematurely forced to leave. I'm devastated that I'm abandoning what feels like my home and I'm really worried about starting over\-\-it's really important for me to have a group of friends, but it can be hard for me to make new ones.

In my perfect world, he would move to NYC with me this year\-\-but he's committed to finishing his masters degree in Arizona. I'm really worried that I'm going to move to Arizona and resent him for the entire time we live there or that I'll be really miserable there for the whole year. My boyfriend is the love of my life and we've talked about all of this before, but the closer we get to the moving date, the more I start freaking out about completely changing my life.

What should I do? Should I move to Arizona after all? Should I stay in NYC for another year while he finishes his degree and prioritize my own happiness? \(I think that may break his heart\)  Is there some sort of middle ground?

\*TLDR\*: I feel like I'm being forced to move to a city I hate in order to close the distance. I know in my head that I'm being selfish, but every time I think about actually leaving NYC and my life here, I start panicking because I love everything about my current life\-\-apart from being long distance.

I've tried to be nice to him or try to guide him into a different path of not being so awkward you drive people away from you (majority of us do not like him and can't stand speaking to him due to the awkwardness involved in every conversation with him).

I used to think my family was the typical strict Asian house hold parenting, but as I get older I am realizing that they are the cause of my depression. 

They are worse than typical tiger parents. For example they have no idea, nor care, that I've been depressed and suicidal and seeing a therapist. They can also screaming their lungs out at me, then the next second I'm gone be joking and laughing behind my back. Then continue to talk shit about me. 

They dont care about me in any sense other than I get good grade, clean, and support them in the future. Also I've met friends for 3 days and they know more about the internal me and my emotions than my parents. All they seem to care about is how much money I cost them, and how much I will make for them in the future. 

There are too many events to account for... I've been locked out of the house at the age of 11 and locked in the garage at night for not finishing my dinner as a child. Physical punishment is also normal. I know that I am mentally a strong person. I have been, being raised in a typical asian house hold. I rarely cry or break down under intense stress.

As I am now an adult in college (I pay for my education entirely myself and a few other bills) I see that my parents are still over bearing and threaten me like a child constantly. I literally have to pretend everything in front of them. Expression of any negative emotion ends up with abuse 
 me being yelled at and threaten to be thrown out on the street. 

They also dont think logically in any sense. They can be mad at you because they want to be and ""They're my mother/father"" so no logical reason is needed.

Over all the only way I can survive in this house is by being a literal doll with no emotions and perfect in every way and I can't stand it anymore. How I have to live now is effecting everything (school, work, relationship, health) and developed my depression and suicidal thoughts. 

This may not seem bad to some people based on my description (I probably just can't remember all the bad shit because I suppress it and most of my childhood), but it has worn down on me. 

I've been wanting to leave this family and live on my own, but they still pay for stuff like insurance and housing. I dont know where to begin and how to leave. 

TLDR
I have parents worse than tiger parents who cause me to have severe mental break downs. How do I leave and support myself?",13Apr2018,2

Then, in the throes of psychosis, I decided that contacting him was a good plan. (Narrator: It was not a good plan.) This spun into obsessively contacting him once a day for about 2 weeks until my antipsychotics kicked in and I got the help I needed in all areas.

113,"I'm usually a pretty frugal guy despite wanting a lot of things I've always been able to control myself, but I've been working a lot and now I have some cash floating around. 

Essentially the ""money burning a hole in my pocket"" sort of feeling.  I've already made a big payment on my house.

So now I'm really fighting the itch to buy something I want.  I've bought a couple guns but now my focus is on an old car or motorcycle which I've always wanted and think about daily.  It's been easy fight these feelings in the past but it's getting harder now that I'm making more. 

I'm also getting a good amount back on my taxes, which my wife has claimed most of, lol.

She's usually the voice of reason when I start talking about buying things but she says she okay with the car/motorcycle idea.

Idk, I'm struggling with this because they're are more important things I could spend it on (house, retirement, baby funds) but I've been so strict with my money the past 8 or so years that it's getting harder and harder.

I've set up looking at a motorcycle and almost contacted a guy about a car but stopped myself and I feel self conscious about going to look at this motorcycle ( it's only$700).

124,"I know this sounds really silly. I'm 25. I'm an adult, and I'm VERY uncomfortable with nudity/sexuality... To give you an idea, I don't even like watching movies with sex scenes in them. Sometimes I look up parental ratings before I see a movie, and if it seems like it will be too much I don't watch it. I live in a pretty conservative and rural area, and I grew up kind of sheltered. I've never been to a strip club because the idea upsets me for some reason (I don't really know why). When people talk about going to strip clubs, I get really uncomfortable... Even when people check someone out and say, ""oh they're hot"" it makes me feel weird in a way I can't describe.  

I understand at concerts people have a tendency to wear less clothes. That's ok. I can usually suck it up and handle it because I love music. Plus, where I live it is against the rules to be topless/nude at most concert venues so I am usually able to avoid the stuff that I don't like.   

However, I am planning a trip over the summer. My boyfriend and I have birthdays within a month from each other, so it's sort of a present to both of us. I got us tickets to a Rob Zombie/Marilyn Manson concert, and we're both *really* excited. I looove Manson but I've never seen him live, and my boyfriend loves Rob Zombie. It seemed like a great idea, but then I realized something: this concert is out of state. Meaning, different (and likely less strict) rules. I probably can't avoid seeing all the stuff that I don't want to. And this terrifies me. I feel so childish that I am getting as bothered as I am by this. I don't know what is going to happen or how much I am going to see. I didn't think this through, and I'm really scared. I'm literally in tears thinking about it.   

This type of stuff is stuff that I hide from the rest of the world because I know it's not normal. I know I'm not supposed to feel this way about stuff like this.

125,"I’m on mobile so I apologize in advance if this is messy. 

So, let me lay the groundwork for you:
Since I was hired, it was with the understanding that Sun. and Mon. I am unavailable to work. There was no back and forth to land me these days off, I went in to the interview and said “I’m available Tuesday thru Saturday” end of.
My coworker is in a similar boat but is unavailable Saturday and Sunday.
Recently, the fourth person on staff quit so us three remaining (manager, coworker, and I) had to cover some shifts *temporarily* while the manager found a new hire.
During this time, the manager was covering Sundays with me but decided they’d rather do something else and signed up for a sports team on Sundays (IMO they did this purposefully so they wouldn’t have to work on Sundays, I say this because they implied in so many words “I’m the boss so I can do what I want and I don’t want to work weekends”), which left myself and my coworker to be on Sundays.
A miracle happened and a staff from another store location decided to move where we are located and so (it was assumed) that this person would be taking on the spaces we had been temporarily filling.
Now that the time is coming closer to that staff moving to our location (in May) it is beginning to seem like we aren’t getting our regularly scheduled shifts back. 
I’ve been pretty vocal about wanting things to go back the way they were, but the manager is really obstinate about scheduling us around our unavailability and is now “committed” to their sports club so is unwilling to work it out. Even though they were before, the most flexible with their schedule out of everyone.

The three most evident options to me are:
1) pitch having the store closed on Sundays - it’s by far our slowest sales day and no one seems to want to work it.
2) pitch having shorter hours on Sundays so manager can make it to their sports club (starts at 18:30, we close at 18:30 regularily) and still cover.
3) suck it up and accept the shitty schedule (working Sundays as well as two other days, staggering my days off throughout the week)
4) just f*cking quit cause it’s not worth this much stress over something that any other workplace would respect without question.

My question is, what do I do? My manager wants to sit down with me and chat about my schedule and I’m at a loss of how to covey this to them respectfully.

126,"Hey reddit, I need some help.
This might be better in r/legaladvice but I wanted to try here first. 

TLDR: My doctor just called me at 10 tonight, and informed me that the invasive medical procedure that I just had done, per her urging advice, was ultimately unnecessary,  due to a laboratory error. 
I’m apparently still supposed to pay for this.
I’m furious. 
And this has been an emotional rollercoaster. Without being too specific, let’s just say the word cancer was used a lot, in reference to the procedure they insisted I needed to get right away. 
Is this at all okay and who do I call? Is this something I should report somehow?

And how can they make me pay for this, still? When I wanted to do more testing and wait, in the first place. 



More details: 

So not only, have I had my body surgically invaded due to an “error”, the procedure that I did not need, may affect my fertility later on.

I was informed of this increased risk, but because the “severity” of what the doctor said was going on- I needed to get it done right away to preserve my health and not go on to develop a more severe or widespread cancer. 

I hoped to have another child sometime in my future (should things pan out that way) and this procedure can elevate your risk of preterm labor/miscarriage. 

I took that risk because I kinda planned on being around for the son I already have- more than I wanted to have more kids.

In total, I’ve had biopsies done twice.
First time, they said things weren’t great but they weren’t “urgent” they wanted to check again in a year.
We do that, and they want more biopsies.
We do those biopsies.

About a month after those ones, they’re urging me to get this procedure done, right away. Things look much much worse than we expected, doc says. 
I begged for one more biopsy. Wait for 4-6 months and check again.
Nope. Do it now, don’t take the risk! 

So now I’m sitting here, after months of inner turmoil about cancer this and cancer that- I get the procedure, I’m at home, took two days off of work for it (and wouldn’t ya guess, I’m an hourly wage low income single mom, too- so every hour fucking counts for me) and I get a pretty serious allergic reaction to some fucking medication they gave me and I am STILL covered in a goddamn rash head to toe and I have been itching, cramping/bleeding from the procedure, stressed as FUCK waiting to see if this is all worth it and hope they got it all out of me
And then she calls. 

WOOOOPS! 
Good news, the shit we took out of your body tested all clear and gravy, because we kinda fucked up in the first place...
So yeah, hope you have Medicare. 

I don’t. 

I’m one of those fun groups of people that make $150 too much a year for any sort of financial assistance.

129,"Hello all,

Hoping to get some advice from you all. 

I have lived in an apartment for a year with a roommate, who recently moved out to go live with their partner. I just renewed the lease for myself and my partner, who's moving in at the end of the month. The apartment building is privately rented (no big corporations or complexes.) 

When my roommate and I were living here, we had two assigned parking spots. When my roommate moved out, I figured my partner would just take her parking spot. There is a nearby parking lot and street parking nearby for guests. I should note that currently my partner and I have one lease that lists ""one parking spot"". Both our names are on the lease so the ""one parking spot"" specification is a little bit vague. 

 A neighbor from a nearby unit has the same guests over frequently (mom and girlfriend) and they are constantly taking our second parking spot, as well as bringing loud animals over and making lots of noise. (Our lease actually says you can't have animals on the premises...but that's a different story.) This isn't currently an issue for me since my partner is not here yet. However, since my partner is moving in soon, today I talked to one of the frequent guests (the neighbor's mother) and let her know we would need the parking spot starting at the end of the month. She insisted that the neighbor used to have an extra parking spot ""in the lease"" and that because she is family to the neighbor, they deserved a spot, despite them not being on the lease. When I mentioned that my partner and I were both on the lease and that the spots were ours, the mother smirked, said ""We will see,"" and slammed the door in my face. 

Asshole mother also had a big problem with me moving in last year, as I recall, because I suddenly took her parking spot. Which she's not entitled to because she's not on the lease. 

Last week the neighbor himself approached me about maybe ""doing a rotation on the second spot."" I spoke to the landlord at that time over the phone who assured me that the two spots would still belong to me and my partner. The neighbor already has their own assigned spot for his own car - it's just that the neighbor's guests want our extra spot. The landlord said that the neighbor's guests would just have to park elsewhere.

After the incident with neighbor's asshole mother, I talked to the landlord again who told me to ""work things out"" with the neighbor and maybe alternate who got to use the spot.  He said that the neighbor is a long-term tenant who he'd like to keep and that unfortunately the asshole mother is part of the package. (Again, this asshole mother isn't even on the lease.) He also said he'd like to keep us as long-term renters. I told him that my understanding was there were two spots for my partner and me, but he quickly changed the subject. This was all over the phone. 

Redditors, help me. What the hell should I do?  This apartment is a great deal in a very expensive coastal city -  but the asshole mother's entitlement over the parking space, plus the lack of guaranteed parking space for my partner, is a real downer. The landlord isn't really taking our side one way or another.

My partner hasn't been present to sign the lease yet, so he's considering using this whole incident as leverage to not sign the lease since he's not getting any added benefit beyond what a guest would get (i.e. if the asshole mother, the neighbor's guest, can park there and apparently live there during the day without being the lease, why shouldn't he also just be a guest and live there without being on the lease too.) This also leaves him more room to find a place  for us that is close to both of our jobs, depending on where he can find a job. Good plan? Bad plan? Should I just pop the asshole mother's tires instead (I'm kidding)? 

Side note: I'm also extremely annoyed that the neighbors thought they could just take advantage of me and try to take the spot once my roommate left. I may be petite and baby-faced but it doesn't mean I'll put up with their shit. ",13Apr2018,2

UPDATE! #2 (2018-4-13)

It's been two entire days since I posted my first update and I finally have something to share. I pretty much did nothing the day after posting this except for laying in bed and thinking about everything that just happened. This morning I finally decided to man up and confront my Mom about this issue simply because I had no other options. It didn't go too well the first time because I got too emotional and started yelling at her. Not only did I not get the point across but I also made her cry for the first time in my life. Few hours later when I returned to my senses I went to my Mom and I apologized to her. This is when I was finally able to sit down and share everything with her. She also openly said everything she wanted to. We talked for at least 2 hours and lots of things were revealed. Most of the things that she told me were things I NEVER EVER wanted to hear but the fact that she finally told me the truth makes me feel a lot better. I'm not going to tell you everything in depth but here are the major points that I finally know now.


1. My father is a piece of shit and he has been cheating on my mother countless times for the past year. She showed me pictures of his text messages and everything.


2. My father treats my mother like shit and has even hit her a few times. She showed me two marks on her back today. It's only happened twice over the past year but it's definitely a thing.


3. My Mom told me that she does have feelings for me and she's had them for a few years now.


4. Everything from how she was acting recently to how she was dressing was indeed for me.


5. She admitted to taking those picture of me as well and said she enjoyed looking at them


Now here's the thing. I am honestly still uncomfortable as hell but the relationship and love I have for my mother is still very much intact for me. She has been my best friend my entire life and helped me with so many things. Like I said in my previous update, I can never just run away from her or treat her like trash. A few hours ago My Mom and I called my Aunt and we asked if we could stay at her place for a while. My Aunt has no idea about the stuff between my Mom and I but she now knows about my father. She has 2 extra rooms in her house and is willing to let us stay for as long as we want. She'll be coming to pick us up in the morning and we will both leave with our stuff without telling my father. Once we get to her house I will help my Mom relax and then get a separation from my piece of shit father. Then when all of that stuff is over I'll deal with all the other shit depending on how long everything takes. I was extremely confused and going crazy the first day I posted this but now that the truth is here, I am definitely feeling a lot better. I really really love my Mom and I want to help her no matter what. I have pretty much accepted the fact that she has feelings for me at this point and nothing I do will ever change that since they've been there for years. I will give her all my love and attention and I will update this post the next time I have something to add. The next time I do update this will be from my Aunts house.",13Apr2018,10
141,"So my sister and I are very similar despite our ten year age gap. Both indecisive, sensitive people with a rather similar skill set in media and design. She has started and not finished four uni degrees, myself two and we both work in the same company. She has previously quit the company due to mental health/stress and came back in a role with less hours and responsibility. I quit earlier this year due to a bullying issue which wasn’t being fixed (another story in itself). I have been offered my job back as the person who was the instigator of this bullying has finally resigned and my mum (who also works in the company) is talking me out of it saying if I don’t want the job my sister would love it. I’m now incredibly torn because if I take the job my sister remains unhappy in  her position (and may leave completely and jeopardise her mental health) or I don’t take it and risk remaining unemployed. I do have another option I could take in a different field but there’s no current jobs available there and I am still not sure what I’d prefer to do in my life (toss up between media and childcare).

142,"I'm approaching the end of high school and I find it extremely terrifying that after high school ends, I would be able to go out and do anything that I wish and that I would have nothing to motivate me to go out and meet new people.

I have 3 friends that I talk to frequently at school but the friendship we have isn't the very close type of relationship as we cop alot of each other's verbal abuse quite often because we are immature teenagers and we have nothing better to talk about. Overall, it feels like we have the potential to be extremely close and be completely comfortable around each other but everytime I think about trying to be closer with each other, I could never think of an appropriate way to say it.

There are plenty more people outside of the 3 friends that I would like to get to know better but I don't know how to progress the friendship without seeming extremely nosy trying to get to know them better.

I'd love to have extremely close friends who I can rely on and ask for advice.

146,"So it appears my girlfriend had someone spike her drink today. It all points at her female co worker. Apparently the pharmacist I spoke to said the drugs would already have passed through her system. Mostly because I got off at 23:00 and she blacked out at about 12:00 Earlier in the day. And all was blank till she got home at 19:00. I got a report of how she was acting while I was at work and my roommate thought she was just insanely drunk. But i woke her up to figure out why she was acting like a tweaker i.e. wandering around the house looking for cigs while she was holding them, then calling me saying I need to go pick her up even though she was at the house, texting nonsense, trying to smoke weed out of a coffee mug. Then just out cold till I got home after that I took her to get tested to see if I could maybe see what someone slipped her which is when the pharmacist said it would already be out of her system.

In the weeks prior to her disappearance, we would talk literally everyday. She told me about how she had already attempted suicide multiple times. And then one day she just stopped logging on Discord- it's been a month since. I am seriously afraid that she had taken her life, because I don't see any other reason why she won't log on.

152,"Ok so it’s happened twice now with two different girls and I’m not sure if it’s me or the circumstances that lead to my issue. I just couldn’t get it up. I know this is an inherently funny topic but I’d really like some mature responses.

TL;DR: when out in new environments while I’m stressed out, hungry, and exhausted I can’t seem to get hard. Is this my circumstances or do I have a problem?
To be fair I’ve had sex with one girl before countless times lasting to completion, so this problem is new for me.

The first time I was in a place I’d never been before with a girl I’d never had sex with before. I’ve noticed that new environments, especially ones inhabited by multiple people, just freak me out. It was super late at night, I was exhausted, starving, and I’d already jacked off that day. I was already so nervous but I just couldn’t get hard. She came on my face and that was the end of that.

Second time was tonight with my now girlfriend and I knew even before I got there that I wasn’t going to be able to do it (I could just feel that my drive was totally down. Plus I’d been super stressed all day, and was super hungry). It was the same circumstances as before, new environment with someone I’ve never had sex with before. When we’ve fooled around before I’ve gotten totally hard, but that was in my house. I was going to her house, which I’d only been to once before. Not to my surprise I was just not getting hard, so I just fingered and ate her out as best I could. She wanted more but thankfully we were cut short by her mom.  
I guess the fact that it’s happened twice now is really doing a number on me. Is the issue me or my circumstances??",13Apr2018,1

156,"So I didn’t get the job. I didn’t even get an interview. I’ve been waiting by my phone the last three weeks and checking my email every hour. Of course they will call me, I’m the perfect candidate. I applied literally the day the job was posted. Went in that week and chatted briefly with someone in a similar position (hospitality tourism related job) put in a good word for myself. Told her it would be my dream job, etc. She was excited I stopped by and said she’d put in a good word for me

All I ever got was an email confirmation that they got my app. I was soooo confident they were going to call me but nope. Weeks go by.. (I’ve heard these types of places can take a while to pool apps, but I’m kicking myself for not going in sooner). I popped in again today and to see what was up, the HR lady wouldn’t even come down to tell me to my face. Over the phone, she had the lady at the front tell me that the position has been filled. What a slap in the face. I kept my cool and extended my hand to the lady at the front and once again expressed my ~~excitement~~ gratitude before leaving. I’ve been a complete mess. Angry. Sad. Second guessing myself. Second guessing everything on my resume 

Now, I know this sounds a little crazy but I’ve seen  a couple mainstream news articles about a controversy in the job world where the need to be pro-diversity is taking precedence over ones own qualifications. I know I sound “entitled” saying this, but I have been having a tremendously hard time finding a job. I am a white male and I can’t change this. I can’t help but feel like something like this is at play; some breed of nepotism. 

Now, of course I don’t know for sure. But part of me is mad. I need to wait a couple days, but I want to follow up with this particular HR lady.  I’ve applied three times now and never gotten an interview. I want to know why god dammnit. Is there any way to do this tactfully, or is this a huge no no?

Part of me wants to subtly call her out on her bull shit and not even coming down to tell me herself that they hired someone without even interviewing me. Any thoughts? (I can pm more details if you simply think it’s because I want qualified)",13Apr2018,2

158,"In the past 3 weeks my life has complete fallen apart. It started 3 weeks ago(2 days before my birthday) when my wife told me she was unhappy and wants a divorce. I wanted to try and fix things but she said it was impossible. Over the course of our 4 years together she said she's grown to dislike being around me. Finds me annoying and boring. She says she still loves me, but can never be in love with me again. Our lease ends in 6 weeks, so we don't have a lot of time to divide everything up. But, she's definitely taking our dog.

Less than a week later, I was t-boned leaving work. I suffered a concussion(including memory loss) and multiple bruised ribs. It causes me extreme pain even to breathe. Plus, my car was completely totaled. I had to miss multiple days of work. Considering I need to move into a new place by June, is especialy bad.

And to finish off my 3 week hell, 2 days ago, my best friend(who I've know for 25 years and was planning on rooming with), decided to text my wife and ask her if she'd want to hook up now that we're divorcing. The fucked up thing is he was one of the only people I had talked to about getting divorced so far. I trusted him and talked to him about everything. After that, I told him to never speak to me again.

162,"So this has been really big problem for me and I'm seriously really ashamed of this (I even did this new account just for this). I haven't told anyone about this but I think now it's time for that.

I don't know when it started or how but I can't poop if I'm not alone at home. And I can't focus on anything before I've had a chance to poop. It sounds ridiculous, I KNOW and I've tried to talk sense to myself because I really know that there isn't anything more normal than pooping.

Year ago (yes this has continued many years) I used to have very often constipation, because I just couldn't poop if I wasn't alone. Then I was afraid to take medicine because I didn't know when I'd be able to be alone. 

It even got to that point that I waited that everyone was sleeping and then went to poop or I'd rather walk 2-4km to a public restroom and poop there. And I did this almost every day, I still do sometimes but now it's easier because my sister moved away with my father so there is just me and mom. But the thing is we have a very small apartment, so is the bathroom, and just on the other side (of the bathroom) is kitchen and living room where my mom always is.

Now my pooping has been fine since August (yes I've kept track) because I've been able to poop everyday because my mom is at work so there is no problem. But I seriously fear weekends and holidays because then she is at home. So those days I walk every morning to some public restroom and poop there, telling my mom that I go for a walk. 

And the reason I started writing is that today I can't poop and it really drives me crazy. I feel like crying, I can't concentrate on anything and I really fear constipation. I can almost poop but then nothing comes out and it stresses me so much because there's weekend ahead and I can't take medicine. This stresses me so freaking much and I just don't know what to do. What the hell should I do, I'm really tired of this. Especially now when summer is coming and mom has one month holiday I just really don't know what I should do.

And what on earth should I do so that I can poop tomorrow? Or what if I can't? Please help me",13Apr2018,4
165,"Sorry for the long post. There's a TL;DR if you need.

My dad and step-mum (D) are in the middle divorcing. They were together for almost 15 years and have children who are still in primary school. I'm living on my own, currently working on my career. My brother is living at home, but he is a fair amount older and is doing his own thing.

The signs were all there from the start. When I was much younger and less cynical, we were all (my brother included) best friends - she would spoil us with attention and gifts and we used to think she was the best person ever. I won't go into too much detail, but she basically usurped our ACTUAL mother - she unofficially took our family name, and did things like signing up for events at my school under that name, let everyone think that she was ACTUALLY our mum (unbeknownst to us) and conditioned us to feel that she was a better fit for me than our real mother. It got to the point where I (roughly 8-10 years old) used to get anxiety attacks when staying at my mother's house and would need to phone D to calm me down. I can't begin to imagine how useless that must have made my mother feel.

D had her first child with my dad, and everything changed. This could be understandable, given the new-born baby that has just joined the household, but it went from 100 to 0 immediately and stayed that way unless D felt like she was ""losing me"" (i.e. losing my admiration) in which case there would be a shopping trip, off to a theme-park, the cinema etc. so she could apologise for how she was behaving towards me and my brother without ever actually saying sorry. This got successively worse with each new baby.

This only worked for so long, in certainly doesn't work now. To give an idea of her overall character during this tumultuous period, she: (i) caused my therapist to breach confidentiality by spooking him with fake concerns over my safety, causing me to be removed from my mother's home; (ii) slammed her hand into a door and then told my dad that I had physically assaulted her; and (iii) convinced my family that I had stolen a family member's phone FOR DRUG MONEY when I was a teen and didn't even know what drugs were.

Fast-forward to last year and my dad tells me that they're getting a divorce. He'd suspected her for over a year, and has now got evidence that she's seeing someone else. The circumstances in which the relationship arose, and with whom the relationship is (it's ongoing) exacerbated the issue considerably. She was working in a position of trust at a conservative institution, what she is did went against that in more than one way. In the years before this, when I was at university, she would make no attempt to contact me and would never reply to my texts (I have tried to reconcile on multiple occasions, against my better judgment) - when I would be told that I was welcome to stay in ""her home"", and that they would make space for me - I'd only been away three months!

D has since left the family home and is living on her own whilst my dad tries to sort this mess out. D is still denying that anything happened beyond what proof my dad has of her actions. D has been trying to get in touch with me to meet up, saying my sisters want to see me (which I can do with my dad anyway) asking me things about my life, how I'm getting on etc. (trying to find a way back in) I haven't replied to her most recent message, and I really just want to cut this woman out of my life, but in spite of everything she has done she spent many years and years taking care of me and my brother, cooking and cleaning for us and more - and there is still a small part of me that feels attached to her, perhaps I feel like I owe her... I don't know. I feel like I've been emotionally compromised by the way she dealt with me, I've seen three different counselors/therapists since leaving home. But I don't want my sisters to think I hate their mum, and I don't want to cause more pain for anyone else.

The question is - am I justified in removing this person out of my life? This isn't even a tenth of the story, I don't think anyone wants to read all that... I'm okay to elaborate on specific issues.

169,"I know this sounds super weird, and I say all this at the risk of sounding completely crazy, but this is something I’ve been watching closely for a while now and I’m pretty sure. I don’t want to say exactly how I know, but I had been posting to a NSFW subreddit for some time and began to notice a lot of weird things, so I’ve been paying close attention. 

I’ve had a lot of different usernames, and I believe that I have encountered this person on more than one of my accounts, which suggests the fact that they have some sort of access to see what I am posting no matter what username I’m posting from. I also know that this person uses many different accounts too, maybe to maximize the chance of getting a response out of me. I really don’t know enough about these things to know how or to what extent I am being cyber-stalked. 

Because of the nature of this situation, I have a strong feeling that this is a male, and even have suspicions about who it could possibly be. But I have no solid proof, because this is happening in such a subtle way it’s very hard to track, and I’m sure that’s on purpose. 

I just want to know if there is any way to find out whether or not somebody is actually stalking me or if there’s any way to block this type of thing. I’ve already deleted my gw account, but that doesn’t completely solve the problem. This has taken a huge mental toll on me, I’ve become extremely paranoid and have been losing hair from stressing so much about it. I’ve tried to forget about it and dismiss this as simple paranoia a million times, but it keeps happening even when I am not searching for signs. This is the creepiest, weirdest thing that I’ve ever had to deal with. I feel like every person on the internet is just this same person trying to trick me into talking to them now, and can’t even fully trust anybody IRL anymore. I’m paranoid that everybody I know is in on it. I know that’s not probable at all but I can’t help my paranoid thoughts from spinning out of control. This whole thing has made me seriously question my own sanity every single day. 

But If what I suspect turns out to be true, then that would mean that this person can also see this post. So just in case my “stalker” is reading this, I want to say: Please leave me alone. What kind of person even has the time and energy to do this, and why? I am not hurting anybody or bothering anybody, I just want to live my life in peace and be left alone.

176,"I work in a small retail liquor store store and today I had my first shift with an older Indian gentleman. Towards the end of my shift, while i was counting the till he said that he was going into the back to put the kettle on (while i was still here so the store isn't being unwatched). I acknowledged and then right after a customer asked if we had a certain product to which me and my co-worker both replied yes we do. My co-worker then stopped me and asked ""did you want to serve the customer or I serve the customer?"" I said ""go for it"" and continued to count the till. After the customer was gone and i finished counting the till, he stopped me again and spoke in a tone as if I had insulted his mother, saying ""I know you're new here (I'm not new here)...eager to serve customers etc... a little professional tip: When your co-worker is dealing with a customer, don't jump in to serve that customer"". I just agreed and shrugged it off, finding it weird however because I noticed during the whole shift he was acting semi-authoritarian after I said no to staying back so he could leave earlier for a family commitment because I had something of my own to attend to. 

Correct me if i'm wrong here: Obviously if he was directly talking to the customer and then i butted in to 'steal the sale' I could understand my actions as being rude, but I assumed that he was going into the back. Is this simply just a case of wrong time-wrong place?

178,"I [F18] have a friend [M20] who has very recently had a sentencing and has gone to prison for selling drugs. I don't know about the details of the sentence quite yet but it's for a decent amount of time. He's a very sweet, wholesome, honest and genuine person and I'm quite worried for him.

Firstly, if I write letters, is it good to be solemn and emotionally supportive or more of a vapid distraction? Is it impolite to talk about what exciting things I've been doing? 

Secondly, will he be okay in there? Will he come out very different? He's quite a childlike person in the best way but I feel like there's a notion that men leave prison way more scathing and weathered. I would be his friend either way but is this true? Is it really as dangerous and miserable in there as they say?

180,"Hello, me (20) and my girlfriend (21) have been dating for two months. The past week has been super rough emotionally for the both of us. It is clear that I am into her, way more that she is into me. She's even said that she feels guilty and that I deserve someone who conveys the same amount of emotion that I do. She has a few difficulties when it comes to mental health, often getting overwhelmed by many things including me, shutting down emotionally into a frozen state.
Furthermore yesterday she had mentioned that she almost has a regret in us not having a friendship stage before our relationship (we met three days before we started dating, with us just kinda bonding without the ""do you want to date"" question.)
My question is, what do I do in this situation? I really don't want this relationship to end, as she is a genuine person that I care for romantically. Do I peel back my emotions a bit? If I peel back my emotions, what do I say when she notices? Am I thinking to much into this? Is this abnormal for a relationship? Any advice or questions you have would be most appreciated.

181,"So a little backstory info, about 6 years ago when I was 18 I went out on my first date. On the way home I had a car accident where I broke my neck, leaving me a quadriplegic. After rehab I tried to start dating again, but it became A LOT harder to get a date. Counting online messages I know were read and a few ""second thoughts?"" repeates, my stats are 2dates in 2375 with 164 being face to face. I'm not being desparate, just confident.

The other day after Bio, I asked this girl who sits one table over if she'd want to hangout or grab a coffee sometime and she replied with one of the more authentic yes's I've gotten. Most everyone had left and both of us were in a hurry to leave so we planned to trade numbers the next day (yesterday) in trig which we also had together. She sits behind me in math and she and the guy next to her were joking/flirting, and I think I overheard him ask if she wanted to hangout sometime, and I swear I heard her say ""Well Nate just asked me out, but I don't think it's going to workout."". At the end of class she left like a bat out of hell before I could talk to her to trade info. I hope I just overheard incorrectly but I don't feel like she would have forgot our conversation in bio just the day before. I see her again on Monday and I planned to give her the benefit of the doubt and ask if she still wanted to hang out without mentioning what I think I might have overheard yesterday. If she says yes that might be my only shot. What do you think we should do? I was thinking something like going to the dog park with my pup to chat. Any better ideas?",13Apr2018,2

January 2017 got a new accounting job for taxes. Didn't do well, so I lost that job too. 

Fast forward to July 2017, I got a third accounting job (similar work to my first one) and I'm doing really well here. Everyone likes me and the company is a nice place to work. 

Anyway, I've kept my lips shut about being a certified personal trainer. Above all, I think group fitness is fun. It's provided me a lot of fun/stress relief and I think I can do that for other people.

I want to mention the idea of being a group fitness trainer that teaches a class or two per week, probably on the weekends/weeknights. HOWEVER, accountants typically like you to be AVAILABLE to do work at all times. So I'm really considering not saying anything and giving up on being a group trainer because I don't want to jeopardize my career at a company in my degree field that's actually working out well for me.

197,"I am a female in my late 20s, and I've noticed a trend among girls my age w/ significant others, and that is their SO either does not work or is very underemployed with little to no ambition to move forward. Including mine. Mine graduated in 2012 with a sociology degree but has no interest in doing anything related to sociology, and has since been in various retail-related positions that have provided him with barely full time hours, much less benefits, and they're usually at very poorly managed places of business. He's tried applying for better jobs but he gets no callbacks, and he quit his last job due to the usual poor management. Now he's unemployed with no prospects to speak of and seemingly no desire to put in the effort it would take to get a better job than what he's had before, but yet he doesn't want to work the jobs he's had before either because he thinks he's above them. He has recently started developing a hobby in photography/videography, so we'll see where that goes. 

Me, on the other hand -- since we started dating nearly 4 years ago, I've had a steady full time job w/ benefits and completed a master's degree and now I'm a librarian. While I am definitely not rich by any means, my bills get paid and I have full benefits w/ vacation, sick leave, and holidays -- things that I've always had since I moved up to a ""big girl"" job. Even before then though, I worked at a grocery store in high school for 2 years, did work-study jobs and tutoring in college, and worked at a department store for 2 years after I graduated undergrad. In otherwords -- I've been employed ever since I was legally able to do so.

That's my story -- and it's not dissimilar to girls I've met that are similar in age to me. We moved across the country a couple years ago for my current job, and the first girl I made friends with had also made a move across the country for her job and lived there for over a year -- her husband never found work until she came up pregnant and he had to to help support the baby.

Another girl that came to work at my library has a similar story -- moved across the country for the job, and throughout their relationship, her bf worked 6 months out of the year as a park ranger in CO and then when he came home, he lived off of unemployment. Granted, they've only been here a few months so it's understandable that he hasn't quite found a job yet, but instead of sticking it out and trying to find something so they can support each other and be together full time, he's about to go back to CO and do the park ranger thing all over again. 

I know that's only 3 examples and its very anecdotal evidence, but it just seems to me like guys these days just don't want to take care of themselves and expect their girlfriends/wives to take care of them. Are we alone in this? Are there other girls out there dealing with this? I know we aren't, and I just want to know how you guys are handling this sort of thing, and why you think this is happening.

PS: I do want to add, I don't want to seem like I'm bashing my boyfriend cause I'm not.

200,"            So I’ve known my Best Man for 6 years he’s my best friend and like a Brother to me. We live across the country from each other now but we still meet up to see each other at least once or twice a year. 
             This August I am marrying my fiancée I’ve also been dating for 6 years she loves my best man and we all get along very well. My fiancée is from Brazil though and we will be having the wedding in Brazil. I’m an American and we currently live in America.
              My friend knew that he was going to be my best man for a long time now and he also knew that the wedding would be in Brazil. Him his family and his brother (one of my other groomsman) were all going to go. But out of nowhere his parents decided that they’d be quitting their jobs and opening up a bar. They asked my friend (my best man) and his brother (one of my groomsmen) if they wanted to get in on the family bar and also quit their jobs and help them run it. They said yes.
                They are currently still all working and looking for a place to buy to open the bar and plan on starting it this summer. As such my best man informed me last week that none of them would be able to attend because they would need all hands on deck for this bar this summer.
                 I’ve gotta be honest I’m pretty hurt by this. I don’t make make friends easily and he’s the closest friend I’ve ever had besides my fiancée. He knew that it was important to me that he be there for my wedding. My fiancée and mother in law had already made specialized Ties for all the Groomsmen with their names and initials on them. My fiancée is also a little peeved by this even though she really like both of them. 
                  My point is I could see if his parents and brother couldn’t make it because of the bar but does he absolutely have to be there? They can’t go a few days without him at the bar? I literally have no replacement if he doesn’t go I will not have a best man. Am I being selfish here? Money isn’t an issue for them they are very well off. So the only thing holding him back is this random bar decision. 

Idk how to approach this I pretty much have thought about a few possibilities tell me what you think please.

My Thoughts are:
1. Don’t say anything just let it go and carry on the wedding without him.
2. Tell him that it means a lot to me that he be there and see what he says.
3. Ask his parents if it’s really necessary for him to be there that exact weekend.

*Little Background on my best man. We are complete opposites he’s very introverted and doesn’t really like parties or people, while I am very extroverted. I have always forced him to go out and interact without me his social life wouldn’t even exist. He’d be perfectly content just going to work and going home and not talking to anyone. I feel a little bit like he’s using this bar excuse to get out of going to a situation where he will be forced to be an extrovert. He has very poor social skills and I’m not sure telling him how I feel about him canceling will even effect him he may just shut down and be like okay then be mad at me I don’t care.

So to sum it up I have been paying my parents 450 in rent, paid my phone bill which is like 40 because we on a family plan, as well as paid for all my clothes and luxury items since i graduated high school. I don't feel as if I've made any ""major"" mistakes in my life. I did fail geometry in 10th grade because I got lazy, but I paid for the class in my senior year to retake it so that I would graduate with everyone else, which I think makes up for it in my opinion. I graduated when I was 17 and 1/2 years old and immediately started college. This is when my parents said they would start charging me rent and all the other things I listed above. For some reason they also think me paying it isnt enough so they also want me to work a full time job to save money on top of going full time to college. The first semester was hard but I pushed through and gave it my all and then this last semester which just passed drained me and I barely passed and am considering dropping out. I have told my parents how I feel but they said they don't care because it should be easy. This doesn't make sense to me because they didn't get their degree till they were in their mid 30's, and by my age they had kids of their own. Every time I bring it up they just brush it off, I honestly don't want to quit college, but at the same time I would like some support from them. It may be childish of me but after the past two semesters I don't think if I move out ill be able to handle working and college all alone in the world. I just want my parents to recognize and appreciate that I'm doing good compared to what they were at my age. I know there are a lot of people who are working a lot harder than me and not breaking down but this is how I honestly feel.

He found a mobile mechanic through Facebook, a post made by his girlfriend, and called him to come take a look. The guy did a few repairs and then said we needed to order another part for him to put on and he told my dad he would come back out and put it on no extra charge. He gets the part in and I went ahead and installed it for him because I didn't believe it would fix the problem, and it didn't. So I put it on and was running the car, driving it back and forth up the driveway to test things out. Later, the guy came out to look at everything and tell my dad what needed to be fixed now. They talked, nothing got said about money, and my dad went inside, and the guy went to his car. About five minutes later, his girlfriend, who was with him when he came out, messaged my dad and asked if he was going to bring out the $40 for coming out.  My dad went out and told him that he said he would come out again at no charge, and the guy said he spent however much time at junkyards looking for the part. The guy ended up just saying okay and leaving. About thirty minutes later, my mom was taking my nephew to work and came back in to say that my dad had a flat tire. I didn't realize it at the time, but I had thought the air was slipping out from a nail or something.

My dad, in the meantime, called the guy and paid him $40. And he said he would be back out to check something else out on the car, which kept getting ""delayed"".

A week later, yesterday, when I got the chance to take the tire off for him, I found a clean cut on the sidewall where the tire was touching the pavement. So this guy slashed it. His girlfriend was with them him so she knows that he did it.

Who slashes a 75 year olds tire over a $40 misunderstanding? I'm not sure how to go about this because if he's the king of person to do this, I feel like he would do something else if we said anything on Facebook. His girlfriend frequently advertises him as being an affordable mobile mechanic and I see people commenting a lot asking for service.

However to my pleasant surprise, we have *one* weekend possible, no business obligations (yet), with his music performance (the only thing that is scheduled for that weekend) scheduled at a location in the SAME TOWN as the hotel!! How awesome is that? We could make it work! EXCEPT.... husband's niece's open house is that Saturday. What would you do in this situation? Do we skip the rare opportunity to have a mini family vacation in order to attend an open house for our niece?",13Apr2018,1
211,"I'm in my penultimate year of study, and I'm faced with a dilemma. On one hand, I'm contemplating getting a summer internship, and on the other I was planning on going for a 3 months Muay Thai camp in Thailand in order to get my life together. I've done a shorter version of the camp before and it did wonders for my mental health and self discipline (which I lack currently). I wouldn't say my life is a total mess or anything, but I do suffer from depression which has affected many things in my life, and I do find that being forced to be in a structured environment does have a positive effect on me. 

Internship pros: Work experience, higher employability after graduation, $$$ 
Cons: I suppose I'd be in the same frame of mind and routine that I'm currently in at uni. Could do with something different that will have a positive effect on my mental health and general well being. 

Muay Thai camp pros: I plan on going to a smaller, slightly more rural camp. The environment wouldn't be difficult for me to adapt to as I'm from South East Asia myself (although I'm studying abroad for my degree). It would do wonders for my mental health+ fitness and general state of mind, I've always been serious about practicing martial arts and have done muay thai and tkd before. 

Cons: Would not be earning money during this time period, although I could support myself there as living costs are cheap. 

I could always get an internship for fall, spring or next summer, too but my concern is 1) fall/spring internships aren't as long as summer internships thus decreasing the experience I would have 2) getting a summer internship after the end of my third year might be too late.

216,"We started off as really good friends who were also coworkers and then though a drunken texting session I told her I liked her and thought we would look good together. After that made a move on me which i took to positively and we had sex. This proceeded for a couple months with our friendship continuing to grow. 

Before all of this she got out of a serious committed relationship and I asked if I was being used as a rebound and she said no. Now I can see at the time I was blind to what was truly happening. 

She suggested that we stop whatever we were doing and I agreed but I didn’t not agree to her completely disregarding me as a friend and as a person she was with, emotionally and physically. 

Now I’m currently here having strong feelings for her and it’s obvious she’s still caught up in her ex who she can get over. 

I feel confused, hurt, and used and she has no regard for me what so ever. I don’t want to blame her because we both went into this knowing we probably shouldn’t but now I realize that the difference is that I truly had emotional feeling for her and she used me, even when she claims she didn’t.

It was like one day we were fine and then the next she completely cut me off. Unfollowed me from all social media, no text, and when we did see each other she’d be aggressive and won’t look me in the eyes.

After a year later I’m back and as far as I know, she’s single.

The only thing is, I can’t exactly tell if she’s into me at all or not. I always try to find reasons to talk to her throughout the day, and I text her memes and funny clips.

Meanwhile I got a job as a cleaning personell, which includes cleaning at malls, school, ferries, hospitals, police stations.. literally everywhere so the job will vary a lot. I am fine with that, I like that kind of work because I've been doing this every summer as a summer job between the age of 16-21.

I am a guy so occasionally I will be used for other things, like throwing heavy stuff away etc. which is also fine with me.
But there's definitely going to be times where I'll be cleaning when there are many people around and even though the chances are kind of small that I would run into someone I know, I think I would feel embarrassed that I have this kind of work at the age of 24. (I lack confidence I guess)

I don't mind cleaning in front of strangers, but if I run into an old friend (chances a relatively small) I'd be embarrassed as hell.

220,"So I had this guy who treated me so politely and beyond any guy who ever could ....sounds clingy and stupid right? but I never encountered any form of politeness that's beyond weird to a point it's questionable, sometimes I wonder could he actually liked me? This i why I need a different perspective from a reader in reddit I hope you could help me see in a different light. 

   It first started with meeting him in class where he called me whether I could be his close friend in class?; I could vividly remember as I was sitting alone because I was early; then, along came an acquaintance of mine sitting behind me and there he was presenting himself asking me and so forth. I never invest my time having to spent a conversation in class, now I know it doesn't hurt to get to know people so I kind of did talked to him.

  This is where it gets interesting; everytime when class is in session he almost ALWAYS wanted to sit right next to me sometimes I really can't understand why?, but he has his own group of friends who's apparently in our class as well but he choose to sit right next to me asking how my day was everytime. An interesting note however, I remembered he placed his forearm at my table which at first, my thoughs were maybe he's invasive or had some kind of an attachment issue. He usually commented on my social media when I posted something ""interesting"" we would discuss and even debate to a very pointless debacle but now he's always the first to see my story in social media which kind of raises the creep factor to a whole friendly bit. 

   I kept his previous messages when he commented about who I had crush with inside the class; well clearly it wasn't him but I did have a crush in my class which peaked his interest I kind of stopped the whole conversation by texting him ""it's none of your business hahaha"". Following the next semester, we rarely met simply because our class no longer coincide. We would stumble at each other and this time I always said hi but that's just it. There's this one time where I had to wait for my car ride to arrive I was sitting on a bench and I saw him with his friends; I did the usual greet and he quickly came up to me and sit right next to me so close that I felt uncomfortable, asking me light questions about my day. I was creeped out so I had to rush myself as soon as my uber arrived it was so funny maybe I was kind of embarrassed because no idiot would ever do that there's a personal space and he really did invade mine lmao. He even offered to help me when I was packing too much stuff, when I was about to leave but I rejected his offer because I'm accompanied by my friend so it isn't necessary.

   Well, currently I saw him in college again and he was standing beside a glass door texting, I quickly rushed my way out I was rushing anyways... so I haven't had the pleasure to get in touch with him; glad he didn't see me as well lmfao.

I'm not religious and I don't believe in life after death or heaven or anything, I think this is probably the issue. I just kind of don't feel like there's a point to life when we just die anyway. 
How do I get out of this mindset? 
There's no way of feeling better about something that is definitely going to happen. I never used to worry or obsess about dying but for the past 2-3 weeks I've been thinking about it constantly.
I know rationally that I should just accept it and enjoy my life whilst I have one, but I just can't because as I said it feels like nothing we ever do matters since we just die anyway. 
I'm not sure if I'm depressed or if this is just a normal existential thing that happens to everyone but I really can't function properly having such terrible thoughts every day. 
I don't believe in God before anyone suggests 'finding my faith'. I'm very non-religious and there's no way I could trick myself into believing it. I do believe having some sort of faith in life after death would get rid of this problem, but I know (obviously I don't KNOW but I believe) that once you die, you're just gone. You don't know you're gone but you just are. You cease to have thoughts and feelings etc you're just nothing. This is what makes me depressed, the thought of becoming nothing.

229,"Hello everybody,
sorry for the long post, I really need to write it all down...

I'm male, 25 years old. I've never been Tom Cruise-level handsome guy, but I've not been really unattractive since 15. I had a long-term girlfriend for almost all the high-school and 3 long-term girlfriends during university. Now, during my Ph.D. studies, I'm still dating the third one. Talking about some one-night-actions I've managed to get only one girl in that way in my whole life.
To sum it up, I've been with some girls and several others (not many) were interested, but I wasn't willing to cheat on mine girlfriends.

That said, I've always wanted to feel attractive and enjoy sex with more women. I expected that to come with age, as I managed to put on some muscles, while I used to be terribly skinny. I'm also working very hard on my career, working as a full-time researcher in a very prestigious research institute (at least in my country), leading one project on my own etc. Generally, I'm considered quite a talented student and described as an ""extremely skilled programmer"" (not my words, this was written by my supervisor in his last evaluation). I'm 5'10'' and about 175lbs.

My current girlfriend is very sexually open and since the beginning of our relationship, we were talking about trying a threesome with some other girls, which would fulfill my needs of more sexual partners and her needs of frequent sexual experiments.

We had several friends who are practicing this or were willing to try something new.

The first time, when were living separately, one of my GF's friends came to visit her, but the timing was pretty bad and I had no time to come that evening, so I wanted to join the next day. Her friend is very sexually open-minded, so they've slept together with my GF (I'm completely OK with that, while it's with a girl) and then she went and spend the night with my GF's flatmate, whom she obviously liked.
Unfortunately, when I came the next day, she behaved completely different, was pretty cold towards me and while we arranged the next visit, this time in some hotel pretty far from us (she lives pretty far in a different city), she had no problems to cancel it after we arrived.

Long story short, pretty much the same thing happened with other two girls, one of them being my friend, who was flirty with me, but then rejected me too, while she preferred some middle-aged, divorcing guy (ordinary man, no Bernie Ecclestone-like type). She also attends threesomes with him and some other guys, while she told me, that ""she's too shy to join such an activity with strangers"", so she's obviously not interested in me.

The third case was the worst, as the girl came to our flat, enjoyed her time with my GF and then rejected me right ""before the action"". To be honest, I've never felt so humiliated in my whole life.

The last case happened yesterday when other friend of my GF whom I know briefly wanted to go climbing. As I'm attending a local gym, I offered her, that we could go together. She agreed and while she enjoyed the climbing itself and laughed all the time, I could say, that not only she's not attracted to me, but that she's physically repelled by myself. 

Today she written me a message, starting with a brief mention of the yesterday's climbing and her leg (she injured her leg slightly a few days ago)  and after few messages she told me, to tell my GF to go with use another time. I was joking, that I didn't forbid her (true, she didn't want to go, as she was too busy), but she really insisted on it, obviously not willing to go again just with me.

During last year I've noticed this behavior many times - women don't like me at all and I have no idea why. I tried to discuss it with my women-friends, but I'm still being told that I look well (many times even from the above-mentioned girl who sleeps with the older guy), which is not honest, obviously, as they're just trying not to hurt me.

I feel really bad, have no self-confidence at all and most of all, I feel humiliated before my GF, as many men we know have no problems with this.

The problem is, I'm visiting fitness centers pretty often, trying to live healthy as much as possible and wear well-fitting clothes. I'm also no asocial weirdo, who repels people generally.

Do you have any idea, where could I get an honest advice with my look/behavior? Or, do you have any experience with getting honest and constructive feedback from the opposite sex?

Thank you very much for your answers. And, please, don't write about me being superficial, about the ""special one"", about the higher life meaning etc. I'm asking for help with a problem, which really torments me for a long time and I have no idea how to improve my situation. Please, try to understand me.",13Apr2018,0
230,"Hi all.

July 2016 when I was 19, my professor and chair of my department \(he's in his early 50s\) sexually assaulted me. 

We had numerous normal interactions previously and I really liked him. He always asked about my home life \(it was rough\), let me work in his office when I couldn't go home, and gave me really great educational and career\-oriented opportunities. 

The day it happened, he asked me to meet him at the school and help him with a project, it was an exciting opportunity so I agreed. Everything was fine and afterward he asked me to lunch, which I didn't think was unprofessional so I went. At lunch, I went to the bathroom and when I returned, he had bought us both shots. ""To celebrate your getting published"" he said. I don't drink and didn't want the shot. He kept pressuring me and pressuring me to take it. So I did. I don't think it was spiked or anything but I did feel rather tipsy after it because I never drink so I'm a ""lightweight."" 

Afterward, he drove me back to the college to get my laptop, which was in his office. When we went in his office, he locked the door behind us and turned the lights off. Then he started saying things like ""I'm just going to address the elephant in the room, I want to f\*\*\* you"" and ""You know you want this."" I was floored. I had never expressed any interest in him like that.

He then grabbed me and kissed me, which I pulled away from. He then proceeded to choke me, from behind, and force his hand up my skirt and into my underwear. I asked him several times to stop and tried to pull away but he was stronger. He finally said ""why should I?"" when I asked him again to stop and I told him I was on my period and he finally let go.

Afterward, I just left. I didn't know what to say or do. But afterward is when the real nightmare started. 

He started texting me constantly about wanting to ""be in a relationship"", asking me to tell him I loved him and that he was attractive. Telling me that he loved me and was going to leave his wife for me. But also making threats. Saying that if anyone find out he would ""ruin me"" and ""get me fired"". He literally said I would never graduate and never find a job in this area. 

I basically did what he asked. I was dumb, naive, afraid, and I felt like I was so damaged already that nothing else mattered. Nobody would believe me. I was just some girl from a messed up junkie, family coming up against the chair of the department, the editor of the biggest newspaper in the county, the owner of a popular local business, a millionaire. I didn't stand a chance.

This ""relationship"" continued until November and things got worse still. 

He stopped texting me out of the blue. When I would see him in school he would insult my work and intelligence publicly, and privately insult my weight and appearance. He told me I should skip the senior luncheon because ""nobody liked me"". He told me I should just quit school and temporarily removed me from all my class registrations. He didn't include my name on several important emails so I missed out on info. He threatened to ""lose"" my internship hours so I didn't graduate. He ""accidentally"" removed my video work from an end of the year presentation. He removed his name as my adviser so I had difficulty registering for classes as I couldn't obtain his signature. He told my boss at the restaurant I worked at \(who he's good friends with\) that I was stealing money and alcohol \(I wasn't\), so I got fired. When I finally graduated, he refused to shake my hand. 

I found out that all of these actions were because he started sleeping with another student, a year younger than me.

I told no one. I just wanted the nightmare to end and I was scared it never would if I spoke up. But it's been two years and the nightmare is still happening. I see him everywhere. TV. Newspapers. A concert 200 miles from home.

I feel like I can't tell anyone because they'll just say ""why did you put yourself in that situation? Why didn't you report it?""

I guess that is what I deserve.",13Apr2018,3

233,"Where to begin...
I am a student in a film class at my school, and the class gets film projects every couple of weeks. I had a couple of other students that I normally work with, plus one extra person. I think it’s around 6 people in the group. I have done great projects in the past, with excellent grades on them. Until now. Now I am seeing we are missing the recommended times to get done, and I see the project is failing. The due date is April 27th. Let me explain how this happened.

Week One 4-2-18 to 4-6-18
The film project was introduced on April 2nd. We had a few days of planning. Over two days, one of the group members typed the script. This is when we got our first deadline, we had to produce a preview of what our projects was going to be like by April 6th. I reviewed the script given to us, and it was terrible. I decided to revise it. I do so, and bring it in on April 4th. For the rest of the week, we had a substitute, which meant no filming. The teacher extended the due date to April 9th.

Week Two 4-9-18 to 4-13-18
We turn in the preview right at the due date, and lose some filming time because of it. On April 11th we start filming, and we only get 3 scenes in, which is not much. At this point group members were getting frustrated with our slow progress. On April 12th, another group offered to help us. They had excellent equipment, so we accepted. The catch is that we had to help them. We only got 2 scenes done, not good. While we were filming, they made many comments about how it was boring and cringe. I had to agree with them, our revised script was not much of an improvement. Now to today, April 13th. We had to keep our promise of helping them. We helped them. Today we made no progress on our project, and 2 members were threatening to quit.

The future
The next 2 weeks, we will not be able to film much, due to End of Year exams. The only thing we will be able to do is just to edit what we have. I see this project failing quickly, and I have no idea what to do. I consulted with the film teacher, and he said it is too late to turn the ship around, and just to continue with what he have. I seem to be stuck in a rut, and I seriously need help so I don’t get a poor grade. Any advice?",13Apr2018,1

Also, please note that while reading this it may seem as if there are obvious solutions like medications, but we have tried those and none have worked. If there are newer medications or sedatives I am open to hearing about those. But please be mindful that we are intelligent people and have gone down that route before with no avail.

She does not listen and will only calm down when her fits are over. No bribes work, etc. We have been thorough so much therapy and family rehab over the years with all of the tactics presented to us, and still can’t seem to find anything that works. 

My sister is a larger human being and her violence is to the point where my aging parents (in their early 60’s) are unable to stop or handle her. I moved out when I went to college and so did my older brother, which left my parents to care for my sister.

Growing up she was violent towards everyone and would go to the extent of pulling knives on us. We have had the police brought it, EMS called to sedate her completely, taking her to psych wards, etc. 

However more recently on my visits home, being so removed from the home life there, I realize how truly awful this quality of life is. My parents are aging very quickly and cannot continue to fight against or take blows from a wildly aggressive adult. My mother is disabled, has borderline personality disorder and refuses to take her medication. To be honest, she kind of eggs on situations that then get blown out of proportion and then take violent turns when my sister so much as feels bothered by it. My father is so beaten down mentally and physically that he just sits and ends up bruised and beaten because he refuses to yell or get physical. Over the years when she was smaller, he was able to put her in a hold that therapists trained my parents on, and held her until she exhausted herself. He cannot do that now. My mother cannot do anything due to being physically disabled and basically adds fire to the situation because she just sits and yells until my sister eventually hits her too. 

My brother and I are pretty close siblings, and after visiting home recently, talked about doing something or finding some sort of solution for this. 

Ideally, my mother should be medicated but no one can talk her into/force her to take medication. My dad is just slowly dying inside and out because he has suffered through this shit too long. But he is a good guy and won’t leave or give up on the family.

But my sister, we cannot figure out what to do with or how to handle it. My parents are going to end up dying if this continues while they get older and older, and I am also scared that one day my sister will end up murdering them on accident. 

This quality of life for everyone needs to change and I just don’t even know where to start with something like this since it has been my whole life. I feel like an awful family member letting it go this long, but I guess I didn’t realize the extent of it until I was out of the house and on my own for a long time. 

Please let me know if this doesn’t make sense or you need more information before offering advice. I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and please excuse if I made any typos, I’m on mobile!

237,"I need help. Bad. 

I am obviously pretty bad at writing a cover letter. Well, at least I think that’s what’s wrong since I haven’t landed a job yet. 

A little back story. 

I have a degree in Multimedia Design as well as one in Innovation. I’ve worked within my field for 20+ years. 

Five years ago I lost my mother to cancer and two years ago I lost my father. This took it’s toll on me. So much that I had to quit my job and go on sick leave for almost half a year. Since then it has been impossible for me to get a new job. 

I have a CV that I’m really proud of. And after my sick leave was over and whilst applying for job after job I took a lot of extra credit courses to keep me updated within my field. 

Three times I was called for an interview. That’s it. 

So obviously I’m doing something wrong. But what?

I need a job - desperately. It doesn’t have to be anything related to my education. I’m at a point where I’m willing to work with whatever’s available. Since I don’t have an income and my husband works to many hours to make ends meet. 

I need to take some pressure off of him and I need to get out of the house and be around other people. 

I’m willing to PM my resume and my latest cover letter. 

If anyone can point me in the right direction I would SO MUCH appreciate it. 

Thanks :)",13Apr2018,1

I have a boyfriend and lately my mom has come across a photo of me that she considers to be ""sexual"" but it really wasn't intended like that.

I brought a tablet home yesterday to try to get around the fact she took my phone and she called me upstairs from my room last night to ask if I was talking to him. I told her yeah, and she's like ""Want to know how I know? You just told me."" she was planning on giving it back eventually apparently, but I didn't think she would which is why I signed out a tablet from my school. I've done nothing wrong since that photo which I regret even though it's intent isn't bad. She said I need more strict rules or something along those lines and I'm scared.

but here's the deal.  I've smoked a pack a day for 4 years. The past 7 months I have drank 72-80oz of beer a night.  Weed gives me bad anxiety but i blow through a quarter oz a week because it helps me escape my depression.  a lot of my money goes to drugs.

257,"I’m a 16 year old turning 17. I really like this guy I met a while ago. I’m not looking to have sex, at least not yet. Neither of us drink, smoke, or party as far as I know. The only thing like that is that we both love music and going to concerts which is how I met him. (I used to work at a music and arts venue) He’s in school for music right now, his dream is to be a musician. I also want to go into the music field, but I want to be on the business side of things. So, our goals are pretty similar. 

As far as I know he hasn’t dated anyone serious since I’ve known him, which might be because he can be a bit shy and can get anxiety around new people. Besides that and he can have low self esteem at times, he’s like the perfect guy in my eyes. I have low self esteem myself, and we have really picked each other up in the past. 

Back to the whole point, I really like this guy, we have a lot in common such as life goals, and our social lives are similar. I’m just nervous that if I was to ask him out in the future, people would say things because of the age difference. 

TL;DR I’m 16, going to be 17 soon. The guy I like is 21 turning 22. Would I be able to potentially ask him out? Is that too big of an age difference?

264,"Long story short, I was in a progressively abusive relationship with someone but it ended about 5 months ago. I still don’t understand what is happening to me right now, I find it hard to speak my mind out loud but I have so many thoughts in my head. 
My parents got divorced and gave me 2 weeks to find a place to live so my ex and I moved in together. At the beginning it was normal to me. He was angry and had a temper but I grew up with my father the same way so it didn’t really faze me. A couple months of living together I knew the situation was growing dark. I felt sick full of anxiety and depression. I wasn’t allowed to talk about certain things that ate me up inside. 
He cheated on me. I saw it happen but, he continued lying to my face for months. Calling me crazy, and weak, and I need to get over it to move on and be strong but he still never told me the truth. About a week after I confronted him on the cheating issue and some other worries I had (coke and alcohol because it made him angry as fuck) I was working up the courage to end it. I was gonna move into a community house and start over. I got a call from his sister crying, their mother passed away and she told me to watch him. His father told me to take care of him. Everyone one I met at the funeral shook my hand and whispered to take care of Him. I didn’t know what to do, I was scared for him because he was so unpredictable. I stayed so he wouldn’t be alone in his pain. His sister and father lived somewhere else. 
We stuck together and I tried to take care of him in his grief. But it escalated. Everything became a fight, everything was my fault. He would say 
“ your not the innocent girl you think you are”
“ why u starting shit ? U have nothing to complain about you are such a brat” 
“You have nothing to be sad about”
“That never happened your fucking crazy, you really need to go see someone” 
I ignored everything he said to me, and these quotes are just crumbs to the cookie. 
It got to a physically abusive point where I would be running out of the house at 3 am to escape. 
I had no one in my life to lean on. I felt this dark hole in my chest grow everyday. We lived like this for a long time. I wasn’t allowed to speak, talk to my friends or even visit my grandma. He would erupt. 
I read once about gaslighting, and it totally rang with me. Our relationship was based off of these tactics he used for control. I gave up on trying to leave because our living situation was the only one I had and could afford. One night he erupted , I got scared and slept at my work on the ground before my shift that morning. He texted me and told me he left. I was relieved, this weight was gone. But now I’m seeing the effects and I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk out loud to my new partner about problems. I can’t and don’t want to cry. I fear emotion. I crave isolation. 
The guy I’m seeing now is a dream. So kind, I’ve never been treated so nice by any male in my life even by my own father. And I fee like I’m not capable of being open like he is. And it hurts our bond. He encourages me to talk but I can’t get the words out I just choke on them. I use to be open. I don’t know how to be me anymore. Is there anyone out there who can give me advice on getting over the past?

This is how it started, I told her about another women I would die to have sex with and then she said “.... really ?.. would you ?” I said yes in a heartbeat and she says “.. ok...”  I ask you know what’s up ? she goes on to say that nothings wrong and she’s just laying there. Puzzled, I ask her if she’s being honest with me and she says “I’m gonna be straight up with you I’m kinda jealous, you’re practically mine but we aren’t dating so that’s why I’m not freaking out or anything” she jokingly goes on to say that I’m her territory. I told her that why would she be jealous if we aren’t really dating, she says that she knows but she likes me in a way but she sees me as a friend.

I forgot the rest of the conversation we had but it was a lecture of once a pare have sex their relationship changes and we can’t be really sure if we’ll just friends while also having a sexual relationship. 

I do want to be her friend because we get along so well and joke around a lot but at the same time we both want to screw around and she doesn’t do friends with benefits so shes is now in a complicated position as me also.

The payment is $1100 a month. My boyfriend has been in a lease with his roommate since this past October. Nowadays he spends all his time at my place so he wants to move in but he was waiting for the right time to break his lease in a way that would be equitable for his roommate as well. I got very excited about him moving in with me because splitting the mortgage and having an extra $500 a month to spend on improving the home or to save for a future purchase of a better home with boyfriend would be amazing. 
Roommate hates all solutions. Doesn’t want to split fee to break lease ($500 per person), doesn’t want to transfer lease to a different apartment with the same apartment company, because he’s on the waiting list for a new complex the company is building and claims it would jeopardize that. Doesn’t want to continue to pay three-fourths of the rent while my boyfriend pays one-fourth of the payment even though he wouldn’t be living there anymore (and I wouldn’t make him pay me half in that case). Roommate just got a raise and would be able to easily afford it (we would never want him to be left with payment he can’t afford) but said he doesn’t want to pay any more bec he just doesn’t feel like it and my boyfriend is contractually obligated to pay half (not exactly specified in contract, they are both responsible for full payment). The roommate doesn’t want to find a new roommate to take over because he wants to live alone. I see it as the roommate not being flexible and not being willing to work with us, I think he should try to find compromise with us instead of refusing to let my boyfriend leave the lease. My boyfriend says that his roommate is under no obligation to work with us on this because my boyfriend has signed the lease so he feels obligated to see it through. Boyfriend says my mindset is disturbing because I’m being selfish and expecting the roommate to do something unfair. I think boyfriend isn’t making a decision that is good for me or us as a couple because this is less money that we will have, as he is paying it to an apartment complex instead of to my/our house (we are long term partners who plan to continue to build a future together so I consider this a good move for the both of us and not just beneficial to me, plus we really want to live together). Who is right? And what is a better solution? Should roommate agree to one of above solitons?

281,"My dad says derogatory things about many different race groups behind closed doors. But, outside of our home he's nice to everyone and is respectful. For example, he will say something derogatory about Hispanic people, but when he walks by a Hispanic person he will smile at them and say hello. Even our neighbors. Our neighbors are a different race from us. He says derogatory things about people of their race inside of our home, but he's friendly and cordial with them. I don't understand how you can say all these things about these people, but you still interact with them and are nice to them outside.

He has coworkers that are different races from him and he is friendly and interacts with them. This should show him that people are people, and lots of people are good people regardless of race. It doesn't matter. He's very narrow-minded and two-faced. I also know this is very common.

282,"Hi there,   

A person on my team at work recently got let go. From the few conversations I had with him, I could tell that he had kind of a negative outlook on life and his situation. He is an older guy (60ish) who was in an entry level position here and I know he wasn't super proud of it so it must have doubly stung when he didn't end up making the cut.  

I'm really worried because I just got the vibe from him that this job opportunity was the only good thing going for him right now. I'm worried about his emotional state in the aftermath of being fired.  

I have his email address, but I have no idea what to say.   


Another aspect that is making this difficult for me is, I am on the team he was fired from, and he might attribute some fault to me. We butted heads a few times because he was difficult to train and insisted on doing things his way. I hope he doesn't think I got him fired, because I was not a part of that decision at all.

283,"The title basically says it all. I'm 28 years old and I live with my father. Have lived here for about two years now with plans to move out within a year because I'll be transferring to a university.

I'm not trying to mooch, I'm in college and we have this agreement so that I can get through school. He's doing me a big favor by doing this, and I am grateful for that.

For some reason, as time goes on, I'm finding that I have little patience for him. I feel irritated and annoyed when we talk (he's a bit of a rambler), and if were both at home I spend my time at the opposite end of the house. I never really feel like I have any *real* privacy. I also find that I will do just about anything to not be at home. When I get off work, I'll try to find something to do so I don't have to go home, and I usually end up at a coffee shop doing homework for several hours before finally going back home. If I have nothing to do, I'll go to the gym for a couple hours to get a workout in, but I do extra stuff, again, to eat up time so I don't have to be at home.

A few other tid-bits: I'm single, have been for about 3 years now. Dating has been very difficult, living here doesn't make that any easier. My father is not retired, but he hasn't worked in about two years, spends most of his time at home, always on the phone chatting with god-knows-who.

I really hate that I'm feeling like this. I feel like a real grade-A prick. I'm pretty sure I might be depressed, but I'm still productive so I really have no idea. All I know if that I really don't like being at home.

I have been trying to make a conscious effort to be more willing to chat with him, but I always fall back to feeling irritated an annoyed.

Why am I like this? Does anyone have a similar experience? I don't know what to do.",13Apr2018,1

285,"About a year ago, my parents separated and have since been divorced. I have no contact with my father, and don't want contact with him for personal reasons. 
The assumption between my parents when they split was that he would keep custody of the family dog since he was the one who adopted her and he was her main caretaker.
Recently, I found out that he abandoned her when he moved in with his new wife. My paternal grandparents still own the property and allow the dog to live there, feed her every day, and basically keep her in the back yard 24/7.
I would adopt her and take her home but she weighs over 80 pounds, has had ZERO socialization with other dogs or people, and is basically a feral dog. I don't have the time or resources to resocialize her, but I also don't want to call animal control on my grandparents and have her seized, as my county's primary shelter is a kill shelter and can only afford to keep animals for about 14 days before they are put down.

286,"Hello fellow Redditors, I'm not quite sure where else to put this so I'm hoping someone here can help me figure out how to move forward. This is a throwaway account because I don't want friends/family to think I can't talk to them, but I feel like they're biased and I need a stranger's point of view.

Yesterday I had a dentist's appointment to get two fillings put in, one on each side of my mouth. This was not my first rodeo, I've had several fillings put in during my life and I'm very familiar with the process. I've been going to the same dental clinic for ten years. I've always had excellent experiences with them, they've always been very gentle and stop immediately to administer more numbing if I indicate I'm having pain. I recently moved and decided to go to a different branch (same company) at a different location closer to home.

So, yesterday's appointment. The head dentist (I'll call him ""doctor"" for simplicity) explained what we were going to be doing, then got the numbing gel they use before giving the numbing injections. He swabbed the areas he was going to inject, but immediately grabbed the needle without allowing more than thirty seconds for the gel to set in. The left side injection was uncomfortable but I have a decent pain tolerance and knew it would be over soon, so I just breathed through it.

Then he moved to the right side and I knew immediately that there was NOT enough numbness over there. It was incredibly painful and I immediately made a noise to let him know. In my experience, that's all it should take for them to stop and give you some more numbing gel. He did not. I made more noises and tensed up off the table, trying to get him to stop, and he just said ""I know, we're almost done."" At one point he hit a nerve or something and pain shot down the side of my tongue, and I was afraid he might be causing nerve damage. So all I could do is lay there and wait for him to pull the needle out of my mouth to reload, and when he did I said ""Would you please give me more numbing gel on that side, that was too intense."" He did, but I was shaken and tearful at that point and withdrew into myself for the rest of the (2-hour) appointment. He was not gentle at all and often had so much cotton and fingers in my mouth that it was hard to breathe, even through my nose. When I finally got out to my car I had a panic attack in the parking lot and it took about a half hour for me to calm down enough for my bf to drive me home. He wants to chew that doctor out for hurting me, but I don't know if that's going to fix anything. 

Since then, I've been shaky and near tears. I keep having flashbacks and I haven't been able to eat since about 10:30 yesterday morning. Not because my mouth hurts. That's the kicker, as far as I can tell he did a great job fixing my teeth. It's all anxiety, whenever I try to eat something I feel like gagging. I'm at work and I had to hide in the bathroom and cry during my lunch break.

I feel like my trust was violated, I feel like what he did was wrong, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know if he's just inexperienced or what, but I never want to see that doctor again. I don't want anyone else to have to suffer. What do I do? Leave a negative Yelp! review? I know that we've made leaps and bounds in the medical field and anesthetic is a new luxury, in the past agony could be expected from a dentist visit. Am I just being a big baby? I have never, ever been afraid of the dentist before but after that experience, I'm afraid I'm going to have to have them gas me every time I go in for a cleaning now.

I needed to get this off my chest. Please, any kind of serious advice would be appreciated. I feel so lost and bewildered.

287,"Hi friends! I’m 22 and I moved to New York City in January for an unpaid internship (nonprofit theater industry). My internship is up in May and just yesterday my employers offered me a job. It’s only 15 hours a week and barely above NYC minimum wage. 

I’m originally from Michigan which is where all of my family still is except for my cousin whom I’m currently staying with. 

If I were to stay, I’d need to find my own apartment, find a second job to make ends meet (high rent, student loans, metrocard costs, groceries, etc.)

I’m not sold on New York as a place to live for a while but I also don’t have any job prospects back at home. If I were to turn down this job I’d be moving home and looking for work there or in Chicago.

Basically, I’m really torn as to what to do. I love the people I work with and the stuff I’m doing but I feel very lonely here and miss the lifestyle back in Michigan.

288,"So I work in a non profit that does std testing and support for people with HIV. We have a food pantry that is open to people with HIV in our area. Several of our food pantry clients and repeat std testing patients like to bring their animals with them into the office. Their animals are not usually behaved, nor do their owners try to manage them in a way I believe a respectful owner should. An example would be we have a client that we know is fearful of dogs and today one client just let his dog run around d our office while she was also present, 2 strikes in my opinion.

But, the issue is my boss brings his dog to work. She is a calm dog, stays in his office behind a baby gate, barely makes a sound all day, and is of great comfort to nervous patients as she is a very relaxed dog. 

I'd like to implement a no dog policy but I feel guilty because we have the office dog. Also some of our clients are homeless and I am unsure where they would put their dogs when they come in. But on the other hand we are a business and have standards to uphold. 

Any advice?

Well she just let me know on Easter that she plans on selling the property in the fall and using that money to potentially start another business or fund me to start my own. I'm crushed, totally crushed, and I told her this. I told her how her business is my second home and that I couldn't imagine life with out it. I feel betrayed and lied to.

297,"Ok.
So I am 16. I am a sophomore in high school. My name is Joey and I am gay. A random fact, I know, but it becomes important later.
Freshman year, I met a girl from India. Let's call her... Kayla.
Kayla is in my grade, but she is 18. She didn't get held back, but since she's from India, adopted, and all that, she got held back two years.
Initially we basically hated each other. But then in January 2017, I met a girl. Let's call her Hannah. She's from Ohio and one grade above me. She's Mexican, and we initially met through other friends. Then I found out that Hannah's adopted sister is Kayla, and I felt like gagging. But through Hannah, we became okay with each other. I'd say by April 2017 we were cool with each other. I was much stronger friends with Hannah, but today it's more equal.
When summer started, I talked to Hannah a little but not much.
Then on the first day of school, we reunited, and I became even stronger friends with Hannah, and Kayla too.
By November 2017, Kayla and Hannah had become two of my closest friends.
Ugh. This is where it gets bad.
Sigh. 
Okay. So Kayla met a male freshman in December 2017. Let's call him Chad. He's 14 and will be 15 in June.
I already (barely) knew him from our fourth period.
I always felt there was a lot of romantic tension between them, but Kayla said they were just friends, so I let it go.
Then in January 2018 she randomly said one day ""Wanna know a secret? I like him."" Then a day later Chad told me in fourth that they were dating and had been since December.
I was okay with it at first. Initially I suggested to her that she should date someone her own age, but that deeply pissed her off. I apologized, and we moved on. Kayla tried to keep all of this a secret between the three of us, but Hannah found out. Kayla's parents as well as Chad's, still don't know about all of this, so whenever they hang out they go in public. Later in January, we walked by Hannah and Chad said, in front of Kayla, ""Wow that girl is so hot"" because he was unaware that Hannah is her sister, which also shows how little he knows about Kayla. Kayla got mad for a little while, but they moved on. But then Hannah started saying that she doesn't like Chad, that he's rude, a fuckboy, and that Kayla should date someone her own age. Chad started calling Hannah a bitch and other names, so ever since then they have hated each other.
In February they started having some relationship issues and Kayla would frequently call me crying, so I would give advice, she would take it, and soon they'd be back together. But then it started happening frequently, and it got worse. Then this huge thing came up towards the end of February. 
So apparently, while they were dating in February, he sent a dick pic to his ex. His ex's friend exposed him, and he got all mad. Then Kayla got all mad at his ex and her friend even though she didn't do anything to influence his actions. Then, they made up. But then Kayla told me that they have tried to break up three times, so that's not good.
Also, as mean as this sounds, it still bugs me so much that she is dating someone FOUR years younger than him despite the fact that it's technically illegal. It's just wrong.
Through out March and up to today, April 13th, Kayla has called and texted me sooo many times. On March 22, I finally suggested that she just break up with him but she's too attached and so I told her that I don't know what else to tell her because it's getting annoying.
On March 29, she decided to break up. She ignored him up until April 3, where she got back together with him. I finally told her if she's not gonna follow my advice, she needs to find someone else to cry to. She said that if I really cared about her that I would understand her and try to help this thing work out because she loves him. I told her that if she really cared about herself, me, or Hannah, she would do what's best for her and stop her suffering. I walked away after that, but I looked back at her, and she gave me a nasty look. 
I ignored her up until April 7, but I apologized to her because I like having her as a friend and I genuinely care about her so I couldn't stay away. We stick together, because we like each other, and we always rely on each other.
But she is always with Chad, so I don't talk to her at school as much as I used to. Then on April 11 she called me crying about Chad, and how he's stubborn and overly attached, and how he's emotional. I told her that I always give her the same advice, but she said she's not gonna break up with him. Eventually we started getting mad at each other because he always shit talks me and Hannah, and I confronted her about it, but she got mad and hung up. That night I texted Hannah just to say hi, and she asked me why Kayla said she was mad at me. I told her not to talk to Kayla about it, but that I was getting annoyed with Kayla. Then I mentioned how he always shit talks both of us, and Hannah told me to find an alternative solution other than breaking up with Chad, even though he's never even there for her, he's always fighting with her, and Kayla has even told me that he gets jealous of me even though I am gay, and she said that he's annoying a lot and that she likes spending time with me a lot better. Then I mentioned to Hannah how Kayla is 18 and how Chad is 14, but I only did that because Kayla even said it bugged her and I agree that it's weird. But Hannah said ""Aw Joey don't say that, she feels horrible when someone mentions their age gap."" I texted back ""She brought it up, but let's change the subject"" She didn't reply and I haven't talked to her since. I tried texting Kayla that night an apology. I told her that I loved her and will always support her, but that I want what's best for her. She didn't respond, so the next day during fourth period, I texted her.
I said ""wow thx for responding""
She texted back saying that she got busy and that she was sorry so I texted her back ""yea sure""
Ever since yesterday I have ignored her at every cost, and I have seriously started to consider not being her friend anymore. It's too much, and she talks about it all way too much. She's not even the same fun person anymore, she's just annoying now, and a lot more quiet and depressed and negative, even about herself. She used to be really confident.
Anyways, so today in sixth I had to pee so I was going to the bathroom and I saw Kayla crying. I tried asking her what's wrong and she just said it was her friend, a friend she somehow managed to never tell me about.
She was going to the office to turn in an attendance sheet and before she went in I walked the other direction. As I was walking away I said ""bitch"" and smiled playfully at her. She looked back and said ""hoe"" and smiled back at me, because we always joke around like that.
I feel awful about this whole thing and I have no idea what to do. I have both Chad and Kayla's number, but I don't know what to do, I'm still mad at Kayla and I love her, I always wanna be there for her and be her friend, but were going through a rough patch and idk what to do.

298,"Hi, I am an agnostic 18-year-old male who is about to go to University soon. I am a highly open and creative, but not to the point where my brain falls out of my head. I read a lot of classic lit, and spend my time in the house. I never drink or party like most kids do from where I'm from. So In general, I am a decent kid. 

However, I have a helicopter mother who can't keep out of my relationships. She always says to marry/date some Christian girl that is 'Pure"" and ""innocent"".
I do not live by her religious standards, therefore, everyone I date is a conflict for her to direct me away from. 

(She also does not know I am agnostic)

She will always tell me whoever I am with is ""fast"" or some sort of completely disrespectful thing like that.

She is always asking me if my girlfriends are religious and love Jesus. (Which is something she thinks will make for a good mother to raise her grandchildren. I am smart enough to know what makes a good mother/wife and it's not that.)

She needs to realize that i am an individual and not a piece of dough cut from her cookie cutter. I avoid talking to her about this kind of stuff due to the extreme fear of what her extreme Ideology may bring out (e.g. not paying for my college, disowning me) 

I have tried to talk to my mother before about practical things, so believe me, there is no room for negotiation at all. She is set in her beliefs.

Don't get me wrong though, my mom is a good person she does care for me, sometimes a little too much. 

 It is obvious that she does not see me as an individual.

A while back I tried talking to a girl that fit her standards of being a ""good Christian girl"". I hated it. It felt unnatural and synthetic. Almost like the way Hollywood people talk to each other or present themselves. 

I felt that way especially when my other family came over for Thanksgiving where I had that innocent meek lamb of a girl over. The rest of my family approved when I secretly did not. 

I don't want my mom to disown me and I don't want this helicopter parent behavior to enter into my college years. I want her to respect me as an individual and for the person I really am.

I'm standing in my kitchen now in my shoes and coat for 5 minutes before he walks in the door says hi and starts walking about the house. I ask...""are we going?"" and he says ""just a minute"" then proceeds to go to the basement for several minutes...then he comes into the kitchen and starts texting for another two minutes before he says hello again and gives me a kiss and again I say ""...hello, are we going now?"" on our way out I mention ""...you know it really bothers me that you asked me to be ready and then left me standing here for 10 minutes while you did (whatever misc. stuff he was doing in the house). He gets super upset and says he ""can't believe i'd get upset at something like that, how i get to sit at home all day and can't wait ""2 minutes"" etc."" It's not that the act of it bothers me that much, it's just that he wanted me to be respectful of his time by being ready...then he sees no bother in having me wait there without any acknowledgement or explanation. He doesn't think he should have acted any other way, or apologize, which I think is the polite thing to do...say ""i'm sorry, i didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I had no idea my actions would have that effect on you, I'll try not to do that again""  or say as he walks in the door ""hey, i've got to do a quick thing or two, feel free to sit down, we can go in a few minutes"". We've been together a year and a half...I usually just ignore these things to not start a fight, but am I over-reacting saying that I don't want to be with someone that starts a fight every time I tell him something that bothers me? I just want better communication, which I've told him just now, and he laughs and says...well good luck, you're never going to find anyone who will put up with your ridiculous arguments.

308,Ok so I’m just gonna be straight up I recorded myself masturbating on my iPhone camera and I deleted it right after I finished. People are telling me google maps could’ve backed this up to their server or whatever. But I had that turned off and all photo sharing things turned off. I was connected to the internet I’m pretty sure. They were also telling me apps that had access to my camera/camera roll could’ve saved it for themselves on their own server. What are the odds of an app doing this if I deleted the video right after I took it? Could they access my phones memory too? Please help me understand this as I can’t stop thinking about it.

310,"Right so my brother is older than me by a few years. We have different bodies. I was always really skinny and never gained weight. My brother on the other hand has always had baby fat or been chubby. It was never really an issue when he was growing up because he wasn't unhealthy or obese, he just had some extra fat. My parents thought that as he grew old, he would lose it or he would fill out but that never happened. 

He's about to gradudate college and I guess I'm concerned about him. He's gained a lot of weight in the past 8 months, about 70lbs. He was working during the summer on a ship at sea and he lost lots of weight, about 50 lbs in just a few months. He regained all that and more when he returned. He thinks it's a thyroid problem, which is something that has been a problem in our family. I do want him to get tested for that but I have a strong feeling it's about his diet as well. 

He does drink beer, lots of carbs, salty foods, cheesy stuff,  most of this is because he eats at college and they have terrible food. He also eats lots of sweets and desserts, sugary stuff. He wanted a gym membership but our parents said no because he doesnt go to often so he uses the gym at school. I don't think he uses it too often though. My mom has suggested dieting and he said that's not the problem. She suggested he go biking or hiking with me on the weekends and he always says he's too tired to do that. He has a bad sleep schedule. Stays up late watching movies or has a rough night. I don't know if that might have something to do with his weight gain. 

I want to help him and be there for him because his body image is important to him. I don't want him to become depressed or have self esteem issues because my mom subtly brings up his weight like 'your pants are getting too small for you... I had to buy you a new belt... I gave away your shirts because you can't fit in them/can't wear them.' This bothers me because it really affects him. 

How do I talk to him about dieting or going to the gym more often? Or even convince my parents to get my brother tested for a thyroid disorder?

I do really enjoy geology but I'm not totally sure what I would want to do as a career, since I also really enjoy environmental science based work.

317,"I posted four days ago explaining this situation (if you haven’t read it, read it as everything will make more sense) and I don’t know if I’m currently being irrational because I’m upset and angry, but this feels like a decent place to turn to. 

This may sound very silly, but here I go. My drama group from last year have several group chats and we’re pretty much inseparable. We hang out together, throw drama parties, go to Thorpe park together and so on. Recently, on our snapchat group chat, there have been several posts from a few people - most notably J and G - containing my ex (let’s call him Big C). I mentioned to J that it made me uncomfortable (not because I’m not over him, I’ve moved on and I’m happier than ever now. He just makes me insanely and irrationally angry to the point where I think I need to see someone about it) and she’s stopped posting pictures of him. However, one of my good friends, G, continuously posts pictures of him with no regard for my feelings. Instead of dealing with this privately I very sarcastically called her out on the group chat “oh I love it when you guys hang out with Big C who you’ve all moaned about with me, I’m so glad you’re all friends, it makes me so happy to see you all getting along”, to get her claiming she’s never moaned about him - she has. I expressed my thoughts, telling her she needed to consider my feelings more before posting with Big C, to which she apologised. I don’t know how genuine this was, after all we are drama students and this is on the group chat where she won’t want to make a bad impression, but I’m willing to believe she was being genuine. 

I know this seems like a big moan but it will come to something and it is quite therapeutic for me to type this all out. 

Anyway, they often go out as a group, the drama lot, minus a few people. They’ll go out in the evenings and either hang out at McDonald’s (classy, I know) or a pub. There are a few that won’t go because they live further away or aren’t interested, and then there’s me that isn’t invited because they’ve invited Big C instead. The same Big C they know only because of him and me being previously together. It can’t be just me that thinks this is super shitty of them? 

A few of us have April birthdays coming up, G included. G has decided to do pre-drinks, Spoons (british pub thingy) then clubbing. I know that without a doubt Big C will be there because they’re brown nosing each other beyond belief, but I don’t want to miss out on a friends birthday and an event I’ve actually for once been invited to because Big C will be there. At the same time, however, I can’t bear the thought of having to sit in the same room as him for the majority of the evening. 

A few people advised on my last post to talk it out with him or just try and forget and so on, but that’s very much easier said than done when the same person you want desperately want to forget is being shoved down your throat every other night. 

TLDR: my friends are snaking me out by hanging out with my ex and mugging me off. Help

318,"So here's the situation. I have lived with two of my close friends for the past year in an apartment. For the sake of privacy, let's refer to them as Phoebe and Kelly. Kelly is moving to a new state when our lease ends in a month. We've had some issues with our current building so Phoebe and I both want to search for a new apartment. My best friend Allison is moving here as well and will be joining us as our 3rd roommate.

Only problem is that as the end of our lease gets closer I am realizing that I no longer want to live with Phoebe. She's a very good friend and we do get along, but overall she's flighty and irresponsible as a roommate in terms of cleanliness, locking up, turning off the stove, etc. I'm always picking up her stuff, feeding her pets, making sure the apartment is in very basic working order... also her boyfriend just informed me that he'll be staying with us for the next month due to a temporary change in his job (it's ok i guess, but she failed to inform us at all...) The list goes on but these are the basics. Oh, additionally, I am wanting to move to a spot in our city that is a bit more vibrant, and equidistant to all of our jobs, instead of only being convenient for her. She's being overly stingy about money and it's adding stress to the apartment search. She ALSO recently announced that she is pretty sure she's going to move away after this next lease year...which would leave Allison and I scrambling to find yet another apartment after we clearly expressed that we want to live in this next one for at least 2 years. 

Allison, on the other hand, is very responsible, clean, and reliable. I am finding myself wanting to live with just Allison in a 2 bedroom. The only problem is that I did commit to living with the three of them, and I don't really think Phoebe knows anybody she could move in with at this short of notice. I don't want to ruin our friendship, nor do I want to screw her over- especially with such little time left to find a place but I find myself. 

I really don't know the best way to approach the situation. Do I tell her that I'm going AWOL? Or do I suck it up and live with her?

TLDR; I committed to finding an apartment with my current roommate and my other friend, and I am realizing that I don't want to live with my current roommate anymore. We have 1 month until our lease ends and I don't know what to do.

319,"and now I want out.

Throwaway account obviously. But the story goes like this.

I meet her online. We go out, get engaged, married, all within under two years. At the time of the wedding and prior, I was being treated for depression due to suicidal attempts. I started treatment while we were engaged and after a month of being married, it was like a switch went off.

""I know what being happy is now and it's not here""

Now that I have made significant progress on my path for mental health, I find myself feeling like I was depressed prior to treatment when I'm around her. We don't click, we have nothing in common, and nothing equals up for us as to what we want out of life.

is it wrong to consider divorce due to this? Due to a different mindset before and after? We have a daughter together and my main priority is her. I worry if I do seek divorce she will fight for her but I can't keep feeling like I did a year ago anymore. My psychologist doesn't really help with my thoughts and he even validated me in a way for my thinking, as shitty as it might feel.

320,"I am a 30-year-old, non-traditional nursing student and I live with an older woman who offered me a room during this school year that was close to my campus.  Originally, she had health problems that would need some assistance; nothing major- just some help around the house here and there. However, I have come to find out that she is a major alcoholic. Several months ago she got drunk, fell out of bed and broke her hip.  I was there for her during it all and even studied for mid-term exams in the emergency waiting room just so she wouldn't be alone.  During the ordeal, Little nosey me looked through her telephone to call her son and happened across quite a colorful rant about me; how she just does not like me; and that of all things ""I forget to empty the dishwasher..."" That was the first instance when I knew things were not right this woman. Since that time I have caught her multiple times bad-mouthing me to her friends. Yet, she smiles in my face. I once confronted her about it and she started to scream that ""I cant tell her what to do!"" (WTF?)..Her hip surgery was 5 months ago. She has done nothing but sit in her recliner for 20 hours of the day and tell her friends that I do nothing to help her. (Even though she is healed).  I can't stand it anymore.

As a skilled professional, he asked for my opinion and we engaged in an active critique of the business idea, its weaknesses and how best to develop the offering. All very exciting as I am sure you can tell.

I am with a somebody I consider a friend, so I speak freely, and the conversation develops but eventually moves to other topics. After a while on unrelated topics, I present a very different solution to the problem which we both agree is far more effective. I excuse myself to the bathroom at this point.

We’re both graduated and I recently moved into my first apartment, by myself,  with no co-signers / roommates, etc. My lease is for a year so I can’t leave until April of 2019. 

Recently, my boyfriend told me that he’s going to go into the army to help achieve his dream of becoming a firefighter. He doesn’t have a full time job currently and is still living at home with his parents. He believes that the army is his only way out of the house. He wants to become a medic for the army, but yet for some reason he’s under the impression that he will never be made to be in infantry. He never discussed this choice with me, he simply texted me one day and told me that he talked to a recruiter. 

When I heard about this I was absolutely devastated. We haven’t ever gone over two weeks without seeing each other or even talking to each other. 

He told me that once he signs all the papers in the next few weeks, he will be going away to basic training for 4 1/2 months and after that he will be stationed across the state that we live in and he has no intentions of ever coming back home. He told me that either I go with him or our relationship is over. He also said that if I make the choice not to go, the ending of the relationship is on me. 

I’ve tried to convince him to change his mind, or even compromise with me on coming back home. I can’t just up and leave my job, friends, family and newly signed lease for him. He says that he’s 100% set on going and “nothing but death will change that.”

I went onto Steam and saw some really cool looking games. Some of them are pretty expensive, and I don't want to spend any more than 200$. 

I'm trying to narrow the list down, but it's hard since I can't do research (to avoid spoilers and such). All I can do is read reviews and analyze game descriptions and tags.

Some more background on my current financial situation:

I'm 13 (birthday turning 14) and my parents are middle class (maybe in the upper-middle class). We are buying a brand new half million dollar house, and selling our own for about 490k.

My dad has a good job and makes good money, and recently got a raise. 

I'm also depending on summer sales (since my birthday is in the summer). So some games may be cheaper than what I put here.

Also keep in mind that I am mature enough to have these games. I play GTA V and Fallout NV for gods sake. 

These are all games that I have heard of before, and want equally as bad. 

Here is the list and the prices:

4.99 -Betrayer

9.99 -Gary's mod

19.99 -Borderlands

335,"Ok. So I am 16. I am a sophomore in high school. My name is Joey and I am gay. A random fact, I know, but it becomes important later. Freshman year, I met a girl from India. Let's call her... Kayla. Kayla is in my grade, but she is 18. She didn't get held back, but since she's from India, adopted, and all that, she got held back two years. Initially we basically hated each other. But then in January 2017, I met a girl. Let's call her Hannah. She's from Ohio and one grade above me. She's Mexican, and we initially met through other friends. Then I found out that Hannah's adopted sister is Kayla, and I felt like gagging. But through Hannah, we became okay with each other. I'd say by April 2017 we were cool with each other. I was much stronger friends with Hannah, but today it's more equal. When summer started, I talked to Hannah a little but not much. Then on the first day of school, we reunited, and I became even stronger friends with Hannah, and Kayla too. By November 2017, Kayla and Hannah had become two of my closest friends. Ugh. This is where it gets bad. Sigh. Okay. So Kayla met a male freshman in December 2017. Let's call him Chad. He's 14 and will be 15 in June. I already (barely) knew him from our fourth period. I always felt there was a lot of romantic tension between them, but Kayla said they were just friends, so I let it go. Then in January 2018 she randomly said one day ""Wanna know a secret? I like him."" Then a day later Chad told me in fourth that they were dating and had been since December. I was okay with it at first. Initially I suggested to her that she should date someone her own age, but that deeply pissed her off. I apologized, and we moved on. Kayla tried to keep all of this a secret between the three of us, but Hannah found out. Kayla's parents as well as Chad's, still don't know about all of this, so whenever they hang out they go in public. Later in January, we walked by Hannah and Chad said, in front of Kayla, ""Wow that girl is so hot"" because he was unaware that Hannah is her sister, which also shows how little he knows about Kayla. Kayla got mad for a little while, but they moved on. But then Hannah started saying that she doesn't like Chad, that he's rude, a fuckboy, and that Kayla should date someone her own age. Chad started calling Hannah a bitch and other names, so ever since then they have hated each other. In February they started having some relationship issues and Kayla would frequently call me crying, so I would give advice, she would take it, and soon they'd be back together. But then it started happening frequently, and it got worse. Then this huge thing came up towards the end of February. So apparently, while they were dating in February, he sent a dick pic to his ex. His ex's friend exposed him, and he got all mad. Then Kayla got all mad at his ex and her friend even though she didn't do anything to influence his actions. Then, they made up. But then Kayla told me that they have tried to break up three times, so that's not good. Also, as mean as this sounds, it still bugs me so much that she is dating someone FOUR years younger than him despite the fact that it's technically illegal. It's just wrong. Through out March and up to today, April 13th, Kayla has called and texted me sooo many times. On March 22, I finally suggested that she just break up with him but she's too attached and so I told her that I don't know what else to tell her because it's getting annoying. On March 29, she decided to break up. She ignored him up until April 3, where she got back together with him. I finally told her if she's not gonna follow my advice, she needs to find someone else to cry to. She said that if I really cared about her that I would understand her and try to help this thing work out because she loves him. I told her that if she really cared about herself, me, or Hannah, she would do what's best for her and stop her suffering. I walked away after that, but I looked back at her, and she gave me a nasty look. I ignored her up until April 7, but I apologized to her because I like having her as a friend and I genuinely care about her so I couldn't stay away. We stick together, because we like each other, and we always rely on each other. But she is always with Chad, so I don't talk to her at school as much as I used to. Then on April 11 she called me crying about Chad, and how he's stubborn and overly attached, and how he's emotional. I told her that I always give her the same advice, but she said she's not gonna break up with him. Eventually we started getting mad at each other because he always shit talks me and Hannah, and I confronted her about it, but she got mad and hung up. That night I texted Hannah just to say hi, and she asked me why Kayla said she was mad at me. I told her not to talk to Kayla about it, but that I was getting annoyed with Kayla. Then I mentioned how he always shit talks both of us, and Hannah told me to find an alternative solution other than breaking up with Chad, even though he's never even there for her, he's always fighting with her, and Kayla has even told me that he gets jealous of me even though I am gay, and she said that he's annoying a lot and that she likes spending time with me a lot better. Then I mentioned to Hannah how Kayla is 18 and how Chad is 14, but I only did that because Kayla even said it bugged her and I agree that it's weird. But Hannah said ""Aw Joey don't say that, she feels horrible when someone mentions their age gap."" I texted back ""She brought it up, but let's change the subject"" She didn't reply and I haven't talked to her since. I tried texting Kayla that night an apology. I told her that I loved her and will always support her, but that I want what's best for her. She didn't respond, so the next day during fourth period, I texted her. I said ""wow thx for responding"" She texted back saying that she got busy and that she was sorry so I texted her back ""yea sure"" Ever since yesterday I have ignored her at every cost, and I have seriously started to consider not being her friend anymore. It's too much, and she talks about it all way too much. She's not even the same fun person anymore, she's just annoying now, and a lot more quiet and depressed and negative, even about herself. She used to be really confident. Anyways, so today in sixth I had to pee so I was going to the bathroom and I saw Kayla crying. I tried asking her what's wrong and she just said it was her friend, a friend she somehow managed to never tell me about. She was going to the office to turn in an attendance sheet and before she went in I walked the other direction. As I was walking away I said ""bitch"" and smiled playfully at her. She looked back and said ""hoe"" and smiled back at me, because we always joke around like that. I feel awful about this whole thing and I have no idea what to do. I have both Chad and Kayla's number, but I don't know what to do, I'm still mad at Kayla and I love her, I always wanna be there for her and be her friend, but were going through a rough patch and idk what to do. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.",13Apr2018,2
336,"I work 2 jobs. 1 (Pizza Hut) in the morning and 1 (Pharmacy delivering meds to Elderly homes)  at nighttime. Inbetween I feel the need to bathe and clean the sweat of the first job off so I typically shower before my second job so I don't smell of sweat/butt. Today when I came into work I notice these posters all over stating that this is a ""fragrance free environment"". Then the boss came and told me about how I'm effecting the pharmacy by coming in and smelling of deodorant and body wash and how I'm triggering illnesses and allergies. She even went so far as to say ""Just standing here talking to you is making me dizzy"". I feel very disrespected and harassed beyond belief. Is this something that I can sue the company for?

338,"I like this guy but one day he was talking with his friend i was sitting next to him and he was like I went night night skiing and I was high af. I don't know if he was actually high though or he was joking and then he was talking about shaking on the chairlift so was he high? Also he was with he older sister so she is probably more likely to get drugs. Then today on the bus some kid was like when ""my crushes name"" walked into first period he  looked \( they never finished the sentence I assumed they were talking about drugs becuase before they started talking about him they were talking about drugs\). So I am in highschool and I'm a good kid but I'm worried this guy does drugs if he did them once it's ok but if he's doing them regaurly him and I could never be a thing. He's sporty so it seems like it would be dumb for him to be doing drugs. I JUST NEED ADVICE",13Apr2018,1
339,"I had my wallet and phone stolen this week. Because of the cost of the phone and wallet and the cash/gift cards inside, even after the deductible, I'd get a check for about $500. 

I know the claim stays on your account for 5 years.  I live in a new townhome where the major repairs are taken care of by the HOA's homeowner's insurance, so it's unlikely I'd have much to file through my insurance, but obviously possible.  However, there is a chance we could move within 5 years. I also read that if you file more than 2 claims in 3 years, you could have your policy cancelled completely. 

I don't want to screw myself over in the long run, but I'd also love $500 to help recoup my losses.

342,"I've never been the kind of person who was ""central"" to a friend group. I've always been the kind of person who had friends in multiple cliques, not one solid group of friends. As a result I was always a little bit of an outsider - close enough to be friends, but not close enough to get invited to their core events. 

I thought this got better in college. While I still had friends across many different groups, I was closer and got invited more. However, ever since graduating I hardly hear from any of them. I only get invited to birthday outings, not their regular hangouts or anything else. I've tried reaching out but usually I just get ignored or the ""yeah! We have to hangout soon!"" but then when I try to make plans nothing ever comes of it. 

This has culminated in me staying home most of the time, and I can go whole days without getting a single text from anyone besides my parents. I've pretty much given up on reaching out because I just feel dumb every time I do, like they're just trying to let the friendship fall off and I'm annoying them by not letting that happen. The thing is, I don't know why. I know that I can suck sometimes, but I've gotten so much better and hadn't done most of my old habits with my college friends. I don't think I'm that terrible, but it seems like no one really wants to be my friend. Not that they actively dislike me, but just that *no one* likes me enough to try to see me or want to make plans without my prompting. 

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like if I said something everyone would just say they're busy and meant nothing and they still like me, but I just feel like *everyone* can't be *that* busy. 

Making new friends in my area isn't really an option. I've lived here my whole life and know pretty much everyone already. I'm looking into jobs, and some of them involve moving out of state. Part me just feels like at this rate I could move 6 hours away and if I didn't say anything no one would even notice for months. I have no idea how to rectify this, or if I even should. I didn't have a fight with any of these people recently or anything either, so it's not that. ",13Apr2018,2
344,"Hey guys, I‘ve started to develop feelings towards one of my classmates, we don‘t really talk to eachother about anything but school stuff. That‘s why I‘m unsure how to proceed. I‘ve never had a girlfriend or a date before and that doesn‘t make things easier. I want to ask her out but I‘m not fond of the idea of being in the same class the girl I date. Even worse would be if she rejects me and things are going to be strange for the rest of our time in class. I‘ve only got one year of school left, I could also wait a year but she might be taken by then.. I really don‘t know what to do. Any help is heavily appreciated!

The littlest stuff makes me go off and I usually just sit in my room whenever I can. I feel like nobody understands me and that I can’t be myself. It’s like I’m emotionally trapped or something.

349,"I’m 38, the man I’m interested in is 39. He’s a combat veteran with 3 tours under his belt. We’ve known each other 9 years. I knew him before combat. Since he’s been back his life has seen terrible tragedies. His wife left, his son died, he moved out of state for sick parents etc. 2 years ago he said he had feelings for me, we tried to work on a relationship, he abruptly ended our relationship, blocked me on Twitter, FB etc. A week ago he tells me again he’s ready this time, move in with him, he has strong feelings for me.  After 4 days of talking/ texting etc he stops abruptly AGAIN. The worst part for me is I can’t get mad at him. I know he’s scared, I know he has PTSD, anxiety etc. My friends say leave him be for good. My family says exploit his weakness (((sense of humor))). The past 2 days I’ve sent him Trump/ Daniels memes, in the hopes he just smiles to himself. He hasn’t responded. I knew he wouldn’t. What do /adv/? Leave him be, send him a meme a day???",13Apr2018,1
351,"Dear Reddit,
I am fairly new here but I would appreciate some advice. I am a fairly extroverted person. My best friend in the entire world (and roommate) is a huge introvert. We have the same sense of humor and I can tell him anything. I know he cares about me. However, we do have some personality issues. I thrive on social interaction and can’t deal with being ignored. It drives me completely crazy. When I’m PISSED at someone i stop talking to them. The silent treatment is how I react when someone upsets me. So when he doesn’t talk to me for a day and needs “to be alone” I can’t help but think he’s upset with me, because that’s how I react. Are there any extroverts with introverted friends who have dealt with this? Or are there any introverts who can explain his side to me? Thanks guys ",13Apr2018,2

Just quickly before the topic of this post...
Update on my Dad’s situation:
He’s home! Which is both good and bad. On one hand it means he is recovering. He told me today he has reached “a turning point.” But on the other hand my Mum now has to put in 200% to keep all of us going. My dad is almost always in his bed. Luckily my Mum has a fucking incredible boss who is letting her take time off but she still only gets about 2-3 hours to relax inbetween doing what needs done in the house. I help around where i can (dishes, hoovering, etc)
but my Mum is one of those people who says “no im fine” and carries on without help. My grandad (Mums side) is now making frequent visits with shopping so all in all that looks up.

But as somebody commented on the last post, i need to pay attention to my own problem too. Social Retardedness.
I tried to take a step back and see what 3 things I think I need to be to overcome this. I came up with these...

Confident
Smart
Strong (Mentally and Physically)

“Holy fuck im none of these things” I immediately said to myself. So this is where I need help this time from people.

How do I become confident when im such a naturally nervous wreck!?

How do I become smarter through revising when (as with everyone and their dogs at the moment) Im addicted to fucking Fortnite and it takes over all of my spare time!?

And how do I get in shape (from underweight) without embarrasing myself at any gyms or whatever!?


One more unrelated thing (As a very direct follow up from last post)
How do I get the head of PE not to phone home about my anxiety?

Thanks a bunch in advanced once again!",13Apr2018,3
353,"Hello Reddit family, here’s my situation. So there’s female that I’ve known for a while. She has a man and has been flirting with me for a while. She thinks I’m attractive but then I just got to the point where I’m over and done being played with. So it wasn’t the best move but I just completely ignored her. She tried getting me jealous with other dudes and everyone else kept telling me that she notices me ignoring her. 
So then, she calls me out we talk about what’s going and she begin to cry and she tells me that she really like my presence and she doesn’t want to lose me and personally I think she actually liked me but of course her having a man doesn’t help. I could be wrong.
We then make up whatever then we stay as friends but then she continues to feed off attention off other dudes and kinda ignores me now and now I feel like a fool. Part of me believed she felt something and meant the apology she gave me. But after seeming this I just don’t think she’s real.

They had one sleepover with everyone else except for me, my bff, and my good friend that’s sometimes mean. then I just found out they had another one today. It’s actually so annoying cause I feel so left out. At school they act like my best friends and then they have all these events without inviting me.
