1,"(I know this might be a strange thing to ask about here but I'm just hopeless at of social interaction) 

I went to a LGBTQ coffee social at my university last week, and I saw one of my flatmates there for a few minutes. They left before I had a chance to talk to them, but I asked them over messenger if they were there (because I wanted to be absolutely sure) and they said they were. 

So now I really want to talk to them more (because they're literally the only non-straight person I know and I've practically never had a chance to even mention my bisexuality to anyone), but I don't know what to say to them. I don't want to just start asking what would be very personal questions out of the blue either. How could I start a conversation with them without it being awkward (especially since we live in the same flat)?",22Oct2018,1
2,"I’m currently seeking treatment for my anxiety and depression. Ive been referred and so far I’ve told them some of the  symptoms I’ve been experiencing, however I’ve not mentioned that I have racing thoughts and I keep pacing when I feel anxious or uncomfortable.

When I’m depressed I tend to replay past conversations in my head that anger me where I didn’t retaliate back or should have said something but didn’t, so I play an alternative scenario where I do, I pace around my room for hours doing this which gives me adrenaline if that makes sense. I’ve been doing this for many years but it’s got worse and I realised how addictive it’s become. 

I also daydream about an alternative reality where I’m successful and happy, this tends to happen when I listen to music. When this happens it isn’t so bad usually I snap out of it. 

Is any of this normal has anybody experienced this? if so I can really use your advice thanks.",22Oct2018,1
3,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 4 years now. In the beginning it was great, after being in a very bad relationship where I had been cheated on, I thought I had finally found the one. For almost a year he was nothing but sweet and all about me, just as I was with him. 

We moved in together at the end of the year, and one day I was on his computer when I saw he had gotten an email. It was from the craigslist personals, a girl (a bot maybe) messaging to hook up. I asked him about it and he said his old roommate signed his email up for a bunch of stuff so I believed him.

Fast forward a few months. I had just gotten off of work and he had just left for work. I made myself some food and sat down with his computer about to watch netflix. When I opened the computer, there was his email, full of atleast 30-40 messages sent to craigslist personals trying to hook up. Asking for pictures, asking to meet up, even in one he had said ""I'm free Tuesday 9-2"" which was the exact hours I was working. I sent him pictures and he immediately came home, apologizing and saying he had done nothing with anybody, he had purely used them for masturbation purposes. I left him for about a week, staying at my moms house. But I believed him that he had never met any of them and a lot of the messages did seem like bots....It was the longest time after that of nothing happening. I thought it'd be over...

Well I ended up getting pregnant last year, about 4 months in of being pregnant I find out he has kik and is using it to get pictures of girls so he can masturbate to. I had never felt hurt like that. I was carrying his baby, he had promised to stop, and here he was doing it again, but just a different outlet. Again he said sorry. I'm not stupid. I know how this must sound, why would I stay with him? Because I didnt want our child to grow up without his parents together bc of something that COULD be fixed. I truly do believe he only used them for masturbation purposes, but it was more of an intimate thing than just watching porn, which I do not care about.

Well it's been over a year and everything has been great. He hasn't been doing any of that, never had to worry about things... I thought once our kid came it had really sunk in for him that he couldn't be doing that to me, to us.

&amp;#x200B;

And ig this is where I need help...the past 2 months we have been having financial troubles after he got fired from his job. It had set us back a bit so we were tight on money. Well on this particular night, he had gone to bed early bc he was sick while I was up. I had seen on fb someone showing how to look at your locations you have been. I dont know why I did it, I think I just had this weird feeling out of nowhere....so I checked his phone. And I didnt see anything. I felt dumb bc I had gone through his phone to find nothing, all his locations were not out of the ordinary...except one. It had said the previous week he had been in a location for about 30 minutes on the 18th and 19th. I looked on google maps and didn't know what it was. So I asked him. And he stared at me for a few moments and finally said ""I went to the strip club."" Not only did he not tell me about it, not only did he spend money we didnt have, but he went two days in a row because the first night he just went in and did nothing so he felt he wasted his time, and felt he needed to get his lapdance, which I found out was 2 dances and then he came home. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I talked to him about it I was so calm. I think because he's hurt me so much with this that I can't take anymore. It's a numbing feeling to hear ""I'm sorry"" and not think anything of it. Like how could he come home to us, and still feel the need to go the next day? How do I learn to trust him again? I feel like the next thing he could do is cheat on me, am I letting this happen? Is it me or the fact he has no self control? He even called his mom and told her everything I just told you, as if it would show he was really serious... ",22Oct2018,1
4,"So, I have failed my first 2 exams in my Gen Chem/College Algebra classes. I get to take the exam for mastery points in Chem tho to go to C- level on my second exam, I'm on pace to get D's in both of those classes and I know why kind of but I just want to know how fucked I might be so I can prepare mentally/devise a plan.

In Spanish right now I have like a 72% but I'm pretty decent at Spanish, I'm confident I could possibly clutch a B. My second exam I got a 87 and I only studied for a day, but that's just because I'm naturally good at spanish.

In chem and math I practically don't go to any lectures, Chem I haven't been to one in so long and I haven't fucking watched a single video. We moving into new units for both Math and Chem right now, and I have an exam for Spanish on Weds.

So, I know I need to start trying now and try and salvage how bad I'm doing in Math/Chem, but is there any chance I can even get C's in these classes still?

How much work will I have to put in?. I don't know shit about good study habits/time management, I don't want to sound like I'm bragging or anything but I think I'm definitely intelligent enough to get A's in these classes. All the problems in the classes are definitely OBJECTIVELY easy, I just don't fucking do shit and I get down on myself for fucking up this semester...

I really want to be able to get like a 3.5, but I've been playing fortnite for probably 3-4 hours a day on average. Some days a lot more, but I do have a reason for it $$$...

I really am at a crossroads, and I want to just go home for college and maybe that'll make me do better, for next semester I'm also thinking about changing to an open major due to possibly easier classes and to discover what I really love. I'm in Biology rn, and I am interested in anything STEM related but I don't have the same motivation I do to play Fortnite with my studies.


I also might have ADHD as well, I went to a psych but I never am going back cuz she was a major bitch. Tried to argue with me when I said I had autism, and wasn't the most knowledgeable about the symptoms (I called another doc who is a specialist for people with autism and he basically said she had a lot of misconceptions).


Anyways, I'll stop this stupid ass ramble. If anyone here has failed their first 2 exams or just their first semester and rebounded. Let me know, please help.",22Oct2018,1
5,"So a Parakeet/Budgie flew in through my open back door a few days back and am trying to make him as comfortable as possible. Will try to give a quick jaunt around the immediate area to see if anyone has lost one soon but I noticed past day or so that he's limping and preferring the use of one leg. Looks relatively healthy, no outwards signs of infection or other issues, healthy appetite (only have wild bird seed), but he's becoming exhausted being unable to sleep well since he can't rotate use of each leg. I'm starting to worry because I don't have the means to take care of him. IF I find owners (if any) then I'll just be handing over a crippled/dead bird.

So here's my conundrum, is there anywhere that'll take in lost birds for free? I tried googling but didn't seem to get far.

8,"To start this off a few years ago to be exact 9 years ago we were living with my uncle. I was 11 years old and we lived with him for two years for reasons that don’t really matter for this story. Also yes i’m using a throwaway account because on my main account I have friends who do not know about this.

So my uncle was always a nice guy I really liked him and so did other family members, he always joking around telling great stories and a hard worker. But in the period that we were living with him he got a bit too touchy and friendly that resulted into 2 years of being molested by him. As I got older I also realized this started way early ( when I was about 9 making me touch his private parts) than the time we were living with him, I won’t go into detail about what took place for obvious reasons. Of course this had a great impact on me in my teen years it made me scared of men and being touched by anyone and still to this day. It made me self harm and also got me suicidal to the point where I almost killed my self when I was 15. Everyday was a big struggle for me and it not only effected my mental health but also my social and school life. I always wanted to tell someone but I could never not even a friend most of the time it felt like I was going insane but if I told my mom this would have a big impact on my family and I was not even sure how she was going to react. To make this worse I always saw this uncle at family gatherings I remember once when I was 14 and we moved out from him he came to me telling me “how much fun we had”. For years I have walked around with this burden thinking maybe it was not as bad or maybe it was my fault. But as I got older I realized it’s not okay and nobody deserves this to have happen to them. 

You may be wondering why i’m here asking for help about something that happened years ago. This is my first time ever telling anyone about this whole situation even online. I’m here asking for help because my uncle recently got married. I’m not sure if he wants to have kids but I think they are trying to have a kid. I don’t even want to know what he will do if he has a daughter and I don’t want anyone to go through the depression I went through and the shame I felt because of something like that. I’m scared that if he gets a girl he will do the same thing to her and god forbid maybe even worse. I’m at complete loss at the moment and maybe he changed but I doubt he did because whenever I see him he still acts as creepy. But the worse part is I should have come clean about this years ago, I should have told somebody about what happened. I don’t know what to do now and I feel like it’s too late. I just fear what will happen if he does decide to have kids and it’s a girl. If anyone has advice as to what I can do in this situation I would greatly appreciate it. I know I might be overreacting or being paranoid but if this man actually has kids I really fear for them. 

Also i’m sorry if there are any spelling mistakes English is not my first language, it’s late and i’m kind of all over the place. Thank you so much for reading.",22Oct2018,1

15,"Last year my wife and I just moved into our first neighborhood. It wasn't long before a few kids started making their rounds asking us to buy something to support their school clubs. At first we were happy to support them. However it seems once we said yes it opened the flood gates. We were still willing to support the kids, but we soon decided it had to stop when we started getting different families showing up almost every day for about a month. The final straw was when one mother kept driving her son back to our house each day (over a 4 day period), parking in our drive way, and set there until we finally bought her son's discount card (we felt really sorry for the young child, it was clear he was very embarrassed). After that we were done with all of it. Some neighbors understood and some didn't, oh well. For the most part the selling seemed to stop. Until this week. We had a handful of kids show up each day through out the week. We polity declined each offer and the kids seems fine with it. They'd hop down our front steps and run right up our side yard to the next house. However tonight we had another parent drive back to our house, come to our door with their high school teenager demanding we buy something to support their child. This has become ridiculous.   


I would think simply saying no thank you would be enough, but apparently not. We've started declining everyone now. We've also just tried ignoring the doorbell, but since some of these are young kids some will constantly ring the bell until we answer (Yes sometimes a parent is standing right next to the kid as it's happening). I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to handle this situation? Since children are involved my wife and I have held back from showing any anger towards these belligerent parents, but if it comes to that you can bet I wont hold back. However, I was wondering if anyone knew of maybe a polite and less aggressive approach to get these people to stop showing up. ",22Oct2018,1

18,"I'm a Uni freshman in US that started at late August and I have a roommate. We're both Chinese and we live close to each other(in terms of where we're from). However, English is my first language since my lessons were taught in English and Mandarin is my second language, whereas he's the opposite, just like any standard Chinese student is. Despite all this, we get along well.

My roomie sleeps early, like he usually goes to bed by 11pm. I normally sleep late regardless if it's weekday or weekend so I go to bed by like 3 or 4am. This is fine because I never made much noise as I either watch Netflix, YouTube or do my assignments late at night. 

But then after a few weeks my roommate casually complains that I snore in my sleep, and that this affects his sleep. I knew this might've been a problem before I even met my roommate because I'm chubby and it's pretty accurate that chubbier people snore easily. He claims that he often wakes up at 4 or 5am almost everyday and can't go back to sleep because I snore. As I don't sleep a lot, I say that he should just use earplugs and once he sleeps he should have no reason to wake up randomly at night and not be able to sleep if I snore unless he goes to the restroom. He says the earplugs he got are ineffective. Therefore, I've been sleeping more on my side rather than on my back to prevent snoring. This has been going on for weeks and this more or less greatly reduces his complaints for inadequate sleep.

However there was this one time where his complaints got so annoying where I just blatantly said ""I'll just sacrifice my 4 hours of sleep so that you could sleep peacefully for a full 10 hours okay?"" and he didn't say anything. There were times where my roommate would call out my name and wake me up to say I'm snoring again, which then I'd say sorry and sleep on my side. 

But on this one night I decided to sleep at 4:30am after studying for a test and when I'm still lying down wide awake, my roommate randomly calls my name to say I'm snoring again. I instantly replied ""I'm wide awake and haven't even slept, how am I snoring?"" He ignored this remark and just said I'm snoring, WHEN I WAS CLEARLY FUCKIN AWAKE. He complains the next morning that he only got like 7 hours of sleep whereas I only got like 2 because I woke up at 7 cuz I couldn't sleep. I said ""are you unaware that I slept 2 hours and I'm still fine, but I've sacrificed my sleep just cuz you've been bitching?"" And he just complains that he still sleeps less than he normally does. Fuckin pissed me off how he's so self centered. At least I did well that test so my last night studying paid off.

Alright, whatever. There's more.

We both want to be healthier since we came because after a few weeks of eating outside, we both gained weight. Whenever we eat in the school canteen, I'd fill up on vegetables and meat while he gets more meat than vege and some carbohydrates. He'd say that I'd get more fat for eating so much vege. Which then I retaliated with ""You like chicken wings so much, don't tell me they're healthier than vege"" to which he jokingly said yeah. This irritated me a lil but it's quite insignificant cuz I just ignored his remarks and lost weight from healthy food habits. But this just tells me how ignorant or narrow minded he is.

Next.

My roommate studied English intensively every now and then because he wanted to get a good TOEFL score. Therefore, he'd occasionally ask me for help whenever he doesn't understand something. I didn't mind helping at first but he eventually gets to the point where he's quite needy(?) whenever there's English involved.

For instance, whenever he wants to go out such as Bestbuy, Walmart, to the school doctors,etc. He'd want me to tag along with him. I'm not always free but he'd still really want me to go with him. I asked him why and he says because he feels safer if I'm there with him to communicate with anyone else. This doesn't seem too bad at first, but the one time I went to the school doctors with him, the appointment was at 8 and my lesson starts at 9. After helping my roommate with the survey and telling the doctor the problem, my roommate didn't want me to go and I was forced to skip my 9am lecture. This was fine as it wasn't the first time but he didn't even apologise for using my time. 

Moving onto the main course.

It was a few days before my roommates TOEFL exam and he was seriously studying. But he was studying on vocabulary and usage of words, which worried me because he scored about 40 on his third TOEFL exam even with studying. For instance, he'd ask me how to use the word ""appear"" in a sentence, or the pronunciation of ""energetic"", struggled with pronouncing ""competition"" or asking synonyms for ""illustrate"". I knew he wouldn't do well and I was genuinely worries for him but I'd still help him regardless.

The night before the TOEFL exam he said he really really wanted me to go with him. I demanded why, I don't wanna wake up at like 6 for an exam I'm not taking on a glorious weekend morning, but he said he'd feel less anxious if I went with him. I was his roommate so I said fine, I'd just bring a book and sit in a nearby McDonald's to read. 

After studying, he slept at 12 and I continued browsing on the internet till 2 before I went to bed. My roommate has setted up an alarm and woke up at 3am to study. At 5am he woke me up and said the question for the writing essay was just leaked onto a Chinese website and he asks me to make an essay outline for him. I told him that even if I don't sleep much, waking a friend up just to help write an essay outline is outright inconsiderate. He said please and I scrunched up a draft in minutes, but had to edit and explain my essay's arguments to him cuz he didn't understand jack shit. Afterwards we left to go to his exam center. 

He said he needed to arrive at 7:15 but we left the dorm at 6:10. We arrived at 6:20 and the exam center wasn't open. We waited outside in the cold for a good 20minutes before someone inside let us in. Afterwards I just went to a nearby McDonald's and read my book and was on my phone for four hours before meeting up with him. I later slept from 1 to 7:30, wasting almost am entire day. Despite all this, he didn't say thank you nor apologize for wasting my Saturday. 

This was yesterday btw. I now contemplate on moving out to live by myself in a spare dorm. I'll have to wait till tmr to ask the school. My dad is already aware of this and hopes the extra cost isn't too much, but isn't against my idea since I said my roommate hinders my studies and that we got sleeping conflicts, not telling him anything about the TOEFL.

I have a good tolerance level and am usually quite patient. But I genuinely thinks my roomate is using me to obtain a good TOEFL to just leave me by next semester to another uni. He's self centered, ignorant and unreasonable (vege makes you fat LOL WHAT okay). 

Should I move out? He's fine as a friend and we joke around, but he's unaware of his actions and by moving out I'd just help him less. Also we wouldn't have any bullshit conflict regarding my sleeping. 

Am I bitching too much or do you all agree that he's self centered as hell? I swear to god this can't be normal. Bitching over a lil less sleep when I suffered more in terms of sleep deficit, waking up a friend to help them make an essay outline at 5 at the fuckin morning before dragging me out to go out with him, causing me to sleep the afternoon and essentially wasting my afternoon. 
 
I haven't told him I plan to move out yet. Want to make sure there's available rooms before doing that. Do I need to be extreme and completely not be friends with him anymore?

Serious suggestions only please.

19,"Background: After I graduated from community college with my associates degree I interned in the real world for nearly a year. After coming home I worked for a few months, not knowing what I wanted to do. Eventually I enrolled in my local university. After a semester I transferred to an online school with a completely different major and have been doing that for the past few months. I always got good grades, but I never liked school. After being in the real world I got fed up with being coddled at another school and delaying permanent entry into the real world.

Problem: I want to learn things. I want to learn soooo many things, but I can't stand the school environment. It's pissed me off so many times throughout the years. While I love that online college allows me to work full time, I'm not getting that much out of my current major. So, while I am still early in the game, I am thinking of changing my major. Or... Just not going to college at all at this point. Of course, I do worry a bit because I don't really have many skills...

I know that it's impossible to be completely self-taught in certain subjects, but do I really need to force myself through an environment I hate?

24,"Hi there. I just want to see if some people are in my same position or if its just a thing that I do. I've been friends with these girls for over three years now, and I've always felt really good around them. But, sometimes, i just feel like i cant be my open self, or i cant be completely open with them because I feel like they would just drop me right there. 

In their defense, I'm a pretty intense person. I need boundaries and space, which apparently, they dont. We used to always share clothes and stuff, but lately ive been making some money so I buy more stuff and more expensive stuff that I dont necessarily want them to borrow (also because we all have very different body types and some of their things dont fit them and vice versa). I've said this to them over and over agin, but it seems as everytime I'm not at the house, i see pictures of them wearing my shit. I texted them about it and nobody responded, which obviously mzde me feel like shit, but i dont feel like im out of line here. This is my stuff, and they should respect it. I know this is a very superficial and materialistic thing, but its the same with more serious stuff. I just feel like i cant be direct with them without them being really short. I dont know what to do, i feel like i made the wrong friends and now im stuck in a very unequal friendship.

25,"For example, my friend said she wanted to go to the movies tonight. I asked her what’s up and what the plan was at 7 pm and over an hour later she hasn’t responded. Should I just call it a night? ",22Oct2018,1
26,"So for background last night my boyfriend and I went to party with 2 of my coworkers. We got drunk at the one coworkers house and walked to a party. My other coworker started to talk about how hot and cool my boyfriend is.. which was like whatever it’s not like people aren’t allowed to find my boyfriend attractive and I’m not the type of person to get upset about things like that! But things started to get weird. He gave her one of his jackets when we were leaving the party to walk to the bar and she was talking about how warm and nice it is and being kind of obsessive and strange talking about his looks and personality again. Right in front of us. Keep in mind I was drunk and my boyfriend was REALLY drunk so it was kind of weird to me and pretty much flew over my boyfriend’s head but I wasn’t worried about it and was focused on having some fun. When we got to the bar she just kept saying his name in a really flirty voice and laughing really hard at his jokes, saying he’s really amazing and I should bring him to hang out more.

Walking back to the other co-workers house from the bar at the end of the night she started saying things like “honestly he’s so much hotter than my boyfriend” and I was starting to get really uncomfortable and just didn’t say anything. I went to bed kind of feeling weird and sick.. and now today I just feel really upset. I don’t feel jealous because I know my boyfriend wouldn’t return her comments or advances but it just leaves me feeling really icky.

The non-weird coworker texted me today that weird coworker was talking about my boyfriend all day at work.

I told my boyfriend about it (he doesn’t remember most of the night) and he said it was pretty weird too but I should just ignore her unless she does it again when I bring him around.

What am I supposed to do in this situation? I thought she was my friend and I feel like I’m being completely disrespected.

My mother has been working almost her entire life ever since he brought her to America from the Philippines, and now she is the only one supporting our family. I can't help but feel awful for putting everything on her so I tried to help out with bills and payment but soon after I started to work, both my mom and my workplace has been shut down. She has been on a job hunt but nothing has been going for her. I absolutely hate seeing her like that and I can't help but feel like it's my father's fault, he has invest much of the money he got from his deployment and many of my mom's finances too. My mom always talks about how she wants me to have a better life and I cry every time she says so. My dads always been hardheaded and doesn't like to listen if it's not what he wants to do but the martial arts school isn't helping in the slightest with all the payments. The bills have piled up so much that just yesterday he told me over text that a realtor is coming to set a house price (I doubt we'll be able to get anything due to it's condition however) I just feel like everything is going down hill and with me going to college it's only going to get harder for them.

I flat out said no and said I needed to study but they insisted that I drive them and essentially drug me out of the apartment to go.

I’ve been working for 2 years at this company and after spending two weeks on holidays I realise this isn’t what my life is meant to be. 

I’m not 100% sold on it yet but I’m looking to quit my job and live off my savings upto a year to see what else is out there for me, I have no clue where to go or what to do but I feel like this a perfect time to do this.

37,"Okay so back story here. Back in April I went through a break up after a 5 year long relationship. I did the typical post break up bullshit and got on tinder. One day I was swiping and my best friends boyfriend came up (lets call my friend Sadie and we’ll call her bf fuckface). When I first saw his profile, I compared all of his pictures with his Instagram to see how old they were. All of them had been taken before they started dating about a year prior. I also was unaware of the fact that tinder hides your profile after three weeks of being inactive, meaning he had to have been on there within three weeks for him to even show up. Being new to tinder, I had no idea that was how tinder worked, and with the pictures all being old I decided that it wasn’t a big deal. I didn’t want to tell Sadie if it was honestly nothing. Fuckface had been unfaithful towards the beginning of their relationship (it’s all a bit foggy with when they actually became exclusive) and I didn’t want to create more doubt in her mind if it was unnecessary, especially since that had been no big hiccups for them in almost a year. 

A few weeks after I saw him on tinder, they moved across the country together to start fresh in a new big city. Things were going pretty good for them and I was happy to see my friend making big moves in her life. Then I found out that tinder will not show your profile unless you’re active on the app. Now I really don’t know what to do. It’s been a few weeks since I found this out, and I FaceTime Sadie almost daily. I feel incredibly guilty every time I talk to her because I want to tell her, but I don’t want to destroy her life. She has literally no one else besides him in her new city and I know if they split she would have to move back home and I would hate to see that happen for her. I’ve never felt more conflicted. I’ve thought about going to him about it but I already know I’d get some excuse like “oh I went on there to delete it” or “I didn’t mean to open the app.” So I’m at a loss. Any advice would be great.

39,F 36 so not too long ago I hooked up with this guy m 26. I could tell there was something wrong about the entire situation. He just seemed to act very shady and it sparked my curiosity. Needless to say I found photos that are of myself on a few different sites. I was unaware of the photos are being taken. What's weird about it is that I'm not so much mad about the photos because I mean everybody gets naked. I think one of the most annoyed about is the lying that he did to try to deter me from finding this out because it's pretty much a huge insult to my intelligence. The way I see it is any guy that does stuff like that is very troubled and probably will be for his whole life. When you confirm something that you already know it's kind of a relief that your instinct was right but it's also a disappointment cuz you wanted to think better of that person.

I just feel like I'm not equipped to deal with the hardships life inevitably brings. Right now I think if my dog were to die I'd probably jump off a bridge.

I'm seeing multiple counsellors, and they know I deal with suicidal feelings. I've been to a 'facility', and lived in secondary housing with support workers. I'm on medication and I see a doctor, for all the good it does. I've gone to 12-step meetings for my ED and I try to talk to people about it. I just think I'm always at least somewhat depressed, and have been for as long as I can remember (I'm in my late 20's). I can't work or go to school right now, a lot of days I can barely even answer the phone or check my email. I feel like when I get into these really dark places, that I'm taking a step towards just ending things, and I can never regain that ground once I've lost it. I just get closer and closer.

It's just so hard to imagine anything ever changing after feeling this way for so long. I don't think I'll ever have a job I enjoy, or find a partner, or become a 'real adult'. I've wasted so much time, and money, and after my last relationship failed I don't think I can ever trust someone like that again. I don't even have any real interests. Right now I'm just a leech on my family. They don't shame me for it, and try to understand, but I just feel so guilty over everything. My counsellors tell me to go easy on myself because I'm trying to get better, but I dont have any faith that that's even possible. I know I'm not trying hard enough, but I dont know how to change that. I think something inside me is broken.

46,"So, as mentioned above I am 30 years old. i FINALLY graduated college with a degree in business management. I currently work for family as a laser programmer at fabrication shop, but this is not what I want to do with my life or my degree. I have been in a management role when I worked as a senior customer service manager for GrubHub. I loved that job, but I had to leave due to issues with those above me. ( they cheated people out of pay and promised raises one too many times ). 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I am also married and live in a smallish town in Virginia. I like the field I am in, but I want to do MORE than just a programmer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had a chance to help manage the shop I work for and everyone loved how it went but it was only interim until the new guys showed up and only lasted a week or so. After that, I remembered why I was getting this degree and realized why I wanted to get BACK into management.

So my question is this. When I have such varied experience. 1 year as customer service manager, 5 years as fabrication laser programmer and purchaser, with a Bachelors in business management how do I go about finding a job? I have checked Indeed and Monster and the like and nothing really seems available. Everything needs "" 5 years experience "" in that exact field.

When we first started dating I noticed he had two instagram profiles. The first one, his main one, he let me follow, but when I requested the second profile, he blocked my request and never said a word. I asked him why he wouldnt let me see it and it was dismissed. 

Later on in the relationship, we got into an argument about secrets and I brought up the profile. He finally let me see the profile as he scrolled through it (pretty hastily). From what I could see, he had a lot of photos of his half naked ex's. Old photos or new, I didnt know but it hasn't set well. I've brushed everything under the rug to give him the benefit of the doubt after he said he would delete the profile, but I still see him on it. I dont want to be the overbearing girlfriend or the crazy one, but it makes me feel insecure that hes saved these photos, or if hes getting new ones. 

We had broken up for a month in the middle of the relationship, and he told me during this time he slept with a girl named cynthia. I see him text a girl named Cindy a lot but I dont know if they're the same person. I dont want to waste my time on a cheater but I dont want my insecurities to get in our way.

48,"My dad is in the military, meaning we move every two or so years for his work. He has orders to move this summer to WA, but told me and my mom that we can stay in MD so I can finish high school (this will be the first time I’ve been able to stay somewhere for so long, which is special to me??). I don’t have many friends, but all of them live in MD with the exception of my best friend who lives in MA. My best friend and I rarely see each other, talking mostly though the phone or text, but since MA is relatively near MD, we spend the summer together for a week or two usually. 

So staying in MD would be a no-brainer, right? Here’s where it gets a little messy. 

I’ve want to be an animator and go to college in CA. At some of the colleges I’ve been looking at in CA, they have summer pre-colleges that help you build a college portfolio and meet people with similar hobbies and interests as you. My best friend from MD attended one last year and loved it, he made a ton of friends and basically had a blast. Because of his experience, I’ve been really excited to go to one this summer. Except, a problem arose. During the time of the summer pre-college, my dad wants us to take a road trip to WA to say goodbye, as it will be the last time we see him for a year. The road trip to WA would also mean I won’t be able to spend a couple weeks with my best friend from MD this summer. 

A solution was offered from my dad. We could move to WA this summer, and I’d be able to go to the summer pre college since we’d be flying rather than road tripping to WA. 

Like I said earlier, I don’t have many close friends in MD, which is one of the reasons why I was so excited to go to the pre-college to meet people. My best friend might also be doing a summer pre-college this year, so if I play my cards right, we could go to the same one and spend practically a month together. But moving completely diminishes the chance of us visiting each other outside of summer pre-college. 

I told my best friend about the possibility of me moving this summer, and he seemed hurt that I would even consider moving and diminishing any chance of us visiting each other. 
He’s a senior in high school right now, and I’m scared that if I end up staying in MD to keep the distance between us small, that he’ll go to college and forget about me, making my main decision for staying disappear, and making me spend another year in MD without having gone to a summer pre-college. 

The gist of it is: I stay in MD for my best friend (who I might not even be friends with for much longer because of college), but we can’t hang out during the summer because I am stuck on a road trip. OR, I move to WA and have the chance of going to summer pre-colleges that will benefit me in the long run, but possibly ruin my relationship with my best friend.

Both options are crappy in their own way, and I need to decide what I want to do before December. On one hand, I really think moving and going to a summer pre-college would be beneficial for my college portfolio, as well as help me meet friends, but on the other hand I don’t want to leave my best friend behind. 

At this point I am just weighing if I think my friendships will last here in MD, or if I should just think of myself and go to WA.

I’m just, tired of this whole situation. Maybe it’s not that hard of a decision, idk. Sorry for the long and confusing word vomit lol",22Oct2018,1

55,"So, there are some important things to note here but overall this is me tryna figure out whether to apologize for possibly ruining someone's day.

OKAY. SO. I shop at a superstore near my house every weekend, usually pretty late at night. Well last weekend my Uber canceled on me and I ended up sitting outside the store for about half an hour waiting. At this point its like 10pm and ive given all the shits I had, they've run out. 

So here I am sitting on a wall, very openly listening to the fucking YMCA theme (like every 20 year old does late at night in public) and an employee walks up and sits on a bench near me.....well I didn't *know* that so....anyway. He was cool and didn't laugh at me, gave me his seat when it started to rain, cool guy.

Uber comes, I go home, don't think about it. Well this weekend I go shopping, and ALL I need is laundry detergent. So I get there around 9:30pm and I find the detergent.......same guy is stocking the shelves. So I'm like ""oh hey that's the dude from last week"" but no other thought put into it.

So long story short I can't do my fucking laundry and I don't know what detergent to get so I have to go back to the isle about 10 times. It should have been okay, but he was there the whole time and eventually greeted me with ""welcome back"" so I'm like ""well shit, now an employee thinks I'm insane"" even asked if I needed help and I just said ""I can't do my laundry"" like what? What? What was that?

So FINALLY I get the right detergent in the wrong scent (but shit, I can't go *back*) and here's where everything falls apart. I have an anxiety disorder that fucks with me in the sense that I freak out if I make the wrong decision, even if its not a significant decision.

So I leave the store and panic sets in, I go to the bench from last weekend and lay down and hysterically cry for about 5 minutes, then sit up and repeat ""I can't do my fucking laundry, I can't do my FUCKING LAUNDRY"" ya know...like a psycho...and listen, it doesn't matter. Who's judging me? But right in that moment I get a call from my ride (who's like RIGHT THERE) at the same moment the employee walks around the corner (because its his fucking bench, like no shit, Alyson) and I'm on the phone crying as I get up and walk past him then FALL and start hyperventilating. I literally SCREAMED ""I CANT DO MY FUCKING LAUNDRY!"" before running away to the car.

.....


Now if you're still with me, you're probably wondering why any of this matters right? Its just a place I shop once a week. Yeah. I thought that too until my application from a few weeks prior was accepted.

So here are my options so far:

a) Apologize to that poor stranger for panicking in his isle and move tf on/be a normal associate

b) Decline the job offer. Find a new store. Never forget what you've done.

c) Take the job, avoid the coworker, learn how to choose detergent correctly.

The obvious choice is to just explain that I've got some screws loose and move on, but that shit not only involves me creepyily waiting at the bench at 10pm, but also apologizing for something that I'm not sure was like.....a bad thing?

This is where I need your help, any and all advice appreciated. Feel free to suggest something entirely not on the list, and ask as many questions as necessary.

57,"I'll just say that I have a 3 year old and another on the way, but my and my fiance have a very toxic relationship that has gotten out of hand, emotionally and physically, (not to the point of multiple bruises, black eyes, etc.. but not just pushing either) 

We are supposed to be moving in to a new house next month, but I feel like my anger issues and her unwillingness to be wrong about anything, has taken its toll and I just dont want to have anything to do with her anymore

I have thought about still keeping contact with my children and also sending her money to take care of the kids financially, but emotionally we cant handle being around each other and I dont want my kids to suffer because of this

I have also thought about just taking my things and starting completely over in a new state somehow, and just live from in my car until I can find a stable job and living condition.

Am I wrong for thinking this way? Am I wrong for wanting to abandon my family so to speak? I am not happy and she also isnt happy and hasnt been in a long time",22Oct2018,1

59,"I feel like I’m drowning. My boyfriend of 6 years, with who I have a 1 year old daughter with, left me. Although his leaving does hurt me, that’s not the reason I’m writing this. It’s the situation he’s left me in. Let me start from the beginning. We moved in together about 2 years ago and everything was great. He convinced me to get a car because I had found a job where I have to commute an hour away.  He was also working and we were going half and half on bills. We had our baby and it was all good. Well a month ago I found out he had been cheating on me for a couple months now. I confronted him about it and he said he didn’t love me anymore and that he didn’t want to be with me. So he left. He packed his stuff and just left. Now I’m on my own and drowning in bills. I am behind a months rent because he took that money when he left and i don’t have enough to cover it. I spend about 300 a month on gas. Plus my daughters diapers and formula (I dried up to quick and wasn’t able to breastfeed as long as I wanted to). I also have utilities and the car bill. I ended up going to the bank to try to take out a loan so I could catch up on rent and get some other bills payed off. I couldn’t get a loan because my credit was horrible. Turns out I have 10,000 in credit card debt!! I had one credit card under my name that I got a year ago and he had it in his safe. We had agreed not to use it except for emergencies. He had been using it all along. I’m so scared to lose my apartment. I have no where to go and no one to turn to. I’ve been applying to jobs closer to home to diminish the spending on gas but I haven’t heard anything back yet. I at some point considered selling my body to catch up on bills and pay off that debt but I don’t want to go down that route. Sorry if I’m rambling I’m at my wits end. I don’t know what to do and I’m freaking out trying to figure out what to do. That’s why I need advise. Or just someone tell me it’s going to be ok and that me and my daughter will be fine.

62,"Made an account just for this post because it’s something I’m embarrassed about and am desperate for someone to talk about it with. I’m a junior in highschool, tall and skinny, alright looking. I don’t like telling people this because I hate sounding arrogant but I’m a smart kid, I go to a good local catholic school and I’m at the very top of my 200+ class. My story starts about mid June. I had just gotten out of school and one of my best friends was going to throw a party which I wasn’t too happy about. I’ve dealt with social troubles all my life. I can’t say I really had true friends until 6th grade, and an inability to really connect with girls has always limited me. I really didn’t want to go but I did anyway, At that point I would’ve rather gone than be looked down upon for being a pussy for not going. I ended up meeting a girl. We sat around a campfire with my best friend and his girlfriend and just talked for hours and at the end of the night I got her number. Going to bed that night I felt such a sense of peace. As time passed we kept talking, kept getting to no eachother, we both cared about eachother. We hung out a few times, and we always just did fun things, nothing romantic or sexual other then me complimenting her and saying she looked nice and shit. We had known eachother for about two months when she asked me if I wanted to get with her. For context, she met me about two months after she got done with a long term boyfriend which ended really badly. She also has a terrible father, and has obvious trust issues around guys. I told her that this was absolutely something I wanted, and I had her over to my place, and things went okay. It wasn’t my first kiss but it was my first time kissing a girl I was really close with, so I was nervous. Clammy palms, etc. I was spooked when she didn’t really text me at all the next day, but she ended up telling me that she really freaked out. I ended up learning more and more about her dad and boyfriend and how they had abused her and how she was really distrustful of boys. Fast forward a week and she’s sending me really horny texts about all the things she wants to be done to her. Unfortunately, I don’t get to see her for the rest of the summer since she started with a new job. My best friend, who I had already mentioned, threw a big party to end the summer, but I was away with my sister for her move in day to college. She gets drunk there, and tells me this weird story about one of my friends took her phone, signed himself in, and added himself on her Snapchat. At the time I didn’t think anything of it since she sounded pretty weirded out by it all. Also, as summer ends, we have a couple of disputes, but I always felt like those were resolved pretty quickly.. Then school starts. For the first month things were cool, but for the last couple of weeks I feel like too many of our conversations are super dry and feel like me forcing information out of her. She never thinks to make plans with me anymore. Now I haven’t seen her in over two months, and just last night I tell her this story about how me and that kid who added her pulled this prank in our math class on our old teacher. In response she texts me back, “oh him I love him we text a lot”. This throws me in an absolute tailspin. “I responsd back with “okay then” since it’s so out of the blue and I don’t get a response from her after. Haven’t talked to her since.

Keep in mind this kid is someone I’m really close with. We’ve had talks before about promising to never get with each other’s friends and how that’s super toxic. Right now I’m incredibly down about this, and I can’t really talk about my friends about this without it getting around.

He had a job where he was getting out of the house and seemed to becoming a functional adult but he had some sort of a relapse and quit. Since he quit his job it has been several months and from what i've heard now he just stays at home ( has always lived with his mother ) and seems to be avoiding friends. His mom has her own house but spends most of her time now at my Dad's so he practically has the house to himself. His mom i'm sure does a lot to take care of him yet though.

66,"This is super long so sorry

I would like advice on an old friend. So I’m going to start at the beginning. I (22f) met this friend (24f)  when we were in middle school. Instantly hit it off and she became my person. The one that was there through my first heartache as I was there for her. There for each other through family problems and life problems for birthdays for parties... we grew up with each other. Learning about life with each other. 
Until we graduated high school 

Freshman year in college, she was there. We both went to different schools. About 3 hours away from each other, still kept in contact. She ended up dropping out then decided to move to where I was going to school and get a job, all that good stuff. Let’s fast forward to the end of that year. 

She meets POS guy. We fall off. She doesn’t want to hang anymore doesn’t want to be included in any of our friends’ festivities, notice her change. Not in a good way either. 

Sophomore year we don’t talk as often and she’s still with POS. She comes over to me and my now (fiancés) apartment and tells us she had been strung out on drugs (hard ones I’d rather not say) for over 48 hours. Starts crying and asks for us to help. It’s this POS guy bringing all his druggie friends around her and her not having the strength to just say no. They start doing hardcore stuff together... I try to stay in contact with her and help her but she doesn’t want my help anymore and is straying away because I am always telling her to just LEAVE him and come stay with me (because she has problems being on her own). But no. She completely ignores me for months. 

Fast forward a year. Beens months since I’ve even heard from her. Me and boyfriend are celebrating one year anniversary. Drive 4 hours to some waterfalls to go camping and hiking. I get a call that she is at my parents house full of blood because she cut herself so bad to get POS attention. He just left her. So she drove to my parents house. My mother brings her all the way to where we were and she spends the weekend (OUR ANNIVERSARY WEEKEND) with us because I AM A GOOD FRIEND. And I care about her wellbeing. 

He hit her. Treated her like shit. Made her feel worthless. My response to her was “leave him” I will be here. I would’ve helped her. She was my best friend. After that weekend, she stayed back at her moms for a week or two and was back to him. 

2 years go by and I haven’t heard from her. I know she’s okay bc she will get on social media but blocks me for NO REASON. 

This happens late June. My friends and I were getting ready to throw another friend a surprise birthday party. They see her at a gas station looking really rough and seems as though she is coming off of something (which didn’t surprise me). They talked and she told them how he put a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her. So she made her parents go get her. She wanted to leave him. She needed to before she got hurt. So we invite her to the party. Doesn’t show up


Next day she calls ME. After 2 years of complete silence she calls me. Crying. Apologizing for hurting me and treating me the way she did. But said it was all him. And I believed her. Weeks go by and she’s coming back to my house, clearly going through shit and I stuck up for her. Took care of her. Helped her. Stayed up countless nights just to listen to her talk about this guy and make up excuses for him. To justify the way he is. All I kept telling her was that she needed to stay here and to not go back. That in time you will heal and someone else will come along and take care of you the way you deserve. 

Weeks go by and we stay in contact. She’s living at her parents. She’s still calling sometimes to tell me she had a bad day. Thought about going back to him. I always talked her out of it. Then one day we go to a haunted house to tour for my birthday (bc I’m into that kinda shit) and she asks me to play some music from her phone while she was driving. I see texts from POS. They are talking about seeing each other. I don’t say anything. I wait for her to tell me why she’s lying to me. 

We get home and she leaves then calls me. Tells me she’s sorry. That she just needed to know why he broke her. 

What I tell her you guys may not like. But in the middle of me trying to help her, she stole medicine from me then decided to give it back,  spent money on her bc she was broke. I did it all. I FUCKING TRIED MY BEST TO HELP HER. 
So I told her that it’s either me or him. She can choose to poison the rest of her life with him or choose to get over him in 2 months and move THE FUCK on with her life. 

We go weeks without talking. She calls me one day and we talk. She went back. Got beat on. Left again. Few more weeks and She’s doing good. Staying away from him. Being happy again. 

I text her a few weeks later to check up on her and she blocked me. She blocked me from social media. Her and a really shitty friend (from my past) decide to prank call a few of us. Treat me like shit. And I NEVER did anything to her. At all. Like we are 22 &amp; 24 years old. I want to be adults and find out why I got shit on so badly. Me AND all my family. We all did everything we could and she completely DISRESPECTED us. 

How do I let bygones be bygones? I want this anger to go away. I hate feeling so angry. I want to stop the hurt from losing my best friend over and over again. And just accept the fact that she’s been gone. ",22Oct2018,1

I feel like I should leave. I don't think I'll make it this semester, and it'll only get worse from here. I have nowhere to go but back home and I have no money to move somewhere else, so I'm back at square one if I do leave.

70,I am a 22Yo female. I miss my ex a lot and he was incredibly hard to handle. He had 3 suicide attempts while we were together and each one fell onto me. I stayed the night on hospital floors every time he was admitted. I held his wrists and stopped the blood until the ambulance came. I gave and gave until I was empty myself. He started to dangle suicide over my head if I ever hinted towards leaving. Then one night I had enough of the worrying and the nightmares and the flashbacks and the knife hiding and the complete social isolation. I decided to leave because he started to use his self harm against me. He was controlling me with his threats and also incredibly jealous. That night he sent me texts explaining how awful I was and then he cut all over and I of course came to the rescue. This time I left the hospital and cried the whole way home because I was leaving but it became too much. I have nightmares still and horrible flashbacks and I can’t drive by where the attempt happened. I worry all the time and I don’t feel stable myself.

71,"For the past 2 months I’ve gotten into weightlifting, and I have a cheap gym setup in my basement. I just decided one day that I wanted to look good physically and that I needed more confidence in myself, so my stepdad who works at a school was able to get some extra weights from his school to give to me. 

He and my mom suggested a few weeks ago that I should join wrestling, and at the time I kinda just blew it off as “I could never be as physically fit and defermined to do that in high school,” but just a few nights ago I realized that it would probably be really benefitial to me. My social anxiety has been getting gradually worse and worse over the past few years, and I am currently starting therapy for it. Socially I want to push myself to make new friends and have new childhood experiences, because right now, I feel like I’m not enjoying my childhood to the fullest. I mentioned this to my friends and a few of them jumped to the conclusion that “I wouldn’t be able to do it” because I just don’t like physical contact, which I agree with but I don’t think that alone is a reason not to do it. The worst that can happen is I don’t like wrestling and I drop it. And I’m kind of conflicted here, because these are the same friends I avoid hangouts with because every time we hang out it’s the same experience. I go over to my friend’s house with a couple of my other friends there as well and we just sit in his basement and watch funny youtube videos and while our sense of humors are similar, I just hate knowing exactly what to expect. 

Also, I don’t know if joining wrestling this year will be too much pressure on me socially because I know like 2 other kids that are in wrestling that I talk to every once in a while but most of the time I just don’t know what to say to friends I’m not super close with. I mean I want new experiences but learning to talk to new people is a skill I might not develop in time to join wrestling this year. It is certainly a goal I want to achieve by next year though. 

The main reason I want to try it out is so I can gain more knowlege in fitness and stick to a workout routine that is most efficient to my body. Is it worth waiting a full year until my junior year to start? Because by then I will have a jump start on my strength, and learning may come a little easier. I also feel really afraid to start it because I might be too awkward to make new friends. Will I have a disadvantage for only doing wrestling for 2-3 years? Will it be too difficult to learn?

75,"About 2 months ago met a girl and we started hanging out, she's married and I knew that fairly early on. 

At first it was just a crush, I thought nothing would come of it, but she reciprocated and wanted to see me more, it started only mildly physical, then escalated more and more...think like a physical progression you'd think in High school dating... there was a lot of justification on her part like ""well..\*this\* isn't too bad..."" but then eventually it was just fully cheating by any definition. 

At some point she started feeling guilty, but instead of it stopping completely, she's essentially just been reversing the physical progress to tone it down a bit, so she doesn't want to have sex anymore but still wants to snuggle and do some things. She's said essentially she's trying to wean herself off me.   


I always knew she might eventually just break it off totally, and that would suck...but this like...de-escalation of affection is incredibly painful to me. I've really grown to fall in love with her, and I know she feels very deeply for me, but is consumed by guilt over cheating and still likes her husband too.   


She doesn't want to completely break it off, but it feels like she's trying to push me into not quite a friend zone, but a 'mildly sexual and physically comforting providing me me with the cuddling and affection my husband refuses to give me' zone.  


Like I said, this is very painful to me, to be pushed away at arbitrary points I don't get to decide or even be aware of ahead of time, I really like this girl and she still talks about wanting a life together and needing me but then just halts things.   


I'd understand her stopping cold, and I'd understand her continuing. But I have no idea what to do with this situation where we're continuing to cheat, but with a restricted set of things.   


Part of me wants to tell her she's got to just choose because it breaks my heart whenever she changes her mind and tells me we need to stop only to come over the next day, or when we start something physical only to stop halfway.   


Another part of me thinks this is much more emotionally taxing to her and I've got no right to complain or give her any sort of ultimatum.   


I don't know what to do, It just feels to me like we're breaking up and getting back together like every 2 days, like when she's here i'm fine, but a couple times I basically just started crying as soon as she left because I can't handle it.  


I love her and don't want to totally end it, but this sort of situation is beyond anything I've been involved with and my heart can't take it. 

If it matters they've been married like 2-3 years, she's 29 and i'm 35, her husband is like 26 and doesn't seem to be aware of it and is apparently not an affectionate person and not interested much in sex, they fight a lot but he's not abusive or anything bad.

Hope you are all well, thanks for taking the time to weigh in and read.

 I was at a party at a friends place, wasn't too big, a mellow and mature gathering. Another friend of ours invited a girl over who he had been apparently hooking up with. None of us had heard of her or met her before, so it was a casual and recent thing. She shows up and is already pretty drunk and starts to cause a bit of commotion. People were playing board games and she wanted to party and she was basically being loud, obnoxious and disrepectful to the vibes in the room. She eventually settled down but was still a drunk mess, she was stumbling and falling over on the floor and being a goofy drunk girl. She eventually managed to settle down on the couch and my buddy who invited her over poured a large glass of wine and hands it over to her. Seemed odd to me since she was already wasted, he didn't take a sip or anything and it was a a heaping glass. He was really drunk and I was to the side watching this all go down while having a pleasant conversation with someone I met. 

Moments later my buddy who is a big tough athletic dude and the girl head off to a bedroom (my others friends room) and close the door. I forget about them and then later learn they both left. Soon after the party wraps up and we leave and we find my buddy outside sitting on the curb alone. He's none too pleased and tells us that the girl literally ran away from the party. 

I'm sober at this point and he is way drunk but basically he says that they fooled around a bit and then decided to go back to his apartment but the moment they got to the front door of the house she ran away from him and he couldn't keep up and she ran back to her place without him. 

I told him rejection sucks and we went our separate ways, he got a cab home and I chose to take the bus, but I'm starting to wonder, is this suspect? Why would she run away like that? 

I've no idea who the girl is or what her name is, I hope she's okay but I dunno. What do you all think? What should I do? My buddy seems to act as if all is normal but we've not seen this girl since and the whole situation just leaves a bad taste in my mouth",22Oct2018,1

The next day my superior (the new guy) came in and began talking about how he “watched me glide to my car” and how I looked “like a super model”. He talked about this daily for weeks. I think he eventually got the hint that I didn’t care what he thought. He mentions it every once and a while, but not nearly as often.

Incident 2 - I usually brush my hair at my desk as soon as I get to work, to me it’s completely innocent. I drive with my windows down, my hair gets messy, and I brush it - end of story. One day I didn’t brush my hair and he came to my desk asking me why I didn’t then proceeded to tell me that I needed to otherwise it would “ruin his day “. This man was at at my desk for like 15 minutes telling me that I needed to brush my hair and I needed to get up and do it now. I told him I really didn’t care if I ruined his day and that I wasn’t going to do what he want me to do as it wasn’t in my job description. 

Incident 3 - ongoing- he constantly asked me “will you miss me” are you going to miss me” when he goes to leave the office. I kept telling him NO and it was extremely obvious that I was uncomfortable, but he persisted. This went on and on for a couples months. Finally, I had enough because he only did it when no one else was in the office so I told him he needed to quit. I said it bothers me and makes me uncomfortable. He laughed and said the reason he did it is because it amuses him. He said seeing the way I responded to the question was funny. So seeing me visibly uncomfortable is amusing? That’s creepy as hell.

Incident 4 - I was in a hurry and wore a dress to work (it covered me and I wore a jacket to ensure that) he said “ohh, look at you in that dress”  and “I wish we could take pictures” I don’t wear dresses to work anymore. 

Incident 5 - ongoing - he just stands at my desk and after a few minutes he will tell a random story, but prior to his story he is just staring at me.  

Most recent incident -we had our usual weekly meeting with everyone at the company. I work in Construction so it’s mostly men. I wasn’t in the room yet, but I heard him say “Angel (me) can sit next to me so I can protect her. I said (loudly) “I don’t need protection”  as I was walking into the room he repeated himself “Angel you’ll sit here so I can protect you” I responded, annoyed “AGAIN, don’t need protection” you could tell it made everyone uncomfortable.  At some point during the meeting I felt something brush my arm. I thought maybe I rubbed it against the chair or something but later a colleague to;e me that he saw the other guy reach over and touch me. My colleague was pretty pissed about it. 

This isn’t everything, just the main incidents that got to me. 


I take great care and making sure that I am dressed appropriately. I wear a shirt that covers my chest with a jacket (always a jacket), jeans that aren’t too tight, and I make sure not to wear make up.  I don’t style or change anything about my hair because I don’t want to give him any reason to comment. I’m cautious. I don’t giggle or smile at men, I am careful at all times. I make sure not to look at them or make eye contact.  I have dealt with men making comments since before I was a teenager, it’s fucked up but it’s life. I make sure to conduct myself appropriately. I never act interested or give them the impression that they have a chance. FFS I am married.

This guy makes me so uncomfortable because I can feel the intent behind his words.

I feel like I ruin everything for a lot of people. I feel like everyone views me as this ditzy, self conscious person who flaunts off their emotional hurt as a way to garner pity. Whenever anyone helps me with anything, be it as simple as repeating what they've said before, I feel as though that means they view me as unintelligent. 

Today I was folding clothes. My dad suggested I move the laundry inside to a second basket to separate my laundry from his own. Felt like a total dumbass, ended up flipping my shit. Wasn't mad at him, even though it cane across as that, I was furious with myself for being so fucking stupid.

88,So yesterday my 17 year old stepsister had her Halloween costume on and she was showing it to my stepmom and asking if it looked good. It was some stupid “Sexy Cop” outfit with a super low V neck and short shorts. I started laughing at her and called her a slut because she looked like a hoe. Well that pissed off my bitch of a stepmom and we started yelling at each other. Her whole point is that I don’t treat women with respect. (They’re both retard liberals while I’m a conservative. This is something we argue about a lot.) I ended up calling them both cum sluts because they’re literally dirty whores. This caused my stepmom to man handle me and drop my pants and underwear and start spanking me in front of my sister. The whole time she was yelling that she was “beating the misogynist out of me”. While she was doing that my sister was making fun of me and calling my dick small even tho it’s not small at all. I’ve never been spanked before because my real mom isn’t a bitch. My stepmom basically assaulted me physically and sexually but exposing my butt and my penis to not only her but my sister as well. Should I call the cops and report that they sexually assaulted me?

89,"Except of course hangout with my friend group, that's always a blast and I love hanging out with them.

Aside from that, I literally don't want to do anything. I had a date today with a girl and she's HOT but I just really did not feel like going so I cancelled. I had a few errands that were really quick, probably 15 minutes total that I should've done but I didn't do them because I felt lazy. The only thing I do is school, work, and play my guitar. I hit the gym 3-4 times per week, but I almost always miss 1-2 days of the gym per week. I used to go 5 times a day no problem.

I just literally don't want to do anything with my time. I don't have depression. I think I'm just incredibly lazy and unmotivated right now because of negative events that inevitably happen in life, such as hating my school program, my PT job, etc.

It just sucks. I want to WANT to do things. I want to wake up and hit the gym instead of needing 8 hours of mental preparation. I want to WANT to go on dates with all these girls whom I set up dates with, but never want to go the day of because 1. I feel too lazy and 2. I don't want to deal with them being potentially awkward (Tinder)

I just am getting to the point where I'm unsure what to do with myself. I don't even want to hangout with anybody unless it's my main group.

It just sucks, to wake up at 8AM or even 12PM and have the entire day ahead of you, but having zero motivation to do ANYTHING at all. Not sure how to change to be honest. I was thinking of moving out of my parents place and having my own place. I feel like just living here destroys my motivation.",22Oct2018,1
90,"I am a social work graduate student who recently started a placement at a hospital. The unit I am on primarily deals with eating disorder patients. The internship is unpaid as I get school credit for it. This placement is very competitive and they only take two interns total out of many applicants. It is my second and final year in my program and I chose this unit, interviewed, and they accepted me. The placement is a total of 8 months.

Basically, after my first 5 weeks, my internship contacted my school stating numerous problems with my professional behavior and performance. This came as a shock to me because I wasn't getting any feedback at my internship. I got a sit down conversation one time after my first 2 weeks related to my body language showing that I was disinterested. Although I did not really understand this feedback, I did my best to correct it and my supervisor said I was successful at doing so. Other than that, I haven't had any discussions about my performance. I did not think I was performing exceptionally well, but I was trying my best every day and performing average. I feel like my internship tried to fire me, but my school convinced them not to.

After my school was contacted, my field placement liaison came to my internship and we had a meeting with my supervisor. My supervisor began the meeting by saying that she knows I'm dedicated and hard working and that I want to do well, but it is not translating in my performance. She acknowledged that I listen and write things down, but it does not seem to leave me notebook and get applied to my work. They had a whole list of instances where I underperformed or made mistakes within the past 5 weeks and the length of the list was shocking. I knew I wasn't doing a great job, but I was completely unaware of how terrible I was doing. My supervisor stated numerous times that they have very high expectations but this experience is really weighing on me and it honestly feels like no matter what I do, it is not good enough. My school ultimately said they need to lower their expectations and create a learning environment and that I need to ask questions more and make changes to apply what I learn accurately. I've been trying to do this since the meeting and I have not gotten poor feedback, but I can tell my supervisors and other staff at my internship are still displeased with me and I leave there every day feeling defeated and terrible about myself.

94,"I'm 21yo female and my mom is 53. We are are very enmeshed. She even lived with me in my dorm room (a single) all of last year and all this year so far. We share a twin bed and and she eats from the dining halls and used the showers. I  do my best to keep her hidden (sneaking her up food from the dining halls, making sure no one is in the bathroom, etc.). It is real life arrested development!

The reasons are complicated. For one, she is basically homeless and doesn't have a job at the moment. We were living with her friend for a while, but she finally kicked us out after 2 years of living there rent free. On the other hand, my mom believes she is living in my dorm because she is helping me with my depression and ADHD. She sees this as a great act of self-sacrifice on her part.

There are legit no boundaries with us. For instance, when I was first going through puberty (about 13 years old), she asked me to undress for her so she could see how I was developing ""down there"" (not in a sexual way). I got embarrassed and said ""no"" and she freaked out. She forced me to lay down on the bed and screamed at me and continued to undress me. She then straight-up washed me in the shower while I cried. She kept screaming at me for ""lying"" and ""hiding"" things about my physical development from her (this wasn't sexual, she was just super angry).

We are enmeshed in other ways too. I'm not trying to complain. I know that if I want things to be different I have to do something different. I admit I have been very complicit in all of this. Anyway, we shared a bed throughout much of high school (due to messiness of house/hoarding). We share all our clothes, money, passwords. We even share a phone right now (for financial reasons). She regularly checks my email and bank accounts. She tells me all about her marriage woes and about how my dad won't have sex with her anymore. She forced me to be present at every fight she had with my father. She said it was because she needed a witness (even though she was the more physically violent one). Throwing dished and hairdryers, bashing heads into bathtubs, kitchen knives, hair pulling, biting, drawing blood, punching holes in walls, etc. etc. And when my dad wasn't there she'd rage at me. Afterwards, she would wail like some kind of wild animal and order me to insult my dad in all sorts of ways. She threatened to kill us, to strangle us, and even to kill herself. All sorts of things. She had me call people like my grandparents and aunts and uncles and ""testify"" against him (aka lie about things he has done to us). She has said that I'm the only person in her life that cares about her, which sadly may be true.

Sorry I know it sounds like I'm just complaining. But I'm more just getting it off my chest. I'm an adult now and I have CHOSEN to live like this. I don't mean to complain. Just share.

BTW, she is very supportive and loving toward me much of the time. I mostly feel sorry for her. Also, sometimes like I have no right to confront her on some of this because last year I was very depressed and I almost had a psychotic episode (was diagnosed bipolar I/schizoaffective actually) and actually DID need support because I was falling apart.

I know you all can't really give me advice. I'm just so tired of having to keep all of this a secret. It is really a very embarrassing situation. I just needed to let it out today, I don't know why. ",22Oct2018,1

96,"One thing that has never changed, no matter how old I get or where I live, is my never-ending tendency to put myself in other people’s shoes and think very deeply about *everything*. I’m very sensitive and I hold pride in the fact that my heart is big and soft. It has made me a better, more caring person in the long-run. 

Although, this has always made me second guess my actions, views, and how I affect other people. It turns toxic when i begin to think excessively about how other people view things, whether it be a person or event that has nothing to do with me; all the way to how they may perceive my own personal quirks and short-comings. Constantly looking for another perspective has many times made me lose my own sense of self, viewpoint, confidence etc. This has led me down a path of life-long insecurity, self-doubt, and constant anxiety that I can’t shake. 

I love understanding other people and feeling things intensely, but I’m tired of caring so much about how other’s think or feel that i’m paralyzed by second-guessing myself; i.e. how I do things and how I feel.

101,"So my recent girlfriend (We've been together about 1 month now) has invited me over to her parents house a few times. I'm a solid guy and good to my girlfriend. She, however, is a very sexual person and initiates most of the intimicy - IN FRONT of her parents (just ""cuddles"" and laying next to each other). So naturally I kinda feel like ""Well....I'd love to be next to you alone but it might give the wrong impression to your parents about me don't you think?""

The last time I was at her parents house felt a little odd. Her dad walked in on us cuddling. Later, we got up to eat. I said ""Hey! How's it going?"" to her dad and he kind of smirked and said ""Hey I'm Okay..."" 

Another instance that night- I was playing guitar and her dad happened to know music theory, so I played an interval and asked him (just in a curious and friendly way) if he knew what it was and he said with a defensive tone ""Of course I know what that is, it's a Major 6th"". My girlfriend and I we're laying next to each other (it was her idea) and her dad said to me ""I'm probably gonna get to bed soon, you probably gotta head out soon right?"". I was like ""Uh, yeah...I am probably.....haha...""

Her mom said the same thing to me the first time ""(my name) probably needs to get going soon, doesn't he?"" The funny thing is I've been nothing but friendly and conversational with them. 

\*TLDR - So yeah. My girlfriend loves me a lot and I love her a lot, but her need for intimacy, even around her parents, has made things a little awkward between me and her parents. Thus, I could use some advice to settle the storm. Thanks!\*

TLDR; Had sex with random guy at school function and now I think I might be pregnant (Read last paragraph for symptoms)

Backstory: I went to a school function a week with my friends (we’re in university) and we all got drunk. While I was in the crowd holding my friend’s hand (so we wouldn’t get lost) I bumped into this guy and grabbed his hand. He went along with it and we eventually separated from my friends. 

He basically took care of me while I was almost black out drunk. He took me back to his dorm and we were just hanging out. Before anyone asks, this was all consentual sex (I was starting to sober up a bit) but we were both still drunk but I was a little more gone.

 Long story short, we had sex with no condom and he came inside me. It’s been a week and I’ve been feeling very tired to where I need to nap, my breasts have started feeling tingly, I’ve been having more discharge and today my back and abdomen area have been aching all day.

It didn't mention anything at all about the delivery fee, service fee, and 20% gratuity. My salad ended up becoming $50. I didn't look at the receipt when they delivered because they had passed me the tray first and I rushed into giving a 20% tip on top of that. I realized when I set everything down what I had done.

Hi there. I’m absolutely sure that anybody who gives advice on this subreddit has heard of this before. I’m a 15M and I’ve always been that weird, shy kid. I’m in a massive friend group, but I’m usually the one who’ll listen to conversations, and very rarely give my own input if asked. I tend to avoid hanging out with them, not because I don’t like them, but since I like being alone for the most part.

So, high school rolls around and I try to step outside my comfort zone by talking to some new people. One person stuck out in particular to me, who I’ll call A for the sake of privacy.  A was sweet, but also shared my shy and weird personality. As the first year of high school went on, I got more and more used to her being around, and even introduced her to my friends group who she got along with. 

I think it was around half way through the year when I realized that I started to see her differently. I never met someone that shared my odd personality and seen me as who I was, and never judged me. I mentioned before, I am shy and I don’t say that just to throw it around. I have to contemplate asking simple questions for long periods of time, to the point of giving up asking entirely, I struggle making eye contact, and I have trouble speaking and holding conversations. I’m more confident around A than others by a bit, but I trade out that shyness for being awkward.

I finally tell another friend I can trust around the start of this year, which is my second year of high school, and he doesn’t seem too surprised. Ever since then, he’s made subtle hints that I should tell her when us three hang out. I get pretty flustered and sometimes just stay quiet and ignore it. Since September, we started talking a lot more, and started to talk outside of school and even hang out outside of school for the first time. The friend has even stated that A’s developed a bit of a crush, which I’m a bit skeptical on. It might be true, but it sounds too good to be true.

I don’t know if I should really go for it, since we are really good friends I don’t want to shatter it. I can’t really imagine not having A around, as she really lightens up my day and helps combat the anxiety and depression I have going on. My friend says I’ve waited long enough, and I might want to act soon before I loose her. I trust him, but I don’t know whether I should take his word. Is it worth risking it?


TL;DR
Socially awkward and shy 15M has crush on a very sweet girl. Began to hang out more and more, until she supposedly got a crush on me too. Friend is convinced she likes me, and tells me I have a shot. Should I risk the friendship?",22Oct2018,1

122,"I’m 17, she’s 17. Started out as a cool summer thing but I never thought it would turn into more. I said fuck it why not give it a try during the school year but I was just kinda testing it. Now I’ve realized I’m not happy in our relationship and I want it to end. However, one time I tried to end it and she came to school with cuts on herself the next day. She has no other friends and a lot of family issues. I’m really all she has right now. And breaking up with her would mean she’d have nobody and she’ll start to be pretty suicidal. I don’t want that at all because I still care for her but I don’t want to be with her anymore.

In all honesty I’m not ready to handle her right now. I’m still totally a kid, I play wizard101, eat cookies for breakfast, and make 69 jokes. But the things I have to be there for her I’m just not able to do. I’m just so lost right now and it seems any decision I’ll make would hurt.",22Oct2018,1
123,"Back in the days of dial-up, my brother and I shared an AOL account. We were assigned a password and committed it to memory. 

Time went on, we grew up, and we drifted apart. I haven't spoken to him in over 15 years. I wouldn't say we were close, but we didn't have any bad blood. 

Tonight I was going through password dumps to see if any of my previously used passwords have been compromised and I found that old AOL password. To my surprise, he is still using it today. I got the feeling that he's using the same password on every site he logs into. 

Would it be weird for me to email him out of the blue just to tell him he needs to change his password for this specific site and possibly all others? ",22Oct2018,1
124,"Ok so this is actually really tragic and kind of all my fault. I matched with a (m/20) on tinder and we hit it off pretty well, ending the night with a makeout session and an agreement that we’d kind of just stay friends. Time passes and I realize that I have depressive and suicidal tendencies, and because I’m a stupid 19 year old college freshman, I unload all this heavy shit on my fwb... we get closer and the possibility of us actually dating comes to a point when we both got trashed at a party and wound up having bad cross-faded car sex... after this moment I start to see red flags in his behavior that remind me of how controlling and manipulative my ex boyfriend was, so I call things off at the end of freshman year very suddenly, telling him I need time to think and work on myself. He’s understandably upset and gets fired up, but I tell him that none of it is his fault and that I simply don’t want to hurt him or drag him into a half-assed relationship...

Summer comes and goes, we haven’t talked in months and I come into sophomore year free if the situation. I randomly hit him up for alcohol one day and all seems well. We acknowledge that I did some bad things but we both reacted poorly and we don’t hold it against each other. We catch up on what we’ve been up to in the hiatus from school and I feel very comfortable around him again... Boy did I have a storm coming.

I hung out with him and almost spent the night at his place a few days later, when I started feeling uncomfortable and asked to leave, apologizing for any awkwardness and telling him that I didn’t want to get tangled up in a fwb situation again because I valued our friendship. He shrugs it off (so I thought) and I leave.

Ever since then he has found every chance imaginable to blow me off, whether it was to say he was out of town or off campus or having already made a booze run, he blew me off... my depression started getting worse and I asked to open up to him again because he’d been there through all the initial mess of me realizing how out of wack my mental state was. I trusted him enough to confide in him still...

His response: “I don’t want to be your friend anymore. It’s not beneficial for my state of mind for you to walk all over me like you do”

I’ll admit I abused his kindness sometimes and I’d rant a little too much or be in a bad mental state around him too much... But I never consciously gave any indication that I wasn’t 100% there for him... now I’m afraid he hates me for a mental disease that’s destroying my life and there’s nothing I can do to fix it... I just want my friend back...",22Oct2018,1
125,"I know, I know. Nothing ever good comes from something titled ""So there's this girl..."". But I don't think that this will be one of those. I recently began attending a church and during a sermon, I glanced around the room and I see this gorgeous girl (Who I think was looking at me) looking at me. So I keep singing the songs they are singing, no big deal. Whatever. But then it happens again two minutes later. THEN I realized who it was. (We will just call her Penny.) Penny happens to be the pastor's daughter. She also happened to be in the same gym class with me in Jr. High. So I kinda know of Penny. But not enough to walk up and say ""hey"" like an old friend. So I added her on Instagram because I thought it would be weird to add her on Facebook for some reason. Today happened to be Sunday so I went to church and it happened again. She always sits in the same spot and I try to sit where I first sat. Shes the kind of beautiful that would make an angel jealous. But anyways I'm thinking about trying to text Penny but I don't know what to say or how to start it. I missed my opportunity to say hi in person today, and I'm really kicking myself for it but I don't know what to do. Sorry this was a long one. 

Synopsis: I used to know a girl and now we have something in common and I want to get to know her and even start a relationship, but I don't know how to engage with her.

128,"I met this girl at the start of the school year and we instantly connected. She is smart and pretty good looking but I thought nothing of it because most people I meet are like that at first. Between that time and this week weve seen eachother once a week in debate club and always seem to hit it off. Now, Im an akward dude, I dont know where to put my hands when I talk, I speak until I forget what I was saying, etc but for some reason not around her. Im calm, collected and just generally presentable. 
Cut to the middle of this week, were debating together for the first time and as she goes up and start to destroy the oppositions points one by one, I just have this moment where everything clicked and I just sat there looking at her dumbfounded by how incredible she is. I realized just how sharp, smart, beautiful, funny, and simply  great she really is. Immediatly after that I became three times worse than I usually am, which is to say really akward and reserved. Its funny to what extent I became clumsy regarding her after that moment. I tripped in my words, began to have cold hands and my heartrate was through the roof. 
Wouldnt you know it, during the past weekend there was an out of town debate where we got paired together. At this point Im dropping spaghetti out of my pockets left and right at an unprecidented level. I cannot act normal around her and start saying things that seem funny, but that (in retrospect of 5s later) were really not. Later that night we go out for drinks with the rest of the club. As time goes on people are leaving until its just the two of us and a longtime friend of mine. When she went to the bathroom my friend told me that she thought I was kindof off putting and waaaay too interrested in her (which is not wrong) and that maybe I should lay off. I did and the rest of the night went smoothly. Very light hearted and fun times. We actually closed down the bar and when my friend left to go to sleep this amazing girl and I stayed up until 4am talking about life and goals and everything in between. It was great. 
The next morning I scrounged all my confidence and asked her out. I knew what she though of me, but still gave it a shot, I was tired/excited and ready. She turned me down. She said that since were in the club together itd be weird plus she said she didnt think of me like that.
Im crushed. What do I do? Play it off cool and ask her again later after I calm down around her or do I abandon ship? I really like this girl and I would honnestly hate not being around her. Do I risk the friendship by asking her out again or do I apreciate the time together in the club.

131,"when i was in middle school i was extremely online &amp; was in a group chat with a lot of internet strangers. one dared the group to send pictures of them in bras (most were of age) and not wanting to be left out, i sent one too. I was in the 7th grade.
In 8th grade, i liked a boy and he told me he wanted me to send nudes, so i did. he showed his friends and from then on i had a reputation. I began to mistake negative attention (boys asking for nudes) for positive attention, and i gave them what they wanted. This continues for a long time. meanwhile, if i would “date” anyone i would be uncomfortable and distant.
 This continued even into high school, the cycle of negative attention and discomfort around romantic relationships and intimacy. 
Now, i’m 18. i’ve never been kissed, but i’ve sent nudes to more people than i can count on two hands. i have never had a relationship longer than 2 months. i am afraid of intimacy, and only recently have i realized it’s from past trauma. i’m worried because i go off to college soon and not understanding negative attention is going to lead to being taken advantage of.  

How do I overcome this and actually engage in a healthy relationship? 

TLDR; I have been taken advantage since middle school, and subsequently have a fear of intimacy. How do I overcome this? ",22Oct2018,1
132,"I started working at grocery store about a month  ago. It’s my first job, they trained me to use the register. It took me about 2 weeks to get used to using it. when I first started they made gave a good amount of hrs. I would work like 5 days a week, for like about 6 hrs each day. But then they realized I needed more time to get used to the register &amp; cut my days to 2 days a week. I was working 30 hrs every 2 week. My manager told me that once I got used the register I would get more hrs. I got the hang of it by now. &amp; they did give me more hrs Im working about 45 hrs every 2 weeks now  (idk if im making sense im not the greatest at explaning.). BUT the reason im working more often now is bc im basically covering for my coworkers. Today I was told I was gonna work all week &amp; then after this week go back to my normal schedule of working 2 days a week , My parents don’t think it’s a good job if im just covering for other people &amp; then  gunna have to go back to my “regular” schedule.

133,"I have no doubt that I am an intelligent individual who has potential for financial success. However, I never see myself being happy with any of these high paying careers. I'm in my second year of college and as long as I keep up my A's this next semester, I'm guaranteed into a couple of the top public universities. To be honest, I could care less. I have no motivation other than making money. I work 26 hours a week on top of school, which isn't horrible, but it adds to my struggle because it reminds me of what is in store for the future.

134,"It's a little past 1am, and I've had this thought on my mind since a couple of weeks after the fall semester started. I'm a freshman, first generation college student, and I started college in the summer semester in the university I'm currently attending. Everything was really fine during the summer; I didn't end up with a GPA I wanted, but I still loved college. Now, I'm half way through the fall semester and the thought in the back of my head that consumes me is quitting. Just throwing the towel in, maybe joining the Peace Corps, I don't know. I just can't validate college, I can't see myself completing it. I mean, I rationalize these thoughts by looking towards my siblings: one went to college and got a degree in something she doesn't even use. The other one went straight into the military after high school. And me? I'm supposed to be the change in the family, by educating myself with a college opportunity my mother never pursued. I don't want to quit; I just want a drive, a passion. But I don't have that. I'm falling short. I really don't know what to do. I want college, but quitting is so easy; no debt, getting decent sleep and not stressing about subjects I don't even understand. I feel like I'm falling into a deep depression about college; I'm crying even writing this post because I'm having a much harder time than summer and I've been thinking about quitting but I know I can't. I would be such a disappointment. I feel like I'm disappointing myself. Is there a big picture I'm missing? Is college necessary for success? I don't know what to do. Someone please help.

135,"Over the summer, I met this guy and things were fantastic for about two months. I was fairly certain he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend, but instead he freaked out on me and ended things. I was heartbroken. He’s now my best friend. Some of our mutual friends say we were meant to be the best of friends and not lovers. Unfortunately, I finely believe he’s my soul mate and that we’re meant to be together. I found out later that he possibly still had feelings for someone else, but I don’t know if that’s completely true. Anyway, I’m still head over heels for this guy. I don’t want to screw up our friendship because he means the world to me, but it’s killing me not knowing how he feels. He still flirts with me sometimes and I don’t know if it’s because he genuinely likes me or if he’s lonely. I’m just torn and I don’t know what to do. ",22Oct2018,1
136,"A bit of background, I went to community college for  a year and then took two years off. I started attending again earlier this year, and it sucks. I'm majoring in finance and transferring next year. It's not like im doing bad in school, usually gettings A's and B's, but it just feels like I'm just going through the motions and not really accomplishing anything. This is also my first semester taking 20 credits while working 3-4 days a week, so it's a tough adjustment. 

I've talked to a couple of my relatives and they all stress that I should finish school so I can get a 9-5 job getting salary if something doesn't pan out in the future. The amount of pressure on me to finish school also kind of sucks because I don't want to let them down. It mostly comes from the fact that they all went to amazing schools and are very well off, so they can't really see me doing anything else. 

I just don't know what to do at this point, school feels like a waste of time, but I also see the benefits of it. I'm not struggling, but I also don't really enjoy it. My cousin has also told me that I usually just take the easy way out, which is kind of true so dropping out right now makes me seem like a very lazy person.

138,"So last week, on of my teachers started talking about this kid in her homeroom who apparently stinks. SHe mentioned he was indian as well. She asked us on what to do as im maybe email her parents or something. After she left the class for a bit, people were shocked she would bring this up and talk about a student that way and exploit him pretty much. 

Keep in mind, in that class, i'm the only indian guy. Same night, mom recieves an email. To summarize, she tells my mom that i need to take care of my hygine, use deodrant / perfume, take showers everyday. All which I already do. And in that email, she goes beyond and lies about kids not 'hesitating' to sit next to me. Cap. Her class seating arrangement is horeshoe shaped. (U). I sit at the end of the back and so do a few kids. The left side is half empty, more than enough for all the kids on the back to sit at. 

So her not realizing her mistake yet, then emails me a few minutes later. Talkin about how i probably smell because of spices in indian food. That did it for me. Its over. This racist bitch is done.

140,"So, yesterday morning I was going through my emails and went to clear out my junk folder when I noticed something odd.

I saw an email that was apparently sent to me by my own email address with the subject ""example@email.com has been hacked."".

Against my better judgement, I opened it and the email said something along the lines of (and this is just off the top of my head, I didn't read the full email properly)

""Hello! My name is &lt;something&gt; from the dark web.
I hacked into this inbox 6 months ago and have been monitoring it and you.

I know your password is so and so (He did correctly guess my password, but it was an old password from about 6 years ago that I don't use for anything anymore).

I have also hacked into your devices webcam and been able to see what you look like (I don't have a webcam but I used to around a year or so ago).

I have access to your social media and various other accounts.

I have sensitive info I can release about you, unless you pay me $800 in bitcoin.

You have 48 hours after you open this email and I will get a notification to tell me you have read this.""

He had a link at the bottom of the email which I didn't click, obviously.

Confused, I went to the ""sent"" folder in my own email and didn't see this email I had apparently got from myself in there, googling it revealed that apparently email addresses can be spoofed to bypass spam filters.

Anyway, at the time I just deleted the email entirely because I just assumed it was a fake scare email.

To be safe, I ran a full virus scan on my PC with windows defender (I don't have another antivirus program ATM, if anyone knows any decent free ones feel free to recommend them), deleted any threats it did find (three) and changed my email password.

I tried to just go about by day after that but it lingered in the back of my mind.

It's now like quarter to 7 in the morning and I haven't been to sleep because I've been overthinking it and my anxiety has been going nuts to the point I've felt physically sick.

I don't know what to do, it seems too far fetched to actually be a real email but then I remember it did correctly mention one of my passwords, even if it was an incredibly old one.

Is there anything I can do? Is this likely to be real or am I just panicking over nothing?",22Oct2018,1
141,"&amp;#x200B;

Ok so I’m turning 21 in 3 days and I am in this embarrassing situation. I am in this academic frat that’s also pretty social and have made “friends” with a few people in it. Now I use quotation marks because we only hangout at frat events whether it’s a party or just something on campus. I also do not have any personal friends of my own as they all transferred out which led to one lonely year which led to me joining this academic frat so at least I would have people to occasionally hangout with.

Now my issue of whether or not I want to have a birthday party is due to that fact, that I don’t have any personal friends as opposed to everyone else in the frat who does. I’ve been to 3 brothers birthdays since I’ve joined and they all brought 1 or 2 of their own friends along with a few brothers they were close with. The reason I don’t want to have a birthday party is because I would be completely humiliated having everyone show up only for them all to think “omg this guy has no friends but us”. Now these are nice people and they wouldn’t not like me or anything because of that but just the fact that they would know would kill me inside. On the other hand if I don’t throw a party and just use the usual “I don’t like birthday parties” excuse that in my opinion will also look very embarrassing (since everyone celebrates their 21st) but not as embarrassing at me being in the same room as them and they openly see I have no friends.

So I really have no idea what to do in this situation. I should also add that I typically don’t like birthday parties but I kind of really would have liked to celebrate this one if I had at least one personal friend.

What should I do?",22Oct2018,1

144,"What do you think makes a person “dumb”? In my opinion when you have the knowledge but don’t apply it to the problem.. I believe that makes someone dumb, I am that someone. 

I have been walking with the devil for about 8 months now, and that devil is Meth. 

I am not your typical addict. I am 22 years old and for only being 22, I have gone through things that most people will never have to face within their life time. Growing up i had a wonderful but emotional childhood. I lived in the boondocks and i practically raised myself and raised my younger brothers. It led me to crave attention, acceptance, and love. Over the years I have become so selfless that I don’t know how to help myself, although I know what I need to do to help myself. When I was 20 years old I had gotten my first apartment, I had 2 jobs, and I was getting my life put together for myself. Within 48 hours, I had lost everything. I had gotten evicted from my apartment for allowing a homeless friend of mine live with me, and two young men came into my apartment while I was sleeping and stole my rent money, cell phone, and my 2005 impala. That was the first honest genuine heartbreak that I have ever felt. I stood in my apartment and locked the doors, and help a knife to my heart. I don’t self harm and I know taking my life would be selfish, so I ran. I got myself into drugs, it was mostly cocaine and alcohol but it was very excessive for a short period of time. I started dating this guy, we moved away, and our lives where really starting to come together. It was such an amazing feeling, and the love was very very real, until we found ourselves homeless. 

We ended up moving in with his dad, which is not a healthy person. He’s a severe addict and little did I know, he enabled my bf to smoke meth, he actually did it with his son for the first time when he was 12. WHAT THE FUCK. 

And just to clarify what type of person I am, I had such a promising life and I had so manytoday opportunities, including a free ride to college. My BF on the other hand was abandoned my his mom at 15 and his dad has been an addict his whole life, he grew up with no type of structure, he’s a hs dropout. 

The first time I had ever smoked was with my BFF and his father, I lacked self love then and went into a self destructive mode. I never imagined that I’d be where I am today. My bf and I ended up working for this amazing company though a temp agency and from August to March, I had worked as hard as I could to get hired on full time, and out off over 200 temps who where in and out, out of 2 people I got hired. I was the youngest employee and I was also the 2nd girl. I had put my heart into getting this job, and I loved it. I am a closet smoker, The only people who knew my secret where people who I had cried to. Although I am an addict I made sure to up-kept my life, and to stay genuine, honest, loyal, and keeping my integrity. I used in moderation 2-3 times a week, with 1-2 week breaks and an occasional week binge. We where finally content, and our lives where flourishing until May came, it was Sunday, and I lost it. I couldn’t handle myself, I self harmed for the first time, I had cut up my leg, but not with any intention to kill my self, but I needed to feel. Every cut had a meaning the first one being that I had ever tried this dirty drug, knowing the dangers. I was crying hysterically on my living room floor, alone. This was the first time I have ever opened up to my mom. She was oblivious, she and I don’t have the closest relationship but at that moment u needed my mom. Because, if I where left alone I may have very well killed myself, even though I didn’t want to die, meth is very powerful and controlling. My mom immediately came to be with me and we had talked and I had opened up to everything that I had been hiding, being that I put my job first, I talked my mom into not bringing me to the hospital. 4 days after I had told my mom, I had my 2nd heartbreak. My bfs dad needed a place to stay so I needed up using again, Thursday was the game changer. I had asked my coworker to bring my to the er after work on our first break and not even 10 minutes after that my he had approached me and said “we have reasonable suspicion that you are under the influence” before we had even gotten to her office, I think I caught her off guard, I had looked straight in her eyes started sobbing and said “I’m on meth”. I had told my hr everything.

Being that I was honest, and it was clear that I was ready and really did want help my job was willing to work with me. I had gone to the er and ended up not being a patient for inpatient treatment, so I started going to an outpatient treatment, it was me with an individual counselor twice a month. I loved it, I was so happy, and started to find myself again. After a month and a half passed I was ready to go back to work passed my drug test and had accomplished everything that had asked, the problem was there was no work. I after the 3rd week of waiting, I had become discouraged and went harder than I had ever used for a few weeks. Throughout this period, I was becoming so mentally deteriorated that  I’d cry to the point of being to weak to walk. I would cry to my BF and ask why he was still bringing meth into my life after I had lost everything I had worked for. I couldn’t handle life, I started isolating myself, and really losing myself to the guilt and shame that I carried in my heart. I hated that I was using and I knew that I’d have to either make him move out or do it myself. I can’t bring myself to do either, because I’ve worked so hard and created such a beautiful home. Plus, I paid the security deposit and let him sign the lease, — I have no idea what I was thinking, clearly I wasn’t. 

The time eventually came after 4 months of being off work, I got my job back! I was so happy, incredibly happy. I had worked 1 day, and failed a drug test the next. I couldn’t cry, I had to accept the fact that I had put myself in this position and I had to accept it. I had went and gotten an application before I even came home to talk to my bf, the next day I had gotten hired at another amazing company, as a quality control tech. 

I have been working here for about 2 months, and I have a high position so I haven’t been using during the week. Today, I relapsed and had to work. I couldn’t handle it, and ended up telling a co worker - an attractive co worker, whom I honestly would have never have told this secret to.. 

I can’t lose this job, I know it would equal to me losing myself. I know that I wouldn’t be able to bear the pain again. I’m just so lost, and so sad, and I feel so alone. I refuse to ask for help now, being that I feel like if I where to, I’d be looked at as a disappointment, and not taken seriously. I do not want to be like the boy who cried wolf, and reach out for help to not take it. I just know I am not strong enough to do what I need to do for myself, which is give up my apartment and move our, or contact our landlord.. I am not someone to hurt or abandon anyone. Even if it is destroying me and it’s is. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like my life is slipping though my fingers, and I have no control what so ever over my being, my body, and my thoughts. And it terrifies me, because I know this is not who I am, and I also know I have so much potential to do great things. I am so sad. I just need advice, insight, something. 
I just need something. ",22Oct2018,1
145,"   Okay, so I’m a high school student and I’m absolutely in love with the school I go to. I have a lot of friends, i’m a varsity cheerleader, i’m in band, and I love most of my teachers. Life at school has been really great so far even though I just started going to this school a couple months ago. 

  The past couple of months have been difficult though, my parents are divorced and I live with my dad and my emotionally abusive stepmom. I feel so horrible there, i’m always shit on my stepmom and yelled at for the smallest inconveniences. I never feel like I can make her happy. She often mocks me and the way I am, and if I cry she says i’m “manipulating her”. She’s always tried to break me down for years. My dad on the other hand just watches and lets it happen, i’ve never been close to him though. Anyways, i’ve just recently started to grow a really strong relationship with my mom again and we’re really close! I love her so much. She lives about an hour and half drive away from me though.. 

  She told me I can live with her if I wanted to. There isn’t a lot of reasons why I should say no, her boyfriend is loaded and they have a nice house in a good area, she owns her own business and can make time to be with me, she’s the sweetest person in the world and I feel so happy and free when I’m with her. But, I would have to switch schools.. I really don’t want to, I don’t want to leave my two best friends, I don’t want to try out for a new cheer squad or field hockey team, I don’t want to play for a different band, I don’t want to start over. I finally feel like I found a school that’s accepted me for who I am.. 
What should I do? I want to stay at the school I’m at but my mental state is completely dead because of what I go through at home.

146,"Recently I got in trouble with the police because I was biking around with friends around my town after the night curfew and my parents said they were disappointed in me. They told me I should be a leader, not a follower.  But for the past while, I've never had really good grades. Mostly B's, and an F in one Chinese class and it keeps me feeling down all the time, especially when my mom told me my grades aren't good. I've been sent to the hospital before for attempting suicide and I want to be a successful person and go to a well-rounded college so I can make them proud. I know they love me, but I always feel like a burden whenever I'm not distracted watching TV or spending hours on my computer. Am i taking everything in wrong? I'm in a marching band that recently won 1st place in a competition and my football team won a game recently that made my parents proud. I know they love me, but I feel like I'm struggling to repay some kind of unspoken deal between a caring parent and a child where I have to live to their standards.",22Oct2018,1
147,"So this girl messaged me on OfferUp stating that she wants to buy my iPod Touch 5th generation for $50 around 9 pm. She asked me for my address and if I could sell it to her for $40 since she’s coming to me and I said no, $50 firm since there’s nothing wrong with it. I gave her my address, but not my house number and my phone number in case she gets lost. (My area can be confusing at times). I asked her if she’s interested. 

Around 10 pm - she responded like 45 minutes later saying she’s interested and is driving to my house right now. I was completely surprised since it was a bit late, so I decided to look up her profile. She lives approximately 30-40 minutes from where I live and so I asked her how long it would take for her to get to me. She said 25 minutes (the other 10-15 minutes matched up from when she told me she’s on her way). My boyfriend kept telling me to be careful because the whole situation seems sketchy. He said nobody would drive 40 minutes for an iPod Touch and it’s not even that much cheaper compare to the time/effort. 

10:30 pm - she told me she’s here and that she’s lost. I felt like the whole situation is sketchy so I told my mom to go with me. I kept telling her that she should turn right at [this place; front of my apartment complex] and she told me she saw it. Here’s the thing: she kept asking me to meet her up at the front of the apartment complex (like maybe 2 minute walk from my house). I told her she could turn right and she’ll be able to see me and my parents. She kept saying she’s lost so I told her to call me or send me photos of where she’s at and I’ll guide her. She didn’t text or call me once and I waited outside for 15 minutes giving her instructions. 

Afterwards, I came back in the house and told her that if she’s still interested, we could meet up in a public place during daylight tomorrow. I don’t know if I’m being too harsh especially if she drove 40 minutes here. I feel kinda bad leaving her like that, but I honestly didn’t feel safe. I’m 4’11, 95 lbs and I’m afraid she might get mugged or killed (I know I’m being paranoid). Did I do the right thing? How should I respond to her? I don’t wanna go through with this transaction with her anymore - especially at night. 

tl;dr: around 9 pm, this girl told me she’s interested in my iPod Touch 5th generation. Responded an hour later saying she’s interested, willing to drive 40 minutes to get it and when she supposedly got there, she told me to meet her in front of the apartment complex. I thought the whole situation was sketchy and i don’t know how to respond to her now.

149,"(I’m a 20 year old girl)

So I’ve fucked myself. 


Last September I moved away to college with my boyfriend and mutual friend. My program started out fine, but then I realized I hated it. So I dropped out to switched programs. I stayed in the second program for a semester before I realized I hated that too. I again, dropped out. Since I dropped out twice I was put on academic probation and was told I would have my funding taken away and have to pay back immediately if anything else like this happened. 


Well, I desperately tried to find a job over summer but couldn’t. I have blown through all of my student loans and racked up $4000 in credit debt trying to live here. I have no where else I can go and am freaking out. 


I decide to give school another go, I searched endlessly for months and decide on a program that I genuinely liked (and so I could also get funding to stay). Well, I go for the first few classes and then I just stop. I don’t know why, I just cannot bring myself to go to class. I wake up every morning and tell myself that if I don’t go to class I am literally destroying my life. But it doesn’t help, I don’t go. 


It’s half way through the semester now and I’m failing every single class. I don’t think it’s fixable at this point, and I only have one months rent in my bank account. After that, I’m totally broke. 


Every few minutes my heart stops and I can’t breathe because I realize the situation I’m in. I can’t enjoy anything right now and genuinely want to die. I feel so stupid and helpless, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I can’t bring myself to go to class. I used to be motivated to succeed and now I want to sit in bed all day. I am so overwhelmed and terrified of what is going to happen over the next few months. R


I can’t talk to my boyfriend about any of this because he will judge me and likely think little of me. I’m so embarrassed of myself and my debt. I really don’t know what to do. 


Please tell me what I should do. I’m so scared and sad. 


Tl;Dr: I’m failing college. Have no money, am in a ton of debt and have no where to go. ",22Oct2018,1
151,"My girlfriend and I have tried to talk to our property manager (roommate) approximately 3 or 4 times in the last three months about getting our oven fixed. It hasn’t worked the entire time we have lived here. She tells us she’s really busy, which she is, all the time and is unable to call the company at a reasonable time. We are getting really frustrated not being able to cook certain meals but paying rent which is suppose to cover the kitchen and all other living spaces. We also don’t have working smoke alarms in our house, too, and so we bought our own for our room. 

What do you think is a reasonable amount to deduct from our rent until the oven is fixed?",22Oct2018,1
152,"Ever since I left for college, I’ve become a completely different person. Back at home I was incredibly conservative so I wouldn’t drink or party or do anything in that realm. It wasn’t that I had anything against it, I was just never around that crowd so I didn’t get involved in that scene. All my friends back at home, however, are majorly against partying/drinking underage because it conflicts with religious beliefs. I’m a Christian too so I understand where they’re coming from, but for some reason I just don’t feel so constrained (?) 
I’m in a geek organization now so I’ve been kind of thrown into the scene I wasn’t a part of back at home, and I pretty much dove headfirst into it. I think the change is not the fact that I’m going out though, it’s that I’m not following the strict social rules I set for myself in high school. I’m letting myself just be happy and judgement-free for once. 
My friends here are really fun and supportive, but friends back at home do not like the lifestyle changes. They’ve been open about the fact that they don’t feel like they even know me anymore and that college has completely destroyed the good person I was, and that’s really been taking a toll on me. I don’t want to go back to the person I was because I was unhappy, but I don’t want to continue this path if it means I’m going to be judged so harshly. Should I feel so guilty for changing?

153,"I met this guy on tinder. Me - 21F. Him - 25M. We chatted over text for a few days and I met up with him in person for a date. Everything went cool, we got along well. On the 3rd date, we slept together. (Don’t judge, it’s tinder, people!) 

The day after we slept together, he got upset about a situation with his ex and decided to vent to me about it. (He was a month out of a 5 year relationship). Of course I was like ooooohhh red flag, but I’m not bothered because I was just looking for casual fun, not anything too serious. But, I believe he thinks I took it wrong, because suddenly things got weird fast. 

A couple days pass by and he slowly distances from me. We would talk like everything was cool until out of nowhere I didn’t hear from him. I initiated conversation a couple times, but it was always a dead end conversation, until finally a no reply at all. Present day, it’s about a couple weeks from when I last saw him (literally the night I slept with him) and heard from him.

Now, I’m not a fool haha. And I figure this was a rebound deal and done situation on his side probably. But I can’t help feeling so..awkward. I noticed he deleted me off social media. And I just want opinions on what anyone thinks. I hate even slightly feeling like if I somehow made him feel like I wasn’t interested anymore. (Even though neither of us initiated a conversation anymore after things got weird). 

This may be stupid but I feel like I need a piece of mind! It’s bugs me thinking I may have come off petty or something. I’ll be straight up with anyone. Lol, thanks for any opinions on what you guys think. 

TL;DR - Met a guy on tinder. Went on three dates. Slept with him. He told me some baggage about an ex. Conversations distanced. I suddenly feel like I may have accidentally initiated the ghosting? Am I being socially ignorant or oblivious? Just need some objective views. :) ",22Oct2018,1

155,"So I'll start off by saying I'm 30M and I have this friend 20F, well call her Jamie. I know her because I am her cousins best friend, we have been buds since 1st grade and Ive pretty much been adopted by his family. I ended moving away for 2 or so years (for school) and we could only really text each other about our daily shenanigans, we really didn't hang out at all during that time. When I came back we decided to start hanging out again (at his parents house) just like the good ole days, but now Jamie was there, hanging out with us and Ive known her since she was little, we were never really friends but Id seen her at the family party's or gatherings that my friend would invite me to but at the time she was like 5 when I was 15, she was more of an annoyance than anything at the time. Well when I moved back I moved to a different area than where I had previously lived so I could transfer my job from where I lived previously, turns out it was Jamie's area. One day when we were all hanging out it came up that we live in the same area and she has been really trying to find a job, so I ended up putting in a good word for her and got her a job where I work. Now Jamie and I see each other A LOT more often, and we have become decent friends. I think she is a pretty girl and actually fairly cool for being so young, but I just assumed the age difference and the fact that my friends family considers me family, so Jamie and I are family (although it really doesn't feel that way to me, we just haven't been friends very long), I tried not to think of her as anymore than a friend. Whenever I got those thoughts of wanting to ask her out because I thought she was pretty and cool, I always told myself that's weird, I'm old (although I look seriously young for my age, I often have to prove to people I'm 30 by showing my drivers license because they don't believe me, everyone always thinks I'm like 20 or 21) and she's like family and at the time she had a boyfriend so it was easier to tell myself she's unavailable. Wouldn't you know it though she and her boyfriend broke up about a month or so ago, about the exact time I got her a job at my work. We hang out and goof off at work and it seems like EVERYBODY (mostly the guys) has taken notice because I've been asked several times if we're a couple. So normally I blow all this off because I'm assuming that Jamie thinks of me as a good family friend, I'm old and her first thought of a date with me would be ""ew"", not because I'm unattractive its just like because we are family. Then last night at work I was told by one of the female employees that she thinks Jamie likes me, and I was just like ""eh, not this again"" but curiosity got the better of me and I asked ""what makes you think that?"" to which she replied ""I don't know, she just seems to light up every time you come in to work, girls notice these things.""

Also since Jamie and I live so close (we live about 45min away from the family), the family (my best bud, his 2 sisters, and 2 cousins) has said we should hang out together more because she doesn't really have any friends to hang out with, so it seems like we may be spending more time with each other. The family consider me family so I HIGHLY doubt they are trying to set us up, plus the age difference thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know anymore, should I ask Jamie how she feels about it? Does she wanna try and date? Or should I just ignore this and just remain friends?

157,"He 22M just got out of a 6 year relationship me 19F out of a 9 month one. My relationship involved my ex being emotionally abusive and leaving me for someone else while lying about it, and he knows this. We met about 2 weeks after this happened for both of us, on Tinder. We agreed to be friends and potentially fwb and so we were. Neither of us wanted a relationship and we hung out as friends a few times first but we started having sex, and around this time he started coming over for hours every night, calling me for hours every night, falling asleep on videocall, bringing me flowers, texting me all day including saying that he misses me about 3x per day, saying how much he wants me, calling me beautiful, saying how lucky/unworthy he is, saying how amazing I am, jokingly inviting me to move in when he gets his new place, etc. Every day we'd text from like 9 AM to 1 AM while at work, then he would come over from 1 AM to 4 AM, then he'd go home and call me and we'd talk for another hour and go to sleep on the phone. He wants to be a therapist and he'd constantly ask me about myself and my past and my life and my brain and my problems and he always wanted to help me with all of it. I didn't want to talk about it much but he almost insisted. He always told me I am normal even though I am insecure because i think i'm not. We eventually talked about the situation a few times and he admitted he's not ready for a relationship but has feelings for me. This all lasted about 1 month. At some point, completely overnight, he started acting distant and he denied it at first but after about a week he admitted it started going too fast for him--even though he was the one making it go so fast in the first place. That was about 2 weeks ago. Since then we stopped sleeping together b/c he said he feels it's wrong of him to do that to me if he sees no future, he started denying he has any feelings for me, he started warning me he wants to date around and will probably meet someone else and might stay with them, he said he can't commit to anyone/anything right now, and he stopped talking/calling/hanging out as much. But he kept changing these answers back and forth , going from I am an option to I'm not, he does have feelings to he doesn't, he does want a relationship with someone to he doesn't. He says that he is sorry and feels bad for leading me on/lying to me/confusing me, but he continues to do it anyway. He said that I am too emotionally unstable at the moment for him to date, and too much like his ex. In counter I said in passing that he can ask my ex, who he went to high school with but barely knows, and see that I didn't used to be this way and the stuff I have been through recently caused it temporarily (abuse etc). That was a quick comment and I wasn't serious about him asking. But the next day my ex, who I am on good/acquaintance terms with, texted me and said this guy asked about me. Apparently my ex just said I'm cool. The guy added him on Facebook afterwards and was clearly going to ask more but I jokingly called him out over text just telling him what my ex told me.

The next day I got assaulted by a friend of a friend when unconscious. I woke up and he wouldn't stop. So that was that. About 2 days later I ended up calling the fwb, who was out of town for a few days, and telling him what happened. He was sympathetic enough but honestly strangely not very reactive. Like as if I had told him I didn't get into a community college or something. He definitely knows it happened, he saw my hospital sheet containing all the medication and procedural information.

Since the assault I acted calm and not traumatized or crazy or obsessive over it. If anything much calmer than usual, and happy and not focused on it. He continued being nice, sending me pictures of him and his family, saying he misses me and talking about how pretty I am . Then he came over 4 days after the assault, and we had a nice time but I knew he had previously warned about meeting other girls soon and I was scared of having to deal with that on top of everything else and someone called him at 4 a.m. i asked if it was a girl and he said so what if it is. He said it was just a female friend. I started crying a bit and he asked me to please not talk about this. He said that night basically he definitely will meet someone very soon and there is basically no chance we will ever be more than friends. He promised he just wouldn't go on a date until we hung out just 1 more time. That night after he left we talked on the phone and i was sobbing and asking him to just leave his mind open for any potential point in time and he eventually said he had to sleep and hung up. That was about 5 days ago. Ever since that day he avoided me, didn't talk to me or see me at all.

3 days later I texted him saying hey. He texted about 12 hours later to say, ""Sorry if I answer slow this weekend I am going to my friend's university homecoming."" I asked if that is a date and he didn't say no but he said it's just a dance and a game. It was a female friend. I called him and asked him why he is breaking his promise so soon after what I went through and he hung up and blocked me. I texted and called a bunch until I begged him to just say he'd call me eventually so he texted it. He didn't call and I continued to be blocked for most of 2 PM that day to 11 AM next day. I texted him and told him idc if he wants to date around and just be friends, I just miss having him in my life in any way. He blocked me again. I then did something stupid that morning. I was blocked on everything on his phone so I looked up his name on Google and one of the first results was his mom's contact info. I called her and she answered. She had never heard of me before. I just said that I am a close friend of her son's and something terrible happened to me recently and now he has disappeared with no explanation and so I asked her to put him on the phone. She said she would ask him to call me. She was understanding and said he had not been himself lately.

Then he called me. He said that his mom said I called her and he said that he was too drunk to call me last night and now he can't talk to me anymore. I don't believe that, I think that he was not planning on calling me ever, as he had ignored me and had me blocked for a full night and day after saying he would call me, and he only responded to me now because he could definitively leave without seeming dishonest or shitty. Anyway, his mom said that it is really bad that I called her but that she is going to talk to him when he gets home because what he did was wrong and she didn't raise him that way. I asked if she believed he might talk to me again and she said it's possible but that right now he can't have pressure and I should take care of myself. She said she wants to call me again some time to check up on me.

Of course I fucked up by contacting his mother. But please keep in mind the context. He led me on extremely for a month, then silently dropped me, I got assaulted, immediately after that he warns he will meet someone else, he tells me he is on a date, he immediately blocks me and ghosts me. All within 1 week of my assault. I don't have a lot of support, and I have a lot going on, I have emotional issues, physical abuse at home and the assault to deal with , as well as past assaults, and he knows all this, and he was always a good friend, although i rarely spoke to him about my problems, so it's terrifying to have him vanish and start to hate me with no explanation after something like this happens to me. I was blocked by one ex before this (for reasons such as not having sex when he wanted it) for days at a time and not once did I contact his family or friends. The assault and this guy's horrific response to it, after being one of the closest/most important people to me for 2 months straight, really left me hopeless and pushed me over the edge. I was also PMSing which did not help. I feel that someone else could have done a lot worse in this situation, I spoke to her very calmly and politely and didn't reveal anything about the situation until he did himself.

 It seems that he is gearing up to play out the same scenario again with this next girl; he spent the entire weekend with her. He really doesn't care who he hurts I guess.

Is there any chance he will talk to me again? Does it sound like his mom will talk sense into him about his role in this?",22Oct2018,1

160,"I am 21, at the age of 15 my ex and I broke up after dating for 4 months, I can say that this relationship was like no other. We were, and I hate this term, we were soulmates, to the very end.

But it ended.

Why? Lack of communication, young hearts, we did not act according. The break up ended up with an extremely toxic environment for myself, and an extremely toxic boyfriend for her.

I was left broken, confused, angry, alone, sad. Tormented, by my peers, by my closest friends. I avoided her at all costs.

Her boyfriend, suicidal, hot headed, confused, abused, abusive.

My ex was suicidal for a few years after we broke up, I know typical highschooler thoughts. I spoke to her recently, because I was the person she went to, when she wanted to take her own life years ago. That had destroyed my mind, kept her in my head for years. The day I met up with her, I told her everything that I had gone through, that I couldn't stop thinking of her for so long. She told me she felt the same way, she is still with her abusive boyfriend, she still wanted something with me. So I back pedaled, I said my goodbyes, she offered a hug to say goodbye... I walked away.

Every thought I went to go to clear, was cleared. New thoughts, renewed thoughts came flying in.

I am alone, I feel very alone, I have limited friends, I've dated since, I'm on dating apps, I've had success on them when it comes to matches and conversations. After a few dates with a few women, I fell onto the discovery that I can't move on, and it wouldn't be fair for the women I date if I can't move on.

All these thoughts come to me at random times, it is almost safe to say that I am bipolar. Borderline schizophrenic. I am highly conscious, as to who I am, and what I have said, and it is highly contradicting, and that I have already answered my own questions by explaining my thoughts.

The only thing left, is how do I clear my mind? 

I am trying to move on with my life, find a career, finish school, move out of my parents home. I don't feel like I can do any of this alone, and I can't seem to find anyone to aid me through any of this. I can't help but think a companion is the only solution to happiness. But I really know it isn't, and that I can't be putting others through my problems, I don't like to hide, not anymore.",22Oct2018,1

I get it, and I want to be there for my mom, but I want freedom. like I'm going to come back every week to visit ( and because I have a job near home).

M/23

This is less of a confession and more of just something I’m wanting to get off my chest. I have only slept with a woman once in my life and that was 3 years ago, and since then I have 0 sexual contact with anyone else.

Now I know to some this may feel as though this is not really something that deserves to be posted one here, however this singular element I am lacking from my life is causing me so much distress that I do not know where to turn. 

As I said I’m 23 and I’m at university in the UK. I’m not the best looking lad in the world, however I definitely do not feels as though I am the worst. It’s just over the past few months that I have really started to realise the sense of loneliness that comes from a lack of sexual activity, not only in the obvious physical sense, but on a deeper emotional level I just feel empty inside.

The one time I did end up sleeping with a woman was a one-night stand as it was as awkward as you can imagine, loosing your virginity to some random stranger I have never seen again. Since then I have had almost a longing for a deeper emotional connection with someone, as well as the obvious sexual connection, however it’s been over 3 years now and there has been absolutely no sign of that happening even with things such as Tinder etc. I seem to have reached a cross-road in my life and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

Complicating the issue further is the living situation I’m in where I live with my best friend amongst others, however I seems to have fallen hard for my best friend. This was made clear to her by me some time back, however the feeling is not reciprocated, and it is difficult to watch the person you have fallen for sleeping with other people.

TL/DR male 23, not slept with anyone in 3 years, feeling shitty. Plus living with flatmate who I really like however she wants to stay friends.",22Oct2018,1

170,"Let’s just dig right into this. 
My brother has always been kind of off, he just doesn’t socialize well. When I was 13 and he was 7, he tried touching my boobs. He would always trying and climb on me. I have a very bad history of sexual abuse/assaults. So I am easily uncomfortable, and this mad me feel uneasy, obviously. Flash forward, I moved in with my boyfriend at 17 and things were great, and still are but his brother has gotten increasingly weird. When I was about 19 and he was 13 my boyfriend caught him in my room with my clothes on. I knew he’d been sneaking in my room and I tried to say something about it but everyone just thought I was crazy. Hmmm boyfriend didn’t know what to say or do so he just told him to take it off. I didn’t confront him, because how the hell do you do that?! It’s just uncomfortable. His mother found duct tape in her shower and she asked him why it was in there and he straight up just told her that he was choking himself while masturbating. He didn’t seem ashamed at all that he was telling his mom this. Multiple times we caught him on the couch just masturbating, one time we caught him and his friend doing it together on the couch, they stopped when we walked past to go to the kitchen and then just continued after we were out of sight. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with masturbating but there’s a fine line between normal and weird. Anyway, we moved out for a couple years but since we’re both going to school and just had a daughter we found it easier to live with his mom while we figure things out. So we moved back and his brother seemed to be better, he talks more and seems like a reasonable guy. So I assumed any weird things that went in before was just a phase, you know, figuring out sex and going through puberty. He’s now 17 years old and a junior in high school. The past couple weeks I’ve been waking up in the morning and hearing him in my bathroom (his bathroom is upstairs and mine is down) and as soon as I’d open my door he’d quickly shut the bathroom door. I got that guy feeling that something weird was going on, and I dismissed it. He doesn’t do his own laundry, and has zero reasons to come down to the laundry room and when I’d wake up in the morning sometimes I’d hear him in there. As soon as I opened the door, he’d stop moving and just stand there silently thinking maybe I didn’t notice he was in there. This morning I was in rush to get ready for a funeral and had to rewash my outfit from the day before to wear so I had it drying while I got ready. When I went to go grab my clothes my tights were missing. I could have sworn I put them in the wash. I didn’t think anything of it because these days with my daughter I seem to forget a lot of things so I just wore a different pair. When I got home, I mentioned something to his mom about how I wore something else because I couldn’t find the other ones in the dryer. My boyfriends brother was near so I knew he’d be listening. After that I went down stairs and took a nap with my daughter. I woke up and decided to go grab my laundry from the dryer so I could fold the rest and guess what was sitting right in the front on top, like someone just tossed them in there. My freaking tights. I’m 99.9% sure he stole them and just threw them in there thinking I wouldn’t notice because this kid is super dumb. Now I’m feeling very creeped out, my daughter lives her and I already have this fear for her safety, especially considering my past abuse and the abundance of sexual abuse. Obviously I want to move out, but for the time being I just want advice. Is this a serious issue? It feels serious to me, it feels like something is just not right with this guy. If you want to wear women’s clothes that fine, I don’t care. But given all the other odd sexual behaviors I feel like this means something more. I want to talk to him and just confront him because I’m tired of feeling uncomfortable, and like all my things are tainted. Maybe I’m overreacting but I just feel like this is not right. I can’t dismiss this because it’s just not okay to invade someone’s privacy like that. This isn’t just a sister stealing your clothes. This is almost a grown man, taking my things and doing god knows what with it. Sorry, my text is a huge mess, it’s 2:30am, I can’t sleep and I’m feeling very uncomfortable. I just need some advice and I literally can’t find anything relatable online. ",22Oct2018,1

She did tell me about it and they never met but it had gone on for about a week and the things he said were very sexual and she did nothing to stop it and almost encouraged it, also flirted in response. I've been helping her with a lot of the baggage she has and after she did that I knew that I would just be angry around her and that wouldn't be good for either of us. We were talking one night and I asked what she would do if we didnt get back together. She said she would date him the next day, sleep with him after a couple weeks then probably kill herself. She also said later that if I broke contact completely she would kill herself. I told her I need time to try and get over what she did, she asked how long and I said til the end of the deployment. She agreed and part of this is that she needs to work on issues that she has. We are friends now and I try to support her however I can. I did report what she said so that our supervisors know and will watch her, I have a feeling she will get angry with me at times and not talk to me.

Long  story short, things are getting grim for my health condition and I am  90% sure I need to have surgery. I just graduated recently and have just  started job hunting. However, there are already job postings from  companies and start ups that I think might hire me (hopefully) but my  relatives have advised me NOT to apply to jobs until after surgery if  need be because recovery time might take a month.

To  avoid unnecessary anxiety and stress, my parents advised that I  postpone my job hunt until after surgery, but I am getting more anxiety  not being able to apply because as you fellow job hunters know, some  people take over 2 weeks before getting back to you. My thoughts are at  least while I wait, I can or should apply; does this make sense? Or  should I just not bother applying to jobs at all until I have fully  recovered?

I know my health IS wealth but I honestly don't want to keep burdening my parents anymore without having a job.

178,"I work in a small office consisting of 7 women who are overly close and at the same time, overly critical of one another. This criticism can often get nasty. I've had the same manager since I joined as a trainee where I currently work, however now he has been 'promoted' to manage everyone in the office. He is the only male in the office and is not well liked amongst my colleagues as they do not like the implementation of rules, however I really like and respect him for the most part.

As my manager was not in the office on Friday, discussion quickly turned to him, as it usually does. One of the particularly mean spirited colleagues then said they felt that my manager often acts inappropriately towards me. I asked her what my manager does that made her think this, and she clearly did not have an answer prepared, as she gave a lame excuse about how he oftentimes messages a group chat both he and myself are involved in that she is not involved in. I told her that she was being ridiculous, and she later did apologise and said that she hadn't meant the comments the way they were taken, but I don't believe her.

179,"About a couple weeks ago, I made an Instagram. Only did it to add a friend from league since we pretty much have a good duo in rank and plus she sings. Really great person. Anyways, I started to follow some old friends. Amongst them was a girl I had a crush on from high school freshman. We talked, hang out once but she had bf. It was cool. Since then we never talked. About 2 weeks ago I Sent her a message. We caught up. I asked her if she's interested in going out for some boba and she agreed. Sweet!

The day arrives. We met up at the boba place, hug a bit awkwardly but that's normal after so many years. Idk what happened, we ended up talking for like 6 hours at that place. We just clicked. Time went by so fast. Nothing else seem to matter. She mention she was going out to eat with some friends after this and invited me to go since she didn't want to be a third wheel. I agreed and at this point, we were starving. Met up with her friends and it was fun. Towards the end we parted ways and it was seeing each other after all these years. We texted the next day and invited her to go hiking with me and she agreed. 

Fast forward a week later, she invited a friend over from last time and ask if that was cool, I said sure its all good. All three of us went hiking, and it was so much fun. Never had i ever felt like this with someone else. We would be a bit touchy and talked about pretty much everything. She's the first person that I can actually be myself around.  We have similar interests: traveling, camping, music. It's just so weird. After the hike we decided to go out to eat, went by fine. Along the way, she was using my phone for navigation when a girl i used to date text me about some stuff, and she saw the message. She would tease me about it if course throughout the night. After eating, she asked me and her friend about relationships, a guy she was dating. I got a bit upset but wasn't surprised. A girl like her, they will be guys chasing her. 

She asked us something about the person she's dating. How he's just attracted to her but doesnt like her. It was a weird conversation. We assure her that maybe it just a physical attraction he just seeks and and yeah and asked her if she was seeking the same. She wasn't sure and just seem a bit lost and taken back from that response. Then we got into some deep talk and time flew by fast. After a long tiring day we parted ways and said our goodbyes. 

And it just feels like we known each other forever. We would look at each other and it feels right idk. Is that weird? Idk what this is. Shes a great person. Sure I like her, and given the chance to date, I mean why not, she's an interesting person that shares the same values. What do you guys think? What am I feeling, cuz i for sure don't know what this is. Wouldn't want to ruin a great relationship with her.

We sort of briefed each other on how our respective families tick and how to best make a good impression on them. When the topic of religion came up she advised, implored really, that I tell them I am christian, which I am not.

I'm not someone who likes to lie, whether explicitly or implicitly. Whenever possible I do my best to tell the truth and avoid pretending to be things i'm not. Personally i'd rather be disliked for who i am than otherwise and, as i've expressed to her, I highly doubt her family would appreciate finding out i lied to them later me than telling the truth or at least not lying at all. I've brought up to her that alternative answers to questions like ""what's your religion?"" could be things along lines of ""I was raised christian"". However, she warns me that her family is not that simple or, frankly, respectful.

I'm very uncomfortable with to lying to people, especially if those people may become important to me in the future. In addition, I fear where will a lie about a topic such as religion will lead (will they have me participate in religious practices with which i'm uncomfortable?) I'm conflicted on where the line should be drawn (if any at all). Is it better to be truthful, or at least not untruthful, and risk her family going out of their way to stand between my girlfriend and I (which she's strongly expressed is a possibility) or is it better to essentially start and build a relationship on a lie in order to be liked, possibly accepted, and safeguard my relationship but quite possibly be an issue in the future when the truth is discovered?",22Oct2018,1

194,"So I have a friend. I've known her since jr high. We weren't super close but we spoke to each other here and there. She got pregnant at 16 and we drifted apart until about the age of 27. We reconnected as adults and hit it off. In the beginning most of our time spent was at the gym. As we realized we have similar interests, we started to hang out outside of the gym. That's when it got kind of weird. 

Over the course of the next few years I've realized she was starting to become me. She would cut her hair if I would cut my hair. She would ask where I bought my clothes, accessories, shoes etc and I would see her wearing the exact same item or something similar over the course of the next few weeks. As I started to catch on, I started to lie and tell her it was an old item or that I couldn't remember where I bought it. But with a simple Amazon or Google search she would find it and purchase it. She even started to speak like me and pick up my mannerisms. It got to the point where she was retelling my jokes to other people. I stopped going to the gym with her bc as I was getting fit I noticed she would spend our gym sessions talking my ear off. And a lot of times, 10 mins into our workout she would say ""I want to be bad. Let's go eat pizza"". Like Wtf? There's a lot more to this but basically, I feel like she's in this weird competition with me and I'm not even aware that I'm a competitor. 

This all may sound petty, like get over it but the other half is that the more I'm getting to know her the more I don't like her as a person either. She is extremely cheap. I invited her to a friend's bbq and I asked her to bring some beers. She brought a 6-pack of IPA knowing not a lot of people like IPA's so She could drink it for herself. (She told me that to my face). For her bday she expects me to spend money on her and when it comes to mine she doesn't do much. She took me to happy hour this year and got upset when I ordered a drink that wasn't happy hour price. 

Overall as a person, in my opinion, she is shady, selfish, dishonest, lacks self esteem and does not know her own identity.  Those are not qualities i ok for in a friend and am a little upset at myself that it took this long to figure her out. 
My question is, do I cut her off or just keep her at arms length???",22Oct2018,1
195,"A little backstory, my ex and I were together for a little more than a year. Very early in the relationship she moved in with me due to issues going on while she lived with her parents. Things were going great; I started my new job, and was making more money, but it was incredibly long hours. Unfortunately she lost her job, but I was happy to support the both of us because it was right. When we first moved in together things were like we always imagined they’d be. Making dinner together, watching Netflix, and just being together. 
Due to circumstances in our social lives outside of each other, we ended up spending a lot of time together. She didn’t have any friends, and I found myself sacrificing time with mine to spend with her because she was depressed and alone all day while I was at work for 10 hours. I loved spending as much time as I could with her because I knew it made her happy having someone there for her. The downside to spending so much time together was that we always got into little fights, and sometimes they turned ugly, and ended up in us breaking up only to get back together minutes or hours later. 
For Christmas, I gifted her a car, because while I was at work she had no means of transportation, and couldn’t go anywhere. At that point in the relationship, things were very serious to me it felt. I didn’t picture us breaking up, or ever being without her, and I just expected no matter what that she would be there. While we don’t have that car anymore, I ended up fixing up my other car, an older bmw 5 series, and I ended up financing a car, so we could still have two. 
After financing the car, our financial situation was getting harder and harder. She would take me to work in our newer car and she would pick me up so we could save some money to help, but it still wasn’t enough to live comfortably. We were still living on just one income. We couldn’t go out and do anything fun besides go out to eat, because that was all we had money for. For months  I could feel we were growing apart because of our situation, and tried to do everything I could to mend things, but we still ended up growing apart and she became very miserable and unhappy. 
All of these things over time came to a head one night after work. On the way home, we got into an argument, and she wanted to go back to her moms. I acted very improperly because of that, and she went to her moms to be alone and to think. A few hours after, she called me saying she was coming to get her things, and that she wanted to break up. The next few days following were very messy on my part. I overstepped my boundaries and accused her of talking to a guy she slept with before we were together, and my emotions and anger got the best of me. I bought the phone back from her on the plan we had together, and didn’t expect to talk to her again, a decision I regret completely. She ended up getting a new phone under her moms plan with the money I gave her for the phone, and I was blocked on everything. I did all I could to reach out to her and apologize and to try and fix things, but was met with threats of restraining orders and the police being called. I finally took a step back, and realized how terribly I was acting, and left her alone. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and getting medication to help with my mental health, and so far it has been working great. 
A few days after leaving her alone, I receive a call from her, asking about using the car we got together. While it is in my name because of credit reasons, the car was primarily for her to use while we were together. I decided to let her use it for the time being, as a way to show that I’m bettering myself and getting mentally healthy, but I mainly thought that by helping her, we may end up getting back together. A few days ago when I checked my phone after work, I received texts from her saying how much she missed me, pictures of memories we had together, and that she put the rings I bought her back on. Based off everything she said I thought she was ready to fix things and to try again. Unfortunately when I saw those messages she was asleep, and didn’t get the chance to talk to her then. A few hours later in the morning we were on the phone talking, and I brought it up.  She said that she changed her mind, and that she can miss me without wanting to be with me. it felt like a total letdown. She said that she wanted time to be apart to be a teenager, and that after being apart we could come back stronger than ever, if we did get back together. She also said she wanted to work on being more independent, and to not have to rely on me or her parents for things. 
The issue at hand now is the car. She needs it to get to job interviews, hang out with friends, and to overall just live her life. We had a discussion about it, and I told her that I’d help her as much as I could handle emotionally, and that I would be there for her because of how much I love her and miss her. It’s been almost three weeks since we’ve had that discussion, and she’s spent the night at my house once, and we’ve gone out to eat once or twice. She knows I want to get back together and prove things will be different and much better than before, but she still wants to be apart and just be friends. I know that I can’t handle being just friends while helping her the same ways I was while we were together, and I didn’t think we’d be broken up for this long. It scares me to imagine a life without her by my side. I can’t move on if I keep helping her and she chooses to be friends, but I fear she’s going to keep that decision from me so I continue to help her until she has a job and her own car. I don’t know how much longer I can take not being with her and still helping her and she knows that. But her future relies on being able to use the car, with or without me, and I just don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice on this would be very appreciated.",22Oct2018,1

200,"Let's get it real, he started as a rebound from a 5 year relationship I had ended months prior to first meeting him. Every couple weeks, months, we would meet up and spend the entire night together. It was never a ""hit it and leave 10 minutes later"" situation. After a while , it turned into horrible oxytocin releasing territory.  I'm talking...like a year later. We started cuddling, holding hands, kissing on the cheek, forehead, nose, back, falling asleep with our legs tangled together. I was smitten. It happens. However, I tried to end it. He had said he never wanted a relationship and I felt that it wasn't fair to myself. I told him how I felt last year and tried to end it. He apologized for not being that type of guy. However, it was really hard. He'd be on my side of town and hit me up, or vice versa when I was drunk. It always happened. Despite me not wanting to have anything to do with him because I wanted something more, it always happened. We moved onto other sexual territory by him telling me my ""pussy was his"" during sex. After we finished he'd hold me so tight and kiss my head. We've never talked about my feelings for him in person. It's always been over text.  Here we are, 2 and a half years later...There would be times where I would delete his number, stop responding, and he will show up at my door.  It turns me on, definitely but at the same time, I k ow it's not good for me. I am at that point where I want a relationship. Not with him. He will forever just be a fuck buddy and I am aware of that. I honestly do love him but I'm not sure what I would do if he ever asked me for something more. It's hard to quit him. ",22Oct2018,1
202,"Until I reached 18yo, I was a shy, bullied, and a liar. I was making up lies to get attention, making people to like me, you name it. I never told big lies, but what I told always finished to blow up at my face.

On my 18th birthday, I was alone. I decided to stop lying for good, to myself, for myself. So far, I've held that vow flawlessly. My life is easier, my mind is clear and I'm honest head to toes. I'm with in my love with my first girlfriend ever for a little more than two years now, life is good.

I guess this question is asked at anytime in a couple: ""did you ever lie to me?"". The answer was no, and I told her why. I explained it to one or two other people since, but nothing I boast about (well except on here, every one has his flaws and internet makes it easy). 

The problem is: my family don't know it, and at any time, they are going to hear of it. Just like a lie, it's going to blow up at my face. And I wouldn't blame them, considering what I did back then. Do any one have an idea on how to keep it quiet, and dodge the bullet?

Like many youths of my age, I spend an excessive time on my phone. It’s so bad, instead of doing my chores, I’ll lie around and watching / text and put it off until an hour later. It’s not very productive.

204,"I miss lectures because I do not want to feel and stupid as I dont know much but I used to be the best and respectable student back in the school, and that image used to protect me from social akwardness.
Mostly I avoid practicals because there is a lot of interaction with lecturers and other students, which drains and dreads me. 
I know I should socialise because we all need friends especially at uni, so I try and engage where possible, and next day I feel like I told too much and I do not show up, not willing to put myself out there all vulnurable plus avoid showing that I am not as good as first impression on lecturers. The worst are the moments after lectures where I kind of want to walk off to the next room or walk home with someone but I dont know if they want me to, and if I dont sneak out by myself then I dont know what to say when we walk together.
Then I cant study and concentrate at all because it seems to me I can not accomplosh at anything anymore.

I guess I just have low self value and believe will be unworthy in the society just for being who I am without playing a smart one. Problem is, if I don't succseed and graduate I can't move on in life. I just want to be too good and that kills my willpower because perfection is impossible.

212,"I was recently in a relationship. One where we have a lot of history. One where we've been best friends the entire time. During our relationship I was toxic and abusive. Not physically abusive but too abusive for my liking i.e yelling, calling her names, telling her to leave me, telling her id kill myself. We were off and on for about half the year. Unfortunately we split up and she wants to continue being friends. Which is understandable. I love her. Ive realized the mistakes ive made and obviously i cant take what happened back. The best i can do is live with and learn from mistakes. But its hard. I pushed her away. Now shes at the point where she no longer wants any form of relationship unless its a complete platonic booty call.  Which she has someone now.  Im jealous.  I still have feelings for her.  I don't want her to have sex with some random stranger just because shes doing what she needs to do is move on. I feel replaced. I feel that she still has still has some feelings but i feel she does not want to pursue a relationship and fall back into what made us toxic. She wants me to be happy and do whats best for me. She doesnt want me depending on her for happiness. I had everything i wanted in a person and i regret the way i treated her because she truly deserves the best. Shes always been there for me through thick and thin. I want to do the same and be the friend she needs me to be because i do care immensely for her. Just finding it being extremely hard. I just want to be back with her and start over again with a fresh start. Ive been trying to put myself in a position to where i could be happy alone. I started a new job. I have small goals im trying to achieve by the end of the year.  But everything just seems pointless. I saw a future with this woman.  Im afraid to grow old and she was the only person i ever would feel comfortable with having said future with.  Ive tried moving on.  Ive tried talking to other women to get her off my mind.  But her and i talk regularly she's still the only person i talk too pretty much everyday.  But now when i think of her i think if her spending the evening with her play thing.  I know im in the wrong for what ive done and said. I feel as though living together and deciding to foster a kid added a lot of stress to our lives. The foster care system is a joke by the way. We were broke because she wasnt getting paid and we were struggling to make sure the bills were paid and that our kid had food to eat. After two months we couldnt do it anymore and had her moved to another house. But ever since then things have just been kinda going downhill we eventually broke up. We would still see each other, fool around, text, a few weeks ago was the last time we fooled around then we had a conversation aboyt how she wants to be friends and that we will no longer have sex. Unfortunately i saw that she was talking to 2 different men on PlentyofFish i kept my mouth shut because i knew we werent dating. She has every right to talk or see other people. But it just hurts knowing the woman i care about is seeing someone else. She said she has no emotional attachment. Its just sex. I know sone people can seperate love and sex. But to me it doesnt work like that. I feel you wouldnt just have sex with anyone that there is something about that person you like. Whether it be physical or not. Trying to keep my head up. I want to continue being her friend and support her. I just find it hard when im still in love with her. I know our breakup was my fault. Just wish i didnt overreact the way i do. Ive been working on it. Been trying to communicate with her differently and when im upset i try to talk things through with her so she understands why im upset instead of just lashing out. I just want whats best for her.  I want her to be happy. I know it might be better for her if i just stay a friend.  But she does make me happy.  She pushes me to better myself. She gets me.  We don't agree on everything but we just click.  Looking for any sort of advice.  Anger management,  communication,  acceptance, really anything that could help me be okay with just being her friend.  I don't want to throw all our memories away.  I don't want to just let her go and move on.  Like i swear shes it and if i can't be with her i personally don't see any reason to be in a relationship.  ",22Oct2018,1
213,"Dear everyone

My girlfriend is damaged. She was sexually abused by her brother, physically by her father, mentally by her mother. Her boyfriend in high school cheated on her for a year, lied to her and manipulated her, another group of people bullied her in the same period. She attempted suicide at 16. She now lives in hiding from her family, which means she had to leave her little brother and sister behind, whom she loves very dearly. She lives far away, so we can only see each other on weekends.

I also love her more than words can describe. She is a true angel, and I can’t begin to explain the strong feelings of affection I have for her. We have been together for half a year now, and my love for her is truly overwhelming.

For a long time, I carried a secret: 3 years ago, I visited a brothel on a trip to an Asian country with my best friend, and have felt bad about it ever since. The decision to go to that brothel has haunted me and even more than that, it has haunted me that I could never tell my girlfriend about, as she has always been candid with me about her life and what she has gone through. This past Saturday, I told her and she became extremely upset and depressed about it, but eventually said it was okay and told me she was happy that I had been honest with her, but that she has to mull this over in the coming weeks / months. She also told me she never wanted to see my friend if he didn't go and tell *his* girlfriend the story first. It was absolutely idiotic of me to tell her, because I know, given her past, how vulnerable she is, but I just couldn't keep the secret from her, I felt so guilty and plagued by my dishonesty. I don't need to be told how stupid a decision this was, I probably in some sense know that, I just need to know what to do from here.

I then called the friend that I went to the brothel with to tell him what I told my girlfriend. He saw no reason why I told her and was very mad at me for “throwing him under the bus also,” and including him in my story. But I only included him because it was essential for the story that I didn’t go there alone like some horny loser, it wasn’t even really my decision, I just tagged along because I thought going there would make me live up to some idealized rock-star kind of persona who lived for the moment and didn’t care about consequences (I was very insecure back then). I don't think this excuses my behavior the least, I know what I did was very wrong and abuse of the poor woman that I was with in the brothel, but I didn't want to make it worse than it was, which is why I told my girlfriend the full story, with my friend as a part of it.

My friend now believes there is no way for our friendship to recover. He believes I jeopardized his relationship by sharing the story with my girlfriend (because now the truth is out among other people), and he believes there is no way for our friendship to get past me having a girlfriend that refuses to even meet him. My girlfriend I am scared will see me like a worse person forever because of what I told her and I am afraid this will scar our relationship a lot. Even if she can get past it, I also need to get past having disappointed her so greatly.

Making the decision to share this secret was probably a terrible idea, but I can’t really do anything about that. I just want advice on what to do from here. I stand to lose both of these amazing people and if I lose both I'm afraid I will lose all interest in life as a whole.",22Oct2018,1
215,"Hi everyone,

My (f28) younger brother (24) has been suffering from bouts of depression and anxiety for some time. Recently he has been at his lowest point and made a suicide attempt. My family and I are being as supportive as we can. This includes traveling to see him whenever he wants and talking to him on the phone at all hours. We are really committed to doing everything we can to support him and have got him a top therapist who has prescribed him medication.  He is also seeing his university counsellor.

My issue is dealing with his angry outbursts and his refusal to stop drinking which massively exacerbates his depression and leads him to the brink of self harm. He will often call me drunk at 4am to talk and cry and I will listen to him and comfort him for as long as he needs before having to head to my stressful job on limited sleep. A few hours later I will make an innocuous comment which will set him off and he will verbally abuse me and call me the worst names. He does the same to my parents.

I need to understand how we can continue to be supportive while making it clear that we cannot be his punchbag. I understand he can’t help it sometimes but I don’t want it to become more of a habit then it already is. It makes him very difficult to sympathise with and to an extent has always been like this even when he isn’t depressed.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to deal with this? Do I just have to put up with it or can I put a firm foot down while still providing an outlet? My other concern is pushing him away so he doesn’t confide in me which would worry me the worst. It was me he called when he made his suicide attempt and when he’s had trouble with the police before he gave them my number. I am happy to be his first point of call but I also cannot let him take his anger out on me and still confuse to be supportive.

Thank you for taking the time to read and I look forward to your opinions.

216,So I've known this girl (who i won't name for obvious reasons) for about 6 days and we're already quite close but I've got a crush on her and I feel like she may feel the same way since some of her replies when we text (which is literally all day haha) come across as though she's dropping hints. This is our second time going out (oh i forgot to mention we're both 16) and this one she arranged however I'm not sure whether i should tell her i like her or not but this is probably the first time I've actually struggled to tell someone i like them (I've previously been in 3 relationships) but i genuinely like her so much that I'm afraid i might break the already really good friendship we've developed over a short period of time... ,22Oct2018,1
217,"Hi all, I am coming here in complete desperation honestly---feeling utterly lacking in my ability to help my girlfriend during bouts of manic episodes, when I am not there. 

I think the best thing I can do initially, to help you all understand, is detail the position that we find ourselves in, and what I have tried up to this point.

* I am 21, recently turned, and she is 19
* We both live in the U.K; originally living very close, but she had to move away for university (college)
* She lives in student accommodation in her university and thus has roughly 6 flatmates.
* This is her first time living alone (away from family, etc...)
* I see her as often as I can, but there is roughly 2 weeks between when we can next spend some sustained and significant time together
* I have mentioned the possibility of seeing a professional but she insists that she doesn't have the money to afford that help.
* I have already took it upon myself to learn the details of paranoid schizophrenia, D.I.D, and other such conditions I feel she may experience to gain an understanding. **Moreover, and most importantly: I have seen advice on what to do when I** ***am*** **there. I know how to help her when I am around. I just cannot find any advice on what to do when I am** ***not*** **there.**
* I am not 100% sure on the details of her condition but I know she experiences, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, voices in her head (which overpower her own thoughts and keep her awake), and she has not trusted that I am me a few times.
* I know how to identify when she is experiencing the onset of an episode, and when I am in her company I feel as though I can take her mind off it relatively well, and she copes well when I am there. However, when I am not there, it is close to impossible to help her, because she is scared to tell anyone about her condition, and refuses to talk to me (believe me, I really try)

I need to know what I can do to help her whilst she is there by herself, because if I don't sort something out, I am worried I may lose her. All advice is greatly appreciated, and I am sorry if this post is a bit scrambled, I will answer any questions that I can! Thanks so much. ",22Oct2018,1

So that's how we became friends. Now we haven't talked for about 2/3 years , but a few days ago we started talking again. It started off fine talking about memories and catching up, but last night we had a personal conversation. Now in 4th grade I had a small crush on him, but he liked another girl. So about that conversation we went on to talk about our relationships and sex life. Today he was the only thing I could think of and so I wrote him saying what I felt like about last night. Here is my question: what do I do? Do I have a crush on him again? (BTW we were BFF and now we are starting to grow that relationship again) I don't want to break our friendship, he is the greatest boy I've ever met and we get along very well.

222,"I’m 99.9% sure my best friend is toxic. I’ve actually told her as much in a few big fights and my boyfriend and mum think she’s nuts. She is however my closest friend and she does have her good sides, like anyone ... so I suck up the crap.

But tonight I tried to bring up something very serious with her. She got added to a group chat and immediately sent screenshots of said group chat to someone who we both trust, but is in the same line of work as me and if he leaked the screenshots (I didn’t say anything at all, but I could be guilty by association) then my career could be over because tbh it’s just very easy to lose your job in my line of work.

I tried to bring this up with her and also thanked her for telling me that I should leave the group because it would be bad if stuff got leaked (I did leave) and it didn’t go well. She threw it back in my face, mocked me by calling it my “career”, and *joked* about blackmailing the other people in the group. Oh and told me ‘don’t lecture me thanks’ when my message was polite.

This is really a final straw for me, you don’t f with my career that means everything to me and I’m also mad at myself for not realizing sooner that I shouldn’t have stuck around in that group chat.

I really want to end this friendship but 1) I don’t know how to without feeling guilty and 2) I’m scared of her leaking the screenshots. She’s gotten someone kicked out of the army before for revenge. Help!

We both like animes. Games and cosplay.
But then it ends about the shared hobbies.

She is a little bit thick, and that's a thing that makes it complicated for me...

She likes me too now and we are writing hearts to each other for like 7 month , but every time I want to tell her that I love her, I think about what would everyone things of me when I'm together with her.
Then I scrap the idea and try to ignore her but i feel sorry for her..

I told her this morning that I want to talk to her this afternoon after work, to clarify my love to her but an hour later I wrote it, my mind gone crazy about that I don't love her.

I'm completely confused about my feeling for her, I want to tell her I don't love her because I don't want to lose her as a good friend. I think a relationship would destroy this friendship, because of this mindstorm right now that is going on for 3 months now...

225,"I smoke a bit, and I'm usually fine. Just chilled playing games or watching a film. But recently it's got weirder.

It all started last year, after a 3 month break my friends wanted to do gravity bongs. I did a couple and had the worse anxiety and panic I've ever felt in my life. I started seeing shit and hearing things not there. I always just assumed it was because I smoked too much coming back from a break.

But then it kept happening, not every time but more frequently. Started doing regular bongs with a bit of baccy in them and I started getting the same feeling, though definately at a lesser degree. Only way I can explain it is my mind felt like it was racing, a million thoughts a second, I was convinced everything was connected. Convinced that anything anyone ever said to me was meant in a hateful way.

Since then Ive just been doing weed bongs with no baccy. And it chilled me out a lot more, back to the normal high I used to feel.

That was until yesterday where only after 1 small bong I was convinced I was schizophrenic, it felt like my skin was peeling off. Like I'd touch finger across something and it was like the skin was coming off. And again the paranoia and full blown anxiety. A few hours later I hit another bong but this time I was completely fine, was a bit paranoid after I had a cig but overall managable and chill.

228,"So I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis (a painful bladder disorder) about 5 years ago, (I'm 26f) and after bouncing from doctor to doctor, I pretty much realized that no doctor could really help me manage the symptoms. My symptoms aren't as intense as other people diagnosed with it, but it's still a horrible stabbing pain in my back/bladder at completely random times. Every doctor I've seen has essentially said that there's no cure, and that I need to just watch my diet and drink more water, which I do. I've always been more prone to things like bladder and kidney infections, ever since I was a kid, so it sometimes means I'll end up calling out from my part-time job once or twice a month, which is starting to make my managers pretty pissed at me, even though I always get a doctor's note and I try to explain my situation.  


I work overnights doing stocking at a pretty big store, and the work can be pretty grueling sometimes. I'm a small woman, and they run me ragged, which I don't think is good for my IC as it is, but I enjoy more physical work and it's my only job option for the time being. (My boyfriend and I share a car, so he works during the day, and I work at night.) Usually, I'm okay enough to work as long as I'm always drinking water, and they don't give me a hard time about bathroom breaks. I try to work as hard as I can when I'm there and feeling good, and I'm always getting compliments on how great the store looks after my shift. Unfortunately, we are badly understaffed and everyone we do hire doesn't really care about the job, and I end up picking up a lot of slack. (There's a huge turnover rate, we've had grown men just walk out on the job before.) I try to prove to my managers that I care about the job, but it seems like every time I try to speak to them about my schedule/issues, I get ignored/looked down on. They always have issues with their scheduling system, and while I initially applied for a part time position (25 hours), they have me working 35+ hours a week while always asking me to stay late. (These are 8 hour shifts btw, 11pm to 7am, which is already rough) I've tried telling them that I'm getting overwhelmed, (I also take classes/do freelance work on the side, which I've told them about) but my schedule never changes.  


I had to call out last week due to a bad bladder infection, but before I could even explain to the manager that I'd have a doctor's note and could make up my missed days whenever he wanted, he interrupted me and said I'm going to need that note, because he's going to talk to the other managers about me ASAP. I'm frustrated with this company's lack of organization, but I obviously don't blame them for not wanting me to call out. I don't want to be a burden on the company, but at the same time, I can't help my health issues, and I do the best I can. Also, I haven't worked there for a year yet, so the Family and Medical Leave Act wouldn't apply to me. How do I manage trying to hold down even a part time job while having unpredictable health problems? I tried working from home for a few years after my diagnosis, but I just wasn't making enough money, so not working isn't an option, and I'm not completely disabled, so I feel like I'm stuck in work limbo. I'm honestly getting very depressed as well, working crazy hard doing 4-5 overnights in a row just to get ignored by management when I need to talk to them/never seeing the daylight/not being able to focus enough on my classes, etc. The money is decent, and while I'd like to be doing something else for work, I just assume most places are going to treat me the same.

No goals? They're there but I keep on making excuses

I need money for schools since I don't want to study locally - only about $20 - $30K

I love music but it's been five months since I haven't touched it at all, well I have but I didn't complete it.

Do I get a apartment and become a YouTuber and try to make music online and see if it will work.

241,"Hi everyone, 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

My dog is 12 years old, has been diabetic since 6. Prior to the diabetes he was extremely well behaved. Never had accidents, always signalled that he had to use the bathroom. 

After the diagnosis, he would have accidents in the house here and there, once we got his insulin regiment under control this was minimized, still with some accidents. 

As time went on, he would have more accidents, not signalling that he would need to use the bathroom either. He went blind as well, so wanting to go outside in general is a no no for him and he lets us know this as he tenses up when we bring him outside, even if I carry him to the grass. He bumps into things, which is why he behaves this way. 

Now, he uses our house as a toilet and it’s making me, and my family physically ill. He has no control over his bathroom behaviour, and will just urinate/defecate whenever he feels like it. Unfortunately, we do not have the time to keep a watchful eye on him 24/7, and even if we did, sometimes when we turn our head he will even urinate by our feet. 

I know this sounds strange, but I even think he does ‘spiteful’ bathroom behaviour. I have a new niece and nephew, and when they are over he gets very jealous. He will then, I don’t know how, find spots that we frequently go to (bottom of stairs, foot of a chair at a table, by the fridge/dishwasher/stove) and leave a small amount of urine that we know he could have held in but does it anyways. Now, especially with the new young ones, I fear for their health because of this, as much as we try to keep on top of cleaning up the mess when it happens. 

We can’t keep carpets anymore, he’s damaged furniture. However, he’s still walking around fine and still has ‘pep in his step’ and as much as I know that he’s damaging our house, I would feel horrible as I see him and he doesn’t ‘look’ ill.

In January over my winter break from school I used it a lot, like 2 hours a day. Now when you turn it on or start recording a beeping noise plays. For some unknown reason my dog hates this sound and has become terrified of it. At first he was barking but now whenever I use it he runs upstairs and hides under a bed. He generally avoids me now and whenever I come home on weekends always acts scared when I'm around. I only use my gopro once every like 2 months now when I'm at home. Whenever I am home he acts nervous (only when my parents or other family are around, if its just me and him he's fine). It's not like I'm doing anything crazy annoying with my go pro i just film a cringe youtube video every once in a while. The last two days my father has been asking me what i've been doing to the dog and it's obvious that he's starting to think I'm hurting it or something. I've tried to tell them that it's because of the go pro noise but that's impossible for them to believe because it sounds like some made up excuse. (Which in reality it does, but its actually not so idk wtf im supposed to do to get them to believe me). So i'm thinking that this is about to escalate soon, and I really don't have much of a way to defend myself. So what should I do here, cause I'm not really sure what to do?",22Oct2018,1
251," Hello. I'm not sure where to go at this point. This semester has been one of the hardest academically and mentally for me. I had to cut off contact with my parents, quit my sport, drop a class, and start taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication after a scare.

It's gotten to the point that my medication isn't helping me anymore; all I do is cry and sleep. I don't have the motivation to study for my classes, or do much of anything to live. Due to paranoia of coming into contact with my parents, I usually stay on campus (we live in the same town), particularly in my room. I hardly have friends, and those which I do have are too busy to spend time with me.

I'm trying as hard as I can to pull out a B- in each of the classes I have C's in, but my depression is getting the worst of me. My boyfriend said a semester off would probably help, as I'm applying to transfer to a school for next fall (to get away from my abusive family) and could take time off to recuperate and heal. I personally think that I have the potential to excel and make A's in all of my classes; however, circumstance is not permitting.

Help? I'm desperate and at my wit's end.

(p.s: As an added note, I have finished all of my gen eds with all A's save for one or two, and I've only taken two or three major courses in which I got mostly A's and B's.  My GPA is around a 3.75 right now.)",22Oct2018,1

I'm a 27 year old man who turns 28 in December living in NYC. I've been here about 4 years. I currently have a job where I do next to nothing all day, sit in an office, contribute to a failing company that doesn't matter, and make a very low paygrade. I was thinking of going back to school but that is such a long process it seems to be just digging a hole for myself.

I've discovered I love working with my hands and would love to do a job that has some physicality involved... regardless, I was thinking of going to a trade school to switch up my life and get out of this damn office.

I've also considered learning coding with the high demand there is in the field and my love for digital arts and gaming, but I really don't want to fall victim to another office environment... Or am I judging all offices after my first office job which has been a horrible experience (i worked in bars and schools before this)?

Either way, turning 28 is making me realize I'm getting older and its time to be happy and find a change. As well as make money that I'll actually be comfortable and not wait to get a 20 dollar haircut until the next paycheck.

I'm sure this is a common occurrence for people of my age and any age... I'd just like some words of advice to anyone who's gone through it, known someone, think they know a good path for me, etc.",22Oct2018,1

Disclaimer: I don’t think this guy likes me very much I just don’t understand why he doesn’t just move on.


So there’s this guy he’s two years older. When we went to school together he was well liked and dated a good number of girls. We hooked up  a couple times and then he left for a government job for a couple years out of state and moving around.




We would send photos to each other weekly for a year and a half. He got a girlfriend he didn’t tell me we stopped talking for nine weeks and heard through the grape vine they were dating. He hits me up and is visiting town so I thought they broke up and we hooked up. He actually cheated and they broke up a month later.




We keep talking once a week for eight months and I hookup with him again when he comes to visit family. He took sexual photos of me he didn’t really ask but I didn’t say anything cause I was young and wanted to seem cool.



I left the country for nine weeks on a graduation trip. My phone breaks during the trip and I don’t go out of my way to tell him because he had seemed uninterested and perusing other girls. He blows up my phone sends 34 different pics or texts. He also made passive aggressive statuses on social media I don’t have accounts on saying “if you have to think if I care about you I probably don’t”.





We start talking again and he starts acting weird asking if I tell people about us. He has a girlfriend we stop talking she cheats on him he hits me up. Says he never wants to date me only wants me for sex and nothing more. We talk a little and I stop talking to him a little then he gets a new girlfriend and we don’t talk for eight months. 





Then he’s hitting me up again. I tell him I moved to the same state as him recently. He still has a girlfriend I say I don’t want to talk. He sends messages for weeks begging me to talk and asking if he was single I would talk to him. He also sent those sexual photos to me saying “don’t you miss this” .Then he breaks up with his girlfriend I still ignore him. He gets a new girlfriend and was still texting me. I talk to him a little a couple weeks later. Then he says we can’t talk anymore he has a girlfriend.





Seven months later he’s texting me saying this will be the last time we can FaceTime and to talk to him one last time. I do hoping he will leave me alone because he still has photos of me and sends them to me. Now three months later he’s sent me nine texts in a day begging me to email photos saying he “lost “ them. He’s asking if he’s ever hurt me. He says one last time then he’ll stop. It’s been three years and four months since I last saw him in person. He’s also very into to me watching him cum when masterbating




Why won’t he leave me alone? Why does he need these photos? Why not nudes of his girlfriend? Why does he want me to always watch him cum?



Tl;dr: ex hookup keeps trying to contact me after three years of not seeing him

258,"Some context on the situation, I have about 3 months left on my lease with my roommate. I’ve known him for almost 10 years but ever since we’ve moved in together the friendship has become strained. He recently entered a relationship with coworker after never having one and things have gotten much worse since then. She is 20 and he is 25, which is fine, there are bigger splits than that, but they act like pubescent teens when together.  Constant PDA, LOUDLY being intimate across the house, and binge drinking/making noise late into the night. At this point she is staying over every single night of the week and he no longer even mentions when she’s coming over. 

I work early in the morning while they work afternoons, so staying up late and being loud has become a norm for them. It is now affecting my productivity at work due to lack of sleep as well as my mental health. I feel uncomfortable at home and am grossed out by their routine of drinking almost a full bottle every night then loudly getting it out with my room 10 feet away (complete with tissue paper walls). I know I  need to have a serious discussion with him but I don’t know where to start. Is it crazy to expect her to pay rent if she’s now staying over more nights of the week then I am? Is it also rational to have boundaries set on these sort of things? Every time I try forming a mature, structured argument in my head I struggle to not just sound whinny.

I can't be mad about it, I knew I should've tried to figure this stuff out before, but I didn't think people would care about my photos enough to go and post them somewhere else.

261,"TL;DR at the end.

So, I'm pretty stuck on what to do. 

The local humane society is filthy -- there is litter everywhere, there are WAY too many cats for the space (\~15 in about two rooms -- the kittens are sometimes in the same large-ish cage as the rabbits). Whenever I mention it, people just brush me off and say it's because they're understaffed.

I've been visiting a lot lately to try to find an Emotional Support Animal (ESA). I found a very calm cat and fell in love. I went to the desk, gave them the date I would be moving into my new apartment, gave my phone number, asked them specifically whether they could hold her (they said no -- which is fine, they're a shelter, sure), and then I went on my way to arrange things with my landlord. Also on that visit, there was a cat that was sneezing blood, so I told them. Some lady came in, scanned the cat, then walked back out and I didn't see her again for the rest of the time I was there (a half hour to an hour).

Next visit, maybe a week later, I asked what happened to the cat I was interested in. They told me that she had JUST been adopted THAT DAY. I JUST MISSED HER! I asked why I wasn't contacted. (In hindsight, I wonder if they just gave the cat away the same day.) The lady asked why would they do that. I told them I had registered my interest with them. They told me that they had no record of it. I then asked her if the blood-sneezy cat was chronically ill or whether she just had the feline equivalent to the flu or cold. The lady told me that **sometimes cats just sneeze blood**. I repeated that I needed to know because I cannot afford to properly take care of a chronically ill animal. She just insisted that anywhere is better for the animals than in the shelter.

So, I'm very anxious about whether I should report them because they're the only humane society in the county, and they are also animal control. But I am genuinely concerned about their lack of organization and apparently concern for the well-being of their animals. They have dogs, too, and one of my friends that I visited with made a comment about how badly the dogs were shivering even after being taken inside from the cold.

**TL;DR -- Local humane society is doing, in my opinion, pretty sketchy stuff and possibly neglecting their animals, but they're the only one in the county and I don't know if it would be ethical of me to report it because where else would the animals go?**",22Oct2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

Hope your all having a great day and i'm coming here today for some advice as i'm in a dilemma and i'm not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

a bit of backstory, i'm 25 and have worked in IT for 8 years, i do quite well but i really really dislike the field, i just got into it from having experience of building computers from gaming, before i did this i done fencing/construction and loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at the moment i'm working long days, hardly see my partner as she works opposite shifts and only get to see my kids for about 30-40 minutes a day and they're back in bed.

now the problem is at the moment i'm on 38000 and still have quite some debt to pay off, but this job is affecting my health as well as my home life - i've become increasingly stressed and depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner has told me to quit work and look for an alternate role but i'm not sure on what i could do - construction is an option as i have all the required credentials to work on sites/other places but it's not an ideal position if i look at staying in said field for 30/40 years to retirement.

I have considered becoming an electrician but can't afford the wageloss to go and study.

&amp;#x200B;

what suggestions do yall have? skillwise i'm good at all forms of manual labour, i'm quick thinkings, good at maths and learn extremely quickly. i think the ideal job for me would be something similar to Q&amp;A or community manager for a gaming company but i have no experience in said fields and there's

no companies nearby let alone ones that have an opening for this position.

272,"Skip to the 4th paragraph for the main question.


So, for the last couple of years I have supported my local team, Ironi Modiin, located in the 4th Israeli league. In that time I've realised that we're never going to improve or go anywhere at this rate. 

The club is owned by the municipality, who have no interest at all in improving the club. They own and run the youth football lessons and teams as well, which they make millions off. However, the adult team makes no money whatsoever, so them being stuck in the lower leagues is great for them.

There is an enormous difference between the 4th and 3rd leagues, meaning if we get promoted (which we haven't in the last 5 years we've been in this league) the municipality will have to increase the stadium size. Because of that they built a new pitch ,which is basically identical to the other one, outside the city so there is room for expansion. The problem is that they completely gave up on financing the team once we missed promotion by a point a few years back. Anyway, this new stadium leads in to my next point:

NO ONE GOES TO THE GAMES ANYMORE. In the past there used to be an average of around 100-150 people going to the games, a small ultras organization and a great atmosphere when we were still playing inside the city. However everyone but around 50 people come to the games anymore. No one knows the club exists, and no one is interested. Everyone I know refuses to go to the games with me and say I have no life for going. There is a single bus that goes by the stadium, which comes once an hour and barely stops inside the city. The games atmospheres are completely dead, which they shouldn't be because other teams in our league have incredible atmospheres with up to a 1000 people going to games, singing, drums, flairs, the works. 

I have tried speaking to the vice mayor, who went to one of the games with me, but he basically ignored everything I said and tbh all he wanted was my dad's vote in the upcoming elections.

275,"Reddit, I dated a girl at the start of the year and I’m finding it difficult to move on. Not a very stimulating first sentence, but keep reading. We only dated for about 4 months, but things were real and intense and I miss her. I’d like to speak to her again. But I’m pretty sure she’s seeing someone, if not committed to them. She basically got with this person no more than 2 weeks after things ended between us, because she met them on Tinder while she was seeing me. Stung like hell when I found out, and was the main reason why I ended things. Took me ages to move past my bitterness towards her from that. I felt like she wasn’t someone to be trusted and I could’t see any hope for us anymore. Don’t get me wrong, things were never perfect between us. Our values and beliefs were massively different so we’d often get into these petty arguments, which would always end up with mutual frustration and no resolve because she’d kinda just shut things down. But I’m wondering though, how much of that was a result of emotional immaturity and bad communication on both sides? We’re both young and have a lot to learn. Here I am 6 months later, and I find myself thinking of her and wishing she was here. It’s an emotional yearning, not sexual. I fear reaching out to her and finding out they are together. I think that would break me. In hindsight, I can see I took what we had more seriously than she did. It did feel one-sided. I often felt unheard. I think I was her rebound. Something to pass the time. She didn’t want a committed relationship at the time. Just to date, whatever that means. Then towards the end she said “actually we’re not dating” (even though we’d fuck all the time and were all cliche and romantic together, AND we agreed to not see other people). She’d start to get so irritated with me over small things. I felt judged all the time. Then when I found out she was flirting with this person behind my back and it was pretty obvious they liked each other, I felt betrayed. But I never voiced this because she kept assuring me there was nothing going on there, so I wanted to seem chill and non-invasive. I could’ve maybe accepted it if she’d just been upfront from the start, but it’s the lack of honesty that bothered me. I’m wondering how much of our struggle toward the end (aside from her talking to this person) was just us not bothering to try anymore. She had a tough childhood, so did I. We both need therapy. On one hand I feel used and hurt and taken for granted. On the other, I love her and just want to take care of her. The way I ended things was bad. I was hurt, I said mean things that I regret because I wanted her to feel hurt too. I wanted her to get upset and ask me to stay, which she did. Leaving brought back a sense of control. So even if I did reach out, I’m not sure she’d wanna talk to me. She’d either be too hurt, or she will have moved on, or she’d be with this new person. All of those paths would be justifiable. I guess I’m just stupid and wanna see if that connection is still there. We had a lot in common beyond certain differences in morals and ways of coping. Should I reach out?

282,"Though a lot of scientific literature is available on just how miserable commuting can make you feel, i'm still in doubt. 

Currently in a train for at least 3hrs a day, which could be reduced to less than an hour by bike or car. Problem is that a similar job literally doesnt exist closeby. 

The problem is thus the evident gain in commute reduction versus risk of not liking the job. Anybody made the same gamble? Is a 2hr reduction virtually always worth it?

Moving is not an option. Current company works on cool applications. Team, manager, pay, etc. Is al fine and I expect it to be fine with the other options as well.

She agreed, but then proceeded to start flooding me with messages, future plans for visits, pictures of her self, and phone calls. I was pretty flattered and went along with it. 

Then she started going hot / cold. One day telling me how much she missed me and then 3 days of passive aggressiveness. Finally she went silent and I ignored her thinking it was over. Well, it wasn’t. She texted me right before my latest trip back and brought up old plans. She was super enthusiastic to see me and invited me to a friends party on Saturday/ told me that I could sleep over after. She was pretty flirtatious at the party and on the way back to her home we kissed and made out for about 5 min. All seemed great.

292,"19y/o American/Canadian Pakistani background Male here. I’ll try to keep this short &amp; concise. I’m studying Mechanical Engineering in Canada and have a goal to make it as a US Air Force Fighter Pilot or Naval Aviator &amp; a NASA astronaut. I’ve come to the realization of these dreams after my Pakistani childhood crush broke my heart from grade 6-grade 12. Dating every guy but me and purposely hanging out with my friends and not me. She was really rude and I bought her so many expensive gifts and I think that I spent about 3,000 Canadian dollars on her. I could’ve been scuba search and rescue certified if I didn’t have feelings for her or loved her to buy her all that Sephora, Victoria Secret, &amp; Pandora gift cards. The corniest thing was my breaking point and cut off all my feelings for her. I dont have any friends and this is because I want to cut out as many foreign contacts as possible because military pilots require the highest level of clearance.


I lost my feelings for my crush when she didn’t say “happy birthday” to me last October. I’m used to having no one wish me a happy birthday except my parents and I don’t really care. But I liked this girl so much and flowered her with love and gifts for her birthday and just wanted her to say “happy birthday”, but she never did. Even though I reminded her. I told her that I realize that I’m a nobody to her and I lost my feelings for her. I then realized that I want to become a military pilot and astronaut. I made a promise to myself to know my worth and never let myself be this heartbroken again.

Fast forward to now, a very beautiful Pakistani girl who’s so sweet is a new person I like. She went to my high school and I’ve never spoken to her prior. She goes to my university and I spoke to her for the first time and I guess we had a good convo because she gave me her number. I asked her out on my birthday (Oct 19) and she said “hey sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I actually have a boyfriend”. I was heartbroken and devastated. I know I just met her but she seemed perfect and she was so sweet and gorgeous. It’s hard to move on and I don’t know what to do.


Now I feel heartbroken and don’t know whether to remain friends with her or not. I thought the only thing going in life was my dream of being a military pilot and an astronaut but being a fighter pilot is a 1 in 1000 chance and being an astronaut is a 12 in 18500 chance. I still had hope though but I was prepared for Murphy’s law. That’s why I wanted a girlfriend so I can have someone to fall back on if I don’t reach my astronomically high goals. I’m not trying to be conceited but every one of the girls I work with (who I don’t have feelings for) were surprised when I told them about my 2nd heartbreak. They said that I’m really cute and sweet and were surprised I never had a girlfriend. My self esteem was below sea level because of the heartbreak but I guess it got a little better after the international female students from India who I work with told me that.

I have a long term mental health diagnosis and due to a bad, unhealthy relationship I’m struggling again and looking at an added diagnosis of PTSD on top so I’ve been taking some time to heal and recover mentally. 

The issue is I’m so bored and I want to be productive, I want to be doing something towards my future. 

Currently, I gym and I volunteer two days a week. I’m considering taking on another volunteering role to fill my week more. 

If I’m not doing that I’m socialising with friends but if I’m honest it’s always the pub and its not practical to be drinking every time I’m bored. 

I sometimes will go ponder the shops or take myself for coffee. 

I want to work, I’m not happy in this situation however I pushed myself into work not so long back and it had a very negative impact on my mental health. This is not an immediate option. 

I struggle with dissociation, panic attacks and a mood disorder so I need to work within this.

297,"I’m a 17 y.o M. 

I’m just really sick with life. 
I’ve been bullied all my life and now I’m rejected by girls because of my race. 

(Long rant, you can skip to the summary if you want) 
The bullying from high school started just because I was posting gaming YouTube videos, doing what I loved at the point of time (I was 13/14) I had YouTube comments from people in school telling me to kill myself and I had no idea what wrong I have ever done to any of them. I was a confident kid who never backed down from my own responsibilities but since then, my confidence started to break little by little. 

With the atrocious amount of bullying in high school, it pushed me to suicide and my mental health was at rock bottom. I was having audio hallucinations and then further complications, which was visionary hallucinations. Sometimes I couldn’t sleep for days. I had friends, but at the same time I felt singled out and my friends weren’t really friends, just toxic people and people who couldn’t give a shit about me really.
It was hard telling my parents about this as they just couldn’t believe I was going through all of this and eventually brought me to psychiatrist. 

I was then diagnosed with Complex PTSD and severe depression. Anxiety and social anxiety started as well and I had to take anxiety meds too. 

I was always verbally, emotionally and mentally bullied by those kids until last year (my last year in High School) where I was hit twice and nobody in a class of 30 could at least say something about it or help me.

I’m now in Pre-University and mentally, I Ma stable and also so made a lot of friends but I was rejected by 3 girls when I asked them out (after getting to know them) and they rejected me because of my race (I’m a fair skinned Indian dude but they were Chinese girls and they said they don’t date anyone except for their own people) 

I’ve always been writing lyrics (for like 3/4 years) but usually it’s depressingly sad, or sometimes rap and even metal songs but I never wrote an angry sad song to be played on acoustic. 

Note: *I’m advanced on playing guitar, both electric and acoustic* 

TLDR: Any advice on how to write angry, sad lyrics to be used to play on acoustic guitar ? 

Any advice ? 

Thanks in advance !

We stayed in contact but she started being very mentally abusive and a very mean person. It chewed me up so much, but foolishly, I held on.

Fast forward to now I've lost the weight, currently fairly lean, tall, handsome, (got rid of my acne), humble but confident, caring and respectful. I'm in school with 2 jobs dealing with a disease that makes me prone to depression, lost the love of my life who I still am not over despite moving on and dating a few other girls. Long story short its been an uphill battle. 

But now I get the feeling that everyone assumes it was all given. People tell me, ""when I first saw you I thought you were a douchebag."" Its most people.

The point of this post is to help clarify why I'm treated like shit and not considered valuable. A good example is a very common social interaction: someone shows off a drawing or a talent and the person actively listening raves about how amazing it is. We've all seen it. But I'll show something to a friend that won me a national award and I can tell they're not really impressed. I show a recording of me singing my heart out and my friend looks away to someone else halfway through and says nothing about it after. Im working on a group project in school, and every time I contribute, I'm simply ignored and the decisions I've made are attributed to someone else, and I know if I brought it up someone would say ""thats no big deal"" with a negative vibe. Those are just 3 examples of many. 

And the cherry on the cake is that because of these experiences, I give off a ""bad aura"" and that justifies pretending I dont exist. There's like one person in my life telling me what I KNOW, while everyone else is acting like I'm dirt. I'm extremely positive, genuinely affirming and kind, for comparison.

311,"Somewhat of a long story. But I will make it as short as I can. 

After months of suspecting my dad was up to something, he slipped up and I he accidentally messaged the girl (who is significantly younger than him-though legal age) some very inappropriate messages on a shared account of ours for our family business. They exchanged back and forth. It was mutual on both of their parts. 

I am the only other person that has access to this account. So as far as I know I am the only one that knows what he is doing behind my mom's back. After finding out, I became very distant. I didn't even want to look at him. He asked what was up, eventually I told him that I stumbled across the messages he sent. And without being angry, I told him how hurt, worried and upset I was. What makes it even harder is that the woman involved is also a part of our business and has some sort of ""hold"" on my dad often doing whatever she recommends- no matter how unwise. 

After confronting I told him I didn't know how I could look at my mom and keep this secret without feeling guilt. Or attend family functions knowing that everything everyone sees is a sham. 

After the civil and understanding conversation I had with him, he decided to message the girl on the shared platform of ours and ""end"" things with her. In what I can describe as a ""staged"" conversation between the two of them so as to get me to think things were over. 

I was extremely skeptical as the conversation between them seemed so ingenuine it made me cringe but wanted to forgive him and move on so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and tried to moved on. 

I didn't see him for over a week and a half, and decided to reach out to help mend things so it wasn't awkward before my grandfather's 80th birthday party the next day. I made small talk and tried to get past things. Everything seemed fine. 

Then at the party I notice some of the traits I had seen in the past. Being overprotective of his phone, constantly getting up and going to another room to text or snapchat this girl, hiding in corners, closets, the garage, anywhere private. All while in the middle of a family party for my grandfather!!! 

I stepped outside when he was in the garage getting a ""soda"" when he didn't suspect me. Of course, when I opened the door he was panicked and quickly his his phone. Obviously, I knew what was up. 

I confronted him again- except this time I was furious. Not only was he lying to my mom, but now trying to lie and hide things from me and lead me off the trail. And on top of that at a family event. Completely selfish. 

I am asking for your advice. I don't know whether to tell my mom. I hate living with this guilt and I don't think I should have too. I gave him a chance to right things, and even told him that I understood if he told her he wanted a divorce and to go with this girl instead. I just told him he had to make a choice. Whatever it was. But I hate having to hide this from my mom. 

What do I do! Tell my mom? Talk to my dad again? I am so troubled by this and it is a constant cloud over my head. But I feel so guilty hiding this secret from my mom. Help!",22Oct2018,1
312,"I'm doubting going on this holiday with her. I'm worried it'll bring back my feelings for her. We're still friends and we agreed to go as friends just after we broke up, but i've spent all this time trying to get over her and I don't want to start all over again. It was supposed to be on Christmas day, and if I don't go she'll be spending Christmas all by herself as her family and friends are all away. Does that make me a bad friend? I don't want to lose another. But part of me feels like I have to put myself first and decide not to go. What advice do you guys have for me? I have yet to message her again. She seems really let down and disappointed which doesn't make it easier.",22Oct2018,1
313,"For the past two months, (August and September) I've been charged with over $300 dollars on my monthly gas charges (totaling up to over $440). Up to that point, I've been paying only around $80 for gas (totaling around $160-$190). I haven't been even using gas except for stove and hot water, which both have been used sparingly.

I tried customer service and they sent a guy over who checked both boiler room, meter, and the second floor which I reside in and said that he couldn't find anything wrong. I tried calling again, asking for their supervisor but never did, then they just blew me off saying that another department would call to schedule another appointment. They never called back.

The rep even said that it was an unusual amount of usage for non-winter months, but that was about it. I didn't install anything new, although there was a contractor my landlord hired to work on the boiler, which shut off any hot water for that time. I told my landlord about this and the contractor said he didn't do anything wrong.

I don't know what to do from here, I'm afraid to turn on the heat for the winter because no doubt it'll shoot up beyond $1,000, which I cannot afford.",22Oct2018,1

I have lived on my own and moved to different bigger cities for work. I have a secure job that pays around 70k but my commute is about an hour each way from where I’m living. I’ve been offered a place to live from a family friend at an apartment that is about a 15 minute walk to my work and is financially affordable. However, my dilemma is I’ve definitely slacked in the financial responsibility department and although I don’t have debt, I also don’t have much savings.

321,"Okay, this is going to be long. So, I'm 17 and a senior in high school. I'm homeschooled, which means I have no friends and really have had no friends my whole life (in my area, I'll elaborate on that later.) Yeah, some people in public school don't have friends either, but I have very little interaction with other people except at work (also important to the story, I'll get to it). The only people I really interact with every day is my parents are a few coworkers, that's really it. Loneliness has led me close to depression before, and it's getting close to that again. However, every year I go to Canada to visit some relatives, and I have for my whole life, about a month a year. There, I have a few friends, who aren't good enough of friends to talk to the 11 months I'm not there, and I can't get to know them any better because I only see them one month a year. I'm also pretty sure that one person I know in Canada likes me because she did a lot of things that made it seem like she did (stories for another day, they aren't important, tl;dr she probably likes me.) So, I have a few friends and a lot of other people around me, but that's 1 month a year and 1,100 miles away. So, where does work come into all of this. I hate my job. Yeah, everyone says this, but I hate what I do, dislike my coworkers, and one of my bosses insults how I work. I've been assaulted as a cashier, and get rude customers everyday, and it's really not good for my mental health. Really, none of living here is good for my mental health. I'm trying to just get through school without putting effort in because I hate school, I hate going to work but I also want more hours (I only get 12 hours a week because... that's how they do things? idk) because I'm not making nearly enough money right now. I have no friends and not even people around my age to interact with. Even with college, I don't even want to go anymore because I don't want to spend 4 years and a lot of money to learn a job that isn't guaranteed to even hire me and that I probably won't enjoy (I don't think I'll enjoy any job, it's the people I work with that make it enjoyable, less of what I do.) Also, the college part isn't going over well with my mom, and she takes every opportunity she can to remind me to go to college. So, I want to move to Canada. The big problem is, I don't make enough money right now and there's no guarantee of a job when I move there to pay rent. I also don't have a car and can't afford one, and a year of putting 100% of my net profit into saving still won't get me a car. So, I'd want to move in with my grandparents for a few months. My brother moved in with them at my age for his own reasons, and hasn't moved out yet, so I'd need to wait for him to move out before I moved in, which would be probably summer of next year, don't question it. It wouldn't be ideal to live with them for a few reasons, and there's still no guarantee that they'd be okay with it, but I think they probably would be because they enjoy me being there, so who knows about that. I'd be able to get a better job, because I could probably get in at a fast food place where my brother works, which gives better money hourly and I could probably get a lot more than 12 hours, and I have a few friends that work there, making it a much more enjoyable place to work. So, live with my grandparents until I can afford to pay rent, work there until I can find a better job, have actual friends near me with more people around to actually interact with, and it would probably just be a lot better for me to live there. However, if things go wrong, like the job not working out for me or what I'm hoping for with the friendships not being what I hoped for, then I've just moved to a new country, living with my grandparents, and I could be even worse off. Or, I could just be worried about nothing and it would be great for me. So, I don't know what advice I'm really looking for here, and I don't know if there's a better sub to put this on, but like, am I messing up somewhere here? Is it a bad idea to move away, or am I doing it for the wrong reasons?",22Oct2018,1
322,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I have a close friend that I've known for the past 5 years. We've shared some very nice moments together, and I consider him to be a close friend. Recently, he told me a couple very disturbing things and I'm trying to figure out what to do. He made me promise not to tell anyone, but I don't think I can honor the promise. Some background info: my friend is older in his 50s, gay, and a teacher. So far he has confessed to me: 

1) He finds hookups online frequently, sometimes going through multiple partners in a day. This riddles him with guilt but can't stop. This comes up in conversation a lot.  


2) After a recent trip abroad this year, he contracted a curable STD. Upon his return he started treatment, but before treatment is done he had multiple partners. He admitted to having multiple partners at a dinner, but not to the fact that he has contracted an STD.   


3) This is the biggie... a couple months ago he was accused of being a child molester by his nephew. This apparently occurred over a decade ago, and when the victim was 12. Now the victim is an adult and is accusing him of abuse. The victim has not made this public because my friend has a close relationship with the victim's mother, and the victim is waiting for his mother (who is in bad health) to pass away first. I asked my friend if he did it or not, and that I would stick with him if he didn't do it, to which he answered that ""it is complicated"". I confronted him recently and he is backtracking saying he never did the act, but I'm certain that he did or is capable of it.   


I'm at a loss as to what to do. I have already told my spouse, who is also his friend, and she is distancing herself and I am distancing myself. Should I turn him in? Continue ignoring him? End the friendship? ",22Oct2018,1

325,"I've been in a 2.5 year relationship and it's always been a difficult one. I was addicted to benzos when we started dating and she knew that. The taper and lingering depression made things hard but we stuck it out together hoping things would get better with time. We loved eachother very much, that was clear. Anyway, cut to the chase. I have a dog we both love and adore. The dog isnt the problem, but the next litter her parents had, is. Our relationship got to be too much to handle. She moved to Alaska temporarily to work at a resort this summer and I steady worked on myself so I could be a better person for her. We stayed in contact but she started being very mentally abusive and a very mean person. It chewed me up so much, but foolishly, I held on. She wanted one of lilly's sisters so I picked her up when she had little over a month left up there. She planned on returning to me and we could continue our relationship with our dogs. 

She kept treating me like shit. Even after I had the dog she wanted. I'm a lover and I'm falling in love with this amazing creature and she loves me too. Not to mention shes best friends with her actual sister. 

She came back from Alaska and spent a week with me and while it was hard, things really seemed to be working better than before. She left to see her family in Florida and once gone, she returned to her old ways and continued to treat me like she did in Alaska. 

Now she wants to rip the dog away from me and separate her from her sister. And I'm very hesitant to let that happen. For the dogs sake, and for my own as well. My hearts been broken enough and I dont know how much more I can handle. 

Shes in Florida, I'm in Colorado. I have both dogs and I'm moving end of the month to a town a few hours from here. I am considering shutting down all communication and not letting her do what she wants. I dont think it's fair to have me get a dog and me agree, in a desperate attempt to show her I'm committed to our relationship and I've changed, for her to remain treating me so poorly and take the dog from me.

327,"So quick background - I dated this girl about four years ago for about a year and a half. I was about five years older than her - she was a sophomore in college and I had a job. She was very sweet, and we were extremely sexually compatible, but she was also very emotionally needy and the age difference made the balance of the relationship uneven. She told me she loved me, I told her I did too (but if I was being honest with myself I was lying) and we constantly had sex so I just kept it going for a while, but eventually, I started to feel like I was using her and broke it off. Also, she honestly really wasn't mature yet, and as a result, not really my intellectual equal.  It broke her heart and she didn't talk to me for years. I felt really bad about it but I felt like I was doing the right thing at the time.

About a year ago, I started dating another woman, who I genuinely do love, probably the first person I've actually loved, and we recently moved in together. She is sweet, smart, dorky, and extremely attractive, and pretty much everything I could ask for in a girlfriend. There are little things that annoy me sometimes, just as there are in any relationship or friendship. But I really couldn't imagine a better situation.

Except, I constantly have dreams about my ex. Maybe not constantly, exactly, but two or three times a week, I have vivid sex dreams about my ex. I've even had like 6-7 dreams about me choosing to leave my current girlfriend for her. Last night, i actually dreamt that my girlfriend was asleep next to my, and my ex was lying naked on the other side of me asking me to have sex with her. In my dream I just barely stopped myself because I knew it would fuck up my current relationship but I was about to give in when I woke up. 

Basically, I just need to understand why my brain is doing this. I am still very attracted to my ex, but that was years ago, and I'm also very attracted to my girlfriend. Like I said, I can't think of one reason why I would be happier with my ex than I am with my current girlfriend. I don't even interact with my ex except seeing the occasional Instagram post.

330,"This is my first apartment ever (Alabama), and my first broken lease. I had to leave unexpectedly about 5 months into a 1 year lease because I worked up the courage to leave an abusive relationship. I have had no contact with the landlord other than emails through the office assistant. Today, she is telling me that I must hand in my keys ASAP if I want even a slim chance of someone taking over my lease. She insisted the landlord said I must pay for the rent, electricity, and water until the room is rented to someone else, even if I have vacated tbe premises and turned in the keys. 

My question is, are they allowed to do this? Force me to pay for utilities in an apartment I'm no longer living in after taking my keys away? Am I not paying for the access? I accept that I must continue paying rent, but utilities for a place I'm not living in? If a pipe bursts or an electrical issue burns down the apartment, they are saying I will be held liable, even if I've turned in my keys and won't have access to make sure the place is safe and still clean.

I'm already struggling to pay for this place all alone, my ex did nothing to help me pay for it and I don't know how I'm going to pay for 2 living situations when I can barely afford this one. Staying in the apartment is not an option, as it would not be safe for me to be there since he knows where I'd be living.

338,"Hi. Thanks for clicking this thread. First and foremost I apologize for this wall of text and if my grammar is not correct, english is not my first language but I'll try my very best on this.

I consider myself a person that overthinks everything, a lot: it's useful for some scenarios, but for most of the time it impairs my hapiness and mental health. The point of this thread is a little situation I have with a female friend, this is how it goes:

We have been really good friends for a long time. We both share a lot of personal stuff to each other and we kinda have the same taste in games, series, movies, etc. I don't like her ""romantically"", by that I mean that I'm not in love with her or have romantic feelings towards her, but I do feel sexually attracted to her cause she's hot, but I don't go out of my way to try and seduce her. I know I don't like her in that way and I respect that, plus I really appreciate his friendship since she's been there for me when I needed it. She's great, but I felt that I had to make this point for the sake of context.

The thing is that, yea, I don't like her, but sometimes I do and think things that make me think otherwise. For example, she's kind of a lone wolf some times, and can spend days or weeks without visiting social media, just doing stuff at her house. This was fine for me, until I visited her at her house one day and I saw on her computer screen that she had a Facebook page opened, logged in and everything. And it didn't made sense since on my Facebook it said that she hasn't connected since 5 or 6 days ago.

This made me suspect that perhaps she blocked me, or she had a secret facebook account. So I made some investigations and I found that indeed, its a secret facebook account. It's an anonymous profile where she roleplays or whatever, and she has some other friends and stuff. The thing is that, sometimes, when I chat with her (on her normal account) through fb, she suddenly dissapears for the night, and when I check on her other profile, she's active, sharing and commenting stuff for a couple of hours. And the next day, when I ask her why she suddenly dissapeared the previous day she says ""Sorry, I went to sleep"".

Lately she has been doing this a lot, and its driving me crazy, because everytime she dissapears I don't know if she's hiding or she genuinely left, so I always end up stalking her other profile, which makes me feel like a psycho.

This whole situation is weird:

\*I don't know if she's hiding from me or hiding from someone else. If she's not hiding from me, then why doesn't she text me through other mediums? She has called me her best friend countless of times, but it bothers me that I get the same treatement as everyone else.

\*I feel bad everytime I stalk her other profile, I know is not right, but everytime she dissapears while we were talking it makes me thing ""wow, I'm THAT boring? did I say something bad this time?""

\*I don't know if I should be mad at her for doing all of this. We share pretty much everything to each other, but yeah I know, she's not forced to tell me EVERYTHING about her life, I get that. But she's lies to me everytime she leaves and says ""uhmm sorry I felt sleep"".

So I don't know what to do or think. I can't ask her what's going on, I don't want to tell her that I found her secret facebook account, plus she doesn't owes anything to me to ""be for me whenever I want"". Or perhaps I'm overthinking all of this and I shouldn't be mad from the beginning, it's her life and I'm being invasive... if that's the case, then why I'm acting like this? I honestly ask to myself ""Do you like her? do you see yourself in a relationship with her?"" and the answer is no. Fuck her if she wants to? Yeah, but kissing, cuddling and holding hands?

339,"Hi,

I'm 24 years old and have a stable career, not full time but enough. I live in an area where down payment for an apartment/ condo can easily be $50, 000. Majority of my money is already tied up to other investments, bills, etc. So really, I have to choose between travelling now or saving up for a place later.

I've always wanted to live on my own and have my own place and be settled by 30 but, I also want to go to Italy, Greece, Japan, Hawaii, Australia, Netherlands and Ireland at some point in my life. 

I just don't know if being carefree and living my life now will translate into regret of not being wiser about spending money now. What do I choose? Am I being irresponsible if I choose to travel now?

I'd just like to here people's advice/opinion on this. I'm not sure this is the right sub for this either. If not, please direct me to the correct one.

Thank you!",22Oct2018,1
340,"Don't know how to start this post without the typical ""there's this girl"" so im just gonna go with that.

Well. Theres this girl. I may be extremely misreading the signs but I think she is (unintentionally) making it pretty obvious she has something for me. So in one of our hours long daily conversations, I asked her on a kind of date (A kermis, like with carousels, food and shit. You get the idea.) She asked wether we'd be alone, I responded that I didn't really have someone else who I wanted to go with so she just responded okay, and we agreed on wendnesday.

Now if Im not completely stupid and naive, I think she really really likes me. And I like her back. Very much actually.

Now my problem. I haven't even had a serious relationship yet. Some in like 5th and 6th grade but you can't really call them actual relationships. And im scared that she might want to kiss me and I won't notice. Or that I want to kiss her and she won't notice or don't even want to kiss in the first place. Should I even worry about that on a first date? Should I even call it a date?

Also any tips or things you wish you did better on your first date would be amazing. Thanks in advance.",22Oct2018,1
341,"I’m a 17 y.o M

I’ve been writing lyrics for about 3/4 years now. 
I’ve wrote a lot of stuff from the severe bullying I faced, rock bottom mental health I faced during the years of high school. 

Most of my genres of lyrics fall under hard rock, rap, metal and now acoustic. 

I’ve always written sad lyrics or lyrics about certain topics like unrequited love. 

How do I write angry lyrics ?

348,"Hello, I'll start by introducing myself as this is my first Reddit post. My name is Simon and I'm 25 years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm here because I do not know where else to go. My story is a classic one. I had my heart broken by of what i believed to be the love of my life. It started a couple of summers ago. I met a girl that blew my mind at a job I loved doing (outdoor instructing) She was perfect and we got on like no friend I've ever had. If i'm honest I have always had a friends not so many girlfriends but what I am trying to say is that I'm not a recluse or someone who shy's away from interaction with other people. I was 22 she was 20 and we fell totally in love. We shared ever thing we each other told each other everything about each other and would spend whole evenings just chatting this went on for over a year.

&amp;#x200B;

After some time about a year and a half I found out she cheated on my by sleeping with someone when she was drunk. I found out because she told me a week after it happened as she was also fucked up from this whole experience. She told me face to face and explained that she had been drinking a lot of alcohol with some work colleagues one evening shots etc. I know she felt absolutely horrible and disgusted with herself about the whole thing. The whole this was very strange as how drunk she was telling me she was (but that's another matter) Well at least I thought I knew this person better then myself. So I believed her when she said it would not happen again (it didn't) I've never felt so horrible and I still do. I didn't eat or sleep for days after I found out. So eventually as you can imagine this ate away at me to the point where I couldn't take it anymore and our relationship become toxic. We were slowing drifted apart but were still totally in love. In the end we broke up because of this. She told me that I changed and she was right. She was also starting university and I didn't want this toxic relationship to hold her or me back at any point.

&amp;#x200B;

So after we broke up I got a good sense of relief knowing that I no longer had to worry about anything to do with her anymore. I stopped flowing her on all social media and everything like that so I wouldn't be reminded of her etc. Anyway that's the back ground of the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

The real reason why I am writing this is because of the after effect it has had on me. Like I said after we broke up I felt good. But after about 2-3 week I really started to feel sad. My problem is when I'm sad I get a little self destructive. Yes poor me poor me. I started drinking on the weekends quite heavily Friday night Saturday night etc. This wen't on for some months then I started having a couple of drinks on the week night. Then on the weekend's I started using cocaine with friends. One thing led to another... weekend after weekend.. starting to feel depressed which leads to more substance abuse. So I have become aware of this but now I am still using cocaine on the weekend's over a year after we broke up I still beat my self up. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is no joke I have though about her EVERY day since we have broke up. Tonight I was just relaxing at some and boom I started crying thinking about her and what we had. If i'm honest I don't think its her I actually miss. It's how much much more happy I was at that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal after a year? I know people will just be like well stop drinking. It's not that easy anymore I defiantly have a substance abuse problem. It doesn't matter what it is. Weed, alcohol, cocaine, porn. Just something to stop the aching. I just don't know what to do anymore I feel like I'm losing grip on my life and who I am. Every Monday I say I won't drink anymore. This has been going over for over a year and the cocaine usage is no joke either. I regularly go out on my own and sit in bars and drink myself stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know what I'm expecting from this but I almost just deleted it. Any advise big or small is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.

The problem is that my Cats are not used to the New environment yet but still acts pretty much the same as they did before exept the fact that We are living in a smaller space now. 

My mom wants to sell the Cats only because she thinks that they are annoying and in the way when they are laying on the floor or running around but I still want them because the reason why We got them in the first place was to improve my mental health. But she ignores that and makes things worse by saying stuff like ”for how long are you going to abuse those poor cats by forcing them to live here?” And that really makes me feel bad.

355,"I need to go a back a bit to show why this is rather important (also throw away because they know my Reddit)

Firstly I have never really been in love or had a crush on anyone I just assumed this was how it was. Then when I went to college (UK) I met my small group of close friends of which now I talk to on a regular basis. This is where I met (let's call her N) N was someone I could talk to constantly and we had alot of similar interests so we just started hanging out. About 2 years pass and we're still talking and I start to notice that she's really special to me. She shrugs it off as a close friendship and so do I no harm done.

It all comes to about 2 months ago, I had the thought of ""it's be great to love your best friend wouldn't it"" and since then I haven't stopped thinking about her. It's weird for me because I went from being not interested in anyone (some would say aesexual) to head over heels in love for her, it started affecting my sleep and it got to the point where enough was enough (I woke up in a cold sweat panicked that she had married someone else and I missed my shot) and I knew I needed to lift this weight.  Last week I did it, I told her that she was constantly on my mind and that I liked the thought of us together (ommited the marriage and how long it's been that way)

Anyway she said she was aesexual (which is fair enough I hold no anger or resentment towards her for this people who do are just idiots and she said she wanted to remain freinds)

356,"How do you deal with family members who may have views that are now, in today's day and age, considered backwards and unacceptable from a societal point of view?

What if you have foreign relatives from eastern Europe where these kinds of attitudes are still more prevalent and accepted? Especially if they're of an older generation, over the age of 50, and that's simply the worldview they were raised with?

The thing is, in the Western world and especially much of the US, in the last decade or so, there has been a tendency to look at people who harbor these views in a very one-dimensional way, as if as soon as someone expresses those kinds of opinions, they're just dismissed as these evil, reprehensible subhumans who are beyond any hope of redemption and should just be ostracized permanently. In reality, these issues are more complex than that. I think it's still possible for people to otherwise be a good or decent person and still have backwards views at times. I know for a fact that these relatives I'm talking about are actually mostly good folks. They care about humanity in general and have gone out of their way to help others, make sacrifices for others, help their fellow man without questioning most of the time. In fact I've never seen them directly be racist or homophobic toward anyone. It's more like the things they say to us privately about others, and their expectation that we share these views to some extent. But I was raised in America and am from a younger generation, so I grew up with more accepting, broadened views (especially after college- I admit, like many I was not the most progressive person before that, growing up in a small town).

These people aren't completely stupid about it either; it's not like some redneck klan guy who just blindly hates, but they are more subtle or nuanced about it (they also hate Trump btw). On the racism front, they're actually not bad, and never had real issues when dealing with other people, generally able to act amiably. If anything it's more of a dismissive attitude toward some black and brown people while talking to other whites or family members, while at the same time acknowledging their strengths as well, and sometimes outright praising others like Asians for their industriousness. They've been around the world and traveled a lot too, and tend not to make judgments based on individuals but usually in broader more collective manners. Anti-Semitism, however, is more of a problem, but I wont' get into that now.

On the homophobia front though, it's worse. I don't really know what I can do here. In that part of the world people really look down on it, sometimes for quasi-religious reasons, other times just cause it ""feels wrong"" or is not normal human tradition. Bringing up the topic many just get viscerally angry and refuse to even discuss it, calling it disgusting, or even casually advocating violence and persecution against them (I'm not sure how many gays they even encountered personally in their lives). After a few years, I sort of managed to get them to admit that they don't really care so much what gays do in their private life as long as they don't do the pride stuff or act openly flamboyant. They think parades are a way to spread it to others, convince children that it's okay (as if it was a choice), and virulently oppose same-sex parenting. They also said they'd disown their child if they were gay.

So it's weird; on one hand you have people who are mostly genuinely decent in most aspects of their life and on the other they have these views that they don't seem to budge much on. I guess no one is perfect. How can I deal with this and try to convince them? Or should I even at this point? I feel like at their age they're pretty set in their ways.",22Oct2018,1
357,"Hi all, 

I'm almost 29 years old and I'm at the point where I'm finally acknowledging that the career path I've been following for the past 6 years is not for me. I've always suspected this, but I've been doing it long enough to know that I have very little passion for it and it's not something I see myself moving to a senior leadership role in. It's the type of industry (advertising) where you have to have a LOT of passion for the job in order to deal with long hours that get increasingly longer the more senior you are, low-ish pay, stressful demands from clients. I work with some truly wonderful people and I like them a lot, but my heart's just not in it. 

On the flip side, I have a side project I've been working on for the last 3 years that I'm VERY passionate about, and do work very long stressful hours for as well, even though I love it. The thing is, it's a creative project in the arts that will very likely never pay the bills. I'm fine with that, and will be happy even if I just break even every year. 

So right now I have a dilemma: I can't really turn my passion into a career, but I can't stay in advertising when I'm not fully committed to it. Creative types or people who are artists, writers, musicians, etc and don't profit from their art - what do you do for a full-time gig? Are they understanding of your side project? Is it strictly 9-5 (or however many hours that allow it to be a set schedule that doesn't fluctuate - advertising occasionally demands you start around 9-10 AM and work until midnight or later). I'm just feeling very stuck and I'm not really sure what to do. I live in an incredibly expensive city, so it's unfortunately not possible to get by on, say, a barista's salary.

But now he’s gone and I’m on my own, and I realize while he has memories and money and a future, I have.. nothing. I’m a blank piece of paper, and I’m ready to start my life. More ready than ever, I started talking to my family again and they already have a room for me so I need help now. 


I basically have 3 paths in my head: 


A. Join the military I thought about this when I first met my ex, all of his roommates were also in the military and they all seemed to be doing okay. It gets your head on straight, opens up opportunities and if I sign a 4 year I’d be out by the time I’m 26 with schooling opportunities and work experience. I know it’s not perfect, a lot of work, a lot of lonely nights and chances of being stationed somewhere I hate but.. maybe I need that type of stability. 

B. Just go to college, I held off on college for so long because I’m terrified of debt. I worked full time and did so just so I could afford a shitty apartment with an ex boyfriend. Let alone afford a full college degree? I had no car and also I DONT KNOW WHAT I WANNA DO. I have no idea at all, and I don’t want to go to college spend all this money then change my degree and all of that. But at the same time, college man. I’d have opportunities to make friends, feel my age for once, live with my parents and go to school like my sister did. And almost everyone has debt now and they still make it somehow and maybe I’d actually start enjoying my life knowing I had a future ahead of me. 


C. Social media, it’s weird because I could do this regardless of if I choose option a or b. But I want to make something clear. I’m creative, I’ve modeled, I cosplay, I had a somewhat okay twitch streaming channel. Everyone would always ask me for cards for shoots, to model clothes or collab. I really do feel like I have knack for talking on camera and to people. I’ve done a few live streams on things like periscope and musically and I get a ton of followers(hundreds).  IM NOT SAYING IM PERFECT AMAZING EVERYTHING. 

But my entire life I wanted to be on stage, I wanted an audience, I grew up watching YouTube, I made costumes with a passion and restless nights. And I’ve always had people ask me why I don’t do it for a job? Not like “aw your cosplays cute sweaty you should def post a YouTube vid or something” but people wanting to endorse me bigger cosplayers asking to take pics with me to post on their page. And maybe if I actually chased that dream some good would come out of it?

376,"I have a moral dilemma. A friend who I adore came to visit and we ended up having some very bad drama due to drinking. For privacy concerns, I will not divulge too much about the drama, but basically a party we both attended ended up going terribly wrong with said friend being kicked out - I tried calling a cab for us but this friend ran off into the night with a couple strangers he found on the street. This was after trying to drag them from the party they were no longer welcome to attend. This friend initially refused to come back despite my begging them to come back safely to my apartment and not hang out with random strangers from the city. Again, my friend is from a small town and I live in a bigger city. I was worried sick and thought something bad was going to happen. By 4 am, I was still pleading them to come back but they kept refusing. At this point, I couldn't sleep and ended up telling them to forget coming back and that I couldn't keep begging them (two hours of begging). I realize it isn't my responsibility to keep track of people, but this friend had ended up having their phone stolen and had to stay at a motel. Again, huge safety issue #1 and #2 I couldn't wrap my head around why this friend still wasn't coming back at 4 am. Come noon, they wound up on my stairwell steps and we had a big conversation about what had ensued the night before. I had cried for a couple hours due to sheer embarrassment of the bad situation that happened at the party he was kicked out of. I then firmly asked him to redirect his flight and go home. I can't tell if I have ended my friendship, if I was too harsh on them for how he was acting, or if I was correct in being worried so much. I have friends who are absolutely crazy but have never dealt with the feeling of being so responsible for someone else's well-being. What do you guys think? Is it too harsh to send someone home from a special planned trip or was I correct in holding up my personal boundaries? I was so scared sick I didn't know how else to act at the time and was furious about the situation. ",22Oct2018,1

379,"Important Context: I'm 19, Male, and in rural America.

I'm tired of living with my aunt and uncle (I was raised by my grandparents but they both passed away a couple of years back and my aunt and uncle took over there house because it was larger and it WAS in better shape than theirs. They lived across the street previously). They are the kind of people who live in constant poverty and refuse to do anything to escape it. They own 6 dogs, none of which are house trained and they don't clean up after them, they've let cockroaches take over the house and won't let me bring in an exterminator, they have big fancy furniture from a rent to own facility because ""I've worked long enough I deserve decent furniture"" even though they struggle to pay bills, they tell me that anything I suggest that is financially wise (listening to places like /r/personal finance, seeing financial advisers, etc) is bad, they are constantly trying to get me to get credit cards or to get things for the house in my name, my uncle is extremely abusive and lazy and is one of the ""you will respect me because of my age"" types and there have been several times me and him have nearly fought and I'm convinced that if we ever fight I will kill him in sheer rage for constantly demeaning me anytime I do anything positive in my life. In other words my home life is fucked. I could go on but I think I've painted the picture clearly enough.

Education wise I'm also pretty fucked, but not completely. I was put into alternative education when I was 7 because my bipolar disorder was misdiagnosed as assburgers and I was in that system until the 9th grade (when I forced my way into normal education, because even then I knew the system was trying to put me in the school to prison pipeline or kill me) so until then I thought that bullying people, racism and starting fights was what the cool kids did. In the 9th grade I had a close friend (girlfriend for 2 months, actually) who kind of set me straight. I just had a realization that I could actually achieve everything I achieved through fear and more through actually being a decent human being. I'd say by the time 10th grade started I was actually someone worthy of the title of human being. Unfortunately I didn't solve my authority problem (or give me realistic life expectations) and after not doing any homework for 8 months, getting suspended 5 times, and getting kicked out of several classes I was expelled for 2 years. I'm pretty smart (my I.Q. is 121) and I had always tended to study science and history on my own so when I was 17 I was able to get my GED ahead of my class graduating. I have a decent (but seasonal, being only 7 months out of each year) job for my age in an I.T. Management position at a large regional tax firm making roughly $1,500 a month working 10 hours a day 6 days a week, sometimes more (I'm salaried). I don't have my own car (though my aunt is letting me use one of hers), or any other place to stay. I don't have a criminal record and I only have one conviction on my motor vehicle record (I've had my license for 9 months) so I think I'm good there. I don't think college is an option for me as my math skills are probably somewhere around a 4th grade level (for reference, I tested college credit or college ready on every other subject on my GED test) and I only passed the math section via a complex combination of process of elimination since every question was multiple choice and at least 2 answers normally seemed absurd so between the 2 realistic looking option I had a 50/50 chance. I can't even multiply without a calculator and I have my doubts as to my ability to do multiple line additions, I'm pretty sure I lost basic subtraction skills in there too. I spent basically 4 years doing no schoolwork whatsoever so in the sole area I didn't maintain myself it shows.

My health isn't good either. Physically or mentally. I'm around 350lbs, I have constant joint pain, standing is painful after an hour or two, walking long distances is incredibly exhausting and I basically have no appetite control, I eat until I feel like another bite will make me throw up and then I'm hungry again 8 hours later. Mentally I'm constantly battling depression. Pretty much all of my close friends have abandoned me over the last year or so for no apparent reason even though I dedicate a large amount of time to being as helpful to my friends as possible and trying to be the perfect friend. Seriously, I'm the kind of guy who will stay up til 2AM consoling someone over skype for the stupidest little things. What have I done wrong? The more you suffer, the more you really care right? I don't ever plan to have kids or get married. I don't plan to get married because I don't think I'll ever find a woman that likes me which I don't understand because all these jobless pretty boys I see around are swimming in girls yet a supremely intelligent man such as myself with exceedingly high potential for optimal wages and the capability to provide a superior style of life is considered disgusting. Intelligent is what determines a humans value, nothing else. That is my firm believe. Maybe I believe that because I know that's all I have going for me? I don't ever plan to have kids because I'd rather spend $100 for performance parts for my car or a fancy meal than a crib or toys for a kid . Its a money thing, kids = less money = less physical belongings to enjoy which for me = less happyness. Maybe that's part of my problem? I equate money with happyness? I also have a motivational problem. If a goal takes more than a month or so to complete there is a good chance I will loose the willpower to keep it up. Writing is painful, walking is painful, every little thing in my life is painful due to this worthless flesh prison I call a body. It makes giving up the only option sometimes. There are days I can't even convince myself to get out of bed.


I don't even know what to do at this point. I see all these people I went to high school with driving around lifted pickups, to houses they own, with beautiful wifes in the passengers seat and it just destroys me. Where is the money and recognition I've worked so hard for? I've scrapped and fought for everything I have, why isn't it paying off?

I don't know what to do or where to start anymore. Advice, on anything. Preferably advice that doesn't involve shooting myself. Thanks.",22Oct2018,1
380,"I’m 20F and i’m in my second year of college. I deal with mental illness (depression, anxiety, ADHD, and BPD) which makes this whole college thing extremely difficult on me.

First semester of college i did poorly. I finished with a 1.2 GPA. I had severe depression and my anxiety was through the roof, so i stopped going to class and as you can see, the result was how i expected. Second semester i did well and raised it to a 2.1. I was proud of myself.

He has not really done anything and he is having the same problems as me.

Now here is the kicker. My company gave the following feedback to the agency where they hired me from ""Acertenay is hard working and very good in communication. However he is not senior enough to the level we expected for someone with his degree and experience level. We solved this by hiring a senior guy."" However the senior guy is not speeding me up at all. He is even slowing me down because I also have to help him now. He is having all the same problems that i had and even worse.

Coincidentally I made major progress in the last week(During the time they hired a senior guy) and this was all done by me. This was not due to the new guy because he is still learning(Yet the company thinks the speed has been double because they have two people working at the same job) . I was sitting next to an architect last week and he told me ""You did a good job with finishing the task and feel free to mention it in the meetings. We are dutch and we are used to being direct. You can mention that you did everything by yourself and its not because they hired a new guy. The new guy is still learning and it also slows you down because you help him a lot.""

387,"I originally posted this is r/relationships but I think i may get some good advice here...

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be VERY long, but I can't afford a therapist and I'm needing advice on what to do with this work environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

current setting: 

I work for a young residential interior design/construction company, started about 2 years ago. The company is doing very well and is very busy. Owner and I are the same age, late 20's, both with interior design degrees. His sister, the office manager/his assistant, is \~3 years younger. I come from a background of very corporate larger architecture firms, whereas this company consists of me, the owner, and his sister. The construction half of the company consists of 2 guys who work out in the field but dont really see them much. I'm really the first employee that they have hired that works in close quarters with the brother and sister, all day every day. I also only work part time until the new year (they cant afford me full time until then). Lastly, we work out of the owner's house. They also both are homosexual (not that it matters) and have DEBILITATING anxiety. I have not had many homosexual friends, not on purpose or anything, just happened that way. I also am not previously exposed to people with anxiety serious enough to require medication, which they do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previous job:

At my old job the work day was very flexible and as long as we kept in touch with our team, they didnt care if we got there at 8:30 instead of 8, needed to run errands, or take care of things as long as we worked at least 40 hours. They also never had a problem if we needed a day off, we just got it approved (it was always approved) and put it in the calendar. We worked meetings/etc around it, nbd. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation:

I've been working part time here at the place for about 4 months now and we just had our first blow up and I'm having a lot of feelings about wether or not this is a healthy place to be working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assumptions I made upon beginning to work here (assuming makes an ass out of you and me):

\-assistant/sister arrives to owner's house between 8:05-8:20, thus i assume its ok to do so as well. 

\-owner leaves to attend massages, chiropractor appts, facials, hair appts, etc, so i think its ok to take care of personal things too

\-both owner and sister/assistant take days off (at least 3 each so far since I started, also leaving me alone for at least 1 day), simply telling me when they wont be there, so i think its ok to take days off too

\-sister/assistant tells me that if a quarter goes well, the company will bonus out profits to employees and that it almost always happens, so i  assume i will get this too (upon going full time)

&amp;#x200B;

BOY WAS I WRONG

I know stress was building up because a couple projects arent going as well as we would hope, schedule-wise. However i feel like this is all handled in an attempt to be professional but completely missed the mark. 

&amp;#x200B;

The blow up:

I came  after 5pm on a day that i was not scheduled to drop off something (was working at my other job so couldnt come till after 5). I called my boss on my way there to ask if i could work later on friday to make up for a hair appointment i was trying to take (stylist was booked out until february, but had a last minute cancellation). Apparently he did not want to hear this news and flat out told me ""No, I dont approve of you taking time to do personal things during office hours."" I was completely floored, hence my observations of my coworkers above, and could only respond with ""oh.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I got to the house and he proceeded to tell me that he only gets me for 20 hours a week and therefore does not approve of shifting my schedule around and/or taking any days off. This was the first time I was hearing this news, since it was never discussed upon my hiring, at least no more than ""we'll just cross that bridge when we get there."" Knowing I needed only 1 day off before the holidays I informed him that I did not realize this and was needing XX date off. This royally pissed him off and said ""I dont approve and i can't believe I'm having this conversations at 5:30 when i have DINNER in ONE HOUR!!!"" So, we said we would talk about it when i came in to work and i left. 

&amp;#x200B;

We were supposed to meet 2 days later, but he pushed it 1 more day. I am not kidding that the amount of stress I was under caused me to lose 4 lbs from not eating. I have never been under this amount of stress for so long at any job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways fast forward to the meeting. We met as soon as I got there, him me... and his sister. Wasn't expecting a 2 against 1. Anyways, they went on to say that whatever they do (observations listed above) doesnt apply to me because he works 7 days a week and I dont know when his sister works when I'm not there.  They went on to say that I get zero days off while part time, I WILL be there at 8:00am on the nose, my salary for the next year will be the lowest one in the company, (lower than the sister/assistant who never went to college, but nepotism makes up for that i guess),  when i'm full time i will only be allowed 5 days PTO, and i will get zero bonus. They also do not offer any benefits. nada. They also went on to say that they have no plans to let me go, but naturally cannot guarantee that I will have a job in the new year because there is no way to know how the company will by the end of the year. This scared the shit out of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I wrong to be in a complete state of WTF?! 

&amp;#x200B;

That day they left all day to handle furniture with a client. I would update him on things I got done and he would answer all happy ""thanks!"" then that night texted me saying ""we are really happy you are working here and have no plans for you to not be here next year. You really are doing well and are happy you are part of our team.""

&amp;#x200B;

WTFF?!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so conflicted. I forewent an offer from a full benefits, great salary, full time job at government architectural design firm (not a fun design sector) for this residential part time job, under the impression they were hiring me full time in the new year. Basically, I'm choosing to work 2 jobs in prospect of having a full time job doing residential design (way more satisfying/fun) in the new year, in lieu of a steady well paying level job. But now all this drama happens and i'm sort of rethinking not taking that job offer, even though it would mean hating the work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this how startups always are? Are the long-term benefits of one day being a leader at this firm worth the drama and anxiety and MAJOR stress of being their first employee guinea pig? Are my worries of them not actually hiring me full time valid? or instead are they just going to fly off the handle every once in a while and I'll just have to ignore it, knowing it's all hot air? Is it worth putting up with being the only person that strict ""rules"" apply to? I'm so confused and torn. Please help.

  So around a month ago I had a one night stand and didn’t use protection, (very stupid I know) during I was highly intoxicated and it was bad sex and I actually found it hard to stay aroused and didn’t ejaculate, I understand a girl can still get pregnant if this happens by the way.

So after that night we kind of stayed in touch by text and I had decided I wasn’t that into the girl and she kept wanting to arrange to meet me for a date, I kept coming up with excuses and I think it was clear to her I wasn’t interested as one night she got drunk and started sending me abusive messages.

The next day she apologised and claimed the messages were sent by her friend I called bullshit and told her never to speak to me again and blocked her from contacting me apart from Facebook, we hadn’t spoke for around a week and she sent me a message request on Facebook and she is now claiming to be pregnant. I will attach an imgur link of how this conversation goes but I’m 90% sure she’s lying because she seems extremely unstable.

She states she is having the baby aborted and to try and catch her out I offered to go to the appointment with her but she refused, can you please try and give me your advice on what I should do next and wether you think she is lying or not?

401,"Let me clear up a few things first. This is not a cry for help or a plea for attention. I'm looking for advice on what aspects of my life should I change and how I should do it in order to improve my mental and physical health.
I'm a college student and I spend most of my day in college and travelling to college and getting back home. Obviously this puts a lot of stress, both mental and physical, but for now it's the only option I have. There's also a pressure to perform well (atleast better than others) academically because... reasons. My relationship with my family is idealistic but it's not extremely toxic and abusive and the same goes for other people around me as well.
I've tried the common advices that people give usually in situations like these such as reaching out, getting a new hobby, trying to learn a new instrument, etc. They have their effects but they've failed me in the long run. Also, I don't want to seek professional help because there's a stigma around mental illnesses (especially my family) and it would do more harm than good.

tl;dr
I need advice on ways in which I can improve my lifestyle that, in the long run, have positive effects on my mental health. 
Any and all help is appreciated.",22Oct2018,1

403,"*Long post ahead. Sorry :(*

Before anything else, let my first give you a background of my family, I come from a lower middle class famliy in a third world country wherein both of my parents are necessitated to work so that they could provide for me and my older sister. My mother works at an international company while my father works at a domestice one so basically my mother is away most of the time at about 10 months per year. The only parental presence we get is from our father most of the time. This is the way that it has always been for nearly 15 years already since my mother went abroad when I was just about 3. I don't really know my mother that much but every time she comes home, I feel like I know her very well already. She is a kind person and caring as well especially to me and my sister. She is the ""consoler"", per se, between the two and she NEVER ever swears and seldomly gets mad. My father on the other hand is the ""authoritarian"" between them and tends to uses vices (alcohol and smoking; although he did stop drinking alcohol already) and is very short tempered and aggressive when angry. He does love and care for us but he centers around as being the provider and he can be very stingy with money. For nearly 15 years he stood as both the mother and the father figure most of the time that is why I appreciate him for that. He soes have a soft side but tends to be rarely ""showy."" Their age gap is 11 years therefore there is a distinct difference between their priorities and personalities.

I recently found out that my mother has been having an affair with a man that she works with in her company. At first I thought of that it was just a very close friend but I soon learned more by going through of her stuff (I'm very nosy when it comes to belongings especially to those that intrigue me). 

My mother has two phones, one that she usually uses and we are able to use whenever we need to borrow from her like for texting and calling (My sister and I don't have a phone) and the other which she only uses for her ""business"" affairs. In short, I figured out her password and went into her phone when she was gone and I accidentally read a chat that she has with this ""close friend."" I was ""shocked"" to read it at first because I never expected this from my mother. There were messages that professed their ""love"" for each other and as well as n*des as well. What's more devastating is that this affair has been actually going on since 2005 and my mother went away at the year 2004. And recently, they've been planning to get hitched and divorce their respective spouses. My mother's family already knows about this and completely supports her (I read their cinversations as well). She's already been planning on filing for a divorce and plans to take both of my sister and me.

I don't have the courage to tell my father since he has a short temper and is very aggressive since he is already nearing the age of 50. I don't know what he would do if ever he were to find out about this since he is blinded by rage especially when it come sto heavy situations like this. My mom has only been home for a few weeks and I can't keep faking up a facade every time I converse with her. 

The problem is I can't seem to cope with this and I feel very desentized to this because I don't really know my mother a lot and I can't sympathize that with my father since he somewhat brought it to himself. Their relationship has always been this rocky and I could be able to understand where all this is coming from. What should I do? I can't seem to come up with what I should be feeling right now. I don't know if I should be angry, sad or what, I just feel numb. If you had experiences like this or any kind of advice can you help me?

My next door neighbor and I got into an argument with one another about three years ago.

He only moves the boat away when they start snow plowing and then moves it back as soon as the snowfall ends.

I live in a small subdivision consisting of smaller houses on less than .25 acre lots. This boat eclipses my entire house and is a huge eye sore to look at. I've spoken to state, county, and local police and while they all are in complete disbelief that he would do this they say that legally there is nothing that can be done to make the boat go away.

There's a huge issue though: Two of my roommates stopped talking to me almost completely. My dorm is a suite thing with two rooms of two... Anyway the kid I live with in the same room has completely stopped talking to me, and one of the kids in the other room has done the same. I said hi to him when we crossed pathes on campus and he just acted like i didn't exist.. I'm kind of nerd and they're less academic 'cool' types which is fine b/c you can live however you like, so maybe they just have no interest in talking to me... but we spoke a little bit before so I thought we were fine - one issue came up though: I was drinking at a party in a friends dorm and got caught when we were too loud by the RA.... My roommates were all there but didn't get noticed by the RA so they were fine. Eventually I had to do a light interrogation thing and when they asked who came I said my roommates but i said they didn't drink because I didn't want to get them in trouble but i also didn't want to seem like i was lying. - when I got back and told them that they seemed pissed and scared and I think that's when they stopped talking to me, but I'm not sure on the timeline. One roommate still does talk to me, we catch up with whatever ever couple days or so but were not like super great friends no problems i think though. My roommate has made no effort to say anything to me i think since and only responds in one word answers... I was like the weather's pretty warm this morning and he was just like 'k'....

413,"This post may be lengthy, I'll make sure to put a tdlr.

Basically, I set up a close male friend, let's call him B, with a close female friend, let's call her A, and since then my relationship with both of them has gone out the window. 

The reason for my fallout with them together is that A got too touchy with me at a party, got B to be like that too, I felt like they tried to take advantage of me while I was drunk and left the party we were at, saw A once after and I haven't spoken to her since.

After the above mentioned incident A told my best friend C that I was the one who started things when I know I didn't. So I lost my shit with her and called her out for that lie. That isn't the first time she's lied about me. A told B I told her he doesn't know his real mother, he lives with her and I've met her, so B got angry with me and fought with me because I apparently lied. I just took the blame, before that A told B she was older than she was and blamed me for that too somehow. And I'm sure she's told other lies I haven't caught her in too. 

Her relationship with B is also too codependent, whenever I saw one of them before shit hit the fan they were always together. This is a problem for me right now especially since I value my relationship with B and am considering saving it, I don't want anything to do with A. 

B hasn't ever done anything wrong to me besides what I mentioned above but he and I were both drunk, A wasn't. A always criticised my relationship where as B always supported me in it and actually likes my boyfriend, he even lent him a tiepin for my prom because the gold of the tiepin matched my jewellery for it. B is cool. A is not. Is there anything I can do to stay friends with B or should I stay away from him too? I'm someone that struggles to make friends so I value the relationships I have a lot. B has never done anything to me, besides when he got too touchy which he did apologise for as soon as he found out how pissed I was about it, unlike A, he nursed me back to a sense of normality after a depressive phase and I'd say his and my boyfriends efforts put me on track to where I am now. 

I miss his brutal honesty when I was a fuck up, his family and their support of me when I was a nightmare and refused to stay at home for a bit because I was fighting with my parents... But I don't miss his girlfriend and her influence on him. It was a close relationship where we knew each others families and had relationships with them too. I'm hesitant to just throw that away. 

Theres a post on my profile about what happened on the night and in the immediate aftermath of what happened when they tried to take advantage of me and how much I can't stand A.

415,"I need some advice as I’m struggling to cope with looking after my 60 y/o mother. 

I moved back home with my mum and her partner of 10 years earlier this year. In June, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. She had to have a major operation. She is now cancer free but her stamina is bad and she became very down. She has a full time high-pressured job and has found that a big struggle since going back after her illness. Then 3 weeks ago, her partner walked out on her. She found out he’d been having a 9 month affair with a younger woman. It was a huge shock and he left without explaining anything, taking all his things. 

She has been absolutely devastated. Because I’m living here I’ve spent most evenings since then picking her up off the floor. She says she can hardly breathe and is having panic attacks at work and is saying she’s too depressed to go on. She is unremittingly bleak and despairing and saying she has no future.

I’ve been really cut up about this all too - I was close with her partner too as he’d been like a surrogate father to me since my own dad died about 11 years ago. I think this has triggered some things for me too. I’m finding myself feeling incredibly anxious and upset in public and am finding it so hard to keep lifting my mother up every day. Her friends and family who have been around only seem to see her when she’s putting on a brave face, so it’s only me who’s taking on the full brunt of how broken she is. I’ve asked her to see a therapist and she says she will but is very private and reluctant to commit to it.

I feel that living here with her is really damaging my own mental health but she is leaning on me and I obviously can’t leave her on her own, nor would I want to. I want to help her get back on her feet again somehow. I’m sorry about the long post but am feeling at a loss and would really appreciate any advice. Thank you.",22Oct2018,1
416,"My whole life, I've gotten into these ruts where I feel unfulfilled if I'm not creating artwork of some kind. It's either the recognition of it, or knowing that someone (anyone, really) was impacted positively by something I made, I dunno. Maybe it's just having a tangible ""thing"" that I can point to as completely mine. Either way, I crave it. 

But like clockwork, the cycle's always the same. I start a new creative hobby that I'm positive is going to be my strength. I put in a good amount of initial research and effort. Maybe even get passable at it. But I sell myself short and stop as soon as things look wobbly at all, or I lack the work ethic to actually follow through it, honestly I don't know why they never go anywhere. 

When I was a kid, I'd make comic books, going for my own knockoff Captain Underpants or something, and I'd get really into it, but there's a stack of books under my old bed at my parents house and most of them are unfinished. From there it's all the same- creating video games, photography classes, writing novels, recently music has been my effort. It goes on, and on, and on.  

To pick apart the minutae of that specifically- I always wanted to play guitar, but my parents couldn't afford lessons growing up, so when I graduated college I gave it a go. Been a couple years now; I feel like I've learned all that you can from teaching yourself the basics online. I'd need a teacher to get *good*. Really want to get into songwriting though, because strumming the same chords of the same covers is getting boring and isn't fulfilling me like if I made an album or something. 

BUT, there's the blockade again. I was fine following a practice schedule and learning, but as soon as the ""expression"" piece comes in, well game fucking over I guess. 'I lack the skills or the ear for this, this sounds like shit, who'd even want to hear it'. You question your technical ability as well as your creative vision. Not only that, but I hate playing in front of anyone. Someone threw me a guitar at a bonfire this summer, and I should be able to rip that shit, but I just froze up and it was overall very embarrassing. Now that I'm at this stage with the instrument I find myself picking itself up less and less, and it fucking sucks. 

Why do I do this, and how do I fix it? Not even specifically the guitar part, as I dunno if I need to get super good at that to be happy- I just wanna find my niche, whatever it is. Bigger picture, what can I work on to get through it? ",22Oct2018,1

She suggested we try just a finger, which we did. My pointer finger had no problems going all the way in. She felt it and said it wasn't anything more than slightly uncomfortable. Two fingers was not a success though as she began to feel pain again. She rated two fingers as a 2/10 for how painful it was.

430,"My roommate and I seem to be close, he's more of a friend in fact, best friend maybe? Back in June is when we had first become physical. Not sexually physical, though. We had, out of nowhere, started to wrestle/play fight. It was fun, and new. I've never had that sort of interaction with anybody before. Ever since we moved in together, back in April, he'd lightly tease me, so there seems to have always been a sort of thing going on.

So, here we are, month of October, and we've started to wrestle, once more. We have even started to tickle each other. Just yesterday we had spent a good four or five hours in my bed, wrestling, while also playing video games. This seems to have become a daily occurrence, for us. Other residents within the house have commented on our seemingly strange behavior, while also teasing us, and hinting at a romance between the two of us.      

A good friend of mine thinks that there is a strong chance of him liking me. And I do to, though, I'd rather not ask yet. Due to him making use of sugar daddies for income, through sexual favors. He seems to be on multiple dating apps, as well. Mm, perhaps he may just be a hoe? His care for me seems to be genuine, though. Logically speaking, I can't seem to figure out how it is I like him, but I do. 

And it sucks because I feel completely torn, and jealous whenever he makes mention of any other men. Though, with him being my roommate, and a close friend, I don't feel that I can simply go about disregarding his presence here, in attempt to perhaps eventually ween myself off of the feelings that I've manifested for him, over the past few months. 

What ever shall I do?

431,"I will keep this short, my girlfriend told me a story about how she was raped by some guy she knew long before I met her, she told me this guys name and because it was such a vile and disgusting thing he did to her, I can never forget the kids name, plus his name is extremely rare (weird ass name) Also she never told anyone and never pressed charges. so anyways the other day I was on her phone trying to send an email to her professor (she let me do it) and while scrolling through her contacts his name was there, she still has his phone number. I didn’t snoop around so I don’t know if they text (highly highly doubt it) but his number is still there lmaooo wtf? So today I was in class and she was at work so I texted her “some girl in my class was talking about her rape experience and apparently she still has her rapists number and they are still friends” totally fake story just to see her reactions and she replied “smh girls” she doesn’t know I saw the dudes number, this happened like 2 weeks ago, but she told me about the rape long long time ago.

432,"Hi,

i own a small shop and work in retail for 25 years. I serve up to 300 customers per day and normally everythings fine.

But on 1or2 days a week I have to argue with real crazy, arrogant or just stupid people. As long as I was hired by a company it didn´t affect me that much, but as it is my store now, my whole evening is ruined and I can´t stop thinking about that person.

I can´t explain to myself why I can´t be happy about the 299 nice ones and bother about the one ´notsonice´.

I know its not that big problem, but if anyone has a tip, I would be grateful.

437,"TLDR My best friend (F21) keeps getting mad at me because I didn't introduce her to my (F21) boyfriend yet. I've been dating him for 2 months and I already explained my reasons for not introducing them many times. She essentially told me I acting like a bitch because I haven't introduced him to her. This is an argument that's going on for a few weeks now and yesterday everything blew up.

I feel like you need background on the situation to understand why I'm mad at her.
So I've dated this guy for 2 months and this is my first relationship in 4 years. Before that I've had a string of hookups, one night stands and friends with benefits. That explains to you why all of this relationship stuff is so new to me. Also I'm the type of person that doesn't let people in easily. I takes me time to get comfortable and start trusting a new person. My friend knows all of this since we've been best friends for 3 years and it took us almost a year to get there. 

Boyfriend invited me to his brother in-laws birthday party a few weeks ago where I met his sisters. He hasn't yet officially introduced me to his friends, I've only met members of family on that one party. ( That will be important to the story) I've introduced him to some of my not so close friends. Usually if I'm somewhere with him and we bump into someone we now, we casually make an introduction. Also we don't get to spend a lot of time together because we both work, usually opposite shifts with crazy scheduals, and we go to uni. That little time I get to spend with him I'd rather be alone with him than with friends and him. I didn't want any introductions in the beginning before I felt like I could rely on him and before I felt like this has some kind of a future. Basically, wasn't ready for that which is understandable in my opinion since we've been dating for quite a short period. Now I feel like I'm ready and I wanted him to meet my best friend at an upcoming birthday party we're all invited to.  My friend knows all of this but she has a problem with this.
Basically the friend is upset about not meeting the boyfriend since I met his family. She thinks I'm ashamed of her and hiding him. She also makes an argument that boyfriend could feel like I'm hiding him from people in my life since I met some of his people but haven't reciprocated to the same extend. He never said something like that to me nor shown signs of that and I made that clear to my friend. Also I explained to my friend that I don't want her to be coming to our date nights when we planned to be alone just for the sake of meeting him. She doesn't think these are valid reasons. Yesterday she again attackedme about this and also insinuated that I'm acting like he's just a hook up and she threw in some insults in. She also made a point that it's irrelevant to her if she meets him or not, he means nothing to her and is not an important part of her life. In her words only reason why she pressures me to the meetup is because she thinks he feels bad for not meeting anyone of my close friends and family. ( Family lives on other side of the country so meeting them is logistically hard to pull)

Long story short I’ve been unemployed for most of this year and been trying to stitch as much together as I can. My parents are ok with me being unemployed, but I’m not. They are overprotective and won’t let me get my license. I’ve had my permit for 2 years (expired last week) and been to two different driving schools. Both instructors told me I was ready to drive. When I went out with my parents they would nit-pick small things and tell me I wasn’t ready. I tried to play along with their game and wait until they were comfortable but it’s going on 9 months now. Even outside of this situation they won’t let me leave the house but complain about me always being in the house. They have a tracker on my phone to tell them where I am at all times &amp; won’t let me leave without it activate it. Sorry for the long wall of text, just needed to vent and seek advice. 

Tl:dr parents won’t let me get my license and my permit just expired",22Oct2018,1
442,"I work in an office that is in a converted house in a residential neighborhood (the business moved to this office about 20 years ago). The neighbor across the street is an Episcopalian Church (the church was there before the business moved in). The church parking lot is across the street from the church, directly adjacent to my office.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem we're having is with trees along the property line. On the church's side of the fence, they have a bunch of large ginkgo trees. These trees overhang onto the office roof. They drop leaves and smelly berry things onto our walkway and into our gutters. The office now has rats in the attic and the exterminator we hired (which cost my boss $275) says that the rats most likely got onto the roof and into the attic by climbing the trees and using the branches that touch our roof.

&amp;#x200B;

Up until 2-3 years ago, whoever the church landscaper was would keep the trees properly trimmed so there were minimal issues with debris ending up on our property. However, for the past 2 years, the trees are no longer trimmed or maintained, and because they're not being trimmed they've been dropping more and more debris on our side of the fence and onto the office. Even on the church's side of the fence there are large mounds of debris from the trees that haven't been removed. The exterminator said this debris provides hiding places for rats, and we have some suspicions that homeless people have been pooping and leaving needles and trash in the debris on the church side (the neighborhood is downtown so there are a lot of homeless people around).

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously my boss may have to just hire someone to trim the parts of the trees that hang onto our property, but that doesn't completely resolve the issue if they're not also maintaining the trees and removing the debris on their side of the fence. Over the past 2 years, people from our office have approached the church about this issue maybe 4-5 times. We've never spoken directly to the pastor, but we've spoken to people in the church office who say they'll pass the message along. We also sent a letter over a year ago about this issue. Nothing has changed except one time after we contacted them their landscaper started to clear the debris on their side of the fence but only cleared a small section and then never came back to clear more. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss wants me to write one more letter to the church to see if they will take responsibility for these issues before he spends money on a tree trimmer. What kind of tone should I take in the letter? I don't want to sound threatening or rude as my boss would like to have a friendly relationship with them, but it's not really fair that my boss has to keep spending money on problems that they're causing us. How should I approach this? If they ignore the letter, should I call code enforcement? Is there some sort of governing body for Episcopal churches in my area (kind of like a Catholic diocese) that I should report them to for being bad neighbors?",22Oct2018,1
443,"My parents have been in an explosively abusive relationship for 30+ years and they're finally ending it - or were supposed to be. My dad has lived in a trailer in the front yard for 5 years instead of in the house with my mom, to give a picture of their marriage. My dad is an okay person sober, but he's a nightmare drunk. He ranges from violent and terrifying to threatening and attempting suicide (which he's done multiple times) in a drunken stupor, always leaving my mom to pick up the pieces. I feel terribly for him because I know he must be in a lot of emotional pain, but he's held a gun to my mom's head before when drunk and I'm terrified that he'll kill her this time. Now that she's getting ready to move out and head across the country in 6 days (like from one end to the other), he's gone off the deep end. She's moving, he's staying. He got drunk and destroyed property at his work, so his boss doesn't want him back, and he got into an accident where he had to be airlifted to a hospital for head trauma, but all of his brain scans and tests have come back normal since the accident (two days ago). But, he has been talking nonsense (he has been making absolutely no sense, mushing his words, forgetting what he's talking about, completely jumping subjects, etc.) and he refuses to sleep and hasn't slept since the accident. My dad's AA group and my mom worked together to strip his trailer of alcohol and weapons (he has a ton of guns) and he's been calling my mom incessantly from his trailer to tell her he wants his guns back. I talked to him on the phone last night and he was making no sense, forgot who he was talking to multiple times, and said some really concerning things about wanting to kick people's asses and such (no one in particular, he's just raging and angry). He hasn't drank since the accident as far as anyone can tell, and they've been trying to monitor him, but he is acting so weird. My thoughts are sleep deprivation or a total mental breakdown. He has dealt with mental health issues his whole life and is on medication. Since the accident, he can't keep a train of thought and is being aggressive and forgetful and overall strange. He made some lewd comments about me on the phone last night that were so inappropriate for a dad to say to his daughter, and it's like I don't even know who he is right now. I'm scared for my mom. To make things worse, she took her van into a mechanic to check it out before she travels 3,300 miles in it and the mechanic said there's no way it'll make it without $3,000 of repairs. She doesn't have hardly any money as it is because he was supposed to help pay for her move (this was ab amicable split before he started drinking again). 

I'm a recent college grad and only have $800 in savings since I started working, and I live 18 hours away. I'm in my first 90 days of my job and cannot take time off of work. I don't have a car that will pull her trailer of stuff, so even if I could take time off and go get her, I can't help her move. I feel so helpless. 

What can I do to help her? My mom has taken my dad to the emergency room and they can't commit him because he won't admit to being suicidal to anyone but my mom, but he hasn't done anything illegal, so we can't have him arrested (which sounds horrible, but we just need him to be supervised somewhere where he can't procure drugs or alcohol and where he can sober up). Is there anything I can do to help her? To help him?",22Oct2018,1
444,"I met my new friend about 5 months ago.
We have one common class and that's where we first met. After a couple of conversations I learnt that we have not much in common apart from our c.s. class, love of sarcasm and our interest in gaming. We are in fact rather contrasting , She's  a foodie ,doesn't enjoy reading as much, listens to mainstream  pop and has plethora of friends while I'm pretty much the opposite, im a typical introvert. Okay getting to the issue. 
Firstly, When she's with me she likes to pull me away from our group and make me feel all special by telling me lovely things but then again if her other friends from her major are present it's like I'm a stranger and I'm  left with no one as I'm already separated from my group so most of the time I'd have to go home. 
Secondly, She'd tell me she'll do something with me and then completely disregard it like she never promised me anything. When I confronted after a good 3 weeks of her totally failing to keep her promise she told me she had to do something on that with another friend, said that she was really sorry and promised to not lie to me anymore although she could have just told me the reason without me having to confront her.
Thirdly, the thing that bugs me the most is that everytime she asks me for help I help her but when I ask her help for anything she'd tell me she'll help as soon as she can but not once has she helped me. It's like she has a short term memory loss or something, I am truly hurt by her behaviour towards me.
This is really taking a toll on me because I believe that friendship is a 2 way street or is this person even looking for a friendship with me at all?
I'm totally confuse ,this person is running hot and cold on me and I can't be certain of anything because when she's hot she's like an angel but when she's running cold I'm merely a stranger and won't even reply to my text.
The reason my writing this is that when it comes to friendships I'm just a toddler, I don't have much experience and I do not know that to make of this.
Is this person just self absorbed?
 Am I reading too much into this?
since we've been friends for only 5 months are my expectations unrealistic and need to fix myself?
Is our difference in personality the cause of all this?
What should i do to fix this?Is it worth fixing?
How do I go about this?

This is a problem in all aspects of my life. I find it hard to know what to do with myself and dating can be hard. I often find myself thinking that I don't have much in common with people but in truth I just don't have much that I _could_ have in common with anyone.

457,"Hi everyone!

I'm using a throwaway, yadda yadda. I know this is a fairly specific question, so I hope I'm on the right sub. 

I'm 26 years old, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 in 2010. I also have PTSD. I was unable to attend University until 2016 due to my illnesses. I think it is very important that I emphasize how sick I was; I was unable to drive a car, take a shower, manage my medications, or feed myself. I was also completely agoraphobic.

I am obviously in a much better place, and now I live independently. I'm graduating from college in May with a double major, and I couldn't be more proud of myself.

So, here is my issue. I'm currently mired in the process of applying for graduate school. My top two choices are in the UK, and I have a pretty good shot at admission. I currently reside in the U.S. and I would be overseas for at least six years while I obtained my doctoral degree.

So, these two schools are asking directly on the application whether or not I have a longstanding mental illness. I am very afraid of being discriminated against due to my bipolar disorder. When people meet me, they can't tell that I have a mental illness, and if they find out, they are usually surprised. However, earlier in my life, when I was very unstable, it was impossible not to notice I was ill (underweight, self harm injuries, occasionally psychotic, dirty, etc). I have permanent scarring all over my arms that I attempt to hide in professional environments, but that is the only thing about me that gives away my history of severe illness. I am very, very apprehensive about disclosing my illnesses to anyone, especially if given the option not to disclose. There were occasions when housing complexes or doctors would turn me away, most likely because of my disorder.

My instinct is not to disclose, but the application is set up such that I must choose ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""prefer not to answer."" If I choose ""no,"" I've withheld information, but choosing ""prefer not to answer"" strikes me as the same as just disclosing.

So, TLDR; do universities in the UK discriminate against those with serious mental health diagnoses? Should I disclose on my applications? Help????",22Oct2018,1

463,"Since Thursday, I've been getting headaches in the back of my head, sometimes it moves to the top of my head, it feels like a throbbing or pressured feeling back there. With the headaches, my mind gets foggy, it's hard to concentrate, I get frustrated and confused very easily. Then after the headache (can last from 5-30mins) I get very tired/exhausted and I have to take a nap to really 'normalize' but even after a nap I still feel pretty mellow. 

I don't know if I should consult a doctor about this because it does sound pretty random. I haven't hit my head on anything, I get all my vitamins, eat healthy, walk everyday, stay hydrated. The only thing that might be the problem is my sleeping habits which I've started to fix by taking melatonin (Idk if that's the cause) and so I get like 8hrs of rest at night, plus a nap in the day and I'm not stressed/don't feel stressed.

466,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 21 yo, male, worked as a sex worker, completed an BA of Science at the age of 19, founded a company after I dropped out of my masters program and on top of my company revenue I earned a huge amount of money by cryptocoin speculation.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two true friends in my life, who really understand me and I feel disconnected from everybody else. Don't get a wrong image here. I'm social, I smile with the guys, but deep in my heart, I feel that nobody of them really understands me.

&amp;#x200B;

As a sexual late bloomer with 17 I've been with two girlfriends so far in my life. Whenever I date girls I face the problem, that I'm physically attracted to girls between 16 and 22. But as hard as it even feels to connect to somebody of my own age, it renders nearly impossible to ever establish a true connection with a girl in the age range I'm attracted to.

&amp;#x200B;

A short note to my appearance here, I've been blessed with never aging genes, so I still pass as a 16 yo old and sometimes I get flirty looks from 14yo girls, which scares me, because I perceive them as children, not as possible girlfriends.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, since my sexual desire didn't found satisfaction for a long time, I started to meet prostitutes, but while I feeled a short release, I wasn't able to feel a real connection during sex either. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started meeting high class escort girls, professionals at creating personal bonds in a short time and had several  deeply satisfying dates. I can talk with them and don't face any judgement. Also the sex ist technically extremely good.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I can't find a final solution in this. We're talking about 450€/2hrs upwards hiring these professionals, so this is a pretty costly operation on the one hand.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand do I miss somebody to be part of my life, after saying goodbye to the escort girl and lying alone on my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so helpless in this regard. I don't see any solution coming up. I tried focussing on my business only for a while and ignoring desires for intimacy and sexuality as a whole. But it didn't work out in the long term.",22Oct2018,1
467,"I'm homeschooled, I don't learn anything whatsoever, I'm basically teaching myself everything.

I dropped out of highschool when I was eleven, I was suicidal, depressed, all of my friends went to a different school, I was questioning my gender, I was questioning my sexuality, I was being bullied, my next door neighbour was bullied out of helping me and showing me around, I lost my best friend, everything was all happening at once, so I dropped out.

Now I'm fourteen, I've pretty much been living in isolation since then, I spent the majority of my time completely alone in my room. I haven't really got any one to talk to, I'm worried about my future, I kind of want to go back to school, to a new school.

Thing is, the only school my mum will let me go to is a small one, it has about 20 people in it. I can't do small buildings. I prefer big buildings, big crowds, so that I can blend in, so that no one will notice me, I can't even go into small shops! Also, the kids there are genuinely stupid, I went for one lesson, try it out, I kept my head down, I didn't talk to anyone at all, the teacher forced me to do the work, even though the head teacher said I didn't have to, and the spelling shit they were doing were just retarded, they three/four letter words, the ''Hardest'' word was 'Universal'' Excuse me? I'm SO far above that, it was year one level! I get the whole ''Starting you off easy.'' Thing, but I just felt insulted. They were literally given the answers to the math questions too (I was forced to do the work, and I messed it up because I couldn't think straight, because it was my first time there, and the teacher was trying to force me to go straight into things, when I was specifically told I could take my time, I messed something up THAT easy!) It was such a horrible experience that I just can't, won't go back there.

Also, I'm transgender, I'm terrified of going back to school and the teachers or students misgendering me, and bullying me for it. I've never done that before, I've only talked to family since I came out, and even some of them misgender me. Also, wearing a binder that long EVERY DAY? Can I do that? I hate wearing binders with a passion, but I prefer it over gender dysphoria, to wear a binder for hours every single day...That'd be exhausting. The binder I have doesn't even bind very well, none of the binders I've had have binded well enough for me to be comfortable in public, and it's not like I'm old enough to just get surgery.

I'm just so...Isolated. I want to be around people, but nice people, there's no way for me to do that. Would I be able to handle school? I don't know. I want to, but could I? I used to be so scared that I'd fucked my life up when left, and I got depressed over the fact I was missing out on friends, and on learning, but I'm used to it now, I'm used to being alone, I'm used to teaching myself things, it's been like this for a few years, would it really be wise to change it?

I don't even understand how I'm feeling anymore, I'm sad, and I'm...Lost...And lonely, but it's different than that...I...Don't know...

He is able to see every transaction and deposit made onto his card and has been needing her to transfer him his savings money to afford basic necessities. 
Over time, the amount of deposits has equaled to around $405, but in his most recent observation of his mother's account, the money on her account was equaling around $600.  He should have at least $1,000 of his own money on that account and he knows that for a fact.  
When confronting her about the potential of her not protecting his money, she vehemently denied all accusations and said that she deposited more than what she actually had. He is sure she has been taking from his savings.

490,"This is kind of a rant

I hate my school right now.

Ok, I don't hate everything about it. I'm a freshman and these past two months have sucked. I was scared as hell before coming to college. I'm shy, introverted, but I'm the opposite once I'm actually good friends with someone. Getting there is the hard part. My fears came true once I got to school. It was hard to make friends and I spent a lot of time alone. I've made some friends and joined some clubs, but I don't ever specifically hang out with a group or anybody, I'll sometimes eat with one or two people I know, but even then it isn't frequent. The friends I have made feel fake, and lately I've just given up on trying to meet new people. Everyone seems adjusted into their little groups at this point. I've even kind of lost contact with some of the people I do talk to, although I'm trying to fix that. I just feel like this school is too small, and I don't connect with many of the people here.

It's halfway through the semester and I think it's past the adjustment phase for me. I don't like it here. I want to go to a different school, but that's scary as hell too. I already feel like I made the wrong decision once, what if I do it again? There's no redo after that. What if it doesn't even help me? I'm partially the reason I don't have many friends. I get scared and social stuff drains me really fast. I don't mind being alone a lot, but it's all the time now. I feel like I've shut myself out. Going to a new school might not change that, and I'd have the struggles of adjusting all over again.

I have a school in mind that I'd be going to, but I don't know if it's just impulse. One of my siblings transferred there and loves it. I'm close with them and would be able to see them often, but I feel like I depend on them too much. I feel like I'd be picking the school because of them, but I can't think of any other good schools. This one is a good option for me. It's close enough to home, it's cheaper, and they have more music activities and major/minor options. It also has thousands of more people than my school. I really like the campus, it seems much nicer than my current school. From what I've been told, the people there are more like me, but I don't know if that's even true. All things considered it's probably my best option.

Now I have to research the shit out of this school while simultaneously handling my studies and trying to improve my social skills/relationships before I leave. I'm scared I'm going to just check-out and isolate myself to my room for the rest of the semester, just waiting for break so I can switch schools. I can't let that happen. My family is on-board with me switching if I put in the effort to make sure it's what I want. I don't know if it's really what I want. I don't think I can just drop out of college, it's not really an option for me, but I don't want to be miserable.

This semester has amplified any anxiety/depression I've had. I've been told to see a professional, but I feel like I'm always really busy, or that it wouldn't help. These two months have been some of the worst in my life, which I know is ironic considering how fortunate I am to be able to go to a nice college in the first place. I'm in such a weird limbo-feeling right now, but I think I definitely need to transfer. I don't think I could do another semester at this school without a tank to my grades and mental health. There's so many variables involved with this and it's just like being in high school and worrying about picking the right college all over again.",22Oct2018,1

So my supervisor takes care of the problem, and it's all water under the bridge. I did not get in trouble and was told I'm not at fault.

Okay. Now a month later crazy customer comes back. She starts doing the same thing to me, and I immediately call over a supervisor again to handle the situation. I said nothing further to her other then when she asked me for a sample of coffee I told her ""One moment please"" and went to grab our walkie talkie to call my super, in which she starts going off the handle screaming at me. My supervisor shows up and she's screaming that I'm ""mentally unstable"", ""have serious mood problems"", ""am a devil worshipper because she wears a nose ring"".... Okay. My supervisor takes care of the problem and she goes about the store shopping. I am informed again by my supervisor AND store manager that I am not in trouble, and they asked me if I was going to be fine. I informed them I was okay, I just had some shopping to do in the store (it's the end of my shift).

I go about my shopping, and informed my security guard that I'm having a problem with a customer. She is now following me around the store, and my security guard finally pulls me aside to inform me of this. He's now trailing behind me to make sure I am okay. I go to checkout, and now I head to lane 5. She's clearly standing and waiting in line of lane 1, and sees me go to lane 5 and now walks over there to wait behind me. In which our head cashier (also aware of my situation), purposely pulls her to a different register to ring her up. At this point I have our store security escort me out to my car and I go along my merry way. Still a little irked about the whole situation.

Because of the many medications the doctors warned her to take care of her health, otherwise it would affect her organs, but during the past years they diagnosed her with diabetes and high blood pressure, so now she needs to take even more medicine to control all that, and because of that sometimes the many medications don't work together, affecting her in one way or another.

We convinced her to stop working 6 years ago, and we been helping her with things she can't do alone, but sometimes she has told me that she feels like she's just a burden for us, I try to cheer her up and just avoid talking about that, thinking is just something that she will forget. 

Early this year I was getting to much pressure in my job, and I have the bad habit of taking my frustration to my house, to my sister and my parents, so it was starting to affect them. During those times of stress my mother told me that she didn't felt good, that she would prefer to die due to an organ failure and not feel anything than to wait and suffer the pain that she know the arthritis is going to cause her. That's when I realized that I had to change some things, and my job wasn't going to help me in that front, so I saved some money and quitted a few months ago and I been helping her in the house in what I can.

Two weeks ago, she was diagnosed with depression and they gave her more medication to help her. But even with that she would cry everyday out of nowhere, she never does it in front of us but I know she does. My grandmother has been staying with us since last week, when she heard how her daughter was, and my mom seems to be a little bit better, but she will cry from times to times.

I have been planning to move to another city for a job offer that my help with the finances of my family, and maybe afford my mom to pay for private healthcare, because where I live they only treat you whenever they want. But knowing that my mom will feel sad if I leave is making me doubt, and if I stay, the jobs over here don't pay enough for a better healthcare and I don't even know how can I help her staying here. So, I don't know what it would be best.",22Oct2018,1
498,"I’m in a class of 150-200 people that’s supposedly graded on some sort of bell curve, so my grade is partially dependent on how others do. Admittedly, the last couple of weeks I haven’t been doing amazing in there (I’ve been shooting around an 80%, which is not desirable in terms of how others are doing), but it sucks when I see everyone around me using their phones on the quizzes while I’m in the minority that feels that doing so is unethical. 

Anyways, on the test that is worth something like a quarter of our grade, the guy next to me had his phone between his legs and was using it for the entire duration of the exam, despite the top rule on the board in front of the class saying that all phones should be off and away during the exam. I noticed him talking about how he was going to use his phone during the exam to his friend next to him, who were discussing the exam as it was going on. This is partially the fault of the professor, since one can’t possibly expect him to be attentive to all the students. His enforcement of his policies is extremely loose, which is perhaps the main reason students do cheat. Anyways sorry for the little rant, and thank you for reading.

500,"I'm not sure where else to post this, so I've posted it here. 
Recently my mum discovered my instagram, where I enjoy posting pictures of myself. In some of them I'm wearing only a bra and undies, and she says she's disappointed about it. She said she's done everything to preserve my ""radiance"" and she expects me to have more ""self worth"".

I used to just accept that if someone dresses ""slutty"", they lack dignity and self worth as well, but now that I've thought about it, I don't know WHY exposing more skin or wearing tight clothing lowers self worth. I am genuinely wondering why my mum is so disappointed (I'm too scared to ask her so I thought I'd ask y'all why you think people might think this way). How would posting pictures like I have done differ from posting anything else you wanted to show off (your fitness routine, music, or artwork) on social media?

Just need advise as I’m worried I’ve made a bad decision yet a lot of people saying I have nothing to worry about. ,22Oct2018,1
503,"My boyfriend also lives here with me. We all got this house together, roommate A and my boyfriend of one year. But me, boyfriend, and A all lived together about 4 months before getting this new house. Then after about 5 months in our current house I moved my friend in with us too. So we have roommate A, roommate B,  and boyfriend. We also have one dog and A has one dog. Two altogether both shed hoards of fur. 

So basically before B moved in I was doing all the cleaning. 100% of it. No one helped me, and I've talked to my boyfriend numerous times about it and before we got together I explained to him I grew up in filth and was sick all the time and I have a horrible allergic reaction to cock roaches, if they touch my skin it flairs up. I used to think I had bed bugs until I had an exterminator come in and tell me it was just roaches. 

So of course he swore up and down he was a clean person. He doesnt leave any messes, and if he does dont yell at him just show him how I'd like him to clean it up. So okay that was fair. He lived with me in my apartment, we didnt have our dog yet, and he basically lived up to his word. 

Since we moved in our house now everyone stopped cleaning. Boyfriend just makes messes and leaves food out or hides it in the microwave and completely destroys the kitchen and our room. 

I also paid the entire down deposit and first months rent by myself to move into this place, which is a  really really nice house. I bought the living room furniture, I bought the laundry machine and dryer that the house hold uses, i bought the pots and pans, vaccum, mops, dishes, soaps, trash cans, basically everything aside from the kitchen table. 

And before B moved in I used to clean up after everyone. All the common areas, our bathrooms, clean dirt off the walls from the dogs, I'm the only one that does dishes, ect. If it has to do with chores I was doing it . To be fair A doesnt leave too much of a mess and he never cooks. So it's mostly generating from the dogs and my boyfriend. So I cleaned it up. Then B moves in and it's like having two of my boyfriends. They both destroy the kitchen and their bathrooms. 

So now I have to clean up after 4 people and two dogs. So yeah I started complaining, to everyone. Because these messes arent even mine that I'm having to pick up. And I work practically the most hours at a physically demanding job 6 days out of the week. The only person who works more is A. Who really isnt a problem when it comes to cleanliness in the first place. 

B gets tired of me complaining and tells me my house is always flithy anyway and to get over it and stop talking shit. A feels bad for me because I think out of everyone hes the only one that sees how much I do exactly. So A suggests we make a chore list so that everyone has one chore to do in the duration of a week. And I get excited and am totally for it. So we give my boyfriend and B the easiest chores. Boyfriend takes out trash and cleans up large peices of trash and B vacuums and sweeps  the living room and kitchen, A has to mow the lawn, I do dishes. We also made monthly chores for everyone I have to clean out the fridge, B has to mop, A has to clean off the walls, and boyfriend has to dust. So B and boyfriend have the easiest chores. Everyone agreed to the chore list and we were also going to start have meetings once a month.

The first week was okay everyone kind of did their chores, B still bitched about it and said that somehow it wasn't fair. Skipped sweeping. 

Well the chore list has been in place for two months going on three next week. Aside from me no one has done the monthly chore, B only vacuums like every two weeks, boyfriend will only take the trash out once a week even if its overflowing, A only mows if the grass is up to your knees. 

Everything is getting flithy again and here I am doing everyone's chores. 

On top of that for the last month both B and boyfriend haven't gone to work. Boyfriend switched jobs and starts tomorrow, B faked sick and called off work and they said she couldnt come back until she has a doctors note and she took a week and a half to get it then the note said she couldnt go in for another two weeks. So they've both had an entire month off. 

So I'm stressed the fuck out and I want to move out. I feel like no one respects me then today me and the boyfriend were talking about it and I said I'm just going to stop talking, he said what if our kids end up being messy too, then I said well im just not going to talk then he said good at least you'll stop being such a bitch. 

I feel like it's my fault for always complaining about it but then on the other hand I feel like everyone is 26yo+ and should know how to pick up after themselves. I'm stressed out and dont know what to do. If I leave I cant get my deposit back because I know they'll continue to wreck the house and other wise my boyfriend is a good boyfriend and I know itll mess up our relationship. I feel very helpless right now. 

TLDR; 2 roommates + bf + 2 dogs and no one cleans except me, made a chore list everyone agreed on no one follows it. I want to move out but also feel guilty about how I react to no one cleaning ",22Oct2018,1

508,"So I guess a little backstory is in order. 

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up wasn't the best. My parents were never married or together around the time I was born (1996). For about the first year or two of my life, I lived with my mom while my dad was off somewhere else trying to further his career. We ended up moving to a town that I live/d in for 18+ years now. Around the time we moved there, my dad moved to the same town to be with me and my sister whenever he could. That's when custody of us became an issue. A plan had worked out to where we would be with our dad for school days, and with our mom on the weekends. Over time, that plan eventually deteriorated, and my sister and I would bounce back and forth between the two of them for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the time between 3rd grade and Graduation of High School, my mom would move frequently from being unable to hold the rent on the apartments. Between her and my dad, we were able to keep going to school, but we were anything but stable. From my perspective at least. As Sophomore year came to a close, my dad lost the house that he had had since he had moved there, and my mom was almost living out of her car. We struggled through that, but made it through. Unfortunately, all those years of struggle would affect all of us. My sister has Depression, my mom looks older than she should, and my dad seems to have gotten the same stress aging. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, around the same time that we lost what I consider my childhood home (Sophomore year), I started getting pretty bad. So much so that I had to be put in a hospital for 2 days. Not for rage and aggression. Nothing like that. I ended up being diagnosed with Manic Depression. I wasn't the kid who would act out, I was the kid who would shut down and just stop living. I had already thought about dying around and before that time, but it ended up getting worse and worse. The idea of dying seems nice because it fixes a lot of things for my family. Monetarily of course, but I'll get to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suicide isn't even something I consider too seriously. It just sounds nice to not be a burden to my family. It's on my mind so often that it's just become a part of my personality, and I use humor to get some joy out of it. Manic Depression is just the beginning. I've been looking for a doctor because I need to know if I have autism. I was never looked at as a kid, and these last few years have had me questioning the things I do, say, and think. Problem is, I'm an extremely timid person, going outside puts me into a state of panic, and I'm living with my dad in a different state now. Why does that last one matter? My dad kind of mistreated me and my sister when we were kids. My mom is the only person who takes my depression seriously. She wanted to help me, but my dad took me away to try and help me get better. To be fair to him, he isn't as....""hands-on"" like he used to be. I'm still worried whenever he raises his voice for whatever reason. That alone is enough to put me in a state of panic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I could go on, but I feel like there's already too much here to be annoying to some readers who go through this subreddit, so I'll just get to the reason I'm writing this post. 

I think it'll be a while before I actually truly consider suicide as an option, but the reason I'm getting to that point is because I've come to a realization that I am a burden to my family. Financially, since I'm unable to get a job and give back to my family, they have to waste their money on me in order to feed me and clothe me. If I was out of the picture, they could use that money to further themselves. I'm not going anywhere in life, and I'm not going to be lucky enough for a big pile of money to fall into my lap. For my family, it's actually the better option. One less mouth to feed, one less person to worry about. They could go on to do the things that they want to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other side of this feeling that has been stuck to me, I've been looking for a doctor or a clinic that accepts people like me, but I don't have the money to pay for evaluations, tests, etc. Even if I were to get the tests, those would also be a waste of money because I would still need to pay for treatment and maybe more if my assumptions are right. I've reached out to maybe 10 different doctors, only a few of which cared enough to message back. One didn't even really help me out with information, they just said that their website isn't a platform for email counseling and gave me the number for the suicide hotline, which I can't even call because I don't have phone service because I don't have money to pay for phone service. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything is just one big giant mess, and I don't know where to go from here. Sorry to those who wasted their time reading this. I'm not even sure if posting this is gonna help, but I've exhausted pretty much all options. Any help is appreciated.

509,"Tl;dr: my younger brother beat on my head until I was about to pass out. It gave me a pretty nasty lump. I was chewed out by my family for provoking it, instructed that I needed to lie about why I had the lump on my head, and now there’s threats of trying to have me committed for overreacting. 

For some background, my younger brother is 18.  He’s been a wrester since middle school. He’s pretty good. And he’s really really strong. Way stronger and bigger than me. I’m not athletic. Lately, he’s been having issues. He’s not doing as good as he wants to in wrestling and college is stressing him out. He’s been throwing lots of tantrums where he runs through the house and finds a space to lay spread eagle and just silently protest whatever is wrong in his mind at the time. He’s been checked out before and has no special needs. He’s also been to therapy before but didn’t commit so he dropped out after a few sessions. 

Yesterday, he did one of these tantrums. I tried to talk to him. I sat down by him and tried to comfort him, but he wasn’t having it. I got more serious. I told him he won’t do well in college or hold down a job if he acts like this. He turned on his side to face away from me, so I tapped him on his shoulder and said, “I’m still trying to talk to you. Don’t be rude.”  He did not like that one bit. 

Next thing I know, I’m on my back and he’s laying into me with his fists and elbows. I try to hold him off but he’s too strong. It was the scariest situation in my life. I was so powerless and I feared for my life. I started fading. My vision was going blurry. I finally call out to my dad for help. He’s not stronger than my brother but he is stronger than me. I didn’t initially call out of fear that my dad would be angry with me. My dad shows up and my brother chooses to stop and gets up. I’m having trouble explaining what happened because my head is fuzzy and my mouth is kinda swollen. I try my best to explain.  

He’s not having it. My mom shows up and she’s not having it either. I’m getting chewed out for trying to aggravate him. I’ll admit I should have let them deal with my brother instead of trying myself. But they don’t wanna deal with him. He’s not in trouble. I am. At this point I start crying because I’m just so scared and stressed.  They belittle me and say, “you just had a fight with your brother. It happens all the time with families. It’s no big deal. Stop overreacting.”  I say I’m gonna go spend the night with some friends or something just because right now, I don’t feel safe. They don’t like that. They beg me to stay and tell me if anyone does see the swollen lump on my face, I need to lie and say I just tripped. Nobody can know what happened, they say. 

I pack some things and get out of there. I go spend the night with my girlfriend. The whole time my mother is texting me about how I’m overreacting and that it’s my fault. She thinks I intentionally wanted him to beat me to prove a point and manipulate her and dad. That was not my goal. My mom goes so far as to say I need to be committed because I’m clearly crazy and delusional if I think this is an issue. I ask what’s happening to my brother, because if I’m in this much trouble, surely he is too. 

No, he’s not. They just want to make sure he’s emotionally okay. He’s taking a day off college to recover emotionally from what I did. I am supposed to come home now and try to make it up to him for what I did. 

I tried talking to other family members. I told my older brother (who lives far away) what happened and he told me I’m crazy and overreacting.  Same thing from my aunt and uncle and grandparents. 

Am I crazy? Am I overreacting?  If I’m not, what can I do?  Can I even do anything?  I don’t have enough income to move out thanks to student loans. I’m dreading going back home but I know I pretty much have no choice. What can I do?  What should I do?  ",22Oct2018,1

512,"My biological father is a convicted pedophile. When he was convicted, my step mother divorced him and took my half siblings with her out of state. I cut ties with that side of my family about 7 or 8 years ago. She was the least crazy on that side of the family. 

Last Friday my Mom got a letter in the mail from my Ex-stepmother asking me to contact her. She said that my ""siblings shouldn't have to suffer because of what (insert pedophile name here) did. Rangeralex92's brother looks up to him still.""

Like I said, it's been at least 7-8 years since I've cut ties or even spoken to them. I'm almost positive my brother and sister don't even remember me. My brother was 7 and my sister was 5. I never had a really good relationship with them because I only saw them twice a month due to my visitation schedule with my Ex-Father (I call him that because I have disowned him as my father and called my step dad my biological father). 

I have no idea what to do. I know she has contact with the rest of my ""family"" and I don't want any of them knowing where I work, live, or anything about me. But I'm also really indecisive about what I should do. In a way, I want to contact her and tell her to keep it between us, but I don't know if I can trust her to do that, seeing as everyone on that side of the family are habitual liars. Any advice on what I should do? Should I give her a little trust and write her a letter? She was always more trustworthy than anybody else on that side of the family.

Here I have been, for years, just wishing for it to all end so I can go to college and get on with my life, but I look at all the opportunities I have given up, people whom I said nasty things to, girls I didn’t go for, and I just wish I could do it all over again.

514,"This started around a year ago. We didn’t know each other very well but at the time we both thought this is what we wanted. It worked really well at first. My only “rule” was that I wouldn’t have sex with him if he was having sex with other girls. He agreed, and vice versa. 
A few months go by and I found out he was sleeping with his ex occasionally, who also happens to be the mother of his child. Obviously, I was hurt but I developed feelings for him at this point so I stuck around. He said she was the only other one. I believed him. 

He would talk to me every single day. After a few months in he finally told me he has feelings for me but after the night he confessed them, we never talked about our feelings again. Just kept seeing each other and having sex.  I knew the reason him and his ex weren’t together rooted from the fact that he cheated on her and then a whole lot of other problems happened. He said he tries to have a better relationship with her because of their baby but he said it’s nothing more. I didn’t believe him, but I cared so I stuck around. 

It seemed like he would tell me everything I wanted to hear... or just enough to keep me around. He would tell me he doesn’t want to lose me, that he can’t stop with me, etc etc. I got deeper and deeper into this until now, when I realized I love him.  So before I talk about the last 3 months, let me explain how he NEVER kissed me during sex. Which is very weird, I know. Maybe once or twice. July was the last time I had seen him before he went to another state for school.

He basically ghosted me from July until the middle of August. I thought it was weird but I had finally “moved on” until he texted me and told me he missed me. I kept texting him and he told me he hates the state he’s in and plans on coming back in October. So we talked every single day until he came back. When he came home is when everything got really good and then started going downhill really fast. 

I told him I wouldn’t have sex with him if he was going to be seeing his ex for anything more than seeing his daughter, because I was tired of sharing. He said he wouldn’t so I saw him. This time was different. We talked for hours which we’ve never really done, and he kissed me. A lot? I was confused. He told me he has feelings for me and I told him I do too. I also learned that he did indeed have sex with his sex. I was hurt and happy at the same time but it didn’t last long. 

He left for college and every day for the last month we’ve been talking and our feelings have been growing. He asked me to be his girlfriend but I said I wouldn’t unless he stopped with his ex. He understood, and the fact that he didn’t fight very hard for me broke my heart. A few days ago I saw a photo of him and I noticed on his ring finger he had a new tattoo of her first initial. He tried to lie and cover it up but I knew. It turns out that she begged him NOT to get it, and she confirmed they’re not together because she doesn’t trust him. I also found out that the month he ghosted me they had gotten back together but broke up before he left for college. 

Every time I try to end it, every time I try to leave.. I come back. Or he comes back around. Basically.. what I’m getting out of this is that I’m option #2 and it’s a huge shit show. Either he cares about me and can’t commit and leave his ex, or he doesn’t give a shit and lies so he can keep me around. I just want to be happy, and I just want to let go but it’s so hard.

The thing is, we've been in mostly a long distance relationship. He lives all the way on the other side of the U.S., opposite of me. I want to go to college in his city, not just to be closer, but because I genuinely love the town and the colleges offered there. Right now though, I can only afford community college with out of state tuition, and because they don't have dorms I need a place to stay until I can get a job, and an apartment. Right now, I've never actually had a job because of unreliable transportation and I don't live in a city, so you either need a car to get anywhere, or you end up having to walk down the interstate for 45 minutes to an hour. It's anxiety inducing.

If I end up in his city, I'll have easier access to jobs, and hopefully more places to apply too. So really, would it be a bad idea if I asked to stay with him awhile? It wouldn't be forever, but it'd basically be like living together for at least a few weeks, and I've heard jumping from long distance to living together is generally not a good idea.

I know it sounds bad, but I do go to a private school which may help? Currently taking pre calculus which I am doing well in (b+). Due to the nature of my middle school(public), I never took a complete algebra one course so when going into high school I was to start with that freshman year, missing the chance to take Calculus senior year. This is unfortunate because most schools I've talked to say they'd like to see calculus as a class that I have taken in high school. I have also not taken any comp sci at my school but have heard of people doing it in college who have not in high school.
My question is, could I get accepted to a college and take the necessary pre requisites for Computer Science and then transfer into the program? I'm not looking at any insane schools that pride themselves in their comp sci program.",22Oct2018,1
520,"I'm 24 years old, about to turn 25, and I'm wandering about aimlessly. I can't figure out what career to pursue, and I don't like school. I'm just going through the motions. 

The biggest issue, however, is working minimum wage jobs while also being in school full time. I simply don't make enough money. 

I like giving massages and while it's not a passion, I considering pursuing certification, a process that might take up to 2 years. 

Here's a quick list of pro's and cons. Thanks to anyone who reads and for any advice that comes my way!


Pros: 

I'd have a lifelong, profitable trade under my belt.

My earning potential would increase. Self employed or working at a spa chain, I'd make more than minimum wage at the sort of jobs I have now (retail). 

Cons:

Time! I'm already nearing 25.

Money, It'd be a total of 8 thousand dollars.  ",22Oct2018,1
521,"I don’t know where to start; I guess because the mess is almost all just in my head. I’m not happy with my life and I feel like I’m a bad person because of this.
I’m a 22 year old girl, I live with my boyfriend and our 3 year old daughter. He makes all the money, I mostly stay home with our daughter and work part time bussing and hosting at a restaurant in the evenings 3-5 days a week. 

I feel so awful. All of the time I’m sad, when there’s so many people who would be happy and fulfilled just to have a faithful boyfriend and an amazing little girl. I’m so unhappy in my relationship and that’s maybe the biggest reason I feel like such a terrible person. He never hurt me. I believe he truly loves me. He is attracted to me. I love him too, I just, get this sad trapped feeling thinking of spending the rest of my life with him. I think the phrase “I love him like a brother” is how I would describe my feelings. Over the past two years or so I’ve slowly been withdrawing my affection and intimacy but I didn’t notice it right away. Now it’s just getting worse. I don’t like the way I feel after I do anything sexual with him I feel so empty and worthless. I don’t think he does anything that makes me feel this way, unless it’s something too subtle for me to notice. Sometimes I wish we never got together,  I know that’s awful. I’m awful. 

I think about living alone a lot. Even if I could afford to, I just can’t imagine how I’d live with myself putting my daughter through the trauma and pain of separated parents, of going back and forth between homes, especially at such a young age. I just keep telling myself to just stick it out, to find little hobbies and endeavors to distract myself and make myself feel more detached from my life and more attached to my feelings. It feels like I have to choose between my happiness and theirs. I hope I always pick theirs. I’d hate myself if I ever put me before them. 

A smaller issue on top of this all is that I developed a crush. I don’t want to get too much into that because it’s really not a big deal. But it does take up some of my thoughts, shows up in dreams. It’s definitely having some kind of effect on me, probably exacerbating my negative feelings about my relationship, or maybe just mirroring them in a way. I don’t know.

I think a lot about dying. But ultimately, I don’t want to die, not until I feel like I’ve really lived and felt something good. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyday it hurts just to wake up, it hurts to fall asleep, it hurts to go about all my daily tasks. I wish there was a way out where I didn’t have to hurt anyone. I wish I could make myself happy without hurting anyone else. ",22Oct2018,1
522,"Me and my mom got along fine for a long time. Up until I was 13ish, we could joke and get along, even though we had occasional fights. Since I have never been good at working hard in school, we have always had fights about my missing assignments, grades, etc, but we still got along after those fights were over. But now we never can get along.

A few weeks ago I had a big test that I didn’t study enough for, so I wrote myself a fake pass to get out of school so I wouldn’t have to take the test. It seemed like a good idea, but the school found out my note was fake (they keep pics of parent signatures) and called her. Her and my dad flipped out at me and gave me a bunch of rules about school and homework (have to do homework downstairs at kitchen table, no music, no phone, etc). I was fine with the punishment at first because I knew they were trying to help, but now it’s just ridiculous.

My mom has gone overboard with this “trying to help” attitude, and she can’t have a single conversation with me without bringing up schoolwork and stuff. Almost every five minutes she walks by me and asks if I still need to study, even if I studied for hours. It’s really frustrating because I just had a big change of heart and decided I needed to work way harder in school. I’ve been trying hard to do all my shit without my parents having to ask, but she keeps harassing me, even when I’ve already been working/studying for hours.

I’ve tried talking to her about not being so annoying with the constant “reminders,” but she hasn’t stopped. I got my grades mostly up to all A’s, and got my first A on my last AP World history test, but I still haven’t “proved anything” to her.

How can I get them to understand how badly their “help” is affecting my willpower to study on my own? I don’t want to hate my mom, but she hasn’t joked around or talked about anything besides what I need to get done in weeks. 

Tl;dr My mom is constantly trying to control my homework and studying but it’s crushing my willpower and ruining our relationship.",22Oct2018,1
523,"I was on a rollercoaster over the weekend and I was having a blast, but the day later I was starting I lose my voice, I haven’t talked that much today because I want it to heal quick but it doesn’t seem like it’s gonna because I’m gonna be back in school in less than 10 hours and it’s still not back. I haven’t talked to my crush the whole weekend she only smiled at me a few times but that was it, she was talking to this other guy who I think likes her as well but I don’t like that. Yes I admit it I am jealous but it seems like she likes him as well because they’re we’re talking together and playing around with each other and I wasn’t. Usually she would talk to me most of the time and I didn’t even know she was friends with that guy but now it seems like we’re drifting apart. 




So basically I lost my voice, I want to talk to my crush, but it seems like someone else has a crush on my crush and the guy has been talking to my crush the whole weekend but I want to talk to my crush tomorrow so I was gonna talk to her tomorrow but I lost my voice.

524,"Not sure if this should go here but idk where else to put it  

   This morning I had school off and my whole family was home (except my dad.) I had really procrastinated on a journal got my science class and also had to study for my algebra test. After a lot of getting everything I need, I sit down to do my work. I just barely got started before I hear booming in the other room, it was my 17 year old brother (in my life it could really be no one else.) I try to avoid it and put in headphones but nothing really works.

        Let me preface this next part by saying I have always had a problem with music. I don't know when it started and it's not with all music, just whenever my brother plays it I can't handel it. That may seem like a bullshit excuse but I think it's tied to something he did to me where he played music right after. I don't have any other mental standouts but my hatred of his music is super irrational, I'll admit. My brother could at least help this though by realizing this (even though I've told him many times) and possibally put on headphones. My parents really don't help either, they usually just tell me ""your suppressing his right to play/listen to music,"" or some excuse like that because they just don't want to get involved. 

   So I go into the living room and tell my mom to tell him to turn it down. Suuuuper convoluted right? I think so, but he wouldn't have even talked to me. So she goes to his room he comes out, starts playing it louder after I go back. This infuriates me. Again, I don't know why, it just does. I ask him to turn it off directly this time, and after some groaning he does. Satisfied with my answer I leave. As I'm walking away, I see him approach behind me and extend his leg. I just assume that he's going to push me or do something he would consider ""playful."" Instead, I got the force of him straight up kicking me in the leg. I should mention that he is a totally conditioned and trained soccer player. It hurt, I'm not going to lie, (my brother is four odd years older than me.) He smirks and turns around. I take the chance, completely blinded by anger at what he just did. ""If I don't do something now, he isn't going to know he did anything wrong"" shitty logic I know right. I punch him in the back of the head and Dodge back a bit. He turns around immediately. I can see the rage in his eyes, I see him rase his right are just a little and start walking towards me. I can tell he is about to punch me with all his force. I honestly feared for my life in that moment

  My mom steps in, I guess you could say she ""held him back"" but that wouldn't really fit. I keep staring into his eyes, and I see a total shift almost immediately after he realized he won't get the opportunity to clock me. His face changes to a victimized look, and he looks almost disbelievingly at me. He started saying things like ""I can't believe you'd hit me like that"" and complaining to my mom. Trying to win her to his side. I started yelling at him and he starts to say things like ""it wasn't full force"" and ""it was a playful hit."" I had enough, I left and went back to my room. 

Honestly, I don't even know what to do, I started off thinking clearly that it was his fault, but after writing this I'm not so sure anymore. He's only hit me once before this (no physical provocation by me that time.) But he constantly jabs or prods me even after I've told him clearly to stop. He does often challenge my self worth or in many cases while in a dispute about music (what else)  will tell me that my work is worthless and learning the things I am in my grade is just filler. I hate this too because I put a ton of time in my classwork and when he just dismantles it like that it definitely hurts

534,"So I've been talking to this girl for a while now and I honestly can't figure her out. 


Here's the basic timeline:


(On mobile sorry for wall of text)


We go on a night out and dance together and make out to the point that would disgust any normal person. Then it was the summer holidays so she moves back home for a couple months, we kind of stopped talking during this time. She seems to like hinting to me at all the guys that she gets with when she's out with her friends. We have hung out once kind of recently, nothing happened though, we just lay in bed and watched a movie we were kind of cuddled up and I had my arm around her. We made plans to go for drinks but when I flirt on texts she kind of shoots me down in a weird way by saying ""stop flirting with me"" then saying that she's now a lesbian, then backpedaling by saying she's not actually but she's 'done with boys xo'. THEN to make things movie confusing she's planning on getting drunk with me at a bar and then told me she wants me to get a taxi home with her because she's scared of going by herself. 

Am I the 'gay' best friend? ",22Oct2018,1
535,"Please help me. I've been living the last week or so in a state of absolute terror and guilt. 

I'll try to keep this on the short side, but I'm using a throwaway because the situation is so specific. And please be honest- I'm not trying to tell this in a one-sided way 

One thing to note beforehand is that I struggle horrifically with OCD, especially when I'm stressed. If I have multiple exams in a week, certain stressful thoughts can consistently regurgitate themselves to a point where they feel endless. It's one hundred percent debilitating.

And so, here goes: Last summer I spent the whole 3/4 months of my break living with a family in my girlfriend's (an my own) hometown. I had graduated the year before, and I was a baby-faced, boy-band looking, Wal-Mart version Justin Bieber. I was also a late 18 years old. My family had moved the year previous, so in order for my girlfriend and I to see each other, I had to stay with another family. The stipulation was that I had to work at their local business, but I wouldn't have to pay rent. It was a fair trade off. 

The downside was I had already committed to another job, which almost always meant nearly 12 hour days, starting typically at 5 in the morning, Mondays through Sundays. The only time off I had was to tie my shoe. This meant the only time I would have to see my girlfriend (who also worked) was late, late at night. 

So here's the situation: the family had multiple kids, boys and girls (all younger than me), and I became very close to a couple of the daughters (obviously not romantically, in a sibling kinda way). They had one foreign exchange student about my age. I recognized the fact that she was a very attractive girl, but thought nothing more of it, as obviously I'm fully committed to my girlfriend, who I've spent two years with. 

One night, we were in the foreign exchange student's room after I had gotten out of work. It was me, the exchange student, and one of the sisters. The exchange student and I were laying down on the floor (not cuddling in any way just by each other), and one of the daughters was on the other side of the room. We were all talking about underwear and how different men and women's kinds were. The other two were briefly flashing their underwear while talking about the comparison

And then the fuck up that haunts me: 

I lifted up my own pants and underwear, a little too high, almost certainly flashing the exchange student that was behind me (I was laying down). She made an embarrassed comment about it, that I forget. I very quickly apologize, and then we go about our business and continue joking for the rest of the night. The rest of the summer goes by, we leave on good, friendly terms and are still friends who occasionally chat. I even told my girlfriend about it a few days later and we joked about it. 

So here's how it relates: the situation has become a horrific intrusive thought. What if had consciously flashed her? I was working a lot of night shifts, and I don't remember the situation that clearly. I'm 100% committed to my girlfriend, and I have been for two years. I love her very much. Wouldn't that be like cheating? Did I just ruin everything? I don't why it's taken this long to manifest itself but it has, and I'm so broken because of it. Please help, and if I'm in the wrong, please don't sugarcoat ",22Oct2018,1

537,"My roommates constantly eat my food without telling me or paying me or replacing it. When we first moved in together, we agreed if we ever needed to eat someones food 1) tell the person you ate it 2) pay them back or replace it quickly

Well I realized that agreement was a huge mistake, because they didn't stick to those rules at all. They constantly eat my food. I've expressed my frustration, and they apologize. But then they continue to do it.

Secondly, they are the dirtiest people I've ever lived with. Nobody cleans up except for me. I buy all of the paper towels, toilet paper, surface cleaner, etc. I've tried to not buy that stuff and let it go to hell, but they just don't give a shit apparently. The kitchen floor is disgusting, the carpet is disgusting, the dishwasher is full of gross ass shit, the drying rack literally has mold on it.

They leave piles and piles of dishes in the sink without washing them. I'm not exaggerating, the sink is constantly overflowing with dirty pots, pans, plates, utensils, baking sheets, etc. So, I spent an entire day cleaning the kitchen and living room. I did all their gross ass dishes and left them to dry on the cleaning rack that I cleaned. Not a single dish was mine. 5 days later and neither of them has put away their clean dishes, or even mentioned a single thing to me about cleaning the entire kitchen and living room.

On top of that, one of them keeps putting the chairs up on the table like at a fucking restaurant. I can't even comprehend why someone would do this unless they are cleaning the floor. There are two chairs and a small round table, but someone is constantly putting the fucking chairs up. It is annoying me beyond human comprehension.. and I don't know who is doing it. But I don't want to bring that up because it's extremely trivial, but everything else makes it that much more annoying.

Can anyone give me some advice regarding how to deal with this.. I have no idea what to do.

544,"FTP, mobile. Warning: Mentions of possible assault, and a whole lot of background

I have someone I consider a friend (for now), that claims to be personally targeted and harrassed on Tokyo public transport everyday on Twitter. 
That for example, men are putting their noses in her hair to smell them and leaning on her. The daily rants always end with a call to kill all men. 

When I first met her, I was sympathetic. Trains in Tokyo are crowded, and there are people who use that as cover to do shit. I've had weird encounters on the train, and so have most of my friends, across the years we've lived in Tokyo. But everyday? 
I commute on one of those packed like sardine lines everyday, and suspect this 'harrassment' is just some poor bloke shoved into her by the seven people behind him trying to get on. 

Yet she still acts like she's being personally victimized and some kind of Cassandra daring to speak the truth about the awful awful men of Tokyo. After daily posts too I'm beginning to think she actually thinks killing all men is a good solution……

To make matters worse, shes told me when she gets home, she strips naked in her entryway immediately because her clothing is ""contaminated with businessman puke"" from the trains (I've seen puke on the trains once in 3 years, and they actually clean trains here). When I visited her apartment and sat down on her rug, she got twitchy, asked me to stand, put down a plastic sheet, and asked me to sit on that instead, because I had been contaminated by business man puke. She then spent most of the rest of the time I was extremely worried about how she'd clean the rug as it was partially under her desk/bunk bed that is too heavy for her to move. 

At this time she said ""I know this is bad of me and I should get help"", but shrugged off my offer to share what I know about therapists in Tokyo. 

In the end, I need advice about how to either convince this girl to get some help, get her to knock off the twitter rants, or how to disappear quietly because I'm posting here rather than flip out unproductively at her because I'm sick of her shit.

545,"I identify as a liberal, woman of color. It's not that I've always been intolerant of conservatives and Republicans. I understand there's more to a person than their political leaning.

However, in this current political climate I feel like there is a side that clearly has the moral high ground. Like they say, voting for Trump might not mean you're a racist, xenophobe, or bigot, but it means all those traits in a president (and his platform) aren't a dealbreaker for you. I also can't reconcile with the idea that someone could be indifferent to the scheming in politics at this time and how it affects lives.

An example: one of my (ex)friends was telling me about how he is mostly indifferent towards politics. He says liberals get on his nerves more these days because they ""whine and complain"". He also says he's happy Trump got elected, because of how it frustrates liberals in having lost ""all that 'progress' down the drain"".

What this administration and it's supporters represent feels like a personal attack on me and the people I love. This is a large part of why I am tempted to distance myself from those with different opinions and, as i see it, different core values. If there's billions of people on Earth, why waste my time with those I don't feel accepted by?

How unreasonable and close minded does this sound on my part? Is it foolish to drop a friend because of their personal ideology? Would I be making a mistake by ""locking myself"" in an echo chamber? What do you think?",22Oct2018,1
546,"I have a hard time finding motivation to do homework, and this has caused my grades to dip. Even when I say ""I can do that easily"" I still procrastinate. So any of you who completely turned their grades around, do you have any advice or tips you can give someone who is struggling?",22Oct2018,1
547,"I'm a high school senior and I am half way through my college application process. Three years ago my father passed away and last year my sister passed away too. Safe to say I have been an emotional wreck. The last two years I have worked my ass off in school and extracurriculars and established a pretty stellar resume. However, last spring (when my sister passed) I kind of checked out from school. A few weeks into my return to school my french teacher gave out the seal of biliteracy test. I failed it. I must say though that I actually love french and am pretty good at it. I was just mentally checked out and didn't check back in until the last few weeks of school. Anyways I lied to my mom and said I received the seal because I was embarrassed. French is kind of my thing. My mom helped me the entire way through with the process of applying and we put it together as one of my academic achievements. I wish I could go back and change it, but I just didn't realize the ramifications of what I did until I submitted. What do I do? I'm scared my college counselor at school will find out and kill my chances of getting into college. I have already applied to five schools and am applying to a couple more (I know I'm annoying). I don't know what to do. This secret is literally killing me and giving me so much anxiety. Today I was called into the principals office for tardies and nearly shit myself. Reddit please help me...",22Oct2018,1
