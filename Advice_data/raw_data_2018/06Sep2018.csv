0,"My friends (18,19M) invited this unpopular sophomore to this party. She seems nice she’s bullied a lot. She’s 15 years old. She kinda looks like rosamund pike. She lets me and my friends drive her car around before the party and drink some.


We then go to the party she doesn’t know anyone there and gets pretty drunk. My friends ask her to come back to my one friends house and she does. The tell her to start taking off her clothes once we get there and more alcohol. We try to take pictures but she says to stop.shes slurring her words and is laughing a lot


My one friend tells her to give him and the other friend blowjobs and she does. They then penetrate her and she says it hurts and she starts bleeding. They keep having sex with her and spreading her legs. My one friend finishes and the other takes her into another room to finish.


The next day they tell all their friends and post about how she’s ugly and her boobs are saggy and that she’s gross and a sl*t.


Should the girl of acted better? Why do my friends hate this girl so much? Why are they being mean to her? Did the commit a crime?

1,"We are educators and our classroom was relocated to a tiny room upstairs with no comfort, storage, reading nook etc that would usually be in an after school program.

Okay cool so my coworker and me accept the challenge and do our best to provide what we can in this new room. Unfortunately the school teacher does not want her class to be filled with child care areas or furniture so we spend about 15 minutes after school each day rushing to set up the room so our children can sit down.

We personally understand this is what happens sometimes in childcare. But some parents are shocked and upset that their child is no longer in a welcoming and comfortable class. So what do they do? They file their complaints with the head office.

Our supervisor raged at us for not explaining to the parents that we are in this room permanently now. What in the world? How can I stop a paying grown adult from voicing their complaint? My co worker cried and I just was baffled. 

I think my supervisor is just upset because she has to deal with disgruntled parents? No idea. But they are paying a lot of money and deserve answers at least. 

I understand if we are stuck in a terrible room with a teacher who doesn’t want to share the space. That happens. But why is head office and my supervisor getting so upset about these complaints? If nothing can be changed just tell the parents that! Don’t get angry at me for just doing my job.",06Sep2018,1
3,"Hello!  I was looking for advice on preventing a phone mount I got for my Honda Ruckus Scooter from slipping.   I have a rather large phone (Pixel 2) and it seems the weight of the phone  is causing the silicone(?) strap to slip on the handlebar and I was wondering if anyone else had this problem and what they did to solve it?  Open to any suggestions! :)

I just started grade 10, and the school extended lunch and added an extra 15 minutes to it which doesn’t help as well.

The problem is I’m just...different. Every kid I try to talk to just acts “cool”. I also don’t play fortnite which doesn’t help as well. I play different games that aren’t socially acceptable like smash bros or Pvz.

10,"I just got back from my therapist and we went over my DAPS quiz I did, and she acknowledged that I had “been through a lot,” but then told me it’s “very unlikely” for me to feel as strongly/depressed/anxious/fearful/ high alert etc. All she said was “maybe you do feel that way but I can’t say you have ptsd because the scores are so high. 

Now I’m obviously not a professional but from what I’ve read I likely do have ptsd and I felt really invalidated about my problems because even if she doesn’t believe me the stuff I said was true and a daily life experience for me.

And I guess I’m extra confused because I’ve been misdiagnosed with DID at 17 because of how often I dissociate on a regular basis.

Is there really “too high” of a score where you have to assume they’re exaggerating? Not meaning to hate but if that’s true that’s fucked up because now I feel like I need a new therapist. And it took me a long while to open up about my traumatic past to begin with.

I'm single so no one who'd make me feel sexy, my last two boyfriends didn't really make me feel sexy.  


I've just signed up to a burlesque course, really just for something cool to do, but despite a room full of ladies of all different body types and skill levels...I just felt utterly ridiculous, like a gangly elephant man in the corner.

19,"Okay so, I'm a freshman in college, and my parents are still strict. If I go out more than 2 or 3 times a week they throw a fit about it. And btw, this is a sexism issue. I.e. my brother has ultimate freedom but mine is limited. His curfew is 1am and mine is 9pm. Why? Because girls shouldn't be out at night because only ""loose"" girls do that, nor should I be going out whenever i want because that's not something girls do. I cant even hang out with guys, even my male best friend whom my mom has met multiple times, along with his parents and she says ""they're good people and he's a really nice kid."" Even if theres another girl with us, they still wont allow it. Everyone in our culture does this, but ffs they left that country a long time ago and we're in in the US now. 

anyways, I didn't move out because they wouldn't ""let"" me (I could've done it, but at the expense of not being allowed in the house anymore and seeing my siblings. Hopefully I will be out for graduate school though and they are okay with that).

So I want to lie about being at the campus library when I'm actually not. I just wanna see my friends more ffs. And my male best friend, who I dont want things to die off with just because i cant meet up with him anywhere outside the university. and lying is the only way it'll work. 

I dont see why some days I'm just sitting home alone bored, with nothing to do, when I can be out, but no because I already went out twice this week. It doesnt make sense. It's almost like they think girls have some wire in their brain that fuses into them becoming a slut if they go out 3 times a week.

So the tracker serves the purpose of me not bumping into my mom. It's a small town and I've bumped into her before when I was with my friends. It's very possible that she would, i.e., bump into me at the one and only mall near us.

20,"I just moved into a new apartment with a room mate that is usually pretty chill. The times his girlfriend is over, who I'm also pretty chill with, he gets a bit weird though. He will ramp up the aggressiveness of his jokes towards me to the verge of awkwardness. This is his style of humor normally and I don't mind It, I usually give it right back to him. 

But for example, a normal joke from him might be 'wanna fight Muffl?', but when his girlfriend comes over he might do that  like five separate times and I don't even know how to respond after the first couple times. I mean I dont see many possible responses besides jokingly raising my fists and going 'yeah man lets go'. Other examples might be blocking the narrow hallway when I'm trying to move through it, just shit like that. Okay to some point but obnoxious after that

I can't even get counseling to help talk my problems out. The story of how I got to living away from her is a long one, but basically her boyfriend is abusive (not to me, I'd kill him, but to my mom, which I tried to help but she just denied it all to the police and everyone so I gave up on her dumb ass). We butted heads a lot, strangely he always backed down from me when he got in my face, because I wasn't afraid and I'd get right back in his.

26,"To give some very important context, I was working with this company for two years before I had to move interstate (my partner got transerred for work). 

When I went to resign, my boss refused to accept my resignation, got the CEO involved and they both told me that they value me as an employee and would like to keep on board - **working remotely full time.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I gladly took this offer as I love the work I do, and love the people I work with. I was so stoked that I had this opportunity, that I pre-booked and paid for 3 flights months in advance (you can get them dirt cheap if its months in advance).

At this point I didnt care that I forked out \~$200 for three return flights, as I wanted to keep in the loop with work. Now the issue is, after these three trips, I didn't make book or pay for any more trips for myself as I figured the company would fly me as they needed me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, the company needs me to fly back home and work the full week (Monday through Sunday) - as they have a big project they need me on. I assumed the company would be paying for my flights - so I have spent the last month getting everything prerpared. Since i'm supposed to be leaving in two weeks, I asked when they would be booking my flights. 

WELL... I was told that since it was my decision to move interstate,  **I would be responsible for paying for my own flights. They would not cover acommodation (I would stay at a friends place) and they would not cover any costs.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I did the math and worked out that I would be losing $500 by doing this trip (after my pay!). So I was basically asked to pay $500 to work a 60+ hour week on a stressful project. And when I addressed this with my new manager, she said I should have negotiated flights when I first moved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just some more context, this is not coming from my boss or ceo who originally asked me to stay. Since then, they hired a new person who came along about 6 months ago - and she is the one refusing to pay. Not only am I offended, but I am now wondering why I would ever go so far out of my way to produce high quality work for this company. I know they need me, and if they were to replace me, they would end up spending a shit ton more money than by simply paying for my flights. 

&amp;#x200B;

And not to mention, every other employee who goes on work trips get their flights, accommodation, food and transport all paid for - plyus they get an allowance of $300 a week to spend on whatever they want!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a call with this new manager tomorrow, and I don't know how to handle this in a professional manner, that shows her how ridiculous she is being. I don't know if I should go behind her back to speak to someone above her (like the CEO who personally asked me to stay).  All I know is that there is no way in hell I am paying a cent for these flights. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do/ What would you do? I love that this job allows me to work remotely and I'd hate to have to give up this opportunity. But at the same time, my time and money is clearly not being respected.

27,"So I'm in my senior year of high school, and it turns out this girl from my class has feelings for me. A friend of hers came up to me and wanted to know what I would say if I found out somebody liked me. I said that I wouldn't go out with them (no, I am not gay) regardless of who they were, because right now I want to focus on studying and habits -- get my habits going and preparing myself for my adult life instead of focusing on relationships. Her friend, M, told me later that day that after finding out, she felt really disappointed and bad.  I would then find out that she had been feeling that way about me for some time but hadn't the courage to tell me directly. This is a new thing to me, I had never before had something like this happen. What I'm struggling with right now is coping with this fact. She had, the previous day, talked to me over on Facebook telling me that I was a really great guy and asked if I liked anybody. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have experienced myself, however, liking somebody and just not being liked back. It feels terrible. You invest so much time thinking about the other person even when other things in your life could be getting your attention, but even so, you're pulled towards that other person. You keep thinking about them and about how they're so beautiful and how great things would be if they liked you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I also happen to like someone else who isn't the girl in question, but I am actively trying to not engage in a relationship with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

This brings me to my main point and what I need to be helped with. It's about my ideology. I currently believe, right now at 19 years of age, that love leads to suffering and it is unfair. Feeling attracted to someone only leads to pain. Even when you like someone and they like you back, you will still emotionally depend on them and your happiness and well being will depend on what their actions and feelings towards you. Making your life and feeling of success depend on something that is bound to change is dumb as bricks. It's an emotional state that sets you up for disaster. It is even harder when the emotional investment is so huge, like with love. Am I wrong on this? I would really, really, really, really, really appreciate if you gave me your points of view. I'm trying to selflessly understand what is true. I came here to hear your points of view and reflect on those ideas so I can cope better with everything. Thanks.",06Sep2018,3
28,"Hi, I'm a 17 years old male Straight A's student from Canada, Quebec. I've been wanting for a long time to go study biochemistry or chemistry in an Elite university and right now I don't what is my best chance at it. I'm gonna start by explaining how is the school system in the Province of Quebec to give you some insight. 

From like 12-16 years old, we got what we call 5 years of secondary school which kinda the equivalent of middle and high school without 12th grade, but afterward, we got to do 2 or 3 more years in what is called CEGEP in order to go to University afterward. After my last year of secondary school, I instead decided to do an exchange in the USA. Right now I am studying in a small high school at grade 12th and go straight to University without doing my 2 years of CEGEP. I thought that I'd be able to get the courses I wanted to get into the University I wanted in the program I wanted. But as in turns out, I don't think I'll be able to do that with the classes I'm taking right now. Everyday I've got a class of English, American Government, Math Calculus and Physics, and to be fair, I don't learn much in the Physics class. I can't take any biology or chemistry courses in the school I'm in. So I'm now here to ask for advice as of my situation.

I talked with my guidance counselor about this but I don't think she really seems to realize the position I'm in and when I speak to her about University application, she says that it is still only the beginning of the year and she will help me with my application when they start for the school I wanna get into. But right now I just don't think I have the prerequisites to get into one of the schools I want to get into. 

So now I thought about taking 1 or 2 AP classes online because there are none offered at my school but I don't know if it's the right thing to do and if it will be enough to get to a Elite University.

If somebody have any advice concerning what I should do, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much!",06Sep2018,1

My mom has been unemployed for about 3 years now, and a year ago we had to move in with my grandparents (dad's parents). But my ~50 year old father also lives here, as he has his whole life. He is completely mentally ill, terrorizes all of us and wants us gone. I avoid him like my life depends on it, so I basically never leave the room I'm in and do nothing outside of the house. I have my own room (my mom &amp; siblings share one) but the majority of the time my father sits 2 feet away from my door at his makeshift desk he set up in the hallway, and play music loudly/talks to himself about us/walks around menacingly (rather than stay inside one of his two bedrooms or go anywhere in/out of the large house we live in that none of us are ""allowed"" to go or else he will enter and harass us). So I basically spend all my time with my mom and 4 year old sibling (different dad who is out of the picture) in one room on my phone.


I do not have a job because I have been counting on us being able to move out (and get a job when we have a permanent location) or have my mom send me (alone or with my sibling/s) away to live with family (as I have begged her). I have a long distance boyfriend who I lightly asked if I could live with him, but he lives with his mom, it would just not work out and I'd be too uncomfortable to really ask such a thing in the first place. He really wants me to get a job because I'm just doing nothing now and it would get me out of the house and he has to fund basically every part of a ""visit"" we have. I am in the process of applying to jobs but even the thought of leaving to and from work in front of my dad &amp; having him see my uniform and knowing where I am really unsettles me.


I started looking for jobs that provide housing (basically only being a hotel maid is what I can find) and was hopeful about it but I mentioned it to my boyfriend and he thinks I won't be happy at any sort of a job that offers housing. And I don't have a license for now (and if I did, I'd need to save up for a car once working).


Even so, I don't even care about making money, I just want to be out. Worst case scenario I'm stuck here for a year until I can possibly go to college and live in a dorm but I feel apprehensive about even going to college at all because I know I'll be in debt for the rest of my life.

35,"I'll start with some backstory, but you can skip ahead to Present Day if you just want to read about my current situation. The backstory is pretty important, though.

I've had an online relationship with a girl I met just over 3 years ago. We met IRL only a month after we started dating, and we've seen each other IRL many times after that. We were both juniors in high school when we met, and started college last year. 

Last year, however, I made it clear to my parents that I would not want to stay home for college. I would want to be with her, going to a university where she lived (we'll call **School A**), and living with her and her parents. My parents didn't like this. In fact, they hated it. They hated it so much that my mother was angry enough to tell me that if I were to put in a deposit for the university I wanted to attend with my girlfriend, that she would no longer want me in her life. I also need to say that my parents would be the ones paying for my college education. The deposit was made for a school here (we'll call **School B**) that I would have been interested in if I had wanted to stay here, but I did not.

After this happened, my girlfriend and I had planned to pay my deposit for School A because I wanted to go there with her, and she could not handle another year of online dating. I didn't want to lose her. While visiting her, we met with financial aid and the only way we could realistically pay for the school was getting married so I would get help with tuition, since I was out of state. In hindsight, I understand this was a bad idea, because you shouldn't marry unless it is solely because of love. 

My parents found out, and were hysterical. My father came to her home on the day we were supposed to be married and stopped it. My girlfriend still wanted to go through with it, but I couldn't do that to my family. Even though they were being very harsh to me, I still love them with all my heart because they were the ones who raised me.

I ended up going back home, and going to School B. I somehow was able to convince my girlfriend to stay with me, and we could be together the next year. We saw each other a few times, but with both of us getting jobs, it became more difficult to find free time for each other.

**PRESENT DAY...**

During the summer, I enrolled in online classes for a different college in the same area as my girlfriend, which she is also attending. I enrolled in online classes mostly because I would not be able to make it there in time for in-class classes. My parents had planned on me attending School B again, and for the next 3 years until I graduate. When I told them I had plans to move away, they were unbelievably angry with me. I feel like I need to add that, because of the past my girlfriend and my family have had, they are not too fond of her and her family. In fact, they've outright stated

My father screamed at me for the last 2 nights, my mother did today, and I imagine when my father gets home from going out for a ride with my mother, I will get screamed at yet again. There are a few reasons I'm having trouble leaving:

1. **My parents threats.** My mom threatened me today that they would want nothing to do with me anymore if I left. No holiday visits, no communication, no nothing. My dad keeps telling me that this is the worst mistake of my life. My parents see my girlfriend as controlling, so they tell me she'll have me working a horrible job for the rest of my life. They are just getting the idea in my head that I'll fail. Even if I don't believe that, the idea is still in the back of my mind.
2. **I'm having bad health problems.** I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and just began a biologic medication (injection) that will heal my problems. So far, I'm seeing massive improvements in my symptoms. Every 2 weeks, I'll need to take another injection. The problem is, if I move, I'm not certain I'll be able to get the medicine, since it gets shipped to my house from a specialty pharmacy. My girlfriend has found a doctor for me, which is good, I'm just not sure about the medicine. I've never done this before, and I don't know how difficult it would be to transfer my records. Not to mention, my parents have been paying so many of my medical bills, and now have to pay so much for every dose of my medicine.
3. **It's so hard to choose.** I love both my parents and my girlfriend so much. No matter what I choose it would be devastating to the one I don't choose. Also, my school would be completely paid for here, by my parents who make a very good amount of money. With my girlfriend, her parents aren't as well off, and don't pay for her college. Luckily, she has a fund from her grandparents to pay for her schooling, and she has an amazing part time job to pay for my schooling until I can myself. What I'm saying is, there is a sense of uncertainty with with her, but with my parents, there is no uncertainty that I will get a degree in what I'm going for. 

**All that being said**, what I really want to do is move in with her and try to make everything work with her, because at the end of the day, the last thing I want to do is lose her. The worst thing from that situation is hurting my parents. They have done so much for me over my life and doing this to them seems like it's killing them. Even though they scream at me and call me stupid, I still love them and appreciate them. I really don't know what would happen to them if I leave. If I stay, my parents will continue to support me until and after I leave college, but I will lose the best thing that has ever happened to me. I would be a total and absolute wreck if she left me, which she would, because as I said, she can't handle another year being apart. I can't blame her. 

Additional information: I'm 20, my girlfriend is 19, my parents are both 62. I have 2 older brothers, my oldest brother moved out after high school, the other is soon moving out to be with his girlfriend in Boston because he just finished college.

What do I do? Do I stay and finish college debt-free, or should I move on to the next chapter in my life? I know in the end it's going to be up to me. I've heard that so much before. I would really appreciate any sort of new perspective on this situation that maybe I'm not seeing. I'd also love to hear from any parents. Maybe you could tell me what my own parents are feeling without yelling and screaming at me.

Thank you, I know it was a long read.

37,"I believe my dad loves me so let me start out by saying that, though he's incredibly delusional when it comes to the state of our house. I live with him, my 23-year old brother, and our two cats.
My mother died 6 years ago from a heart attack, and she was mostly the one who took care of everything around the home. We ended up moving to a new place about an hour away. Ever since then, I have only seen my father properly clean and sanitize an area not more than three times other than picking up some garbage. At first it wasn't too bad, I could manage it for a few months but then it got way out of hand. I couldn't handle cleaning the entire household, especially when no one picked up after themselves. It wasn't just trash, either; it was old food on the kitchen floor, filth caked on the countertops, extremely dirty toilets and showers, cat hair all over carpeted areas, weird drink splatters on the walls, etc. It got disgusting fast until it would take many, many hours to deep clean the entire house. So, I did what I could and had the energy to do (which was rapidly depleting because of depression, caused in big part by the mess). 
Then, our landlord decided to sell the house when our lease was up. So my dad and I spent days scrubbing everything from top to bottom so he could come inspect everything, and we could host walk-throughs. There was still a lot of residual damage to the home, like mildew in the basement carpet, so we lost our safety deposit and moved out about two years ago. This new house has been the same old story, though I'd venture to say it's even worse now. When we first moved in, my dad sat my brother and I down and made these promises that we were going to start cleaning and that this house would not end up like the other one. I was excited, until I realized that was an empty promise on their end. So the old way of life continued. I kept (and continue to keep) my room very clean and neat, I try to clean what I can but it's a lot, especially with school.
We then had a basement flood from the rain about 5 months ago. My dad called the carpet cleaner, but then it flooded again and he refused to call them a second time. We now have black mold growing all over the basement walls and in the carpet. I've asked him repeatedly to please get the drywall replaced, but he said ""Why? It wipes right off"". Our kitchen sink and dishwasher broke a year and a half ago, so we can't use it. He said he'd call someone in to get it fixed, but he never did so now we have flies breeding in the garbage disposal. Everything is in such a state of disarray that I am disgusted immediately when I enter our home. The smell of garbage and human feces hits my nose. I ask him to please help me with the house, but I just get yelled at whenever I bring it up. It seems like he is in complete denial about what exactly we're dealing with. What is starting to concern me now is not myself, but our cats. Ever since the mold issue, they have become lethargic and look very sick. Their litter box is in the basement as well, and sometimes they lay down there on the floor. I start to tear up whenever I think about them, all of this can't be good for their lungs and their health. I don't want these cats to have their life cut short. 
I'm still a minor and in high school, though I'll be turning 18 soon enough. I have no control over the funds to the house, though I just got a job so I can save up money to get things like furniture and appliances fixed, cleaned and replaced myself. Is there anything I can do here? I've been close to calling CPS but I don't know if I could do that to my family; the guilt gets to me as soon as I start to dial the number. If you have any advice it would be appreciated, thank you.",06Sep2018,2
38,"okay so this is a ridiculous post, but i have absolutely awful anxiety that causes me to have a hard time making even the smallest of decisions. basically, i am a 2nd year in college. last year, i started taking Japanese because i'd always wanted to learn the language. at my college, it is required that you take 4 semesters of the same language, so i thought i'd just do all 4 in Japanese. however, i got very far behind in my second semester and this semester, i just knew i would fail if i continued taking it.

when i was high school, i took one year of German, but then, due to scheduling errors, was not able to take more than a year. i absolutely loved German and was very upset i wasn't able to take more. i would have started college out with German, but i'd never gone to a school that offered Japanese so i thought that i should take the opportunity. today, i panic dropped my Japanese 3 class because i was scared of failing. i added German 1 to my schedule. 

i am happy because i really wanted to keep taking German, but i'm just losing my shit over nothing because i feel like i wasted a whole year of my life trying to learn Japanese. and now, i have to take a language course into my junior year since i still need 2 years of the same language and i feel like an absolute idiot. should i have just stuck through with Japanese (even though the likelihood of failing was high) instead of going back to a language i've already tried and loved?",06Sep2018,2

40,"Went down with flu on Sunday, so bad that my boyfriend in a panic called my parents to come over cause he thought I was going to die (lol) have asthma also so of course it went straight to my chest. This meant even standing up causes me to be out of breathe. Even though I felt the worst I possibly could I still woke up at 6AM and went to work. Nearly killed me having to shower and get ready but I was adamant. Until I got in my car, eyes were heavy and hot, struggling to breathe etc. Finally got to work and said to my manager that I felt terrible and couldn’t breathe and was a bit worried as I started to panic. He said that he couldn’t send me home it was my choice. So I said I would go go but asked if he could ring 111 (English non emergency line) as I was really struggling to breathe and was wheezing quite bad (inhalers seemed to be useless). He said yes and said he would get his phone, a few seconds later he came back and said “why don’t you just take a minute and then drive yourself home.” Only after I thought about it did I think maybe it was another managers influence.

At the time I just said okay, sat in the car for nearly an hour only for my mum after speaking to her to drive straight to me and take me hospital. Ended up on the breathing machine for a while. (Doctor said my lungs sounded as though they were riddled with infection and the worst case they’d heard in a while)

I’ve just kind of been mulling over this now I’m out of my sleep all day and can’t get out of bed part of being sick and thought how I’m actually quite pissed off. Asthma can be deadly, how could he have just left me to make my own way from work?

42,"Hi, redditors,
thanks for stopping by.
I have a little issue which I though some of you may had experienced as well. I don't wanna write any long paragraphs.. I'll try to keep it as short as possible: I have some messed up obsessive thoughs about other people. Like they could see me.. Like everytime. And I'm trying to make a good impression on them.. Even when I'm all alone. Also I can't help it but keep on imagining different situations with different people, like talking to them and stuff (nothing dirty :D). I'm not happy to admit it.. It really destroys my ability to focus. I used to write a lot. Now I've been sitting here for 3 hours, it' 3 am and I wrote absolutely nothing.. This thing also reflects on my study and stuff. My memory is absolutely horrible. The past is blank. Emotions doesn't feel as emotional as they used to. It's like I'm not being and existing on 100%. Thoughs are empty. It's like being unable to turn off the most boring radio station ever. That thing called creativity usually avoided me, but this time it is completely gone and I miss it. It's weird. Now I have it for.. 2 years maybe.. (I'm 15yo) but it wasn't as horrible in the beginning. It's getting worse. There's some other garbage on my mind, but I really need to solve this one.
I'm wondering if someone here knows what it is and how to get rid of it. If so, I'd be very, very glad for your reply. Many thanks for reading this cr*p. :)
Btw sorry for my horrible English.

44," atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism?   
can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls?   
what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls ",06Sep2018,0
45,"I realize that this subreddit is ""ask HS teacher"" and my question is about college and adulthood, but I guess my question also concerns high school in a way also. Plus, I've learned that teachers generally love giving advice, so yeah.
I've been a college sophomore for 3 weeks and I've been consistently questioning what the point of college is, as well as how people say college is fun. 
I am premed and plan to major in public health or biology, but either way, I still have to take classes like biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus + biostatistics. Because the average GPA of people accepted to medical school is an A- (3.7), I feel like I absolutely have to shoot for straight A's, which is difficult at a grade deflated school like the one I go to (Berkeley). I literally just feel the panic rising in my throat when there's a concept I don't get immediately or even when there's a quiz worth 1-2% of our grade. In fact, I almost cried and had a panic attack before my last o-chem quiz (despite the fact that it's worth 2% of the grade and we get 3 lowest of 13 dropped), and I ended up getting a 90% on it.
I have a 3.62 GPA and have earned like 2 B+'s and a B already, just from freshman year. 
Outside of that, I am a paid TA for general chemistry, volunteer for an alcohol safety initiative, am an RA-of sorts without the totally free housing, but also have much less responsibility, and write for the Public Health Advocate. This isn't to brag; it's just to give you all a window into my life. 
And no, transferring colleges is not an option. I might also look into different career paths, but I like the stability of the doctor career path, if that makes any sense. 
It's not even just academic stress; it's also the stress of being a college student. I just feel like I suck at adulting and am not emotionally mature or stable. For instance, I spilled a frappe-like drink on my laptop today, and the display stopped working. 
I totally panicked and walked around Berkeley for like ~1 hour to get it fixed lol, checking out 3 different places in the process. I finally found a place that was willing to do it for $160 (did I get ripped off)? but I couldn't help but feel like if I were at home or at UCLA, which is closer to my home (I live in SoCal), that my parents would have taken care of it for me and that I wouldn't have been so alone in the process. My friends have their own shit to do here and can't help me with all of my life problems, lol.
As for the $160 (I've only paid $60 so far for an initial service and cleaning, and if it works I have to pay them another $100), I just feel so guilty whenever I spend money on ANYTHING, even though I make $450/month as a TA.
Also, I feel insecure about a lot of things found in college, like drinking and SO's. I work for an alcohol student initiative and I do not drink, but when I see students younger than me getting totally hammered, I wonder whether I'm just immature or missing out on something. 
And as for SO's, I've just never felt attracted to anyone of the opposite (or same) sex for that matter. They might be attractive, but that barely scratches the surface, and I'm just not motivated enough to like flirt/get to know anyone better. But at the same time, I feel so uncomfortable/jealous when I see couples because I feel like I'm missing some sort of support/affection in my life. I also grew up in a traditional Asian family so we don't discuss love and SO's are discouraged until the kid has a job and a degree. 
I'm so homesick for my hometown--which just feels so safe and home-like versus Berkeley, rampant with crime, homelessness, and where my parents/support system aren't, and panicky for my second o-chem quiz tomorrow, and any advice/words of support would be appreciated.
These feelings make me wonder why college is even worth it, especially at a hard school like Berkeley. I've seriously considered dropping out or transferring, but of course neither are allowed. And no one seems to be struggling as much as I am.
All of these feelings also make me miss high school. Don't get me wrong; I'm not sure whether I'd repeat all 4 years again, and there were moments when I was scared about exams and had generally bad days, plus the overarching worry about getting into college, but it seems like life just gets worse from here on out. It's like an endless rat race to the top. 
Work your ass off in HS to get into a school like Berkeley? Work even harder at Cal, competing with smarter people, to get into medical school. And idk yet, and may never know, but I bet med school is even harder. Idk. Life isn't easy and sometimes I wish I could die. ",06Sep2018,3
46,"So two days ago I was talking to this friend of mine on Snap. We weren't talking about anything serious in particular, just school and the stress of exams and all that stuff. 

But after I sent my most recent text about how I feel like I didn't so great in a particular text, she opened it and didn't respond, and it's setting off my anxiety cause usually she and I talk pretty much everyday.

I don't think I said anything bad to set her off or anything. One of the reasons I have thought up were that she maybe doesn't feel comfortable talking to another guy while she's in a relationship (she has a bf, and I think the two are great together). I don't think this is the likely reason though, I think the most likely reason is that since I have l beef with another guy friend of hers, then she has sorta chosen her side and cut me off. But again I'm not sure how likely this is because her friend and I have been not talking to each other for a few months so it seems did that she chooses now to act? 

But anyways, any advice on how I should go about this? Do I text her back asking if everything is alright between us? Should I just ignore it?

48,"This is going to be a pretty long post and likely have awful spelling and formatting so I apologize in advance.

       When I was younger I had an amazing relationship with my mom. She was everything to me because my father wasnt really there for me and never taught me how to be a man. I dont know how to play any sports. Im much weaker than almost every guy I know. I pretty much cant do anything you would expect a 15 year old boy to be able to do. I wasnt even strong enough to open a water bottle until I was 11.

       Eventually my mom realized all of this and decided to put me into taekwondo so I could learn how to fight, get stronger, and get fit. Ive always been very scrawny so I was neevous and excited to start. I was 11 when I first started. I ended up loving it so I signed up for a 3 year contract. Everything was fine until about 1 year in when I realized that this wasnt the sport for me. It was extremely repetitive and we only sparred once a week. Also I was terrified of sparring. The rest of the time I was there was awful. Although I am now much stronger than I used to be (im still weaker than everybody I know) it has done awful things to my life outside of fitness.

        I was in a horrible place mentally because I absolutely hated it about 2 years in and when I told my mom she got extremely angry and didnt let me quit. I got upset and frustrated because I wanted to try a different sport, but I was stuck doing something I dont like. There were lots of personnel things going on that made my mom less of a happy person and more of a grumpy old lady.

       When I had about 1 year left in my contract me and my mom would constantly get into arguments about whether or I not I would go to practice that day. This is when our relationship started fading away. The year passed and I had my black belt and the contract ended. I was asked if I wanted to continue.
      
       For about a month I was feeling good about the sport and was thinking if I was willing to give it a second chance and sign up for another contract. Sadly, I ended up agreeing and my mom paid multiple thousands of dollars to enroll me again. About 2 months passed and I realized that was the worst mistake of my life. I still cant understand why I was so stupid and thought I wanted to continue. 

       My apartment was recently renovated and I had to move out for a week and I didnt go to taekwondo throughout the whole of June and July because I was so busy. During that time I felt much happier and had a lot less stress. Come August and Im ready to go back. This is where my relationship with my mom plummeted. I constantly made up excuses and fought with my mom so that I dont have to go back. I eventually told her that Im done and I quit and she took my phone and told me to never speak to her again and that she will only give me my basic necessities because Im old enough to take care of myself. This went on for a week.

      That week was one of the most depressing and stressful weeks of my life. My mom hated me and my sisters were disappointed in me. About 2 weeks ago I told her I couldnt live like that and that I would go back. For one week I wasnt able to go because of school returning and we were very busy. Last week I made up excuses and I think I made my mom cry because I just couldnt bear the thought of having to go back and going through everything I went to for the past 3 years of my life. My mom id now convinced Im never going back and is rarely talking to me and told me that she is considering completely disappearing from my life because I can take care of myself.

         I dont know what to do. Im a dumbass kid who cant do anything right. My mom hates me and Im extremely stressed. Hair has been falling out of my head extremely easily for the past 2 years and Im probably going to be bald by 30. Im a weak disappointment and I think my mom doesnt love me anymore. I dont know what to do so I came to this sub for help. Please dont be afraid to call me a dumbass or call me out for being the biggest asshole you have ever heard of. Also please dont downvote people giving me tough love. I just need to know what the best thing to do in this situation is. If you have any questions please ask them.

I don’t pay my own insurance but I’m sure that’ll stop soon enough, either way, they handle expenses for cars and whatnot. So they’re telling me that “you’re gonna run this car into the ground there’s no way I’m letting you do delivery”. Fair point, Volvo’s don’t break down often, but a 250,000 mike xc70 from 2003 was isn’t gonna be the best delivery vehicle for long that’s for damn sure. So I offered to deliver in the Volvo until I saved enough money to buy a car and my own insurance, and inevitably pay for repairs. But they still said no, what should I do in this situation? Am I being reasonable or do they make more sense to you?

I have worked at the same company for 5 years. I'm a welder/fabricator and also a medic and do some other safety related stuff. Unfortunately I have developed back problems from welding and can no longer continue. 

My company is great and recognizes my potential, and they have given me a new job role as a quality assurance rep. This is not a job I would really pick for myself but I am happy that I still have a job.

The new role entails quality assurance which involves telling people when they've messed up and stuff like that. I don't really like being the berrar of bad news so this isn't great for me. Its also a lot of desk work, and working with excel etc. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed right now as I am having to overhaul the entire QA process and a lot of things will be changing for everyone at the company because of this. 

I'm used to plugging in my headphones and building stuff all day. 

How can I get used to a desk job? Any tips on managing people? And how to tell people ""you messed up, fix it"" without sounding like a grade A asshole?   I am also stepping on a lot of toes of people who currently do QA whose focus' will be shifted away from that. I don't want anyone to think I'm making their life harder, but unfortunately I work with a few closed minded people who do NOT like change.

It is a lot to learn and I'm stressed about it. I was so good in my fabricating position and it's crappy to have to start all over learning a new job (although learning is always good I suppose).  

It should be noted that I will be going back to school next September so I only have about 11 months left doing this job.

58,"I'm currently dating a girl that goes to a school a few hours away from me. I see her every few weeks and hang out with her and her friends. Recently, I asked one of her friends via instagram if he gave a girl chlamydia because I knew he had it and he had cheated on his girlfriend.

Now he is telling me that the next time I come to their school he is going to kick my ass. I'm very nervous and confused on what to do because I'm a skinny guy and very weak with my upper body.

I've never had a dream career to work towards and it just feels like I don't have many skills. 

Just now I was doing one of those aptitude tests and it was like, ""on a scale of 1-5 how much would you enjoy studying sea creatures"", and so on with different jobs. It was so hard for me to do because I don't feel like I can say for sure how much I would enjoy doing something. I didn't give anything a 5 because I don't actually WANT to do anything! I just want to not suck at something and have it not give me anxiety attacks or make me hate life. 

I'm just scared because it feels like I really need to step it up finally. I was living with my boyfriend but we broke up and I left that area. I could live with family for reduced rent but I really want my own place and a job with a little more responsibility.

Basically what’s going on is that my husband wants to join the Air Force BUT he’s just now considering it. For me, I’ve always wanted to join the Air Force but I’m currently 8 months pregnant. We’ve talked it over before and he thinks it should be me who should join since I have my associates but also since I’ve told him I wanted to do it career wise. Months ago (before finding out I was pregnant) I took the practice test and did really well, as for him he would need to recap his studies. 

Just recently he’s been talking about it saying it’s best if he goes in right now but I’m not too sure if that’s what he really wants to do with his life versus me wanting to join. I think it’s because we have a baby almost here and he wants what’s best for our small family. 

I support him any way possible but I don’t want him to join if that’s not where his head is at. For me, I can wait until our baby is almost 1 and then I can join.

68,"I met this girl at my auntie's birthday party, she didn't actually talk to me then, however, she asked her friend to get my number and I gave it to him. This happened a couple months ago, since then, she got really attached to me just by text messages - we met for coffee later, but nothing happened because she didn't wanted to make out in a public place -, after that encounter things escalated, she sent me a print of my contact saved on her phone with a heart by its side and kept asking me to do the same with hers. I refused and she was getting really aggressive as if we were on a relationship, she started to get mad if I would take too long to answer her texts, it got to a point where I told her that I wouldn't want to talk to her anymore if she was looking for an argument. After that she was less aggressive, but she was constantly asking me to meet her and addressing to me like she was falling in love, as if we were a couple.

At that time I was also seeing another girl and I made up my mind about telling her that things were getting serious with this other girl, so she would leave me alone and also because he longer I would wait, she would get more attached. Finally, when I told her, she snapped at me and told me that she didn't want nothing to do with me. However, a couple of weeks later she texted me and apologize for being rude to me; I told her it was ok, she asked me why I didn't tell her about the other girl before and I answered that I really felt I didn't have to, since I wasn't her boyfriend. She understood and started to text me again, I ended up meeting her again - things with the other girl didn't worked out -, before I agreed to meet her, I had refused several invitations, but I eventually accepted, because I figured she was looking for something casual otherwise she would have gave up already; besides, I told her multiple times that I wasn't looking for something serious. When we met this time, I made out with her, but she was acting very weird, she asked if I were colony for her, wanted me to cuddle her and I freak out, since it was the first time we were together like that.

Therefore, I made the decision to ignore her texts, but she kept sending me them, then I decided to block her yesterday, but she started calling me from different phones today, all day long. It got to the point in which I used an app to block all calls, but when she figured that out she started to text me (old school text, since I blocked her before from a message app we use in my country).

75,"Hello Reddit. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to keep this brief and concise. I work as a budtender (think bartender but for marijuana) at a dispensary in Denver, Colorado. The first few months were fantastic: everything I wanted the job to be. As time has gone on, store policies(in regards to employee rights/punishments) have become more strict, unfair, and (possibly) illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

We(the budtenders) work 4 days a week, but for 11.5 hours at a time(with 2x 10 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch).

We were given the option to pick up extra shifts at our own discretion, with a $50/$100 incentive for half/full days, respectively. About two months in, they stopped offering the extra cash, and instead offered product samples(given to the owners for free, mind you). After about a month of that, they stopped offering any incentive to pick up extra shifts, but still hounded us to do so.

Then, they took away overtime pay. Any hours over your weekly 40, were only compensated at regular wages. Yet still hounding us to pick up extra shifts.

&amp;#x200B;

Its been about 3 months since overtime was taken away. This last month has been awful.

Ever since I started, we've been collecting tips, pooling them, and splitting them evenly to the budtenders for that day. Over the past month, we've been threatened to have tips taken away for specific individuals, been threatened to stop collecting tips indefinitely, and actually have had the tip jars taken away(once for a week, once for 4 days, once for just a morning). Even some customers were upset that they were not allowed to tip.

&amp;#x200B;

And now, without any notice, choice of day, or overtime pay, we(the budtenders) are all being given an extra half day of work each week(due to ""short-staffing""\[at this point it's worth noting that we have lost 3 employees in the last month, and, being personally close to them, I know it was because of the changing store policies\]).

&amp;#x200B;

There's plenty of other issues to cover, including, but not limited to, our ""armed security"" being slimmed down(it was a joke already) despite increasing crime near our dispensary's location, favoritism of newly-hired budtenders(read: given promotion) that are friends with the owners, and threats for write-ups by: using the bathrooms when not on break, taking a drink in the back when not on break, and talking to co-workers while rolling joints(yeah.. no social interaction or fun allowed).

Oh, and honorable mention for hiring a woman who was a pure nightmare to work with, made many mistakes(ex: over-selling, non-compliant packaging, over/under-charging, etc.\[these are fine-able offenses, as in, they could have cost the store $10,000+ in fees\]) and yet continued to have her employed because she... \*gasp\* was sleeping with the owner.

In fairness, she has since been fired, but before doing so, she was given at least 6 chances(any of which would have had any other employee fired immediately).

&amp;#x200B;

If nothing else, it was nice to get this all in words and just vent, but I am curious if anyone has any legitimate advice on what I should do. Do keep in mind that I want to continue working at this dispensary, but will consider looking elsewhere given the current and increasingly worse conditions.

In case it’s not clear, they told me on graduation night and never followed through with it. 

A little background the gift has to do with something I’ve been involved with for almost 2 decades. Honestly, it probably would’ve been the greatest gift I’ve ever gotten. 

So I’m really sad. I’m really bummed. 

It’s been 6 months now nothing. From time to time they make mention of it and nothing comes. 

So, here’s the thing. It’s a few parts. They “thought” it was $800 less than it is together. That caused a minor hiccup for one of my parents. One didn’t/ doesn’t care. Doesn’t even acknoledge it ever. 

Not to sound spoiled - $800 won’t kill them. It won’t. $800 won’t kill me. (I know this sounds wrong and I’m sorry to offend anyone. I’m just trying to give as accurate of a description as I can so that I can get the best feedback possible!)

I’ve waited so long for something like this and I’m at a point where I can buy it.

*To be noted: I feel funny about gifts. I don’t regift. I’m appreciative of any gift.  I won’t ask no expect a gift and I will feel very uncomoftable reminding them*

I recently got tinder and tested some of what I thought were my best photos on a photo rating site and I got pretty low attractiveness ratings and it hurt. Everyone's preoccupied with someone they love and I'm alone in my room looking out my window at the trains going by. I tried to get a phone call health coach but she just told me stuff that I have already been doing. Many times I think of how I want to die but I would never kill myself.

97,I have a crush on a girl at my school. We used to talk a lot and be really cool. In seventh grade I would help her through hard times and give her advice on this girl she used to like (she's bi). During lunch I would glance over at her and she would also glance back to look at me and we would make eye contact but quickly look away. My feeling weren't as strong at that time but they were there. One of my friends doesnt really like her because she's not the most normal person but I'm not either. Near the end of the year I didn't talk to her that much and I was kind of a jerk because these feelings started getting stronger. Eighth grade has started and I haven't said a word to her. I still glance over and she does the same. One time she tried to start a conversation but I got nervous and walked away. I can't think of a way to not make things awkward. This happened to me in 5th grade with another girl. And we haven't talked since. I don't want this to happen with us two. I have trust issues so I haven't told anyone. One of my friends is really good friends with her so they talk a lot. Ive tried getting over her but I can't. I created a fake Instagram account and started talking to her on that. Turns out she said we are really good friends but we haven't talked much. Now I know how she feels when she had that crush. I was there for her. I told her someone has a crush on her on the other account and she hasn't guessed me. I need help pls,06Sep2018,1

So I'm having a hard hard time with my mother who is 61 and were diagnosed with Diabetes two weeks ago and we already were expecting that

She is a very classic ignorant person who didn't have education, never admits she is wrong or does something wrong and didn't want to see a Doctor no matter what I try until the point her feet became purple because of Diabetes, so when I try to give her advices and tell her to go to the doctor and take care of herself she is usually mad with me and doesn't listen a single word, I am living in Canada with my husband and she is in my home country, she is single and use to drink a lot and I guess after she was diagnosed with Diabetes she did stop.

Basically, how to deal with a person who doesn't listen to reason? Doesn't matter how kind my words are with her because she doesn't listen, I guess many people have these kind of situation where they know in their hearts their mother/father needs help but doesn't listen or doesn't want help

I want to help her, but if I try to say the TRUTH(eg: you can't drink anymore as you have Diabetes) to her in the phone she gets mad, screams and starts a fight...

The officer gave me a warning for the headlights and charged me with driving without supervision, and told me to pay a fine of $290. So days go by and I called the Motor Vehicle Association to find out what will happen and what to do. They told me I would have to restart my 9 months period, and that I wouldn't be able to register for a driver test once the information of the stop reaches their system in about 30 days.

I wasn't given any points on my permit, if that's possible. Does that mean all I have to do is pay the $290, then I can take the driver test?

110,"This is going to sound like ""Trouble"" by Taylor Swift.

So there's a guy I know. Let's call him Cecil. For years, Cecil has been an awful friend. I want to keep everything anonymous, so I can't go into too much detail, but here are a few examples.

1) He has always tried to downplay my dreams and accomplishments. *You got into that school? It's not as impressive as it used to be. [School A] is a lot better*

2) He is extremely envious. I once said ""[Mutual friend] must be smart. He got into Yale."" Cecil's knee jerk response was ""Who do you think is smarter? Him or me?""

3) He constantly takes jabs at me. I know people playfully make fun of each other sometimes. But whenever we're in a group of 3 or more people, Cecil spends the whole time making fun of me. He makes fun of my hobbies, he makes fun of my hair, and he just doesn't stop.

4) You know how a friend is supposed to be there for you in times of need? Cecil isn't.

I think most of us can agree that Cecil is a bit of a toxic person. It's no accident that he has few friends. All that said, something is holding me back from just cutting him off completely. For the most part, the thought of him makes me want to never talk to him again. But it happens sometimes that I just want to be around him, even though I know he's no good.

This is not a romantic attraction by the way.

I'm in an intense school program, so I'm working 5 days a week, and I feel like I have to work all weekend (I do sometimes but not always). I'm also at school from 8 in the morning until about 7 at night. On top of that, I'm not getting 8 hours of sleep ever or getting any exercise.

I felt like I was handling it pretty well, but I also had some awareness that I was not great to be around. And likewise, I didn't really want to be around other people. I would retreat to my room when I got home instead of being around family. I kept working and working, with lazer-like focus. Today, I just said 'fuck it' and accepted whatever work I had done on the current project and left a little early. I started thinking on the way home, realizing how emotionally tired I was, and within a couple hours, I felt totally rejuvinated. I suddenly wanted to take care of myself again, meaning eat/sleep/exercise/socialize/look good. I don't know if it was holding in stress, but I'm going with that for the title.

Not only do I feel 100% better, but other people suddenly want to talk to me and help me out. Everyone wants to be nice to me.

119,"Over the years I've developed a hippy goth style. I like to think that it started with my love of black sabbath when I was a kid, but really until high school I was kind of just a fat video game nerd with no real unique personality.

I met this musician that played guitar and collected pedals. He was a loner and found out about most of this stuff because of magazines. He collected CDs and had hundreds of them. It was his hobby. His house, much like the houses of my more distant relatives, was trashed constantly. He dressed like a punk, I wore mall goth clothes.

He and his friends eventually inspired me to learn guitar and I learned really fast, becoming an influence in my friend group and have to admit I became sort of a cheap imitation of a kurt cobain, I was obsessed with dark subjects.

I started dating a girl around age 20 who was probably the most goth person i had ever met in my life. She lived on a bus that looked like an old romani gyspy wagon. I fell in love with her surroundings and I desperately wanted to be a part of her life because of it. The tapestries, the darkness, the candles, the magic circles.

I threw out my flannel and started wearing a lot more rainbow colors and black. Really trashing up my image. When I look at old photos, I'm a little embarrassed because it's obvious I was trying to be someone I'm not. My body type just didn't really fit in with the kind of thing I was going for.

Everybody came to accept me for this being the kind of person I am. My room right now looks like a psychedelic trove, fully of flowing tapestries, dark reds, trinkets, books. I have a psychedelic goth style still and I've made it my home.

I'm worried that none of this is really who I'm supposed to be and that I never got a chance to develop my own style. Sure, I made all the decisions about what to like, but I took bits and pieces from things that more original people invented and took them for myself.

If any of them saw me today they might laugh at what a cheap imitation I am. I probably embody something that they left behind as a kid and might have grown out of by now.

how do I develop an original style? how do I know that these things are what I really love? I feel like I wandered into this stuff only because I lack originality and couldn't find something all on my own, I had to let someone else show me things and then pick from that stuff.

I didn't wander into a record store and fall in love with a record. I didn't grow up in a spooky goth house. My grandfather was kind of a psychedelic guy who used to run around town playing in graveyards, so I think maybe I took after his stories or something.

120,"I don't even know where to begin. This post could honestly be some sort of comedy, with things getting increasingly worse.

​

Well, first things first. This is week two of college. For whatever reason, all the work hit me at once today. I went to a lecture, the first of one of my classes, and felt like a god damned idiot. Understood very little of it. After lecture I sit down and draft all the work I have to do for these next few days. I studied six hours, and did so efficiently, and still barely dented it. I feel like I'm not actually as smart as I think I am, that I wont be able to handle it, etc. And yeah, I know everyone feels this way. But still.

​

Then, later that day, I'm hanging out with the person who I'm by far closest to at this school, like the only person I feel could be a genuine friend. For background, I knew he had a bit of a problem abusing prescription stimulants, but it didn't seem that bad. People would argue that he had a problem, but he wouldn't budge an inch, insisting that its fine. Well today I figured out that he's four days into a meth binge. Like actual crystal meth. He's eating it, not smoking it. And he seems to think its totally fine, when I extensively told him what he's doing is not okay, he doesn't listen. And today he bought more meth and more adderall. And he thinks this is totally fine. He's been using meth or adderall twice a day for the last four days, and has no intention of stopping.

​

Okay, well, after failing to convince him that what he's doing is not okay, I decide to move on to other stuff. Trust me, I tried, but he didn't budge. Well, I tell him I think a mutual friend is trying to sleep with me. For context, I'm incredibly bad with girls, super inexperienced (never done more than kiss a girl), and very self conscious about my looks (I think I look fucking awful, so I'm very validated by her apparent interest in me, thinking I'm about to get the albatross of being an 18 year old virgin off my shoulders. He tells me that he's certain she's not interested. I ask why, and he replies if he tells me its gonna hurt. Well, curiosity is powerful, so I ask him to tell me. He lets me know that for whatever reason he mentioned to her that I'm into her and she responds with ""that guy shouldn't be expecting to be getting laid with me or anyone else"". Well, I get super mad and leave. He calls me, and I'm super fucking pissed at him, still, and he apologizes profusely, with an almost sociopathic charm and persuasiveness, and I just tell him whatever and hang up. A few hours later, he tries to give me some vyvanse pills to make it up and I tell him no. That's the last I've spoken to him today.

BUT this position requires more training to learn the ropes than usual, so I feel guilty quitting because they spent so much time and effort on me (plus they're highly understaffed right).

I really like the job; coworkers are great and most of the customers are friendly. The only issue is my preceptor. She often reprimands me for situations I have no control over and it's very frustrating.

Problems I face with her multiple times a day at work (not limited to these):

1. It's taking me longer than usual to help a customer due to a problem out of my hands (e.g. computer's slow, coworker promises to find a SKU but doesn't return, etc.). Preceptor notices, admonishes me for being slow. After the customer leaves she says, ""Don't take it personally, but you need to move faster"" (tbh on my 2nd day I was the only sales associate during a big sale due to a staffing error but my managers said behind my back that I was fast and did great ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯). I explain to her what happened and ask what I should have done so I can do better next time, she says ""Yeah nothing really, but you're kinda slow."" 
2. Customers lie to managers, saying I lied to them about something so they can get a ""satisfaction"" discount, preceptor hears and admonishes me despite the managers telling her it wasn't my fault.

Any advice as to whether it's ok to quit or how to deal with my preceptor would be great, thanks. Normally I'd put up with this (especially since the managers know so what she does isn't affecting me), but I don't need this job; my parents advised me saying if I have to be so frustrated at work, I should work in my field and get paid 5x more (I already have a job offer so I know my salary). The only pluses for staying are the employee discount I get to use for Christmas gifts and my amazing coworkers.

**tl;dr** \- Started a retail job last month in a good position that's hard to get. Love the job, hate preceptor who blames everything on me.

It is quite common for him to go on a rant about her or myself, usually resulting in him getting pissed and talking shit, and when I tell him something back results in him going ""yeah, mhmm, okay, whatever, yep"" or turning to our mom and begging her to tell me to stop, getting emotional and overall even more pissy.

I just don't feel hungry, and when I do eat I feel physically sick.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a problem with being gay or a fear of it.  My problem is that I want to have sex with women.  I am only sexually-aroused by women.  I am only interesting in pursuing women.  I am NOT interested in having any sort of sexual intercourse with a guy.  No matter how effeminate I may act, that does not translate into who I want to have sex with or how I want to have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

I think our society is very hypocritical for two reasons.  First, no means no when women aren't interested, so why doesn't no mean no when everyone insists that a guy should come out as gay?  Second, stereotyping people by their skin color, sex, religion, ethnicity, etc is obviously bad.  But stereotyping a guy as gay because he's unfortunate enough to be a scrawny, sheltered nerd is perfectly okay.

&amp;#x200B;

What's worse is that there is a woman I'm extremely in love with, and we're currently not together.  She's indicated there's a chance we *could* be, but only if I get my life together.  A fair request.  However, I'm concerned that people's perception of me will sabotage my chances with her.  

&amp;#x200B;

130,"Hello, I am going to keep this short because it is an emergency and I didn't know what subreddit to post this.


A friend of mine (21 y/o) is refusing surgery for an aneurysm. She has a history of severe mental health issues such as bipolar disorder, and it is possible that the aneurysm is triggering these effects severely. She believes that by undergoing brain surgery, she will ruin her chances of ever fulfilling her dream of attending med school. She is currently isolating herself from friends and family and denying care. What should we do in this situation? ",06Sep2018,1
131,"Let’s see if I can keep this somewhat succinct.

- I lost both my parents this year.
- My only brother left the family before they died.
- My 14 year old golden retriever has also passed this year.
- I’ve just moved into a trashed punk house where I know none of my roommates. I’m concerned about being able to take care of myself in such a living arrangement.
- Just started a temp job in accounting. I have some skill but mostly feel in over my head. Like an awful imposter.
- I’m severely overweight.
- I’m a 38 year old woman. Childless (Though I did inherit my Mother’s cat. And she’s a delight). I suppose I’ve been coming to terms with that I won’t have a family of my own. It’s hard to accept though.
- I’m as broke as it gets. Can barely keep food on the table or gas in the car.
- I’m years behind in my taxes.

I used to believe in things. Like Hope and Love. I used to want a creative life (I just moved back from my second failed attempt at working in the film industry). But that’s all over now. Watching both of my folks die right in front of me has really changed me. I most definitely don’t believe in God. I know there is no plan, so it’s hard for me now to find purpose.

I’m afraid I’ve lost my way. 

I’m so alone all the time. I don’t know what any of this is for. My whole life has pointed this way. Much of the depression has existed since childhood, but I’ve definitely reached new depths this year.

My few close friends and what family I have left, have really come to my aide with small loans, etc, for me to get back home and keep gas in my car. I am very grateful to these people for their compassion and understanding.

Things I know should be on my radar:
- grief counseling 
- mental health medication 
- personal therapy
- eating healthy 
- exercise 
- getting my fucking taxes done
- going back to school
- working with children 

I just don’t know what to do next. Or if I do, I can’t believe in myself long enough to find the drive. I’m fucking nobody.
Every day seems so dead and still. It’s quiet all the time. There’s no more room for schemes or adventures. All of that feels over. I have really failed at adulting. I know that. Despite my best efforts. And now I feel like I’m reaping what I’ve sown. 

I want to believe in things again. I want to live life. I want to be creative and take care of my wellbeing. I used to want to travel and be a screenwriter. I like making things. I make these puppets sometimes. I value being kind and making my corner of the world a sweeter place, but I’m just so completely divorced from any personal power or discipline that can bring me back. 

Time is a very real thing. We only have so much of it left. I’ve used mine so fucking poorly. Now I think about what I have left and it is staggering. I watched my Mother take care of my Father when his end came. It was pure love. I did my very best for her when it was her time, just a few short months later. I wish someone better than me could have been there for her. But it made me see the very real cycle of things. I can’t help but wonder who will help me when I go to die?

I can’t shake this terrible feeling my parents would be so disappointed in me.


What do I do next? 
How do I proceed in ways both small and not so small?



TL;DR - Parents died and I need to know how to move forward with my wreck of a life.

I just feel unloved and not worthy of being loved at this point.. i don’t know why but I do. I haven’t had sex in about 8 months, which is long as hell for me considering i have a high sex drive. I have had opportunities to have sex within the 8 months but just felt the time wasnt right or I was tired from work. 

To put things into perspective i’m a fit guy, work out about 3-5 days a week, have been told I’m physically attractive by women I’ve  met/already know.  I’m not a model but attractive enough.

137,"I worked at a popular fast food chain for about a month before throwing in the towel. The kitchen was filthy, barely anyone followed proper food handling guidelines, employer negligence caused all kinds of accidents (which were then promptly blamed on employees)... It was AWFUL.

&amp;#x200B;

In my first week, working drive-thru, we were quite busy and I asked if a pool of greasy, slippery water could be mopped up. No one bothered, and I was the only one working the front so I couldn't leave. I fell and hurt my leg, and had to go home early &amp; miss the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

The following week, after I had asked AGAIN AND AGAIN to ensure I had the time off, my employer tried to keep me later than I'd agreed to (wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't have something extremely time sensitive waiting after work). That same night, some idiot dropped the fry scooper into the cooking oil (or poured hot oil over the scooper, Idk) and didn't tell anyone. So, I reached down to grab it and scoop up some fries, right? And the damn thing gives me first and second degree burns! I don't know why it was drenched in boiling oil, but it was.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, I got my class schedule for college... I'm currently on academic probation because I withdrew from my classes without doing the paperwork / informing the registrar (my family lost a child). It's too late to ""fix it"", so I have to maintain a certain GPA and class load to remain enrolled at the school. I know now that I messed up, but we lost a three-year-old, so you'll forgive me if my brain was a bit of a mess at the time. Anyway, I digress... I realized my class schedule would no longer allow me to hold a part-time job (unless I stopped sleeping), so I gave my manager my two weeks' notice. Or, at least, I tried. 

&amp;#x200B;

My manager went on this rant about how I couldn't quit, we needed more people, no one is ever available, her life is so stressful already, and she doesn't need this! I tried again a few hours later, at which point she asked if I was willing to work there ""after school"". It was late at night, so I thought maybe she meant after the Fall semester had concluded in December. And I was like ""umm, maybe?"" But in my mind, I was still slated to quit on August 19th, the day I had told her would be my last. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it should have sent up a red flag that she'd refused--physically refused--to accept my written resignation, because there's all the proof I had that I was quitting. But yeah, she scheduled me the following week, after I had quit. At that point, I was so swamped with homework, I couldn't even get to my phone, let alone come in for a shift I didn't realize I'd been scheduled to work! So, lo and behold, I had about ten missed calls that weekend. But I told her I was quitting, and I'd read over my employee manual, highlighting the part where it said I was an ""at-will"" employee, and I was legally allowed to leave at any time, for any reason. I DID, so what gives??? Is it even legal to refuse to let me quit?

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to now--I was supposed to receive my final paycheck on the 22nd of August. It is now the 5th of September. I'd have been fine if they'd mailed it and it had taken a couple days (post can be slow; I feel that). But it's been a few weeks now, and I have a payment to make on the 19th. If that money is not in my account, I will be fucked. And I'm struggling to find the time to go in, since I've been put in all these ""workshops"" in addition to my classes (I have a learning disability, and after withdrawing, they want to make sure I'm getting whatever help I need--I'm not complaining, they just take up a lot of time). Soooo, what the hell do I do? Every time I call, no one answers and I'm forced to hang up. If I go in, I'm going to have to deal with an argument I don't have time for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just really sick of everything about this place. Is there some kind of government agency or body I can talk to about getting my money? I earned it. I did the work. Holding my check hostage seems like exactly the kind of stunt they'd pull, but also kind of illegal. Where do I go to seek help for this? ",06Sep2018,1

146," I've been struggling a lot at work lately and really could use some advice as to how to do better.

The company that I work at can only be described as my dream company. I've worked here for about 1.5 years, and I consider it my first real job out of college. The people that I work with are friendly, my boss is an incredible role model and leader that I have immense amounts of respect for, and I love what my company stands for and the work that we do.

Lately though, I've discovered that I've been dropping the ball a lot. They range from tiny things that I easily overlook when I have something else on my mind, but sometimes to mistakes that have been caught by users of our product. While I do fix my problems as soon as I discover them and always own up to them, my boss and coworkers have been calling me out almost daily over Slack, to the point where it's sort of become a joke within our department. While I do know that they are obviously only doing so out of the sake of the job, and I try my best to maintain a positive composure no matter what they say, it all adds up after a while. I've lost count of the times I've had to say ""I'm sorry, I promise that I'll do better next time"" in response to one of their messages.

Just a few minutes ago, I was called out once more by my boss in regards to another mistake that I've been consistently making for quite some time. To my horror, I discovered that it was a result of misunderstanding a part of our work flow for over a year, after clarifying it with another coworker. As usual, I owned up and confessed, and this time my boss told me that I would be meeting with him in person the next day, and expressed his disappointment in not asking about it for so long.

While I once again owned up to my mistake and agreed to meet, I'm terrified as to what could happen tomorrow. I was fired from my last job, my first job immediately out of college, due to incompetency and my inability to keep up with my boss' demands, and I was out of work for over a year before by some miracle, I was picked up by my current company. As such, I've been putting an immense amount of pressure on myself, and frequently beat myself up over causing trouble for other people, especially my boss. I mentioned that he is an incredible role model and leader, and it's in part because he has personally been trying to do whatever he can to help me improve amidst his incredibly busy schedule. For instance, I have been providing both start and end-of-day reports whenever I arrive/ leave work to help me with my organization. Sometimes, it feels as if he's a parent calling me out on my continuous mistakes as opposed to a boss.

Thank you for anybody that took the time to read over all of that. Along with my work problems, I've been having a lot other issues that, in conjunction with this, have been heavily affecting my life lately. But I feel as if my workplace will be a good place to start for now. Regardless as to what may happen tomorrow, I genuinely want to improve myself, and am open to any advice that anybody may have.

147,"This is going to be a long one: 

So, I’m 23F and graduated college 1.5 years ago. I had an environmental internship in college, moved to a different state for an environmental job and worked there for a year, then moved a town over and have worked there 6 months so far. 

I’ve been generally depressed (some highs and lows) for about 5 years. I have hated my jobs so far and they’ve all been fairly similar except subject matter. Working in an office, cubicle environment. Very political atmosphere. Mostly paper pushing. I’ve known for many years that I never wanted to work in a cubicle so I think that has contributed to my depression. It’s very hard to get through most days. I think I have high functioning depression and anxiety (but I also feel like I’m going to fall apart at any moment)

Anyways, when I graduated college I wanted to go to grad school but was convinced otherwise by my parents. 

I met a guy where I am now and we live together. However, our relationship has been rocky since he took a job with my dads best friend (which I was strongly against from the beginning, my dad is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, there’s a lot of history there and I didn’t want any family/relationship involvement). It sent me into a deeper depression. 

The job I’m at now has been rough. It’s been a good learning experience but the work environment is rough. My boss has jokingly told me he’s going to hit me, laughs hysterically when I make mistakes, tells me I should be kicked out of meetings, and is generally aggressive and confrontational. I do make 60k a year so I have a decent living but have a very hard time getting through each day. 

I just got a graduate assistantship at the local college here. It’s not very well known but I would be doing something I think I’m interested in and financially, it would be very affordable. However, I would barely be making any money through my graduate degree. 

Due to my depression and anxiety, to an extent, I have no friends where I am now and depend on my relationship WAY more than I should. If I wasn’t with my boyfriend I would have already moved away to a city/area with younger people. I live in a pretty rural area with mostly old people or college kids.

Also due to depression and anxiety, I have an extremely hard time making decisions and feel like I am losing myself/identity. Any guidance of advice for this decision would be greatly appreciated! 

If I were to go to grad school instead, I’m already past my 2 weeks notice so it’s a bit pressing. A third option would be to look into grad schools elsewhere (that I’d want to live) but then I’d have to become a resident so it would be further out. 

TL;DR I’m having a hard time making, what I think is a complicated decision to go to grad school or stay in a comfy job that I dislike. Grad school or stay in the job? ",06Sep2018,1

This statement was said during a conversation of laughter and jokes. It didn't ruin the conversation as she must of realised that I was not of the average intelligence but I can't help but look back on it.

The University of Minnesota is speaking to me so hard because their education program is incredible, the location is amazing (I love cold weather and lake shenanigans), and it would just honestly be a breathe of fresh air away from the STEM life. This is really messing with me because my whole high school career and $60,000+ of loans so far has gone towards a CSE degree that my family and especially my father is very proud of. My uncle is very well off and successful and texts me often about how awesome it is that my cousin and I do STEM, because we are the only two cousins out of a lot from my mother's side that are ""smart enough for it."" But dude, my brother studies film at a really good school in Boston and reads books on the train to and from the city, and I am so jealous of his lifestyle. He seems so happy, and I think reading books and doing my thing might be the right choice. It would be a lot cheaper at Minnesota, I would live on my own - or apply to be an RA - and just get the education degree along the way. It might be dumb, but it seems a lot more peaceful then the engineering life. I am doing an English minor currently and it is the one class I look forward to during the week: British Literature.

I said ""She wants to be a good momma, she said they were going to start trying soon"" and didn't really think anything of it because I thought my boss new about it, which was stupid to assume I guess. Now my coworker, who's been a decent friend of mine is super pissed at me and I don't know what to do. It was definitely not my place to say anything but I can't really be defensive right now to her. What should I do? I feel absolutely horrible about it. What should I do? I apologized to her (she's been texting me) and said that it just came out and I made a bad assumption, and that I wasn't trying to out her or anything. ",06Sep2018,1
156,"ive been lonely for the past 6 years. ive been able to suppress it. But its getting to me right now. Its gotten worse when i realise that im home alone everyday all day on the computer. Thats all i ever do. ive only spoken to my parents and maybe a store employee in the past year since i finished highschool. and yes i graduated at 20, ive failed and dropped out for a year but went back. so im isolated. I live outside of town and getting into it would be like an hour and a half bikeride. I dont have a car ether. Dont have a job, Ive applied online but haven't gotten any replies. 
If i were to have a job, a car, friends, a girlfirend i would feel alot better. 
Im really frustated with my life. And have thought about suicide but thats not what i really want. I just want to be happy. 
Im trying to get my license and with that maybe use my parents car once and a while to look for a job or to just get out and clear my head. And im looking foward to that.     I have faith in God but i guess my faith isnt enough for him to do anything and help me. 
I feel stuck and trapped and it makes me angry somtimes and i lash out at my parents and at people and ive put a bunch of holes in my wall. Last night i was pissed and threw my bike into a ditch and walked home. ",06Sep2018,1

158,I not really talk to girls and I think it’s time to get into some type of relationship. I’m jealous because pretty much every guy in my school has had a girlfriend and I haven’t.

How do I start talking to women? ,06Sep2018,1
159,I live fairly close to my university campus in apartments mostly full of students. These apartments are just 1 story and are what I can best describe as mini-houses attached to one another. Last week around 10pm and today around 10:30pm someone knocked on my door then nothing else. I checked both times after a minute or so from my window and no one was there. My lights were on both times and today so was the apartment just a few feet in front of mine. I don't know what I should do if this happens again. The only non-nefarious thing I can think of is a delivery driver (apartments are very close to campus) unable to see the addresses and taking a guess on knocking on a door that has lights.,06Sep2018,1
160,"Hello everyone, I'm a 16 year old male in highschool, and I really really need some advice on something important to me. This is going to be a long post, so if you read it all, I'd like to thank you a lot. 
     Okay, so I like a girl. I've been wanting to talk to her since freshman year, and now I'm a junior. My intention is to become her friend, and to be there for her when she needs help, and one of  the reasons I want to become her friend is because I saw her cry before (twice actually). She was in the hallway, sitting all alone with her head down, and her face was red. When I saw this, it really made me want to talk to her, but I didn't. I knew she was getting bullied, and I honestly felt bad for her. Now, before I move on, I just want to mention that I have absolutely no classes or lunch with her, and I only see her in the hallways. 
     Okay, so even though I only see her in the hallways, I've noticed that I see her quite often. It's very easy for me to spot her, because it seems that we always pass by each other when going to class. I also think it's important to mention that the first time I saw her is when my friend pointed her out to me on the first week of freshman year. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to her, but she did seem quite interesting. 
     Alright, so I know this girl is pretty shy. She's quiet and seems to mostly keep to herself, but when talking to her friends, I can see that she enjoys it, and has a lot to talk about. I know this because I had one of my friends talk to her last year. My friend told me that she is very nice, and that made me feel good to hear that. Also, I just want to mention that I do in fact know her name, so maybe it will come in handy when first talking to her? 
     Okay okay, so now I'll talk about what I really want to talk about. I need to start making some moves and actually do something, but what should I do? The only thing I can think of is holding the door open for her, and hopefully she can thank me in return, but that definitely won't be enough to become her friend. In fact, today when we were in PE, I was sitting down, and holding a door slightly open to a cool room, because the breeze felt nice. I saw her coming in my direction, to go through the door I was holding open, so since I couldn't get up to actually hold it open like a gentleman, I pushed it open, and then she went through. However, after she went through the door, she kinda made a weird gesture, and it left me wondering why she did that. I didn't mean to make her feel uncomfortable, perhaps the way I pushed the door open was rude? I just wanted to help her. Also, we are in the same PE hour, but not the same PE class, in case you were wondering.
     I just don't know what to do. I like her, I want to be her friend, and I want to talk to her. I don't think I should just randomly approach her in the hallways, because wouldn't that be weird? I feel that I must talk to her in the perfect situation, so it won't be awkward for me or her. If you guys read all of this, thank you so much. I really hope you all can give me some advice on what the heck to do. I feel like time is running out, and I need to act fast.",06Sep2018,1
161,"       Lets start by saying that I'm not sure if I should distance myself from him for a while or not, and if you have any advice or input that would be greatly appreciated. The more the paragraphs down, the weirder it gets.

      My friend is very weird. He got jealous earlier because I said I had another best friend besides him. He ask who is it and I said who it was. He then said he was cringing because I told him about my other friend before. He was cringing because my other friend liked new rap music. He then said ""you know how i feel about it""... SO?! If you don't like someone because off one aspect about them, then you have a bad trait.

      He likes to say ""I love you"" alot, like alot. He's not being ironic about it, its not bro love either. I genuinely think he has a crush on me. Which makes me very uncomfortable. First off I'm not gay and second I'm fifteen and he's nearly eighteen, isn't that just a little weird. He calls me ""baby"" and ""babe"" to. I told him I think its weird but he continues anyways.
 
      He's a furry and not the ""ok"" kind neither. I have nothing against furries, in fact i myself might be one. But he is on the side of the fandom that likes animals way to fucking much. He sends me drawings that depict bestiality and it makes me fucking sick. He also has two body pillows of anthro animals, which is a bit strange. 


     Gore, he is into gore. I like fake gore from horror movies and stuff but they're horror movies! This guy is into real gore, he goes on best gore, death addict, r/watchpeopledie and plenty more. I personally hate real gore. when he describes it when I'm clearly uncomfortable from it, it makes me want to puke. I've seen my fair share of gore on the internet and I can't even last one to two videos. It makes me feel hopeless.

      He looks at cp. I don't know if he enjoys it, but he said it makes him sick. But the thing is ,if it makes you sick why the fuck are you looking at it?

      I guess that's it for the rant. His mom was very neglectful growing up and his family wasn't really there for him. I can kind of understand why he's like this. Should I disance myself, scratch him out of my life, or stay his friend?

165,"I don't really know where this belongs entirely, but if anyone can help with some advice on gaining the trust someone had in you even after a second try? My ex and I broke up about over a week ago and it was for reasons like I wasn't being very communicative towards the end of the relationship. It felt to her like she was the only one moving forward in life. The more stuff on her plate were added, and the more I was doing better to get my stuff straight in life. The less she felt like I was there for her and us. She felt in a constant loop of wanting to always help and I did too but I didn't make my help very obvious or present to her. She felt like I was taking and not giving. Understandable why someone would get tired of it after a while.. I know I can love her the way she wants. And its not just for her. I also want to do it. 

Before we had broken up, I told her I wanted to be a better boyfriend to her. Later that came up a week later while she was ending things with me. She told me she didn't believe a single word I said.. I truly do love her and I want to save us. But she doesn't want to try again. And I think it's because  nobody wants to get hurt or feel the same way again. And for a third time. I'm more than words though. I really am going to cherish her. But I just need another shot and a chance to get in again. She doesn't want to talk to me for a while so she had time to get over me.

168,"So I made friends with my assistant g/m at the job I was hired at back in April (hired at 10.30) . Mind you, I am a store associate (basically the lowest on the chain). We used to joke around together at work, like throwing pieces of paper and stuff at each other, or making jokes- at one point we had a store-wide water gun fight going on and I walked into the office just to squirt him with the gun. Basically, work friends. 
Phone numbers are in a big directory in the computer and all managers have everyone’s numbers in case there’s a call-out and they need help or whatever. So he texts me one day and asks me to come in for a cover and at the end of the night he texted to thank me for coming in.
From there, we talked, a lot. Like, literally daily. We started flirting a lot and even hung out once. Neither one of us could’ve been fired, as long as it was kept professional at work. 
However, I decided to tell him that I was fine talking once in a while, but didn’t want to flirt or hang out anymore, and he told me he understood.
So the other day, he asked if I wanted extra hours and if I wanted to do an overnight shift (which I’d never done before) so I was like “alright”. Left work at 7am and went in again for a 4-12, then came in two hours early the next day (a call out, so they needed coverage for an extra two hours) and then he asked if I could come in Monday (my day off) for a 9 hour shift.  He gave me a few reward card things we receive for working hard or going above and beyond, etc. and I thought that was it.
Yesterday, i got a text in the middle of training in my last position in the store that he gave me a raise to $11. $11???? That’s literally more than 3/4 of my coworkers, even those who have been there longer than me. I asked him why and he told me it was because I kept coming in when I was off and helping and volunteered for an overnight. I work my ass off over here, but not enough to constitute a .70 raise that puts me above all of my coworkers. 
Idk what I’m asking for exactly.. I just want to know if this is attempted incentive, or what? Or if this is just weird or if I shouldn’t take the raise? I just want to hear some thoughts.

171,"Hi Reddit,

As the subject suggests, I have two part-time jobs, both of which I've been working at for about 3 months. Detailed as followed:

1. The first job is at my dream company: I love everything about the company's msision, the staff, the company culture, etc. 

2. The second job is related to my field, but it's definitely more corporate and doesn't quite align with my career goals. That being said, the perks are quite nice: 2x the pay of the first job, work-from-home, flexible schedule, plus benefits + 401K if I go full time. Right now I'm working part time.

&amp;#x200B;

The kicker is, I got hired by both at the same time. I was previously unemployed, so getting two part time jobs seemed feasible, and it seemed possible to balance them both. Now, they're both impressed with the work that I do, and asking me to make more of a full-time commitment. I've already started commiting more hours to Job #1 (almost full time). However, they haven't offered me a full-time posititon, a salary, or any of the perks of being full-time. I'm weary of them cutting my hours or never paying me what I'm worth, as we're still working off of my contract as a part-time employee. They do seem to insinuate that I will \*eventually\* be offered a full time position, but I'm worried it won't happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Job #2 is less of my dream job, but great in the perks that it offers (re: flexible, high pay, etc) and still interesting enough that I'm willing to do the work.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, I would do both part-time, as I would make a significant amount more money. However, the stress of working two jobs is really taking its toll, so I'm wondering if cutting down to one job would be worthwhile. If I had to choose one job, it would be Job #1, but only if they were willing to offer me full time and salary.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I know I should talk to Job #1, tell them the truth, and ask them for what I want. Unfortunately, we're in the midst of a really stressful project that ends in October, so I don't think it's a conversation that can happen until the end of the project as upper management is stressed &amp; strapped for time. I also haven't told them about Job #2. I want to play my cards right.

&amp;#x200B;

With Job #2, I've been deferring and telling them that I am committed to freelance work until October, buying time until I can make a decision. I don't want to give up this job as it has the potential to offset Job #1 in case they don't give me full time, and also offers a significant pay boost in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

Yikes! I'm sick of feeling deceptive and overworked. Advice needed!",06Sep2018,3

176,"Its getting ridiculous. Im happily married with a child. We dated over 5 years ago. I havent seen him in 3 or 4. Why can't I get him out of my head? Its not like I want to be with him or anything of the sort but I cant help but think about him often and what he is up to and so on.
-backstory; I was 15 and he was 17. Lost our virginities to each other. We were long distance but did everything to make it work. He was my everything. He was amazing to me and I was a total piece of shit to him for no fault of his, I was just going through a tough time. I am now married to his ex best friend. My ex and I were together for 10 months before he broke up with me the day before I turned 16. I loved him then and still do in a way to this day but not romantically but the breakup crushed me and I reacted by acting out. 7 months after the fact I was brutally assaulted while out with friends and was hospitalised for 3 days and was told I had a low chance of having children after surgery. My now husband reached out to me while I was in the hospital unbeknownst to him. We began to talk and he was there for me during the hardest time of my life and we started dating now we are married with a son yet I still can't stop thinking and dreaming about and missing my ex.
 It doesn't help that I hear about him all the time from my husband's best friend who is still a part of that group. I miss the old days when everyone hung out. I miss him in my life. He was my best friend. He was an amazing person to have around. Why can't I forget him? Why is it a punch in the gut every time I hear his name? Why can't I just stop and leave him in the past?

179,"Little background: 
 I’m 16 years old, currently living with my siblings, mom and dad are out of the picture. (They’re divorced) I take care of my own finances, and not as in “oh I’m 16 and I buy my own clothes! My parents are awful!”, but as in I pay my own rent, my food, utilities, etc etc. I also live in Canada as a citizen. 



So long story short, I was born in Canada lived here my elementary years, then moved to other countries. I transferred from the TDSB (public school curriculum in Toronto), to the American SAT system. I studied the SAT system for my middle school years, and my junior and sophomore years. I moved back to Canada in April, after finishing grade 10 in the other county. Since I  have to attend school until I’m 18 by law, I went to school here and finished grade 10, again.(Kind of) 


I have always been a straight A student, never failed any of my classes. When I came here to show them my report cards and papers as proof that I finished grade 9&amp;10, expecting to receive credits for my work, they didn’t even bother looking at them. I went to my counsellor and he said that those papers didn’t matter. Obviously I freaked out because all my hard work went into vain, and I was at risk of repeating a couple years, which is a HUGE deal for me. My counsellor then continued and said that I could get my credits if I worked hard, and MAYBE depending on the teacher, the teacher would give me the credit. I took that, and I worked really hard. I went into school, had the teacher say we were taking science tests next week on subjects I wasn’t there for. I study and take the tests anyway. All my classmates, including honour student classmates, get grades in the range of 75-90, at best, on the tests, while I get a 97 and a 100.  Counsellor asks about how I’m doing, I tell him my grades, he asks my teacher, and she goes “it was an open book test.” Now what gets to me here is, I AM PRETTY SURE IT WASNT AN OPEN BOOK TEST, WTF. 

 
Also note that this school is an annual school, meaning finals are off the subjects covered from September to June. When I was in another country, studying a completely different curriculum. 


Finals come, and most my teachers tell me that they just think of me as a monitor, and my history teacher wasn’t letting me do assignments. My English teacher said he wouldn’t give me the credits for the class. Only 2 of my teachers were leaning towards giving me the credits so I got upset and I told my counsellor and told him if that was the case I wasn’t going to take the finals, and he said that wasn’t an issue and I wasn’t expected to take them. So I didn’t take them, although I tried to study for them but there were just too many things to cover in a really short period of time.  
Now I already have finished grade 10 in the SAT and I was very pleased with my mark and gpa. Fast forward a couple weeks, and I get my report card in the mail from that school, and what do I see? I got an F in every subject. 0 credits. My English teacher legit wrote “x does not meet the expectations of the English curriculum.”All my work, just gone. 


Now it’s the beginning of grade 11, I haven’t chosen my classes yet, because I wasn’t even informed by my counsellor that I was supposed to chose them in June, and everything is a mess. 


And to add on to everything, I have 0 friends, literally ZERO. I used to be very social back in the other countries, made friends very easily, and I went out almost every weekend. Now,  I get name called and I get stares. The one friend I made groped me. I already suffer issues, such as depression and eating disorders, and I’ve dealt with sexual assault multiple times, so I don’t cope well with experiences as such. 


Fast forward to a couple days back, I called my mom, crying to her about my situation. I asked her if I could go back and finish my high school and she said she would be more than pleased to have me, but said she couldn’t pay for my school fees. My school fees in the other country cost about 3.7k to 4K dollars per year.  I tell my dad and he says he’s only willing to pay 700 dollars per year for my school. So in order to go back, I need to save money for my school. I talk to my brother, and he offers paying next year but said he can’t afford this year, so now I need to save 4k dollars for my school plus about 700$ for my plane ticket. GREAT! 

 
I make 700 dollars a month, 350 goes to rent and I’m left with 350 to last me a month. It’s barely enough for my food and clothing. (Winter is coming and I have no winter clothes haha) 


Now the plan is I’ll send her half the fees, get enrolled online, then once I get the other half I go back to the other country in December (or when I have the money) to attend school. 


The only way I could afford it, is if I work a full time job, and possibly try to get a part time job as well.  If I get a full time job I wouldn’t be able to attend school here, so if my plan were to fail, I’d have to repeat a year, and I’m already at risk of repeating a year because of credits they didn’t count. Thankfully, my school in the other country offers online schooling. So I told my mom to enrol me in the online schooling and pay for me, for now, and I’d pay her back by the end of September, just so I could be enrolled in a school. She refuses and says she can’t afford it. Meaning I wouldn’t be enrolled until end of September/ beginning of October. Nice. 

Staying here is really depressing me for many reasons other than school. My mom isn’t the best mother, but we are really close. I’ve never lived without her until now, so that’s really affecting me. I also have two younger siblings, aged 10 and 6, that live with her. I really hate my life without them. My grandma is also in that country, and my grandma and I have a GREAT relationship. She’s the mother my mom failed to be. Adding onto the list, my boyfriend is also there. Not to mention, in that country I wouldn’t have to pay for anything other than my school, which is a huge burden off my shoulders.

Do I risk repeating a year, and not attend school here to be able to work and afford moving back? What’s the best thing to do? 


Another note: what started this is that I don’t think I’d be able to work well in certain classes (English and math, most important classes lmao)  here, as the curriculum is WAY too different. Having tried it, I don’t think I’d be able to get the grades I need to fulfill my dreams.

182,I think my relationship with my boyfriend is coming to an end. We've been fighting a lot and he's been giving me silent treatments that really fw my mental health and he's stated he'd cut me out of his life completely if need be. So now I'm preparing myself for the end. We've been together 1.5 years and have been through a lot. A few months into our relationship I found out I had herpes which ya know is a pain in the ass which also scares me about going back into the dating scene (I'd disclose of course). And I just moved in with him for work and if we were to break up I'd have to quit. I'm defeated and tired of all this mentally staining bullshit and dont know if breaking up would be easy on me. I'm just afraid and stressed and still in love with him. ,06Sep2018,1
183,"We have been in a relationship and living together for about four years. Recently a co-worker and friend of my boyfriend who is happily married to his wife had discussed both having a one time fling outside of their relationship. The co-worker offered to my boyfriend to essentially swap partners for the fling. I would sleep with the co-worker and my boyfriend would sleep with the co-workers wife. Everyone seemed to be okay with this deal except for me. It's really not something I would want to participate in. 

When I told my boyfriend that I am not interested in the idea (and sobbed like an idiot at the thought of him being open to having sex with someone else) he seemed genuinely very okay with not doing it and reassured me that he does not truly have the desire to be with anyone else. I was very at ease about the whole thing after we talked but then I started reading about poly relationships and now I have some unsettling feelings about what I could all mean.

 I am worried despite his genuine indifference toward doing it or not that I am for lack of a better phrase holding him back. Is this like a bad omen foreshadowing the future of our relationship?

 I truly believe that he is being honest about be okay not doing it and I don't think would lie about it if thats not how he really felt. Is there something wrong with me for not wanting him or I to participate? Am I being a bad girlfriend for asking him not to do it? Am I just being too uptight or overthinking things? What does it mean that he was so open to the idea? I'm not really even sure what questions I really have or what kind of advice I'm looking for. Maybe I just need some opinions?

Side note: the co-worker who wants to sleep with me I don't find attractive at all in the slightest bit even if I did I still don't think I would want to but his wife is good looking.

&amp;#x200B;

We are a family of 5. 3 children: me (25), my brother (22), and my sister (19). We have grown up as a happy family, middle class, never had any issues with money. They taught us good morals, not to judge people based on what they wear, always be yourself, and of course: ""you can always come to us when there is a problem"". Basic parenting, and I think a lot of kids around the world had had the same experience. Now we are all adults, all of us are moved out of the house. And my mother is taking it very hard. Me and my sister (who live the closest and therefore meeting her more often) are seeing that this is putting our already sick/tired mother down. 

What do I mean with sick? Last summer, my mom had a burnout. Smashed into the famous wall. She was always stressed, she was always worried, anxious. She has always has issues with control. She always has the need to feel like she controls everything around her. If she doesn't feel like that, she will panic and lash out. 

My parents never wanted to talk about mental illness. Or totally disregard it. 6 years ago I went through an awful breakup, which led me into diagnosed depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Since I grew up with the idea that I can go to my parents for everything. I tried to tell them that I didn't feel good. That the reason that my apartment looked like a mess was because that I was very tired and I didn't feel well at all. Their only answer was a hissing ""cheer up, you have nothing to be sad about"". I instantly recoiled from the aggravation, and never asked again. I could see that my younger siblings knew something was up, but knew that the parents words are law, and didn't say anything. A couple of years later, my sister said to me that she knew I was ill, but she was too scared to say anything. She also had a similar issue. My sister suspected that she had an obsessive disorder. She could stand and lock/unlock the front door for hours, because she felt that ""it didn't lock correctly"". She, like me, tried to tell about to my mother. And again, my mother completely dismissed it and said something like ""oh it's just some regular thoughts, everyone has them"". My sister, who had been losing hours of sleep because of this suspected disorder, was devastated. 

We also feel that my mother is very manipulative. Big arguments were common when we grew up. About basic stuff that all families argue about. My sister had a HUGE argument with my parents a year ago, when I had to act as a diplomat to get everyone to calm down. (Yes, I was the most grown up person in that house that evening). Next day, my mom entered my sisters room, and my sister thought they were gonna solve everything, make peace. Everything that came out of my mothers mouth was: ""are you ready to apologize to me?"". Completely disregarding her own faults, expecting my sister to take all the blame. She also says things like: ""I know what you say to your friends about me"". Or ""I know that you are lying to your friends about me and saying terrible stuff"".

  
Everyone in my family knows that our mother has these issues, but no one talks about it. Our father gets a lot of blame. He gets yelled at, and gets to take a lot of stuff. My dad speaks to me when we are alone that ""your mother is having a rough time right now"" and ""I get to take a lot of blame"" and ""she is very stressed"". My father had a physical injury a couple of years ago and ended up unemployed for several periods of time. This took another toll on my mother, and the economy. He got a lot of bad talk from my mother because of this. He is now back in work again, but the problems remain. My mother is stressed, anxious, very often sick and with migraines. My father says that he think our mom is having a life crisis. That she doesn't know what to do with life anymore, since the kids are all moved out. The more reason I think to get her into therapy, but alas, instant recoil.  


Me and my sister are reaching a breaking point. We feel like our mother is very close to a burnout again. We fear that the last burnout made her (suspected) illnesses worse. The control issues, manipulative thoughts, and even bouts of paranoia. I have spoken to my dad about she/them needing therapy, and he instantly recoils from those thoughts. Again, with the idea that we don't talk about mental illness, and that it is something bad. 

How can we help our parents at this time? We feel like they NEED help (especially my mother) or crashes are gonna happen again. Both my sister and I said that we wouldn't be surprised if they were getting a divorce. With an intervention we feel like we're not gonna be taken seriously and that both of them are going to deny their issues.

198,"Hello.  
  
I've been seeing a guy for a few months now, officially in a relationship with him (and having known him since late April) because I've been trying to try something more sustained. I'm a gay man who's 21.  
  
This guy I've been seeing has been a new experience for me, someone very different in personality than I usually go for in that he's very positive and joking all the time but also a big smoker.  
  
I've got no problem with weed every so often but he's someone who uses it almost every day, and along with that uses rellos (wraps made from tobacco leaves) along with them and smokes tobacco when he's out of weed. I DO have a problem with the tobacco, hate the smell, and  have told him so. He wasn't willing to change at all, despite my best efforts, until recently; we've been trying to have sex multiple times in the past month or so and he's not been able to keep it up every time. I try to be patient with him but it makes me very self-conscious (that I'm not turning him on) and upset he couldn't stay hard even though he assured me it wasn't me and that he was just nervous, and hasn't had this happen before. I talked to a few friends about it and one mentioned he could be cheating which I don't believe. He ended up going to his doctor who recommended he cut back on the tobacco (which he's taking steps to do).  
  
My issue is: along with the sex issue, I feel sometimes his joking goes too far and feels like more of actual digs at me. I begin to feel really self conscious and have told him a few times how sometimes he's hurting me. I confronted him last night and asked if he could please be more positive and supportive of me, and apologized for hurting me but said he didn't know how to draw the line on what was okay for him to joke about. I wasn't sure how to answer.  
  
Having no sex and these aforementioned issues has been a struggle recently because I've felt like I've wanted to break up. I've had quite a few hookups in my past and many of them have tried to get in contact with me recently, moreso than usual, and it's been testing my willpower and patience not to break up with him for some temporary fun. My problem is: being single and hooking up is a lot of temporary fun leads to a lot of crying lonely nights.

Police come and don’t ask any questions about what happened and just get info and write it down then send us on our way. I get a call from the other person’s insurance agent and email showing the appraisal from a body shop where it is $1800 worth of damage (including parts and labor). Um. What? The appraisal sheet has front bumper, side fender and all this other crap that I had nothing to do with. Insurance person originally said that she wanted to work it out between us and not file it, but the box truck is higher up than that corolla- there’s no way I hit anything but the mirror (I didn’t even know I had hit her. That’s because only the mirror was hit and I didn’t feel it). There’s no paint transfer on the truck or her car or anything and I’m not paying for damage to her vehicle that I didn’t do so she and that body shop can get one over on me. 

What should I do? I don’t want to file it on the insurance of the truck because I was using it from a friend. Help!",06Sep2018,1
213,"I’m 18 and I recently did a car accident where my mum’s car got destroyed and 2 passengers got injured. My insurance can’t cover me cause of a distraction of my dad choosing the contract where it says that &lt;26 years old drivers are not covered. He feels like it’s his complete fault (but is MY fault), and they have to completely pay for the injuries of my friends that were with me.  I feel like if I have destroyed my family but at the same time I don’t really know what to do to react and help them as much as I possibly can. At the moment I’m just a guy that is not able to smile and nothing more. (sorry for my bad english)",06Sep2018,3
214,"First of all I'm gonna apologize because this is going to be a long ass thread.

I'm 22, F and I live with my dad (it's common in our culture, children usually move out of the parents' home when they get married) we live in an apartment the middle of the town, so it's close to get anywhere.

Enter my brother (29 y.o.), lives with mom in our house at the suburbs. We live separately because it's easier for me &amp; dad to get to work, whereas my brother &amp; mom at the suburbs because he's been unemployed for years and my mom doesn't work anymore.

I am extremely uncomfortable at my brother's presence. I can't seem to be at ease when he's around, especially when he's sleeping over at my apartment. I'd get anxious and can't sleep the whole nights. The anxiety is really bad that I'd get very sweaty, feeling nauseous, and it's hard for me to breathe at times. The reason why I'm feeling very uneasy is because of the things he said to me when I was growing up. It grows into me like a trauma that makes me hate him so much.

  
When I was small, I can't remember my age but apparently my brother was in his 5th or 6th grade. He would watch hentai on the living room TV while I was in the room. I don't know how but I knew I wasn't supposed to watch that stuff, so I pretended not to see what he was watching, but he kept talking to me, seemed to be fishing for my attention towards him and what he was watching.

When I was in middle school, I was in my tomboy phase. My older sister (now 32 y.o.) likes to wears dresses and stuff. One day, I was minding my own business while in the room, my siblings were talking about me and my tomboy appearance in a small voice, and I heard my brother said ""If she were as girly as you, I'd want to be with her."" and my sister brushed him off, ""You're crazy.""

When I was in 12th grade, my brother picked me up from cram school and drive me home. In the car, he said ""How is your skin so light? If you were milk, I'd drink you up."" I was left confounded and can't find my voice to reply to him, so I was quiet for the rest of the ride.

There was more but thankfully, nothing physical ever happened. I don't know if he remembers these things but I do, and I remember them very clearly.

&amp;#x200B;

More about my brother, in my family he is ""the other"". You know that one member of the family who is very different from the rest. He distances himself from us, rarely answers when my parents asked him about how his day was, and often snaps at my mom when she's pushing him to tell more.

These days it's really rare for us to interact with him. He spends the day playing games and god knows what. His last job was back in 2016 as a contract employee, then the employer wasn't having him anymore. I think he never does well at work, remembering that his contracts were never extended or promoted to a regular employee.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I'm in a big dilemma because I don't want to cause more trouble for my parents (they keep blaming themselves for my brother's misbehavior) by telling them about my problems. My parents are in their early 60s, and I want to keep them as happy as possible, so I want to keep them away from this trouble of mine.

My parents only know that I'm uncomfortable around my brother, but they don't know the reason. Hence why my parents always tell me that I shouldn't be that way towards him because he's my brother and to ""deal with it"". I don't blame them for saying so, though.

He never said anything weird to me anymore since I began college, but neither of us feel like talking to each other.

I just want to control the great discomfort I still experience but I can't forget the things he said to me.",06Sep2018,0
215,"I think I’m being paranoid and I need advice. 

For the past week I can’t stop wondering if he’s cheating. I have no idea where this feeling came from and it’s terrifying me.

Nothing major has happened apart from the fact that we’ve just spent about 10 days away from each other (I was on vacation). Maybe I’m just missing him?! 

We met up on Tuesday for dinner and drinks and it was wonderful as usual. No issues there. Although I noticed that he didn’t snuggle me in bed that night. 

Last night he told me he was going for dinner with friends (originally we were supposed to meet last night but he rescheduled work so he could meet me Tuesday and do dinner with friends last night ). Thing is, this morning he didn’t respond to my text until lunch. Obviously we both don’t respond within seconds and I know people can be busy, but my mind won’t stop imagining that the reason he took so long today is because ‘dinner with friends’ was actually a date and he didn’t look at his phone because he was with someone else.

He’s a really good guy and nothing about his behavior or character suggests cheating. He’s a terrible and cute liar and we never ever fight, our arguments are mature discussions, so I really don’t think he’d be capable. BUT for whatever reason the idea is there and now I’m finding stupid reasons for concern (I.e dinner with friends and no text today) 

I usually trust him completely, we often give each other plenty of personal space and I have no idea why I feel this all of a sudden. I’ve been cheated on in the past and have lost some very important people in my life through tragic circumstances so maybe I’ve got abandonment issues?

Anyone have any advice on how to put my mind at ease? 

TL;DR I’m worried my boyfriend is cheating but with no real evidence.

219,"Title says it all.

I’m worried about this linguistics class I’m taking, but I need it to graduate and there’s only one prof teaching it.

He’s an older man who has a lot of experience in the field (he even joked, “I’ve been doing it before you were all born!”), however others say that his professor never gives out a grade higher than B+ and the tests are apparently hard and confusing and that he will not give partial marks for the tests and wants the exact answer, even if yours is a seemingly good alternative. They also say that he doesn’t like it when students argue with him over answers, and that he will not have it.

On the first day, he said that he likes people and will probably end up liking everyone in the class at the end of the term. But he says that liking someone will not be an initiative to mark better because he says that the rumours about him and his class are true and that he expects good work regardless or whether he likes someone or not. So far, I pegged him as a soft-spoken old man and he’s kind of frail (imagine him saying this with an old, soft-spoken voice with a bit of an accent) but I’m intimidated by him because of the rumours and him confirming that he’s as strict as others claim he is.

I know this is university and it’s a 3rd year class and I’m expected to know my stuff, but people I know personally and others who have rated him anonymously online make him out to be one of the most brutal professors. I’m not even kidding. To keep my privacy, I’m just regurgitating what other students are saying about him.

I digress, so far we have had one assignment and my friend was also confused by it, but she said she did her best. I did my best, too. It’s only been the second day but I’m so intimidating  by a man who doesn’t really look that harmful physically and doesn’t have an intimidating voice when he says, “I’m strict”. Regardless, I am still worried about having a good relationship with my professor and also being able to do good in class if others say he is a hard prof to take. What should I do?",06Sep2018,1

222,"If there is a better sub for this question, please let me know so I can cross post. 

I have wanted a new doctor ever since my doctor of 25 years (since birth) retired. A nurse practitioner took over for him. She is nice but not as good as him and it’s on the other side of town. So I did some research and found a practice near me in my network.

I have been feeling unhealthy, and depressed a bit lately so I was very excited to maybe get some things on track. Throughout my visit yesterday, there was a slow burn of disappointment. They took me back almost immediately which is great, but then after seeing the nurse I waited 20 more minutes only to see a nurse practitioner student. By the time my actual doctor appeared, I had been in he exam room for 1.5 hours. Whatever, I thought, they are probably busy today not a huge deal. The doctor was friendly but she kept the NP in the room the entire 7 minutes she met with me. 

One of the reasons I was excited about this visit is because I was finally going to be asking for a therapist referral after years of wanting to try it. I think it would help me to live a better life all around. She did refer me, but kept it very short as I said. 

Here is where things got interesting. I am prescribed vyvanse and have been since I was 10. In the past I have had to sign “contracts” stating to my doctor that I understand it is a controlled substance and I promise not to sell it or give it to anyone else and that I understand the risks. So I was not surprised when the doctor mentioned that in the visit. When the Dr left a nurse came and handed me the contract. This contract was no lie FOUR pages long lol. The form lumped together “opioids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants”. This immediate miffed me. But I began initialing each statement. Then I started seeing “I will not drive on this medication”, “I will not operate machinery” which OK for benzo or opioids I would totally understand, but how does that apply to ADD meds? Then there is a statement saying “I consent to mandatory random drug testing and I understand that if I fail to provide a unprescribed substance free sample”... they reserve the right to drop me as a patient. This was annoying to me but again I just figured whatever they probably just say that so they can if they suspect you are abusing other medications or drugs. 

I am not yet finished completing the contract when a nurse comes in, and sits at the computers . She then tells me I need to provide a urine sample. I say, for what? She says a drug screening. “WTF” I am thinking. All of this build up and disappointment is seething inside me and I just start tearing up out of frustration. Then I begin having a small panic attack and couldn’t control myself from crying or rapidly breathing. The nurse was very nice and understanding and called the doctor back in to speak with me. There is now THREE people in the room. 

Dr apologizes for upsetting me on the first visit and walks me to the front desk. Schedules me an appointment to come back a few weeks later to finish the drug screening and schedules a three month out appointment. 

Should I stay with this dr? And if I don’t and never go back for the test will they flag me or something? I don’t do any drugs, used to smoke weed a bit but haven’t in a long time so it’s not like I’m worried about testing positive. It’s just the principal of it. 

Has anyone else gone through this or heard of this? I realize it is probably an insurance liability thing bc of the opioid crisis, but it seems super strange to drug test on a NEW PATIENT appointment. 

I have health insurance that my parents pay 600 dollars a month for for 4 people. I will then be on my work insurance which is anthem blue cross and will pay 200 some a month. To me when I am paying this much for private healthcare, that policy is straight bullshit. ",06Sep2018,1

Also, I have a desk job so when I sit for too long (an hour) my knees begin to get that electric shock feeling that I felt with sciatica.

My roommate is around 39, I'm 25, and I recently moved into his large apartment since he lives alone and felt it was a waste of space since there's two bedrooms.

I feel like I'm being a bit violated in my space. I pay rent here, and I have my own space. I approached him to let him know I intended to have overnight guests as to not surprise him, but he said that I couldn't.

234,"At the end of last year I came to the realization that at the time I had too many things started without enough being finished. Most of these were relating to games or books, so over the Christmas break I doubled down and finished a lot of the titles I was planning to finish. This helped get those unfinished items off my mind and allow me to more safely consider new ventures moving forward. So, GREAT!

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today and I find myself in a somewhat similar but different boat. I've started new projects in both my personal and professional realms (even some overlap) but find myself sort of stuck not knowing how best to approach working on each of these. So far I've mainly been taking an ""highest priority"" approach, but feel that it's led to possibly chasing fires and, once again, only small progress being made across the board in each project area instead. I think part of this may be due to the open ended nature of some of the nature of some of the projects, but I'd like to obtain an objective viewpoint and see what advice can be provided for managing my own expectations of progress, time, and completion.   


For context, the project I currently consider ""active"" include:

* Updating a public spreadsheet for Starfinder character usage. Someone else online created the sheet but eventually stopped updating. I took up the torch and have been updating with new content. I'm around 90% complete with the latest updates to the game, but the last 10% is also where the more time consuming changes are being discovered. My recent plan was to finish this up ASAP and release so that I'll have it off my plate. 
* Developing a web front-end for a simple pipeline tool I developed within AWS. The original POC pipeline for this tool works and was able to be developed in a relatively short time, but I've never coded a web front-end before, so there is a learning curve associated to this part of the project. This is currently on the back burner and hasn't really had any progress in maybe 2 months but I feel it could possible be wrapped up for a V1 release within a month if isolated dedicated effort was made.
* Studying for an upcoming assessment that I will be conducting for work. The assessment is within the same area that I have worked before, but it's also not. It's switching from security review and configuration auditing to penetration testing. They're similar, but worlds apart and there is a lot of content and practical experience I need to obtain in order to feel more competent in this realm. This mainly needs a lot of time to get up to speed and while the acceptance level for initial results can arguably be low, the amount of time to get to the ""professional"" level I aim for is far, far higher. I have an assessment for this coming up relatively soon and still feel there is a LOT I need to study and practice...
* Learning Japanese has been an ongoing task since around February of this year. I'm mainly working through WaniKani and KaniWani with some Bunpro on the side as time permits. Overall it's been going well and I enjoy this new type of challenge, but it's regularly at least a few hours each day to at least catch up on pending SRS reviews and lesson items. 
* I operate as part of a raid team in FFXIV that operates at least 9 hours weekly. This is static days and times, so fairly easy to manage, but still contributes to weekly/daily available time loss. It's been a lot of fun and a good break from everything else, so I'd rather not have to drop this, if possible.
* Ongoing home remodeling and repair activities. We just got back from vacation and found our water heater busted, so a lot of time recently is being spent coordinating repairs, discussing insurance details, and planning subsequent changes to move things back down there once it's all fixed. Hopefully the end for this is not far off, but it's still a high priority ongoing task. 
* Then there are all the other normal things such as 40 hour work week, groceries, housekeeping, and so forth. ",06Sep2018,1

243,"I broke up with a girl not so long ago because she cheated on me and afterward, she called me on 3 different phone numbers, begging for me to forgive her. I kept telling her no and blocking her on social media, only to get harassed even more until I put my foot down and told her that if she kept this up, I would call the police on her and tell the police that she keeps harassing me. Afterward, she was very apologetic and told me that I wouldn't hear from her ever again. I haven't heard from her since.

After the incident happened, I was only more paranoid of looking at my phone because I was afraid of seeing her trying to contact me again. Even when my actual friends contact me, I still feel scared about contacting them because maybe they will be my ex-girlfriend in disguise asking for me, they remind me of my ex-girlfriend and even though I haven't heard from her since breaking up with her and putting my foot down. I am a bit paranoid of answering calls from people (even if it is job offers, recruiters, or family) out of fear of that girl trying to contact me, even though she has not. Maybe it is PTSD from the event, and I am just scared that it may happen again, even though it probably won't because I'm planning on staying single for a while, but anyway...

How would I treat this kind of paranoia? Or if it is paranoia, how would it be dealt with? I am a bit fearful of getting in contact with my old friends, out of fear that this will happen again. I love and care for all of my friends (even though we are many miles away) but I am scared of contacting them out of fear this event will happen.

245,"So she knows exactly how to spot and avoid people who follow it. Warning, punctuation may be awful.

I'm 22 and my girlfriend is 19. For about a year when I was 20, I believed the red pill like it was some kind of hidden text that needed to be spread. There were so many ""Examples"" of it in the real world to my now biased brain, and so now I'm creepily watching and analysing every word that my bored cashier is saying to me, so I can go home and type a field report for validation from other ""Alphas"". I've driven well out of my way to the mall to show off my sick gainz to what are probably laughing teenagers and adults who don't give a shit anyway.   


I guess a little part of my soul never died in that forum, so I started looking out to other subreddits, and found out that trp is almost universally hated by the Reddit community. So I used what was probably my only redeeming quality at the time other than being able to cook, and researched why.  

I recognized how misogynistic the posts were, and how fake these field reports were. They were just an embellished diary entry of a social interaction. I left trp shortly after and tried to forget anything about what I ""learned"", but ended up finding the seduction community. It was pretty much the standard lift and be confident, but I guess a lot of guys don't have the role models to tell them how to at least hold conversations with women.  

I noticed that the communities have an overlap in analysing a lot of social interactions though. Sort of an ""If she does x, do y for sex"" vibe to it. It feels unnatural, and slightly manipulative. Spending so much time in that mindset has made my conversations just feel so much less sincere now.   


It's not like those communities are hidden knowledge, and it's pretty easy for any guy my age to find and try to do this. There aren't people out there who know when to stop reading into beliefs like this, so it's not like manipulation for sex wouldn't turn into pressure or worse.  


I've gotten out of those communities about a year ago. Now I have actual hobbies, learn new things because I've taken a genuine interest in them, and try to enjoy the people I'm around for who they are, not what they do for me.  


I think if I showed my girlfriend these communities, it would show her how to recognize when someone is trying to ""game"" her. I think she should be able to recognize people like this because trp and pua can lead to some dangerous situations, and she should know that. I think she should know about this part of my life because I have to admit that some of what I read there still goes on in my head today. I do not an any way subscribe to trp or try to seduce women any more. I don't describe myself as alpha or beta, or any of that other bullshit anymore. I feel that even if she broke up with me, she should know when she's being manipulated for a relationship.  

Is there anything that I'm not thinking of or any consequence that could happen because of this?


Tl;dr- former ""red-pilled"", should I show my girlfriend so she knows to stay far, far away from those people?

That she hates me she'll leave me for someone better blah blah. Usually over little things like what food to eat or something she'll start using really personal insults. She always blames me for arguments when I barely say anything. I'll pick her up from somewhere and she'll instanly start saying I'm grumpy and I'm ruining her day.

First of all, I don't want to assume. I am not diagnosing her or anything, but as someone who has experienced what it feels like to have mental instability throughout my life, I think I have enough awareness- to say the least. A little background, my classmate did marijuana before, she admitted it (I'm not sure if there's a connection, but there you go). She's from a broken family and had recently moved here (Asia) from the US to adapt our culture (she is asian and was raised in the US). I think that'll do. 

Moving on why I think she is extremely moody. Here's my testimony: in our three months as classmates, I've noticed she is having a time when she is very very active, talkative, mean, ignorant, reckless and careless. And ALSO a time when she is VERY quiet, taking naps at classes, ignoring the discussions, ignoring the teachers, all she does is use the phone, and she is strangely kind too. She was very empathic today, mindful and IS NOW following the teacher's orders. Which is something she always ignore. 

As aware as I want to be, I think she is having some manic and depressive episodes and it's obvious. I've noticed this after a month of her attending the school. There are also times she admitted she don't sleep for 2 days because she is talking to her bf, misses class on purpose, sometimes she won't talk to anyone. 

If I am offending anyone, I am sincerely apologizing. My only concern here is that, is there a way I can help her?

Alright, I have a job in the college where i graduated this year as, how can i call myself, basically i copy and scan documents (a client came, gave you money and you did a scan or a copy), making booklets for some shit i don't even care about. Also, when something's broken like a computer, a printer, etc. i have to fix it. I work 8-4 including a lunch break 12-1pm. I've been working there for 2 weeks. The money sucks. The boss is a moron who says one thing and does another. When i came to the interview he said that i would get 160$ a month and would work 5 days a week. Now, when i signed the contract it turns out that my salary is 121$ and i work 6 days a week. btw, i converted to the dollars from the russian ruble. Anyway, at least i can study there and have sort of social life although i'm not that super social but i have to interact with my clients anyway. It's usually girls from the college. One girl that used to work there even gave her number ""in case if i need something"". She comes to me every day asking about a damn printer if it works and my reply is always no. To sum up, the job sucks except i can find a girl which is not that important tbh, but i've never dated to anyone so that's my only hope.

Now, i can get another job where i used to work in the summers back in college days. The job as a security. The money is a little better and the working time is a 24 hour shift with three days off. Not much social interaction though but my studying time is increasing rapidly.

258,"Warning: this might be a long one, but I'm hella confused right now and don't know what to think about any of this. I'll try to keep it as clear and concise as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken a gap year after a shit year at university, and kept an open relationship with my then S/O. We agreed on sex with no strings attached but not to get emotionally involved with anyone else. I eventually got a little bit emotionally involved with a man, however, told my S/O and broke all contact of with this man. Me and S/O became fully exclusive. Sometime near my return, S/O asks for me to do a STD test, which I intended on doing, however the hospitals in the city I was in, waiting for my flight, only had an available booking around the time of my departure. So due to money and time constraints, I wasn't able to get it done. However, I called the last person I had done the unprotected deed with , and asked them if they got tested since ( we hooked up around a month or so prior). They reassured me that yes, they got tested and were cleaned. I calmed down, thinking this would mean I was also clean. 

This is where it starts getting messy. I go home, S/O asks if I'm clean and I confirm. After a while, S/O has symptoms of painful urination (however not similar feeling to a UTI). Asks again if I got tested, I lied to him and said I was clean. I panic call the last man I hooked up with and he states he had done the test but just never picked up the results.. I get tested, and get positive for Chlamydia. I break the news to S/O, massive fight ensues (understandably), and we both take medication but eventually split as I've lied to him once to many times. Again, understandably. 

I call the past two people I had unprotected sex with, including the one who lied about the test, both said they were clean. I urged the last man to redo the test as maybe because of the incubation period the infection just hadn't shown up yet, he re-did and around 3-4 months after we had hooked up he still tests negative for chlamydia. 

Here is why I'm confused: 

\-How could I have tested positive for an infection that my recent sexual partners tested negative to? 

The obvious answer would be that my S/O had the infection, however, he explained to me that he hasn't had sex with anyone since I was gone. I wouldn't have minded if he did have sex as this is the reason of an open relationship, but knowing him, it is possible that he went the entire time without sleeping with anyone. He sees a strong tie between sex, intimacy, and trust. 

\-Would S/O have lied about this?

He wouldn't have had any reason to lie about this, and especially since I was already in the wrong (having emotionally cheated on him), he could have gotten off the hook easily. He is also a man of strong moral principles and values honesty over everything. I have a very hard time believing that he would lie to me especially about something as important as this. 

\-Did I get a false positive? 

I know that this is not impossible but the chances are very small..

 

Any help at all would be appreciated. I'm confused more than frustrated or hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: got positive for chlamydia, but all of my previous partners tested negative. Whole net of lies makes the origin of this STD very difficult to pin point.

267,"Hello all,

So, a couple years ago I met a woman in a Facebook group. We hit it off really well and started started out just messaging each other as friends. Last year we began dating officially. We send each other care packages, order and cook the same things for dinner some nights, watch movies together, play video games together, stuff like that.

Right off the bat, she was very clear about wanting this to move slowly. She's had bad relationships in the past and she has experienced abuse, of which I do not know the extent of. She's super introverted, like myself, and I feel for the first time that I can be a friend as well as a partner with someone.

She lived in Florida with her grandmother after a rough patch in her life. Lots of things going on even aside from her dealing with PTSD. We had made plans to go to Universal this year to check out Stranger Things for Halloween. So I bought a flight. Two months later, she abruptly moves to Montana. Can't get a refund on the ticket so I think oh well, it's a bummer but you move on. She of course was apologetic.

Her move to Montana was strange to me. I still don't know exactly why she did that but it sounds like she badly needed a change in life. Like she was contemplating hurting herself. So, ultimately I'm glad for the move.

Last week I made more plans to visit her. Sept 21st I was going to drive 15 hours to Montana. She agreed to it. Then, yesterday, she asked if I would be mad if she needed more time.

It's been a year. I can't accurately describe how hard it is not seeing her and I'm crushed. I had taken time off work. Bought new tires. I was all in. It's always that she isn't ready and she wants to feel herself when she meets me for the first time.

I had told her, in response, that I need to know that this relationship is going somewhere. Her response was 

""I'm not questioning our relationship or my feelings for you. But I don't feel ready. And it has nothing to do with you. It's me. I really don't want to feel uncomfortable the first time we meet.""

I asked her why she would agree, and then cancel plans the next week.

""I didn't feel ready last week but I didn't want to disappoint you. So now I feel myself shutting down. I also don't have much emotional energy because I've been stressed about a lot.""

Am I being taken for a ride? I know myself enough that I can be blinded by feelings but I always hold on in hope anyways. She has gone through a lot and she does have PTSD. She said her last interest left her because of this reason as well. I've been lied to lot in relationships and so I'm looking for insight from people that have suffered traumatic experiences in the past that might be able to point me in the right direction to handle this sensitively. If I need patience, I can do that. But I cannot handle being taken advantage of.

I’ve tried talking to people but that never goes anywhere so I just stopped talking to people. I can’t make a friend out of my roomate he’s a sophomore and has a group of friends from last year, not to mention once he leaves the dorm he doesn’t come back until 2am. What can I do is there any hope for me to make a friend?",06Sep2018,1

270,"Hey, I am 14 this year and am wondering if I am asking too much. Firstly, this is not that big of an issue so if u can don't care about it but advice is appreciated. I'm planning to buy a gaming laptop to share with my brother, I'm using my saved up money but the thing is that I have to ask my parents permission to get it. Also, I would need some of their money to buy it. I already have a ps4 and I am not sure if I'm asking for much. I'm afraid they would say ""u have a ps4, dun ask for much."" Before asking them, I would need advice from u guys, like how should I approach and am is asking much

Btw, I barely ask them to buy electronic stuff for me, because I wasn't into gaming until last year. The ps4 was a gift for doing well for an exam. Any advice is appreciated  Thank you.",06Sep2018,1
271,"I am 25 and sad to have this problem still lol.  I grew up without much parental guidance at all, parents divorced, mom severely mentally ill, lived with dad who claimed that I raised myself. My sister is 10 years older than me. We have similar values sort of but also very different personalities. My sister is an alpha, likes to be in control, have power, believe she is more superior to others, and need to be in charge of everything. She is very smart and successful in her career and monetarily. I on the other hand am very quiet, introverted, reflective, overthinking, and empathetic and understanding, and self doubtful. 

I feel like my sister is one of my role models in a way. She gives me advice a lot, and I just kind of realized that I listen to her advice and submit to her too much. I feel like she has some control over me psychologically, because I always have her voice in my head. Like I’ve considered getting a tattoo or another ear piercing, but am self conscious about what she would think. It’s silly. I’m unsure of who I am a lot. 

Most of my family has issues with power in a way, my step mom and stepsister are the same way, always have to be in control and leading in social situations and always in competition in a way and I never feel comfortable around any of them. I always feel like I’m not truly valued, that they like to establish dominance over me, that I can’t be myself. 

Does this make any sense?",06Sep2018,1
272,"I have a summary of the situation at the end if you don't feel like reading the huge amount text I just put.

I've known my friend for about three years now and got really close with her this year. She has talked about her problems with me in both her life and relationship she has been in for four years now(I've known the partner for about 4 years and we're sort of friends maybe a good acquaintance) . From what she's told me she hasn't liked the relationship for a couple years now but whenever she try's to break up her partner threatens to either kill themselves or run away forever. She hopes to keep the friendship with this person and doesn't want them to hurt themselves because of her. I've told her many times if she doesn't think the relationship or situation can be fixed she should just break up with him(I've also offered support) but then she says that she would be fine independently but she wouldn't want to be lonely if she didn't have to be so(we've had this conversation a number of times) I first told that she was a really cool person and it probably won't take long for her to get find a new relationship but she says she doesn't think she could find someone she would want to go out with. Another time we had the conversation I told she wouldn't be lonely because she can hang out with me or other friends that she doesn't hang out with much because her partner is almost always with her but when I brought up we were friends she said ""yeah just friends...""(this was the first sign of it I suppose but I took this as her saying she wouldn't have a partner not that she was interested in me(no one has ever been interested in me before and she's way above my league so I never really thought about a relationship with her. also she is dating someone)) 

Anyway a few months go on and she's been telling there is something she wants to tell me but she isn't sure if she should but finally last night we were talking and she was telling me that she wasn't sure how I'd react to her telling me this and said that i probably already put it together since I'm smart but she was scared of telling me because she doesn't know how much she trusts me in a serious conversation or how I would react without joking around(because I'm usually just making jokes all the time this was probably are third or fourth super serious conversation in three years so I don't talk serious often) we were about to go into her house but she said she was probably going to be taking a shower and she was running on three hours of sleep. So I said I was going to go home because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable(in a past conversation she said she felt uncomfortable in just a towel around me but not her other friends(male or female) which kinda confused me and I felt bad that I made feel uncomfortable) but when I said that she told that uncomfortable wasn't the right word it was more of her holding herself back from enacting on her emotions which apparently she has almost done a lot and our conversation ended there because her partner came home we said goodbye and I went home.

Now I'm 99.9% sure she likes me and wants to start a relationship and I wouldn't mind being in a relationship with her but she is already currently in one( cheating is one of the things I hate the most so I'm not willing to participate in that) and I already told her that if she breaks up with them that she should enjoy single life for a little bit and don't worry about making a relationship. Just so she can be happy with herself and move on with her life. I think it's important for her to do that. If she does tell me she is interested in a relationship with I'll tell her the same thing again and if she is still interested in after a little bit of being single then I'd be willing to date her.


TL;DR basically I'm 99.9% my best friend is interested in dating me but she is currently in a bad relationship (with a good acquaintance/ maybe a friend of mine) that she wants to end but the partner keeps threatening suicide or to run away whenever she tries to end it. If she does end up confessing to me my current plan is to tell her to break up for real and enjoy single life for a little bit and if she is still interested in dating me then I'd be willing to try. It's just a confusing situation and I think I'm taking the best course of action.(I don't like planning on going out with someone while they're currently in a relationship it just doesn't feel right even if it's a bad relationship.

275,"Especially at work, whenever I have a 'tough' conversation with my boss for instance, I tend to tear up. It's not that I'm really upset, but of course that is how it comes across. If someone gives you negative feedback and you tear up, obviously they will think you cannot handle it. Since it happens over really small things, I'll come across a drama queen. (For instance: I plan on telling my boss tomorrow that I feel one of my projects is not a good fit for me, and just practicing the conversation in my head is making me tear up already)

Generally to stop myself from bursting into tears I will discreetly pinch myself of tense up my muscles, but I would rather stop getting teary eyed altogether to avoid the chance of the occasional tear falling or someone seeing the tears building up in my eyes. How do I go about telling my tear ducts that I am in fact NOT upset, and there is no need to start spilling water everywhere?",06Sep2018,1
276,"Back story I work in the bicycle industry, always have and maybe always will. So I really love bicycles, like A LOT.. I live and work in NYC, (keep this in mind)

I recently got a raise and quite a big raise. 10k to be exact. Not I raised the question in how I should go about accepting this raise. 

I can go one route of getting the raise added too my current salary. But being that I’m in NYC I’ll get text 25% before I get to even touch it. So that 10k becomes 7500ish. 

The other route would be to apply half towards my salary. And taking the other half towards a bike at our coast. Without taxes. So in theory, that 5k becomes 10k untaxed used towards a bike. Plus 5k towards my salary. 

Mind you that if I go this route my salary will remain only with a 5k raise + a new bike, until I renegotiate next year. That’s IF we have a good year!

277,"Hi, this is a new alt account, but I’m not new to reddit. I just need some advice about a relationship problem.

Background info: I am a high school student (US) and I’m a guy. I’ll call the people in here girl 1 and girl 2.

So I’ll start at the beginning: two years ago, I started switching my group of friends, to this new group of people which were mostly female. Girl 1 and girl 2 are both in this group, and they are good friends with each other, as well as me and girl 2 were somewhat good friends before this. So as time goes on, I get closer with this whole group of people, especially girl 1. In just a few months, we were really close friends who would tell each other about our problems and things. We texted all the time and got really close.

Fast forward to the second to last day of school: we were watching a movie in class and everyone was sitting on the floor, and she laid her head on my shoulder while sitting next to me. I made up some reason to put my arm around her behind her and I kinda pulled her closer to me so she was laying on my chest while we were sitting up. We did this most of that day while just talking and generally having a great time. We both liked each other but we didn’t talk about it because all our friends and many other people shipped us together so it was a little awkward. So pretty much the same thing on the last day of school, and I really liked her and I thought she liked me too, but I didn’t ask her out that day because I already knew I couldn’t really see her much over summer, so I was going to wait until after school started again to ask.

So that summer we didn’t really talk much. We get back to school and it’s clear things were weird between us. This is now 1 year ago. We slowly became friends again but not to the level we were, and all this happened with girl 1. So in the meantime of me being lonely, me and girl 2 started becoming close friends for mostly the second half of that year ~8-10 months ago now. Girl 2 and I were close, and I definitely made some moves (not asking her out but clear moves) that in my opinion she didn’t respond to well, or at least well enough for me to ask her out. Eventually I lost interest in her because it seemed like she didn’t like me (this is girl 2 still) by the end of that year, girl 1 and I were friends but not super close, and girl 2 and I were really close. 

So a few months ago: we were playing never have I ever and girl 1 told me that she used to like me, and I told her I used to like her too. And we talked about the whole weird year we went through, and how both of us were wrong and made mistakes and how we are much more mature now. We decided together we want to get back to that close friendship again. Another friend who new the drama told me stuff about how she liked me for a really long time and probably still did at least a little. So now that school started again, we started getting really close again. Not quite cuddling close, but very touchy and stuff. We are great friends and we really like to talk with each other. And now I like her a lot again, and I feel somewhat sure she likes me too. 

So me and girl 2 were best friends on Snapchat (if you don’t know, it has a certain emoji for when you are both each other’s #1 contact) for like 10 months or something, and yesterday the best friend emoji changed to me and girl 1. 

So here are my questions: 
1. How do I find out if girl 1 likes me still and ask her out without being weird about it?

And 

2. How do I preserve the friendship with girl 2? I haven’t really told her why we aren’t as close anymore but I think it’s mutual and she feels the same way. 

And 

3. Any other general advice for this situation?

I know this is long, thank you for reading and responding!",06Sep2018,1

280,"This has been going on for over 2 years now and we are starting to get very, very,very desperate. 

We (my mother and I) have been living in this flat for over 10 years now. There is a lady upstairs about 60 years old, she lives alone because her two children have moved out (one because she married, the other because he didn't want to have contact with her anymore). 
So she used to be really, really nice to us, but I always thought she is a bit weird because she doesn't want to work (living off of GOV support) and is quite esoteric. Anyways. Two years ago she stopped talking to us. She uninvited my mother to the weekly singing-thing she hosted and became very very hostile. She started looking at us angrily, you know, the look where you feel really really uneasy. When we asked her what's wrong she just said ""you are talking about me."" and we had absolutely no idea what she was on about. Maybe she thought we were speaking ill of her behind her back which was absolutely not the case. My mom tried to calm her down and tell her that this is just some misunderstanding but it was apparently too late then. 

From that point on we more and more noticed that she got more passive-aggressive. But we just took it, which was a major mistake. Because she increased intensity. Until she started stomping on the floor whenever we laughed or closed a window. She even got up at 3 in the night to drop something like a bouncy ball on the floor multiple times. (that was almost every night for a week) We then told the landlord, which is a company.

They told us to write down every incident with witnesses and give it to them. They then sent a conflict person to talk with her and then with us. He told her to stop the evil behavior or she might loose her flat. She then stopped waking us up every night and early morning.

But then she switched more and more to intense passive aggressive behavior. Like as if she went on online forums on how to get rid of your neighbor without anybody being able to charge you with something, you know? In the mornings, she walks with her heels so it's very loud. But that alone is not illegal. You know what I am saying. She also started taking in her young grandchild and let's her run around the flat for hours. This is legally totally okay, and she knows that.

She also tries to befriend every single neighbor suddenly, she started giving chocolate to a lady in the house she always hated and spoke ill of. Invites them to coffee etc. It seems to us as if she is trying to go for the long run and slowly, slowly make life unpleasant for us while reinforcing her public relations. 

TL;DR 

Upstairs single lady who is always at home does everything legally possible to make life hard for us. Think of Lois from Malcolm In The Middle, now imagine her trying to get rid of her neighbor by befriending everyone and turning them against it etc.

Stop lying."" This pissed me off because she has always been trying to insult me. She would always talk shit about everyone in our school, including my friends, and she would always slyly insult me, so hearing this from her, pissed me off more than I would have reacted. I borrowed her lipstick, went to the bathroom, dipped tissue into the toilet water, and wiped her lipstick with the tissue, then gave it back to her. Afterwards, I told Jake, a close friend of mine, what I did because I felt like I went too far with what I did. Jake told Harry, a friend of his, who told Allison. Allison told her mom about what had happened and her mom called the principal to have a meeting with me tomorrow. Here's the part- I lied. I lied to them that I had dipped her lipstick into the toilet water. I lied that I didn't do it and they believe me. I don't know what to do. It was wrong of me to dip her lipstick in the toilet water in the first place and I know I deserve what happened to me. But at the same time, Allison has always been mean to other people, so that's why she transferred schools because everyone at her old school disliked her. She has always been talking shit about me and my friends and everyone else at school, but she's very sly about it. Why is she allowed to do that yet I get in trouble for doing this. I need advice. I know a lot of you will say it's my fault, which is definitely is. But I was having a good time until this happened.

286,"I have told teachers and my guidance counselor, they do not believe me. The main person and his friends (about 5 people) who are bullying me basically turned around all the events I told the guidance counselor and the guidance counselor accused me of being obnoxious and provocative. These events just from the past month are:

My school started about a month ago and on the second week we went on a field trip, the last stop of the field trip was at a mall. Me and my friend were waiting in line and my friend who is on the same team as the bullies was approached by them. Long story short I was first in line and we didn't have to pay for the food, so I took my tray of food and my friend' trays while my friend took all the drinks except for 1 that couldn't fit on the tray. I put my food down and go to get my drink, when I go back my drink is gone so I figured the other people must have brought it back so when I went back I saw everyone had a drink (but I didn't notice my food), looked around saw no drink for me. Asked hey where is my drink and they said they left it up there. So I went back and asked the guy working there and he said they took them all. At the end of the table I looked and saw a drink but it was empty, one of them drank it. Ok so I went to where my food was, also not there and I see the worst of them basically haven eaten the entirety of my food. My friend was not here at the moment he was at the bathroom, so I told that kid he will pay me for my food so I could get more, he said why, I said because you ate it, he said no I didn't eat it you ate it and pushed the tray back at me as they all laughed. Now I didn't know what to do here, I actually looked around for cameras to have some proof for when I told the teacher but I couldn't see any cameras and we were leaving soon. So I went to the teacher and told her this guy ate all my food. So she goes up to them and asks them and they say no we didn't eat his food he is trying to get money from us. So she asks my friend who wasn't there and he said he doesn't know (I know it is because he is scared for what they will do to him on his team). So I was thinking to find a mall cop and ask if I could show their cameras to my teacher, I found 2 talking to each other and when I told them what happened they said haha what? We were already leaving though and I didn't know what else to do, no cellphone, no one listened so I figured whatever I will tell at the school. When I got on the bus I asked my friend and he said he didn't know but he would give me 5 bucks for the food so I could eat something.

Like 2 days after I was walking in the hall because I had to change lockers, I have like 5 books in my hands and a lot of papers. The main bully ran up and jumped to try to sit on my books while it was in my hands. All my books and papers fell. Same day was at lunch, bought my food and got one dollar back in change. Tray in one hand, the bully comes up and puts his hand down my pocket, grabbing my one free hand and then runs away with my dollar as his friends laugh. So I started yelling and he ran out the door, one of the teachers came up to me and said what happened I told them X had stolen money from me and ran away. Teacher looks around doesn't see X so he goes up to his friend's and asks what happened and they said I got mad at X because he wouldn't give me his dollar to buy snacks. Seriously the most retarded shit ever, this dumbass teacher actually believed them but they are many I am one, And when the teacher asked X he asked him in a way where he makes it extremely easy for him to get away with it, did you run away because (I/me) was trying to take a dollar from you? Obviously you know what he said, so the teacher told me not do to that and if I did I would be sent to the principle. I told him he doesn't have to I will go by myself.

So right after this I was angry fighting could get me expelled as would most other things I could think of get me suspended and I was almost certain these buttholes in the office would do nothing either and X wouldn't get in trouble at all because the teachers / coaches would favorite him and I have a higher chance of getting into trouble.

So I get to the office but the principle is busy so they tell me to go to my guidance counselor. I tell the guidance counselor everything and he says he will speak with X. The next day towards the end I am called back to the guidance counselor who said he has spoken to everyone except for 1 person, my friend who wasn't there for that whole week. Long story short, I believe he believes I was the culprit, and while he wasn't accusative I could tell he didn't believe anything I said as he told me to avoid them. I told him did he tell them the same thing, to stay away from me? He said who X and his friends? Yea (Who else?) He said oh yea, yea I said it to them too.

So this is where I messed up, I had this plan to record everything that happened on my phone to at least have some evidence or something to back me up. Walking out of school I randomly saw them on the side where I thought I parked but I had parked on the other side (so it makes it look like I went there to confront them). As I was walking out I saw them walkin towards me so I had turned the recording on but the stupid shit froze as another app was open ontop. X was obviously going to confront me for me making him and all his friends have to go to the guidance counselor so he comes up saying why did you say that, you are a pussy, dumb, stupid bla bla bla. I am not really paying attention and trying to make sure this stupid thing is actually recording because the dumb thing froze, so I don't notice his friend come behind me and when it finally switched back to the recording app with a big red dot on the bottom he says to all of them I am recording this. So I look up and before I can do anything X takes my phone from my hands and whips it at a wall. It made a popping sound alongside the broken glass as my battery exploded and it doesn't turn on. X said exactly what I was thinking he would say, ""I can't believe in a fit of rage you whipped your phone at a wall"", you got issues dude. Who would believe that? Well my car was not parked on this side, in fact I never parked on this side for the past 2 years and they always parked on this side (and they know that). That right there would already lean the guidance counselor away from believing me again. As I was driving home I thought if I should have put my phone in like a plastic bag with plastic gloves so I could get like fingerprints check on it, I have already touched my phone, rubbed it etc to see if it will work though. Is this still viable? Have to go home first to be able to call the police though.

TLDR: What should I do about this bullying? I have already lost about 200 bucks to these kids and this is only about 3 weeks into the school year. The violence hasn't started but they are tall and I am short and I strongly doubt it will be 1 on 1. My parents would also kill me if I got suspended or expelled.",06Sep2018,1

288,"I made friends with someone a couple of years ago, and our friendship lasted a while. We got along really well, although sometimes when talking to each other it was a bit awkward, because we're both kind of shy. Regardless, we both seemed to like each other a lot, we were really supportive of each others interests, and had a lot in common. 

During the beginning of this year, we slowly fell apart, which I think is partially my fault because I was going through a tough moment in my life and started to distance myself from other people. I guess part of it was also because I moved to a different school, so we ended up talking online only. The sad thing is, is that I feel like we could've become pretty good friends, but things cut off too soon.

Every now and then I think about them since we've stopped talking (I have no romantic feelings for them, it's purely platonic), but I just feel like sometimes you meet people in your life who just feel like they belong there. They were honestly one of my most caring and supportive friends, and it feels like something is missing now that I'm not talking to them.

The negative side of me also thinks that maybe we're not friends anymore because they started to think I wasn't the person they wanted to be friends with in the first place, or they just got tired of me. I know that sounds weird, but I tend to be more reserved at the start of a friendship, and then reveal more of myself as I get closer to the person. I go through this weird paranoia stage at some point where I start to think the person finds me annoying or too much to be friends with anymore. With them, this especially happened, which I think is partially why I started to draw myself away from them. Towards the end, I started to feel like they were giving off that vibe. I know they weren't a perfect person, but part of me kind of thought they were... too cool for me? Lmao. They were not the one who made me feel that way, it was just my own stupid brain. The point is, I don't want to come off as too obsessed or clingy. I don't think I am, it's just something I think about as a ""what could've been"" situation if I had done something differently, and if theres a chance that I could save our friendship tactfully. Usually I know what to do in situations like this, but I honestly cannot decide what to do this time.

I have had a few leads with sales jobs, however. Though I'm really an introvert and don't think I would enjoy working sales very much, I think I would be decently good at it. My parents are very worried though, because they know that I probably wouldn't enjoy this work very much.
The part that is enticing about the sales job is that it could potentially pay me very well (which is great because I'll have rent, car payments, student debt, etc.), and I also know that a person's first job out of university doesn't necessarily mean very much.
But in the midst of all of this compromising my aspirations, it's also occurred to me that I might find teaching fulfilling and something that I might really like to pursue.
I know that receiving an alternative teaching certification is a thing. Ideally, I'd really love to be a media teacher (like the ones who teach photo editing, broadcasting, things like that), but I have little to no idea how to go about getting an alternative certification (I know it differs by state), and how much time/money it would take to get one.
Would it be possible for me to work towards receiving my alternative teaching certification even if I'm working full time? How do people usually do this?",06Sep2018,1
292,"**Some background information:**
I’m currently a senior in high school getting ready to apply for colleges. I’ve had pretty much one college in mind ever since I started high school that I wanted to go to. My parents of course knew this and they were perfectly fine with this college. It was in-state, my sister graduated from it, and only about a 4 hour drive from where I currently live. I’ve also told them previously that I wanted to stay in-state. 

Things changed though. I met someone who lives in a different state that makes me truly happy 24/7. I want to be with them as soon as possible and going to college near them seemed like a good option. Now I’m not just blindly changing my whole decision because I met this person, they more of inspired me to look outside of where I currently live. Obviously, them being there is a big reason why I want to go, but there are other pros too. The school I was looking at, which is not too far from them, has a great program for my major, and my mother grew up in that area for the first 25 years of her life so she’s familiar with it and I’ve also been there many times. Her whole entire family also still lives there, so I have them if I need anything. I also just kind of want to leave where I live now. I’ve mentioned checking out colleges in that area but i’ve never really mentioned that it’s where I actually really want to go. The tuition is obviously a lot more expensive since it’s out of state, which my mom brought up and I don’t really know how to approach that. Thought about maybe getting a job, and I’ll be applying for many scholarships. Anyways, as far as I know she’s still under the impression that I really want to go to the in-state school, and neither of my parents know about my girlfriend. I was going to tell them but when I started thinking about going to college near her I got afraid they would immediately shut me down because they would think I’m changing all my plans for a girl I’ve never even met. Also my sister, who i’m the closest to when it comes to family,  still lives right next to the in-state college and she’s expecting me to go there too. I visit her and her boyfriend all the time and they were expecting me to be there with them next year so that’s another thing. I thought about asking my sister for advice about this but i’m worried about how she’ll react as well. 

I just want some advice on how I should bring this whole thing up to them and what I should do in general. I just want to be happy, and I think being leaving where I currently live and being with her is what can accomplish that. I have no doubts in my mind about her, so I don’t really need any advice on that. It’s long distance but we talk at least 7 hours a day (a lot of times more), and we’re really close. I just don’t really know what to do and I’ve been really worried about this for the past month or so. Should I try to reason with them about wanting leave without bringing up my girlfriend? Should I just tell them everything? Please, any advice is appreciated.

293,"It just hit me how behind I am with my peers. I always kind of knew but the reality of it never set in. I’m turning 22 in a few days and I still read comic books, watch cartoons, read fanfiction etc like I’m still in high school. I’m stuck in lalaland most of the time I barely even know addresses because I always zone out in the car. I still can’t drive, I used to work but stopped when college got harder. Now we’ve started clinicals today and it hit me how serious what I’m studying is. Everyone in our group were having discussions over what was happening and I found I had nothing to add to the conversation. I caught myself daydreaming several times and had to pull myself out of it. Then when we finished, everyone went off to leave in their own cars and meet up somewhere else to eat and yet here I am stuck waiting for my ride with no money or a car and just about to read a comic on my phone until this hit me. I’ve spent most of my life since high school kind of just going along with the flow and I would study but I wouldn’t know how to apply any of the knowledge. I understand theory but not practical. But I’d be ok with it because whatever it’s not like I have to know how to actually do it yet. Well now I do. I thought that I was thinking far into the future and had things planned but I realize I wasn’t thinking all that far at all.

I feel like I’m stuck at 15 when I’m already 22 and I can’t get my shit together mentally. I want to mature as a person but I don’t know how. I feel like I can’t control my mind and I just love daydreaming about what could be instead of actually getting it done. I feel so useless and foolish for having wasted so much of my time doing nothing when others have practiced so hard for their own skills. I wonder how the hell im going to get there one day when I’ve already spent so much time in this mold.",06Sep2018,2

296,"Hi,

Four months ago, I got a new job at a bakery in a grocery store. A week before I did, a girl who used to be a cashier joined as well. 
It seemed like one of those funny jokes life gives you at first, but all the employees started to get injured. By the end of the summer three of the full time employees couldn't work. The manager and I were basically all alone for a little more than a week, so I had to do a lot of overtime.

I don't mind overtime, even though I'm not actually paid for it because the director of the store doesn't want to pay overtime (as in, people there just don't do overtime because it won't be paid). The manager of the bakery told me that when when other employees will come back, he'll give me less than 40 hours and still pay me 40 hours until all the overtime hours I did are paid. He is honest so I have no doubts he will do it.

Anyway, when I joined, the  manager told me that next year, there should be an assistant manager job opening and that if I wanted to get a career, I probably could.

Yesterday, he told me that he is teaching the other girl how to be assistant manager. (Even though there is not the job yet; he does that to help up because he said that if after that we want to apply to some other jobs as assistant manager, we can put him as a reference and he'll say we are and also it will help if the job position opens).

Here is the part where I get petty. I worked much harder than the other girl. She's always checking her cell phone when she's working. She's always chatting with people from other departments. She also tends to leave the work she doesn't like to do to other people (for example, she doesn't like to clean, so after doing something that needs cleaning, she won't clean and just start something else). She's the type of person who will come back from her break (we have 15 minutes paid every 2 hours) and say ""oh, wait, I need to go to the bathroom"" and go during work time instead of her break.

I worked my ass off since I'm here. I did overtime almost every week. I'm always rushing to fill up the bakery because since we're not enough staff now and it's ""go back to school period"" plus Rosh Hashanah so there is a lot to do. I'm always super fast. I gave a lot of ideas to the manager to improve the bakery, some that ended up increasing the sells. 

He said he is teaching her first because she was here first. But she was there A WEEK before. Plus she wasn't working for almost two weeks after she got injured, so I actually have more experience here than her.

I feel like it's very unfair that he is teaching her and not me first. I feel like I deserve it more. He said he'll teach me after but it takes months to teach someone. In 6 months she'll be paid better than I and I will be stuck at the same shitty-minimum-age-paid point in my life. If ever the job position shows up, she'll get it because she'll have more experience than me.

Anyway, I worked as slow as other people usually do yesterday after he told me about it. Today, he called to know if I could work even if it's my day off and I said no. I don't feel like putting more work than others if it doesn't give me any type of reward when there is one to give.

Last thing, I'm also moving a little farther from the store into a new apartment by the end of the month, which made me think that I could maybe just find another job. The problem is that I don't want my resume to make me look unstable. Also, I don't want to take any decisions under emotions because it just leads to problems. 

Sorry for writing so much, I wanted to get it out my chest and I also wanted to give the full context. I would like advice about the situation, how to handle it and also, am I being petty to work less than I used to? Should I just find another job?  Should I wait? Am I over reacting? 

(P.S. Sorry if the English is a bit awkward, it's not my first langage).

Thanks so much for helping me.",06Sep2018,2

307,"There was an issue with a dog that we both believed was hers. (Friend claimed It was theirs, that the original owner didn’t want it and gave it to them, which they then gave to my then girlfriend.)

Soon before the breakup I learn that it wasn’t actually theirs, and the owner was intending to keep the dog the whole time. And I struggle for a little around a week to find the words to inform my girlfriend on this, as I knew it would devastate her as she was investing significant time and money into this dog.
—

We end up breaking up, and I have her over a few days after to talk. We end on a friendly note, but I inform her on the dog situation- It devastated her, and I consoled as much as possible.

I tell her to talk to the real owner to see if there’s something she can work out, but she instead buckles down and refuses to return the dog.

This starts a lot of drama
Including the owner getting involved and threatening my ex with legal action.
Legal action that my ex felt she could handle.

She couldn’t.
—

My ex continues to refuse returning the dog,
So the owner begins to gather info to get police involved; and if that didn’t work, to press charges.

I- now getting thrown into involvement, did all I could to prevent having charges pressed against her. So I reluctantly gave necessary addresses to the owner in order to track the dog down.

I should add; my ex’s dream is to be a dog groomer.. needless to say, can’t be a dog groomer with a dog napping charge on your record.

This information gets to my ex and she finally returns the dog. She falls into a deep hatred for me, and is failing to see that I did all that I could to SAVE her from herself.

She would’ve had no leverage in court for ownership of this dog and would’ve lost him regardless, I just ensured she didn’t lose her dream career too.

How do I get this point across to them?
I love her dearly, and the animosity between is stresses me to no end, especially being that the intent was nothing but for her well being.

Fine. But I tell her I’ll take my car and follow her back to her place, since A) I’m sick. I might need to leave in an hour or two if my voice gets worse. And B) her and her boyfriend have clearly already been drinking and probably won’t be able to drive me home in a few hours. We agreed over the phone that was fine. Great. 

So she gets here, and tells me to just ride with her. I say “nah it’s okay, I’ll just follow you.” 
After some back and fourth arguing about this, (such a dumb fucking thing to argue about by the way) she says “forget it, don’t come” and gets in her car. So I just walk back into my house. 

Then she spends the next hour, sitting in my driveway, texting me mean things. 

“You’re such a pussy, you’re such a stupid bitch, I’ve been sick before it’s really not that big of a deal, it’s not like you’re going to die, you dumb fucking cunt. I’m not THAT drunk I can’t believe you think I’d put you in danger” blah blah blah. Almost 100 texts of this shit. 

So that goes on for awhile before she leaves. The whole time I’m texting her like “you’re being a little wild right now girl, you need to chill out. I just don’t feel good. Stop cussing me out. Is this worth losing a friendship over? I’ll see you tomorrow.” Stuff like that. I know she’s tipsy and acting a lil psycho so I don’t feed into her name calling. I never lash out at her, because that’s just going to make it worse. I’m trying to calm her down. 

Keep in mind that she is really GOING OFF because I wanted to follow her in my car instead of riding with her tipsy ass. 

Anyway, she finally leaves and texts me, “if you were like this with _____, I can see why he used to hit you.” 

2 months ago I moved back to my home state after living with an abusive asshole for the past 4 years. I never told anyone about what happened in that relationship, but I did tell her what really went down when I got back home. I trusted her.

After I saw that text, I was shocked. I texted back “Not cool ____.” 

And then she said something like “Well it’s true!” 

And I texted back, “Nah. I’m done with you.”

She called and texted me at least 100 times after I sent that final text and I ignored it. 

So this morning, the morning after, I’m expecting a “omfg I’m so soOoOorry girl I was drunk as fuck I shouldn’t have said that.” But I haven’t heard from her. Its still early ish. Maybe she’s hungover. 

Even if she did apologize, how can I really forget and forgive what she said? “Drunk words speak sober thoughts” and all that. 
She literally told me that my ex abusing me was justified because I ? Wanted ? To ? Drive ? Myself ? To ? Her ? House ?????????

Should I just forgive her, keep the friendship, but always know deep down how she really is? Or should I just kick the bitch out of my life for good.


If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading. She’s the only friend I have and I really don’t have anyone else to talk to about stuff like this. ",06Sep2018,1
325,"A family emergency has landed a relative in the hospital and her teenage children displaced; they are currently living with my brother and his family and will be for about two months.  These poor kids (15M &amp; 13F) are missing their mom (dad's not in the picture), they're in a new city hours from home, and haven't been able to start school yet as they need to get registered still.  It's a stressful situation and I feel for them.  I'm heading over tomorrow for a bbq and wanted to bring them a small gift each, something to keep them occupied until things start to stabilise for them.  

I don't have kids and don't have a clue what teenagers would like.  Unfortunately I don't know these kids very well, only met them a couple times, so I can't say what their interests are.  They come from a disadvantaged background and didn't bring anything with them outside of some clothes...

During these times we got along great but now we’ve gone back to school and although we both seem willing to talk to each other and hang out. They seem to find it awkward to talk to me and quite frequently gives one word answers and runs off to talk to another of our friends first chance they get. If it was constant I’d say they probably just don’t like me and give up but the thing is, their opinion of me seems to change by the hour with one minute they’re talking to me normally and the next they seem really uncomfortable around my presence. I consider them one of my closest friends and it would hurt really badly if they just decided they didn’t like me. What do I do? Do I talk to them or leave it in case it starts a fight?",06Sep2018,1

So I live in Russia, working in Wargaming. At the start of June recruiter from Ubisoft (Sweden, Malmö) wrote me and offered a job.

We also visited speech therapist and he said that if massage and this medicine wouldn't help he would have to go to kindergarten with speech therapy.

I like excitement, he hates excitement. I like gaming and he hates gaming. I tend to act like my peers, very impressionable. I am very shy and anti-social, and I learn to stop being that way by spending long periods of time with social people. I've been on three ""dates"" with this guy, all three were fun while we had something to do, but once we started just talking to each other, it got awkward as hell fast. He's just so boring. He is as shy as I used to be, and hanging out with him brings that side of me back out. I don't want that side of me anymore, that side of me was miserable and depressed. But he's so nice and his only friends are the people in his disabled support group (I think he has a social disorder, if I recall what he told me). I feel so bad not wanting to be friends with a sweet and kind guy who has practically no friends, but I just can't stand being alone with him. I'd love to hang out with him in a group setting, but he hates groups and would be very uncomfortable with that, so I don't want to do that to him. Any advice?

We really hit it off and fell in love and towards when she was going to leave i applied to a school out where she lives and got accepted and all that. She left in May and I planned my arrival for August 14th. Towards the end of the summer, we became short and distant and things were off but she assured me it was the distance cause that seemed the most normal, which I guessed that too. Fast forward to when I get here. It’s been about 3 weeks since I have been here. She’s only said she loved me once, it’s been super awkward and dry and she starts to tell me that she doesn’t feel it anymore but wants to try. Two weeks into me being here it turns great, and I mean absolutely amazing. All the love and affection was there. 2 days ago it’s back to dry again, she doesn’t know if she wants to be with me in the long run, but doesn’t want to break up, and right now we got into a fight about it and we haven’t spoken in a couple hours. I am 25, I left my life, my friends, my family, sold all of my things (car, etc) and everything to be with a girl who doesn’t even think she loves me anymore. I had nothing going for me at home due to my adhd and depression but i figured besides love i would take advantage of this European education. I am beyond devastated about this whole situation that I know l will not be able to focus on school since I pretty much now feel like I have nothing here. If i ever move out of her apartment and I’m sure i would if we break up, i can’t afford it. What do I do? Do I make a fool of myself and go home with almost only a month of being here?

335,"I have dreamed of moving abroad since literally preschool. I was a gifted child and asked my parents to take Japanese classes, which I did on Saturday mornings for three years during elementary school because I wanted to go to Japan. I majored in International Studies in college, chose a college specifically to study abroad (in Europe), which was my first experience in a foreign country. (My family/community weren't huge travelers. I used to feel like an outcast.)

I met my now fiance (wedding next year) during college -- he graduated the same year as me, but from the US Naval Academy. He's ambitious, super intelligent and very caring. He's about to be finished/discharged from the Navy, and this is why the ""window"" is now open for my big move. He's reassured me in the past that once his commitment to the Navy was over, I would be ""driving the train"" to get to work on my own career for a while. (I moved around with him after college which was hard as an early-career recent grad with big dreams, but the sacrifice was what enabled our relationship and was worth it.)

He has known about my dream to emigrate almost as long as he's known me at all, though now he says he thought it was ""one of those dreams people talk about but never actually do"" -- I think he knows me enough by now that the only dreams like that I have are riding a dragon and going to Hogwarts. Moving to Germany, that's not only a dream but a trajectory.

I've been described as a ""type A"" by a lot of people, and I take my career and life plans very seriously. My fiance I think is more laid back, especially since he's had to take a breather since being diagnosed with bipolar II early this year. I'm a survivor of major depression/anxiety myself, and my dreams are part of the reason I survived and am now in solid remission. I help him manage his mental health as much as I can, as a new diagnosis and meds is completely life-wrenching for most people, and I can't bear to see the one I love suffer like that. I will of course be ensuring we make every measure to have quality healthcare (for him, English language psychological care will be a must and available through the VA) as I know too well how vital that is.

We have a city and country we're moving to (Germany) as my current job just opened a satellite office there. This is what I consider the most feasible way to move, as we'll have an income and I won't need to be 100% fluent in German right away (I am passably OK and learning daily.) Also, Germany was THE top contender for my ""whole life"" plan, so to me this is very fortunate.

To fiance, his plans are to go back to school to study a rather specialized scientific field (paleontology) -- his other life dream besides the Navy. This is possible in Germany, but because there is not miraculously an English-language bachelor's degree program at a public university in the city in which we'll live, his optimism has gone out the window. There are literally English language master's programs in the country for this field, well renowned, but the logistics of getting the proper pre-requisites (his USNA engineering degree doesn't have all the undergrad classes he needs for this field's graduate study, so he thought he may need to do another bachelor's), getting there (""if I have to study in another city (an hour away) I could just go somewhere in the US""/""we can't pay 2 rents"" etc), just every reason why it's completely impossible and he will be miserable. Basically it's either a perfect situation handed to him on a silver platter or he thinks he's doomed.

Moving abroad takes hard work, I will be the first to say. I know that if you don't put the work in to settle in, learn customs, make friends, find activities, etc. you WILL fail and just be homesick and want to quit. His adjustment period will be harder than mine, my research and awareness tells me. So him going into this thinking he will hate it makes me think we are absolutely doomed to fail. But I can't force him to learn a language or have an optimistic outlook -- he's never lived in a foreign country before and honestly neither have I, really, so I can't guarantee any specific thing will or will not happen. He may end up thriving and loving it, but no one can know for sure, and he seems to think the chances of that are one in a billion.

We've discussed this a lot, obviously, and currently the consensus is that our real ""decision"" will happen AFTER we're moved to Germany. The decision will not be whether to go, but whether to stay. I honestly cannot agree to staying in the US forever -- I will wonder FOREVER what it would have been like if I at least tried to follow my lifelong dream. But, if we go, and still decide to return, I will be fine with that as our team decision, since at least I/we gave it an honest shot.

My bottom line question(s) -- Am I asking too much of my future spouse? Is HE asking too much of ME? (Asking me to abandon my solid life plan, though technically he has not asked this IRL) Could this move actually work out? What on EARTH am I supposed to do?",06Sep2018,1

So, I don't actually know for sure if I'm balding, but I think it might be the case because I have a big hairline and it's gotten worse past few months. Some fucked genes; I practically went broke on the genetic lottery.

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, it's not even like I can pull off being bald because I have a weak chin / jaw (though I plan on getting plastic surgery for that when I'm 18). Another reason why I plan to do so is because I think it may stretch my facial skin out a bit, as I am 12.2% bodyfat according to my DEXA scan but my face still looks chubby.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I digress. I asked my mom to take me to the doctor and she refuses. I don't really know what to do. My face is pretty chubby like I said, and I've been trying to lose weight (I'm currently 6'1 and 175 pounds) and my mom says that that's a bad idea because it'll contribute to the hair loss. ""Better to be a bit chubby and have hair rather than to lose weight and all your hair as well"".

Also, I randomly feel a crawling through my hair every now and then, like it feels like something is crawling from the front to the back of my hair. I'm not sure what it is.",06Sep2018,1
340,"Originally, my goal was to be a CS/IS major. I have wanted to get into web development as long as I've been alive. I was a straight-A (3.61) student in high school so it would have been easy for me. I soon realized that this dream was dead; I couldn't get a loan and I couldn't afford school. Even with working 2 part-time jobs I would still not be able to pay for my tuition with one of their payment plans. I couldn't get approved for any sort of loan due to me being 19 and having 0 credit, and my parents and extended family having terrible credit. I got next to 0 help from the government, because even though my parents don't claim me as a dependent (I have been living independently on the other side of the country since 11th grade), there was some sort of loophole in the FAFSA where they had to mark me as dependent anyways. I have applied to numerous loan companies with no luck, and even applied to a private loan at my credit union to no avail.  
  
After these plans fell through, I decided I would try and apply to a Coding Bootcamp in my area, to again try and find a loan, become a certified developer and pay them off, and then go to school and pay as I go. I have a month before my tuition would be due if I go to this program and I am quickly coming to the realization that this isn't going to happen; I can't afford it at all.  
  
So now I'm stuck. I realize that there is no realistic way to do what I want in my life. My family is unsupportive. They keep telling me to apply for more jobs that I don't want to work at since I won't be able to get an education. My mom tells me that I should just work an entire summer and then my education would be paid for; she doesn't realize that it's not the 70s anymore. I don't want to be working fast food and retail my entire life. If this is what it comes down to, there is really no point in me living. I understand that it is up to one to find their own reason to live, but what is mine if I can't do what I want to do in life? I feel like a failure and need direction. ",06Sep2018,2
342,"I'm 18 and I am 90% sure I have OCD, going outside is really stressful for me and when I come home I absolutely HAVE TO shower with 99.9% bacteria killer handwash (yes, on my hair aswell) before I can feel comfortable or sane again. I also do alot of other irrational things, the list is far too long to mention here and it grows by 1 new behaviour on average every month or two. Going outside is a sacrifice of sanity that I have had to make to go to school and the consequences are tough, the hand wash is horrible for my hair and even worse for my skin which has always been especially sensitive (I think that's where some of the trauma comes from, I've had more than a few conditions which were really scary to deal with). Thankfully I'm done with school now but that doesn't save me from having to go outside. I've been needing to move away from my family ASAP for the last 2 years, I really can't handle them. Even an average person would say that they have poor cleaning habits and I used to think the house was dirty way before I developed these compulsions. There have been and still are points where I seriously want to die or think I'm going insane. 

I have to go outside to earn that money to move out and save myself some suffering. I can't decide on what I should do. I know I 100% absolutely cannot stop the handwash showers, I limited it to twice a week max so I don't harm myself any further  - that means I can only go outside and work on two selected days. I also came up with the option of getting another bed and working 5 days a week  - between working days I can use this bed instead of my real one, that way I won't have to have a handwash shower for 5 days in a row. I don't know which I should choose  - the 5 days a week will let me take on a £20k apprenticeship and ensure I can move out in 12 months but I don't know how long I'll be able to keep it up, it will consume me eventually and I don't know if I'll make it out alive. The two days a week will keep me sane for longer but I won't be able to move out in the next year at all :( 

I should also mention that my family are very disfunctional, extremely unsupportive and always closed off. I don't have a healthy relationship (if I can call it that) with either of my parents or siblings. They're quite conservative too, my mum thinks it's shameful to have a child that has mental health challenges (she doesn't know about mine yet) and they fit into the typical homophobic, sexist and religious family. I can picture my mum telling me that Jesus is the answer to all my problems if I ever confessed about how I feel. I've been sharing a single bedroom with 2 sisters and 1 brother since I was about 13. I don't know what to do :(

 I want to reiterate the point I made about the 5 days a week without using handwash consuming me because I think most people would automatically advise me to go for that option, when I say consume I'm talking suicidal thoughts everyday and one day per week of what I think is maybe an episode of depression. That was my average week when I was going to school everyday, since the holidays started 3 months ago I have only gone outside twice  -I still get the episode once a week (once every two weeks sometimes) but the suicidal thoughts have calmed down. I don't know who to turn to, I have to go outside to see a doctor and I'm terrified of CBT. I also cry REALLY easily, I don't want the doctor to sit and watch me cry for 30 minutes. I have a feeling they might declare me unfit for work, I have dreams and goals that I really want to work on. I really don't know what to do :(

343,"Hello, I just made this account just to post here. This has been getting under my skin for the last little while and I have no clue where to go about with it.

I have this friend who I've been friends with since we were 15, I considered him my best mate for a while however the last year or so he's been really, really getting into politics (mostly identity politics). I didn't really mind this at first but now it's something he brings up on an almost daily basis. I'm not a very political person and rarely ever enjoy talking about politics as a whole. He's constantly posting memes about this view points, mocking people who disagree with him and anytime I see anyone type out something against him on this he dog piles them and twists their arm before the person in question just gives up and says he's right.

I do agree with a lot of what he says but he's a bit more extreme and is definitely more vocal than I'll ever be. I'm just getting fed up of him giving lectures on the same topics and I feel like I'm the only one in my friend circle that's just getting drained of having nearly every conversation being turned into him getting on a soapbox about these topics despite us already agreeing with him. That or him trying to make me feel bad whenever I decide to chip in and say how I don't quite see an issue that way.

I made it clear to him I ain't a political person and I dislike the constant discussion of the same topics. I do like him, I wouldn't be friends with him for this long if I didn't so how should I go about on this without potentially damaging the friendship?

347,"Ok so I can't seem to find the silver lining in regards to my childhood/teenagehood.  


I am not sure if my parents were abusive, incapable of raising a child. Or that I was a bad child and didn't know how to handle me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother hit me a lot when I was a kid pre 12 years old. She used to hit me with her flip-flop, the broom, the vacuum. But she only did that when we made a big mess in the house, like spilling milk all over the floor and doing slip and slide on it. I would get 90% of the beating since I was the oldest. So I am debating whether we were actually little shits that deserved it or was just a chain reaction and her being an adult should have better self-control. She also could be neglectful at times, e.g. not having food, or serving raw/burned food.   


My father on the other hand was not loving father at all or involved emotionally. I still don't think he ever said ""Love you"" to us or my mother. He did physically hit me once or twice but he mostly lectured me, which by that meant threatening to kick me out of the house, threatening me in general and locking me outside (At least until my mother came to open for me). There wasn't a serious reason for most of those tantrums, could have been for pity things, like not bringing back the correct change from the newspaper stand. But mostly was because of me and my brother were fighting, physically, verbally, breaking stuff, bad grades or doing bad things. On the downside I was the only one being lectured even if it wasn't really my fault what the lecture was about. I feel like many times he was stressed and took it out on me. But I wasn't an angel either, I did haze my brother when he was younger, e.g. ambushing him with water guns with my friends etc.

  
On the upside they spend a lot of money on tutoring and paid for my college. Also we went to some nice places for vacations. My mother spend time taking us around different classes throughout the day. My father even if absent most of the time because of his work, I guess set an example of what working hard looks like.   


I don't have a reference point to know if this was abusive behavior or normal part of growing up. If my parents were good or evil. So your advice can be helpful and comparison to your experiences growing up. I know I resent my family so much that I don't want to see them again but I am not sure if this is because I am shifting blame for my own responsibilities and failures in life. My main reason for resenting them is that I feel like they didn't equip me with the right tools to face life as someone at mid 20s. Didn't help establish a good work-ethic at a young age, messed up my social development. I feel like every time and opportunity I had for growth they shut it e.g. wanting to be involved with sports. I know there are worse and better parents.  


Advice?  


\*\*TL:DR; My parents might have not been the best, but I don't have reference point to compare them and know if my resentment is me shifting the blame for my own responsibilities or them being objectively shitty parents. \*\*

351,"This has been going on for quite a while. It started when my uncle and my aunt decided to get a cat (named Sharon) but after having one litter she got spayed and the kitten were given away. So she is the only one that got spayed and is actually both an indoor cat and outdoor cat.

Afterwards random stray cats came along and since they got fed regularly they tend to stick around.

One female cat (named Kimberly) ended up staying (as a outdoor cat) and she had a bunch of kittens, one grew up and right now he is at least 6 years old. He got vaccinated but he was a bit sick, he lost his fur for a while but it grew back but I noticed he is kinda skinny (I asked if we could bring him to the vet for a check up but they don't care much). 

All the other kitten either got given away or disappeared (they are a lot of male cats who kill kitten to make momma cat go back in heat again, pretty nasty) or died during birth but last year 3 new kitten popped out out of nowhere (I am sure she hid them well) and they were all grown (2-3 months) so it almost impossible to catch them, touch them or give them to someone else. We tried once and it didn't end well lol

So in total we have 6 cats and I heard (right now I am at a different apartament) Kimberly had a new grey kitten...it is still small so probably a few weeks old. I considered to tame it so I keep it  myself inside (I doubt since my mother doesn't want to keep pets inside and I am allergic to cat fur but I always wanted to have a cat as a house pet) or give it away to someone who wants an indoor cat.

Basically I am considering getting Kimberly spayed because if it keeps going on like this we will have +10 cats in a couple of years or less but my family won't listen and they say it isn't important at the moment (it is never important to them).

I told my uncle who generally has to take care of the cats (feed them etc) to do it multiple times but he won't listen.

I considered going to the vet myself, I have some money but I need some help to catch the cat, bring it to the vet etc

I know they are associations who do it for free for large groups of cats (a woman did it for a bunch of cats here near the house I am atm) but my family doesn't care at all.

They get defensive, ignore me, tell me they have more important stuff to do or tell me they will do it but it never happens.

Also this time I will try to make sure this kitten won't disappear or get eaten but they don't give a fuck since fewer cats is better (I know it has no logic but still).

We don't have huge money issues and 100 euros is pretty affordable...

TL;DR: How do I convince my family to take care of this cat issue? There is one potentially sick cat and unspayed cats who will reproduce sooner or later (not just Kimberly but also those 3 stray ones).",06Sep2018,1

353,"I’m a senior in high school and I’m going into college. I feel like I’ve utterly wasted my high school years 

Over the four years I’ve only been in two clubs (one of which I dropped because it was an ‘art class’ but all we did was clean up the art room) and I’ve had basically no friends. I had a few kids I’d chat with but they didn’t feel close at all

My parents tell me college will be the best 4 years of my life but they also said that about high school. I just don’t want to waste my youth and look back with regret. I go to a private school and nobody there has any interests that I have. Maybe a handful of kids played video games but they’re always the typical CoD kids (don’t have anything against CoD it’s just I don’t play it as much). Everyone only care about radio pop and nobody likes metal or rock. Only 5 kids watch anime and they’re all Asian girls only interested in yaoi and magical girl anime. The closest thing I can find is sports which I’m only somewhat interested in but not fanatical about like most guys. I just feel so alienated. I also feel I struggle so much with small talk and approaching a conversation

354,"          Hey all, i wanna preface this by saying thank you to any and all responses, at this point any advice will do. Im not in a dire situation, at least it wouldn’t look that way as an outsider looking in. Im a senior in high school and i still feel like a child for asking advice.

          Anyways for about 2 years I’ve had this crush on a girl, lets call her Lynne (obviously not her real name). Lynne had had a boyfriend since around 2014 according to her at least, lets call him George. At this point i don’t know her In the beginning of our Sophomore year she has a breakup with her then and current bf, these breaks, from what I’ve been told, are somewhat frequent, and happen probably every 6 months, so thats about 2-3 possible breakups at that point. That day she i gave her a donut just to cheer her up, sounds stupid but its important later, at least to me. She was the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen, so that day was the start of it. 

          I later started talking to Lynne through this app called TBH and whenever some comment like “prettiest girl” or something would come up, i’d hit her name, because oh well shes pretty and idk her (didn’t know her at the time, just by looks) she eventually started responding to them trying to find who it was and discovered it was me, we got to talking and became pretty decent friends, talking almost everyday. She and George get back together but that doesn’t stop me, she and I would talk in and out of school, and id help her through those breakups, saying things like “do whatever you think is right, I’m with you the whole way” i wasn’t trying to friendzone myself but i didn’t want to push too hard and fuck it up. 

          Fast forward to later in Junior year. She and George were arguing constantly, even at school they’d throw remarks at each other. It got bad enough for them to split again, but this time it was different. That day i had brought one of those donut pastries, and while she was walking in the hall with her friend i stopped her and said “Hey Lynne. I know you’re going through tough times and it reminded me of last year so i wanted to give you this” She didn’t know what it was but her friend did, and said “those are the donut things!” Lynne had been crying that day and looked like she was gonna do it again, but just smiled and we just kinda starred at each other. I still kick myself for not doing anything in that moment. She was tougher about it, saying “we aren’t getting back together”, “forget him” etc. She now would hang out with me more often, talk to me 1 to 1 instead of with her friends, during the lunch hour she would follow me to my hangout classroom and sit with me. I tried not to get too excited about it so i acted laid back, obviously not pushing away but also not really acting interested. 

          This was around the time where we actually started talking, like 2 people clicking. She’d talk to me all day and into the night, nothing weird, just really clicking together, like nothing i’ve done. It felt different. I didn’t have weird thoughts like i did with other girls, no weird dreams. I just liked talking to her, being around her, seeing her. It seemed for a while she felt he same way. But 2 weeks later she got back together with George. I was crushed but i didn’t show. I never mentioned it to her how much i liked her and i think she may have thought i wasn’t interested. I thought id have more time. We never talk anymore, but at school she will smile and say hi when she sees me. I think about our conversations every day, i see her face everywhere, and i just daydream all the time. I cant help but feel like i was used, but i don’t wanna believe it. Shes so kind and pretty, its senior year and i want to let her know how i feel, but it seems the time is never right, what do i do?",06Sep2018,3

This is what my teeth look like. I haven't talked to an orthodontist, but my dentist told me that I don't need braces unless I am concerned with the aesthetics of my teeth. However, my parents don't want to shell out the cash to fix the crooked teeth that I have.

Can braces make my jaw decently wide / fix my weak chin? Or will I have to get plastic surgery for that (when I'm 18)?

356,"So the thing is. New year of school, new class and ofc new girls. There is this girl and we sit next to each other and she is very clingy, I mean very clingy (physically for now, since it is the second day we met we can't text each other but I expect her to be clingy via text too) when we are in lessons she puts her head on my shoulder, she whisper things from her mind or her mood (she is very open I guess) and in my mind I am like ""alright this is cool I guess, she is open no big deal"" but then something more interesting happened. When we had a break and we sat in the common room (the rest of the class was there too) she sat very close to me and I mean really close. She was basically on my lap hugging me from the neck and staying really close to my face. After half an hour of her staying like this her friend started joking about us (especially her) on the fact that we are so close. Didn't give it to much attention, I joke about my friend when they are close to a girls too, no big deal. After 5 more minutes another girl asked ""Are you guys dating?"" and she looked at me with a ""is she serious"" face and said no.

358,"Using an alt account since family and friends know my real Reddit. 

Anyways I have the opportunity to move literally across the country for a promotion. The state that I am in may have the same position become available in the next 4 to 6 years, 2 months, or never (really just depends on who quits/promotes/etc). The only issue is my parents, brother and sister-in-law, and ailing grandfather all moved about an hour away from where my wife and I live. They say that they were moving here anyways, from 12 hours away, but we know it was to be closer to my wife, my kids and I. My family and I are polar opposites. But still family nonetheless. I know it will crush them if we were to move. 

Pros of moving; more money, equal to cheaper cost of living, bigger city with more opportunities for my wife (teacher), my wife would be 2 hours from her sister, more chances for future promotions, better weather

Cons of moving; toll on family, toll on 3 kids (5,10,15), moving in general sucks, ""starting over""

A friend of mine that I met at work years ago had always relationship and health issues, I recognise schizophrenia because I lived with a guy years ago that had it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22 year old male and I've finally decided I need to move away from my toxic family. I only have about $1,000 to my name and a Computer Engineering degree from my state university. My family is incredibly toxic and I believe I need to move somewhere far away for a little to distance myself from them. I feel this way because not only do they actively do things which hinder my ability to move forward, but living with them is causing me to have anxiety and depression.

Is there anything I can do to escape my current situation and start somewhere new? I currently live on the east coast and have considered moving west where I can most likely find a computer engineering job. I would be willing to move anywhere where I can make a living and have a roof over my head. I just don't want to move somewhere and end up being homeless.

&amp;#x200B;

It's complicated because my parents have all of my personal information (birth certificate, SS card, etc) inside a safe in the house which I will never get access to and they would only give me access to it if I needed it for that specific day. Any advice on where to move forward for this would be much appreciated. I really feel trapped here and I don't just want to move out of the house to somewhere they'll find me. I just want to start a new life temporarily and potentially come back to my family later in my life.

Full Story: 

Life is good. Married to someone who shares my values and shit. We're happy. We both work. Except, not really. I have a job, and things are changing so I have to retrain. Great opportunity, free training to stay on in a better position. Tons of freedom too. Office is usually empty and I'm welcome to do all my work from home, so I do. Well, I do stay home. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not working. I'm not doing the training. Everyone at this company is professional as fuck and twice as busy. I don't always get help with things I don't understand and even when help is available, I find myself too anxious to even try. I find excuses or other things to do. Well, I used to. Now? I don't even bother. I would at least be productive with stuff around the house. Today the place is a mess. The two pets we have aren't getting the care they should. The bathroom is filthy. The kitchen is a pit. Clutter and unopened mail abounds. Not too worried about the mail, because we don't have a lot of bills, and most of them are auto-pay, but this is something I used to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be at the gym. Used to run the dog. Used to get deep into projects for the house and for friends. Used to read all the time. Used to volunteer at my church and I even was an instructor for a martial arts program. Now I browse amazon for things for projects, but shit and don't use it. I listen to audio books in the car, but I don't read. Gym and running don't happen, though to some degree that's because of my leg- I injured it while in the Corps. I guess I'm not super concerned about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Been listening to the books The Power of Habit (50% done) and The Now Habit (30% done) and while there's good stuff in them, I'm not retaining it. I can't see ways to apply this information. I used to take notes and have a steel trap of a mind, but now? I've gotten so little from these that I haven't even finished listening to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no discipline and I'm going to kill the good life I have because of it. I will lose everything and yet I can't bring myself to change or to care. \*What is wrong with me?\* And how do I change myself?",06Sep2018,1
366,"Hey all! I hope this is something that is ok to post here, I genuinely feel conflicted and need some thoughts and advice. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. Thank you if you take the time to read this! (1-2min read)

So last year I finally started slowly getting out of a long and horrible depression. Which is a great thing.
But while I was getting better, loneliness and having very few friends and people around me was very difficult. I had nobody to really speak to and nothing to do in my free time, leaving me feeling rejected by society and alone in life. 

I met this girl on vacation and I have been meeting up with her nearly weekly. When we met it was a lot of hugging and kissing, affection I needed and craved for so long. It was blissful, finally having someone!
So we have gone to weekend long parties and hung out in a romantic way, having a great time for about half a year now. It really was just ecstatic being thrown into an active lifestyle with another person after years of depression. Like a dream come true or a wish fulfilled.

But then recently, the dream broke and suddenly I have no romantic feelings for her anymore (and do not find her attractive at all.) 
I have been really trying but I can’t get it back. I never really found her super pretty but it just didn’t matter. Now that love just died..
The love for her and our friendship still persists. Just not in that way. 

The last few times it has been hard to have as much fun with her since this has bothered me a lot. I can’t lie to her and tell her I like her in such a way, while actually I don’t. 

Should I tell her now and risk losing all this and losing her, (and if so, how?) or do I have other options?
I hate playing with emotions and I only want to be honest, but just thinking of my old life makes me so scared and willing to do just about anything to not lose what I have now.

To add to the problem is that she now is in a rough place herself; having few people, no family and a bad job and living situation.  In her words I am the love that makes her life worth living and telling her this will break her. (And me).

Sidenote: we also still have things planned and paid for. I don’t care about the money, but I just want to keep her in my life without the romantic part. 


Thanks again for reading / thinking about this. All advice is welcome!

I paid the original $700, no problem.

369,"   “Honestly when it  comes to your anger, you can get pretty upset. Granted that's everyone really. But there's times and it's not every time, but you get upset/mad to the point where you say hurtful stuff. 
   One that i remember off the top of my head is, when we were at walmart in my car and the bmv wouldn't renew your license because of your mail didn't match your name. You got super pissed and when i tried helping you, you said hurtful stuff( i don't recall what exactly you said) but i know you said stuff bc we ended up fighting because of it. 
   I get at times when you are upset you need time to cool down. But you also don't need/have to take it out on me. which honestly it happens quite often where you do. I may apologize right away when you get mad or upset because i don't like when you're mad/upset especially when you are upset/mad with me. So i try to fix it quickly and try and put you in a better mood. But often that makes it worse and you go off. So i know i need to stop apologizing right away when you're mad/upset especially when it has nothing to do with me. but i also need to stop pushing you to not be mad/upset and just let you cool down. 
   But when you do get mad, your anger has scared me before. like i said the other day, because i don't know what you are capable of and what you would do. i'm not saying i think you'd actually hit me but i just know that i don't feel safe some times when you are angry. 
   I just think you need to work on controlling your angry. talking it out, or whatever. I want to be able to communicate with you about everything especially when we are upset/mad because communication is key. 
   LyricsMode, you do mean the world to  me. You're my bestfriend. You're my rock. You're mine. You're the love of my life. You're my fiancé. And most importantly you are my future husband.

I want to live my life with you and if we continue to have open communication and support each other and grow with each other. we will live a long happy life together. and that's what i want.

I am a 25 year old that has never so much as went on a third date, this has been in large part b/c I have always been so focused on school and been broke and felt too inadequate to date. For the last 2 years I have been doing a masters degree in England (originally from Canada) and when I move back home will try and start dating. The problem is, I feel I'm so behind the curve that any girl I do meet, i'll be so 'overly excited' that the first/second occasion would probably be terrible and for a girl that would be in her mid 20s I would imagine this would be a major turn off. I figured since I'm close to the prostitution mecha why not. I was thinking specifically just pay for oral that way the risk of an STD isn't present either (I know they have condoms but still there is a risk). Also most girls probably don't do BJs and as an indian guy I imagine it would be hard to get with a white girl anyway so the way I see it I get A) experience B) perhaps only BJ ever C) perhaps only sexual act with a white girl. With no downside since it's just a bj.

379,"He was a heavy cocaine user before we met. When I met him I was under the impression he was “recovering”. Now every time we go have drinks specially when we go out in groups I always notice multiple trips to the bathroom. He’s the only person constantly having to excuse himself to the bathroom. Since I’ve been suspicious for some time I make sure to pay attention when he comes back always comes back wiping his face and his nose not realizing I’m observing his behavior.  There have been several occasions where we have been on the phone and I’ve heard loud sniffs (usually just 1 or 2) right in the middle of his sentences. A couple weeks ago we went out and he asked me to help with his bags but when i approached one of his bags he quickly told me not to touch that one. It was partially open and i saw what i thought was a clear plastic bag with a white substance inside along with a small metal nail file. Being that i want to give him the benefit of doubt, and believe that he is sober i try to just tell myself to trust him and ignore my suspicions. I don’t ask him because clearly this is a touchy subject and I know it will turn into a huge fight that I am not sure I’m ready for. Am I just being paranoid? ",06Sep2018,2

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure where to start, to be honest I’m kind of scared to put this all down (or as much of it as I can remember). I guess first, is me. I’m 31 now, generally 100% driven, motivated, thriving to make everyday better than the last. I have a bachelors degree, masters degree, 11 industry prof certifications, a great job, good pay, race motorcycles, body-build, photography, etc… and I’ve lost that person.

I met this girl over two years ago. It started out as friends, and “wanting to help”. She was fighting for sobriety, along with an additional addiction to Adderall, clonopin, weed, and literally just about anything that would alter her state. She already had two DUI’s at this point. Soon after that, VERY soon after that, it became more. And we had a great three and a half weeks. Every week of sobriety while I was with her was greeted with a little note telling her how proud I was, and a flower/gift. At the end of this 3.5 weeks or so I had to go out of town for work. My first night out of town I was face timing her, and she was staying at my house (watching my dogs), and admitted she was drinking. It broke my heart, and I didn’t know what to do. I rushed home the next day, and emptied out every ounce of liquor I had in my house (which I didn’t even remember was there, I don’t drink, and its been there from years before). This is where everything went south, in a majorly bad way.

This is where the worst of everything started. And I’m not sure how to even put it down on paper. As I mentioned she already had two DUI’s at this point, and had an interlock (breathalyzer) device on her car. And things got progressively worse. I literally must have 50-100 times gotten out of bed in the middle of the night, driven across town to pick her up drunk somewhere. All the while constantly flaking and bailing on me. Turning her back on me, and only to be the most abusive person I’ve met afterward. She flaked on my daughter three times before I put a stop to letting that happen. She would be literally physically abusive, drunk, and screaming, cussing, calling me names, making up stories, talking shit, and literally push, punch, shove, kick, and everything in between. I can’t recall the number of times, I’ve been punched in the face, or the head, pushed, kicked. There was damage all around my house, from wholes she punched, things she broke, etc.

Throughout this entire time period, I literally did everything I could to help. I offered to have her move in rent free so she would be out of the environment she was living in with roommates that loved to get hammered everyday. I tried to find ways to get her on my insurance, even entertaining visiting the courthouse so she could have insurance to get help. Later on in the story you learn I moved to Texas, even tried having her move down at one point so she could get a new start away from everything bad in her life. I offered to go to AA with her, go to Alanon(sp) meeting smyself, talked to other friends I had that got sober to see how I could help more.  I literally gave everything I had in more, even when I had nothing to give to try and help/support this girl.

About 6-7 months after starting all this, I called it off, because it was too much. We kept in contact, and she would have moments where “she was so sorry, she fucked up, and she was changing”, and I kept opening the door, and believe the words, just to get screwed over the exact same way a day later.

A month or so after this I had torn my achilles tendon, and went in for surgery. Three days after surgery she offered to come over and help take care of me, because I wasn’t supposed to even be up walking around, etc, and she wanted to “make up for everything by at least helping me”. About 15 minutes into her being here she got a text that her friends were at the bar drinking, and straight bailed on me. I got a call around midnight that night from a bartender on her phone, that she was sitting there balling, crying, because she was hammered, and all her friends bailed on her. So me, not even supposed to be up walking, got in my car with my crutches, drove left footed (automatic car) across town and picked her up. This was one of the worst nights. Between this point and finally going to bed, I saw her straight black out and fall down 5-6 separate times. Once in the car. Once when we got home and pulled in the drive way, she got out of the car and straight blacked out and fell straight to the cement. And the rest in the house…again me helping with my one foot and crutches. Somewhere, sometime after getting her into the house, she came to…and as the vicious drunk, angry thug, who was out to “put me in my place”. Started yelling, screaming, verbally berating me like no other, punching me in the face and head, and finally said I’M LEAVING. Well she had no car, no way to leave, so at the top of my stairs leading down to the front door on my crutches I stood in front of her and said “sweetheart you have no car, no way to leave, no where to walk to, lets just go to bed, and I’ll pay for your Uber to anywhere in the morning”. I repeatedly asked her to just go to bed, and sleep, and figure it out in the morning. Well her temper never died down, after some more screaming and punching, she eventually spartan kicked me down the stairs off my crutches. As soon as I stood up at the bottom of the stairs and gathered myself, she was already down there, and planted a big knee to my chest which threw me into the front door. I tweaked my bad foot up pretty bad and had to go back to the doc the next day cause they were worried I messed up the stitches when I “fell down the stairs”. I forgot, also this night at some point she got mad and picked up my prescriptions and threw them across the room where the exploded on impact with the wall. I lost two days worth of my pain killers that night.

That was just one instance of “physical abuse”, that I always ignored as abuse and said “it was just her drunk”, not the real girl I fell in love with. But it wasn’t just the physical or verbal abuse, it was the lying. She lied about everything all the time. About that 6-7 month mark when I said I can’t do this anymore she admitted to lying just about every day since we met about being drunk or high, or about miscellaneous other things. She lied about lying. She lied about absolutely nothing, lied about anything.

This whole thing went on for about another year and a half after I said I couldn’t/shouldn’t be doing this because she would always have “enlightened moments” where she realized what she was doing, and everything was changing, and she was so sorry, and this that and the other thing. And I kept opening doors, believing something was real.

Over the course of the 2.5 years or so of knowing/being involved with her, she was emotionally or physically involved with 11 other men, and 3 other women that I KNOW of. Only that I KNOW of. The first fourth of July she bailed on me to “go hang out with her sister and family”, only later to find out she went over to a guys house with the intent of cheating. Claimed it was just flirting and she left drunk. One time she tried to have a guy from out of town come over, and spend the night with her, cause “she was going through a hard time”, which apparently didn’t happen, however she moaned his name during sex the following night or two, because “we were just talking about him a lot”. People she never claimed anything to have happened with I found in notes around her house, and journals later that all turned out to me more lies, around infidelity. One of the nights she begged me to come over, I got there and she was already drunk. When the talk wasn’t going her way, she finally picked up her phone, texted someone, and started laughing at me. I said “come on what was that about” and she laughed some more and said “I just texted \[malesnamehere\] to come over and fuck”. This in addition to other times of finding her flirting with guys on her phone, one time it was another guy and I saw “I want to fuck you” and the conversation/flirting continuing on from there, with her constantly lying, trying to back out of what really happened. She was on “imaginary probation” 4 different times. She had imaginary “counselors” that she went to go see 5 different times, that never happened. And she would even make up the entire stories of what they talked about for the session, how it went, how much she cried, and how much it was helping. I’ve seen her lie to her boss, her family, everyone, countless times, about nothing. I watched her hammered facetime her family and tell them she was 100% sober. She lied about getting the implant that alcoholics/addicts get to help with sobriety, watch her lie about where the implanted it, what it felt like, how long the appointment was, all with me there to my face, where there clearly was no procedure done. And yes to hear her admit later that she lied about it.

The lies were terrible too. Aside from infidelity related lies, she has lied about or supposedly: gotten in 8 imaginary wrecks, her sister and sisters kids in a wreck twice, dad in the hospital 4 times, grandmother twice, her boss twice, herself 3 times, dad with cancer, client with cancer, had a completely “imaginary” phone conversation with her step mom (literally talking to no one, pretending to be on the phone, talk/cry, say I love you and bye), and even got called out on it, and pulled up her phone log and said “I don’t know why it doesn’t show it but I’m not lying”….the lying was the worst part. I’ve almost never had any sigfig lie to me, or lie and immediately come clean. And this was the default status quo with her, like I said before, about anything, or nothing, or everything. And I knew everytime she lied, and would call her out, then she would get defensive about it, then she would scream, yell and cuss about it, then either ride the lie to death, or later cry and say “I don’t know why I lied”, while still lying about parts of the story. It was unimaginably hard.

And by this point, you the reader, are probably at, how the hell did this go on for so long. And I don’t know. I think mostly because I knew she needed help, and I was the only one who knew how bad her addiction and battle was, because she constantly lied to everyone else about it. She would work either drunk, or in withdrawals (shaking, cold sweats, etc), drive drunk all the time unless I was with her, or offered to help. and all the while, she turned literally everyone against me. She would make up stories, tell lies to her boss, her family, MY friends, who no longer were friends, about me being abusive, me being this big asshole, just incredible stories.

One night after things were “over” she showed up at my house, drunk. After trying to leave and drive off, I begged her to stay so she wouldn’t drive, and she again, flipped the switch, and tried to beat the ever living crap out of me, her boss “made her” file a protection order against me. I picked her up again, she was drunk, I tried getting her to go to sleep. I tried sleeping on the couch myself, sleeping in the basement, I tried getting her to calm down and it wasn’t happening. Finally she screamed JUST CALL THE F\*CKING COPS then! So I said okay (because like I said at this point she was already punching, pushing, shoving, I tried getting her to go to sleep and removing myself to literally any point in the house, but nothing was pacifying the situation), and I walked into the bedroom and got my phone. She cornered me, and punched me in the face. I tried to move past her (between the bed and the dresser/wall), and she shoved me again. I was able to side step into the hall, but she tripped her self, and went shoulder first into my hallway blowing out a 2x3 hole into my hallway wall. At some point she snapped out of it in her drunken stupor and started balling and saying “omg what I’m doing, I’m so sorry, please don’t call the cops, please let me stay, can we please go to bed”. So we went to bed. The next day she apparently went to work, and said I abused her, and her boss made her file a protection order. Funny enough she was back at my house a few days later wanting to talk things out, and be with me all over again, when I got served with the protection order. While she was asleep I took pictures and videos to prove she was there, and obviously not “afraid” of me. But the protection order read like a john wick movie crossed with the greatest WWE match of all time. I’m a pacifist, I literally have never laid a finger on this girl, or anyone. I’ve been through a lot, I can take a lot. And all these episodes constantly reminded myself that, “shes drunk, this isn’t the real girl, this isn’t her”, which allowed me to have a lot more patience than a normal situation. A few days later knowing it was all lies, because I said I would challenge it for the shear lack of a single line of truth in the entire document, including her being drunk in the first place, she asked me to drive her to the courthouse, where she went before a judge and cancelled the order, saying she was drunk, she wasn’t scared or afraid, etc. The whole situation has was just ridiculous, and yes I was dumb enough not to leave things there.

Sadly enough this wasn’t our first interaction with the police. One night she showed up at my house drunk, after my repeatedly asking her not to come over anymore. She showed up anyway, and she was drunk, and started rampaging tried to leave, and when I wouldn’t let her leave to walk home or “somewhere” she stole my keys and stole my car and left, to which I immediately called the police. She turned around and came back to my place just before they got there, and even then she mouthed off to the police for a while before she snapped out of it, and was complacent. I should note here, after I called it off, she would repeatedly show up at my house after asking her not to multiple times. Most of the time drunk.

Nor was it the last time. The following valentines day she asked to spend a peaceful night with me. I declined, asked her not to. She showed up later anyway. It was fine for a while, but near bed time she freaked out, screaming and yelling. Eventually we just went to bed, but that morning she blew up again. I finally asked her to leave, because I couldn’t do it anymore, and she screamed no. I asked her to leave a few more times and she finally got pissed and stormed out. As I was getting ready for work, I went to let the dogs out, phone in one hand, shirt in the other, and had 6-8 cops out of no where in my back yard pointing rifles, with lazers on my chest, and one cop almost shoot my dog. She apparently left, called the cops, and I have no idea what she told them. But I got questioned by the cops, and taken to the hospital, because apparently somewhere in her story I had a gun and was trying to shoot myself, and was a danger to people around me. I got to spend all day in the hospital/mental ward or whatever its called, and finally got to have my interview/conversation with the therapist at around 6pm. I explained the whole story. He said “you need to take more responsibility for yourself, and put a stop to everything, and stop letting her come back”. To which I completely agreed, but having seen the situation and the story said “normally this is a 72 hour hold, but I’m sending you home, go home, put a stop to this, and don’t let me see you again.”.

Since then it was sporadic on/off of I’m so sorry, let me fix things, then “fuck you I hate you” the next day. I tried putting a stop to it multiple times. But it only got worse. The drinking got worse, the lies got worse, the treatment got worse. These became the darkest and most depression ridden years of my life. I tried. I stopped talking to her, blocked all social media, blocked her number, but it never stopped. She would call me from blocked number (\*67 then my number lets her call from a blocked number so she could still get through from “unknown number). Download text apps and call/text me from burner numbers. I changed my phone number, and she got it from god knows who, and started the entire process over again. Created new emails a couple times to try to reach out that way. She would blow up my phone and I would have 30-50 missed calls from unknown numbers. I have screenshot of three pages of texts from 24 different burner numbers of her trying to reach out/get me to respond. And all the while telling everyone else and her family a different story.

So I had to change something. I literally was not going to survive this. Around April 2018 a recruiter reached out to me from a job in Dallas (from living in Nebraska) and I got it, and took the job, and picked up my life and moved away from everything I knew, all the friends, or the couple I had left after her lies and stories turned everyone else away. Left the ability to regularly see my daughter (who still lives with her mother in Nebraska), and left.

And even then, it didn’t stop. I’d get calls, and voicemails, and texts, until one night, I got a call from the county jail. She finally got her third DUI. She was taken in for drunk driving (.209), had weed on her, was speeding 12 over, and oh driving without a license, because it got revoked 2-3 years ago with her 2nd dui, and she never went and got her license back after the interlock was taken off. We had a couple days of intense conversation about everything, and how bad it had gotten, and yet again, how everything was going to change. Found out later 90% of our conversation during this time was all lies too. So me, being the complete idiot I am, picked up and flew back to Omaha. Spent 600 dollars on a plane ticket, 200 dollars on ubers during this week, bailed her out, at 3000 dollars (her bail) that I didn’t really have. The peace didn’t last a day. That very first day she snapped/lashed out a couple times, and it went down hill from there. She got violent twice over this week, physically. The verbal abuse came back real quick.  And I finally had to leave her place three days earlier than I planned. The day I left, she was hammered that night. Next day she started drinking at 9am, and was drunk all day. Shes lied to her parents and put on a huge façade to everyone, including her boss, who started to catch on to the lies and how bad things were and got in contact with me. I told my story, told her what was really going on, and the dots started connecting about what was really happening. Since this whole event I finally bailed, stopped responding to burner texts, stopped answering calls.

It took me along time and several conversations with this person, her previous boss to realize that it wasn’t just “a bad road with someone who had bad days”, but a lot of literal abuse, damaging situations, and everything in between. I’ve heard stories of abuse, and how heartbreaking it was. And I never in a million years thought I could be in an abusive relationship, thought or felt like I was being abused. And I honestly take full responsibility for it, I kept opening the door, I kept trying to help, and I left the opportunities on the table. At some point she became my addiction I guess, and I continued to want to help, continued believing empty words, and continued to put myself in these situations, knowing the outcome, and how bad it was every time.

But I don’t know where to go from here. These past few years have been the worst in my life, I’ve been the most depressed I’ve ever been, I’ve lost track of the things that keep me sane, like going to the gym, racing motorcycles, photography, and am barely hanging on with keeping up with work. In the past two years I’ve had severe neck pain, which I’ve seen multiple massage therapists and chiropractors for and couldn’t figure out where it came from or why it was so bad, until I recently realized that I’ve been so down I literally walk around, sit, anything with my head literally hanging down. The gym has always been my church, and as a previous competitive bodybuilder to no longer go to the gym, or even eat, I know its gotten bad. All my days and nights are dark. Feeling like I can barely get to the next day. I definitely still love her, worry about her, hope shes doing well, but she is a constant walking path of destruction. And even while having removed myself from the situation finally, I’m still under a dark cloud from everything. There were dark times throughout where I was literally ready to stop trying to make it to the next day cause things had gotten so bad. And while today, I’m still breathing, and moving forward, I still don’t know what to do with myself. I’m scared for anyone to be close. Scared to talk to people in any real way, scared to try and meet new people. I go crazy staying inside my apartment everyday, but scared to go out and meet people or do social things. I don’t know anyone here, so I can’t just “hang out with people” or let them force me out so I can get out of my head. My only saving grace has been motorcycle racing on the occasional weekend, where I can empty my head, and hang out with a couple guys I met racing and focus on nothing but going faster on the track. But those are fewer and far between lately. I constantly feel like I’m suffocating, with no view of fresh air. I know the plain option is to go and talk to someone, and Im planning to next week after I get back from a wedding I have to attend. But I’m not good at talking in the first place, worse after all this, with an inability to trust people, makes it hard. So now where here, and I don’t know where to go. Again, yes its entirely my fault. I should have bailed appropriately early on. But I’ve always lived for other people, help where people needed help, and be there unconditionally for everyone that’s crossed into my life. And I knew she needed help. Not a great excuse, but that’s my reasoning. And I’ve literally killed myself over it. I literally don’t know what to do, or say, or what the point of writing this was. I’m just trying to survive and not doing a good job of it on my own.  As you can imagine this isn’t even half of the details of what went on, but paints a big enough picture.

386,"Hello guys, I just wanted some advice on this. So the situation is this:

I started working at a bistro over the summer and basically my last weekend working there is this one. I am moving to France next week for the year abroad part of my degree. Anyway it's been okay the most of the time there but my last shift was not pleasant for me. I went in after telling the owners I was sick (I have a cheat infection) I said I could go in if they needed me to and they did so I went. I dosed up on painkillers and went to work, I mentioned it at the start I was sick but didn't make any other complaints about it. Anyway it started to get busy. One of the owners, the male, we'll call him MO, has always been quite rude but that day he was horrific. He sighed and huffed and puffed at me, he got a drinks order wrong so I had to redo a few for the table and then shamed me for taking longer than expected to do it. He also at one point pushed my back towards the kitchen and grabbed my arm at least once to ask ""what I was doing"" because the two owners have no co direction, so if I was running an errand for one I was often lectured by the other and made to do something else, and then lectured for not doing the other job. Anyway all in all I suffered a bit of a panic attack (which I hadn't for months as I am on medication for my GAD), and I felt very ill. I left my shift early. I was quite upset afterwards, as the way MO treated me made me feel very dehumanised and a lesser being.

Anyway I am dreading going to work tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday and I really do not want to, especially as it my last weekend at home and do not want to spend it being miserable and anxious of my treatment at work.

Should I just call in sick for the rest of the weekend? Should I tell them the truth of why I don't want to go? Or do I suck it up and just work through it as it is my last weekend?

A few other issues I have with the place:

- at my interview I asked about tips and they said they are split at the end of each month. Neither I or any of my co-workers have ever seen any of these tips for the last couple of months, but the tip jar has been emptied at least once 
- it's all cash in hand, so there's no legality behind my employment there. I took it as I needed money over the summer but it doesn't settle right with me
- there's no friendliness there. There's never any praise, encouragement or sense of belonging, it's a constant barrage of criticism or indifference 

TL;DR: the owners at my work are kinda asses and I want to leave last minute leaving them in the lurch but can't find the courage to do so.",06Sep2018,1

393,"So right now I live at home with my parents, I am 25 and going back to school for my bachelor's and have about maybe a year left or so. Recently a friend offered me a room for rent for 400 dollars a month (utilities are included) which isn't half bad for the area, but I'm unsure. 

So I am good friends with this person and for the area it is a pretty good price, in a good area, close to the school, grocery storw and other things, but since I am going to school I can't work as many hours so instead of making about 800 every two weeks it would probably be closer to 400 or 500.

Right now my commute to the school is about 45 min to an hour so I would save money on gas and be closer to the school, it would probably be about 10 min away or so and it would be way easier of a drive in the winter.
There are also more job opportunities and being closer to the school and city also brings more opportunities.

I guess the main worry is monetary because maybe I don't make enough money, I feel like I could swing it, but I would have to be more frugal, which is fine. At the same time I do realize that 400 would be almost half my cash, and with food, phone, and insurance on top of that it would be quite a bit. I don't really party or anything and mainly just spend my money on bills, an occasional thing with friends. Right now I have been putting about half my paychecks into savings Everytime.

There is a side of me that feels that I could grow from living on my own and having that experience and that would push me to be more responsible and mature and help me evolve as an adult. Im 25 and never been on my own and I feel like that could really drive me more because sometime at home I just feel way more lazy not having to really do much. I feel like I get stuck in this rut of comfort.

At the same time I don't want to be dumb about things, and a part of me thinks maybe the adult thing to do would be to just save more money. 

I'm not really in a hurry to move out, I have tried in the past, but it usually didn't work out because of my potential roommate backing out or something, and this seems like a fairly good opportunity if I decide to take it. I could learn about a lot of what it means to live out in the world and grow as a person, but at the same time I don't want to be stupid about it.

I want to give my friend an answer in the next few days, but I'm kind of stuck and we agree that if I move out we would probably be good roommates and motivate each other. I'm stuck though.

397,I was not very present in high school I missed a lot of days due to injuries that had to heal. When I finally got back to school full time my friends had started dating going to parties and things of that nature. I’m in college now and when I’m talking to girls I have absolutely no clue what I’m doing. I’m also a bit out of touch with what kids my age 18+ are interested in and I’m sort of nervous my new friends will think I’m a weirdo and ditch me like my “friends” from high school did. ,06Sep2018,1
398,"I dont think i have had a proper HS life, all the kids in my HS had lost thier virginity in that school but i couldnt even get a date. In case youre unaware i have aspergers syndrome (mild autism) so im never taken seriously. I had talked to this girl at the begining of the year on the bus. I really liked her and we started talking more. She was shy but once we talked she was okay. At one point she dissapeared from school with no explination. She did come back eventually, in a wheel chair. I didnt ask what happened because it mustve been tramatizing and i dont wanna make her sad. After this she talked less and less, her small voiced ""Hello"" became a sub-par wave and responces she gave to my questions to her about life was reduced to a small nod or a head shake or a 1 word reponse. Then the day came to ask her to prom. I greeted her like usual and talked a bit to get ready to pop the question. But stoped me in one of my sentences. ""Hey, do you like me or something?"" she asked me politely. I was nervous to say but i said ""Well since you asked... Yes i do."" she replied ""Listen I think we should just be friends, okay?"" i agreed and stayed silent for the rest of the bus ride home. So as a result. I never had a prom date, nor a highschool gf. Dont get me started about how i got blackmailed freshman year. I now am seeing someone in an open relationship but its a long distance one. Plus my mom doesnt want me to date a girl unless she has a disability like me. I missed out on an important part of my young life and i can never go back. Every time i think about it, it upsets me.  I hate to be the guy who complains about highschool but i just needed to get this out and what i can do to make me have an experiance similar to make up for it. I tried googling adult proms but theyre all 21+ and the only ones that allow 18 year olds are in a whole different state. Plus even than i have no date. I just wanna go back so i can do something about it and have a proper highschool year. ",06Sep2018,2

400,"This just happened an hour or so ago today. I'm still in panic mode, so please forgive me if I start rambling or something like that. 

What happened: I work - err, worked, I guess - in a machine shop. Not some recognizable brand or franchise, just an small independently owned place. You might know the type - not the safest place in the world, dirty as all hell, what even is OSHA? That kinda place.

Well last week, a couple of the guys I work with - pretty solid dudes - said they wanted to play a little prank on another guy. He parks like hot garbage, and they thought it'd be pretty funny to give him a parking space. The parking lot is a mishmash of concrete and some loose rock, it's pretty beat up. So we paint him a parking space and made it a handicap spot. We thought it was pretty funny.

We did it on break, it took 10 minutes, and it was like 10 - 20 bucks worth of paint. Its on the far side of the parking lot, no harm done, no big deal.

Or was it? I got conflicting reports that my boss was either pissed about it or he loved it. Eventually, I tried to get rid of it, but nothing was working. Chemicals took almost nothing off and made the paint run more. I took a wire wheel to it and that didn't work. I tried mopping it for chrissake. Scotchbrite didn't do a thing.

I called the company that supplied the paint, explained the situation and asked how they would get it off. They told my my best bet was to paint over it, so I did. I tried to match the parking lot color as close as I could, and painted over the blue.

Yesterday, they told me they wanted the blue gone by morning. I thought they hadn't looked at the spot, as it was now gray, so I tried to block it out completely. It went from a blue parking spot to a grey splotch on a dark grey parking lot.

I went in to work today and the first thing I did was head into the office. They had a write up for me, which I expected. My coworker, the one who got everyone in on the whole thing in the first place, tried to take the rap for me, talking with my foreman multiple times. 

But they had a second write up for me as well. They cited insubordination, along with defacing/destruction of company property, because instead of taking the paint off, I tried to match it to the parking lot. I had no other options, I had no idea what to do. The second write up came with the ""Discharge"" checkbox ticked and here I am.

Part Two: I've been searching for a new job anyway, in a different field. I applied to a job I was interested in last week, and followed up earlier today. The person I spoke to seemed happy that I was following up, and took my information down and made a note that I had called. I actually have a faint sliver of hope that this will lead to an interview. 

But if it does lead to an interview in the coming days, what do I tell them? Do I act as if I'm still working at the shop? I mean, it took forever to explain everything in writing, and I imagine it would just sound worse in person. I try to maintain that honesty is the best policy, but seeing as I'm out of a job... I don't know what to do.

TL;DR - Fucked up at work, got fired, might have a potential interview soon. ",06Sep2018,2
401,"Four years ago I made a mistake by getting a second bachelors from a for-profit school (my first bachelors is from a good, non-profit university). This decision is hindering my employment prospects and I'm wondering if there's any way to reverse the damage.

405,"I was planning on working for a year or two and buying my own transportation before applying to college but my parents didn't like that idea and pressured me into applying for BYU-I. Somehow I got in and I've completed 3 semesters so far and I'll be starting another two next week. 

I completely bombed my first 3 semesters. I chose Environmental Geoscience as my major which was a big mistake, I'm awful at identifying rocks and pretty much everything required by that major. I found Recreational Management which is pretty fun so far, but I failed my first two classes in that major as well. In fact, I've failed most of the classes I enrolled in because my anxiety and depression have gotten worse while I've been up at college. 

I don't have anybody to hang out with at college because all of my friends have gone on Mormon Missions. I haven't gone on one yet and honestly I don't plan on going on one. I don't really want to make friends because I'll only see them like 3 or 4 months out of the year and I'd rather be friends with people that I'll see more often and can do things with more frequently. I'm also terrible at meeting people, my anxiety got worse while I was up at college so I didn't go to any of my ward activities unless my roommates needed a ride, which wasn't that often. 


I also don't know if I really want to be Mormon anymore. I don't hate the church, but I just don't really care about being Mormon anymore. I don't care about much anymore, to be honest. I don't know if that's because of depression or what but I just don't seem to care about anything.

She ended up sitting by herself, and I was tempted to go up to her, but then I realized that that would be kinda weird.

There are a ton of other problems with my health, lovelife, social life, mental state, etc but I'm betting that starting to organize things a bit will make it easier to sort these other things out.(Would love to read some success stories btw, this movement of mine is being a bit of a leap of faith due to desperation).

413,"Hey there! Before I continue, I would like to let you guys know that I suffer ADD and Anxious Personality Disorder, and hell that is making me a mess. welp.

So I have had a crush on this girl, and I invited her over to watch some serie with me which she agreed immediately. The day after she asked if I wanted to continue, and I agreed. After a couple of more days we held hand while watching the series, and hugged each other before she went home. We went to a party we both were invited to however, I asked if she wanted to watch the serie again on sunday, which she responded with “Maybe”, as dumb I am, I asked if she didn’t want to, which just made myself seem needy blabla. We haven’t spoken alot since that.

Now a couple of days ago, one of our sharefriends told me, she was saying that she really likes me, but I am clingy, which I understand and somewhat agree, because I am little too much of a cuddly person. She told them, she felt I asked too much about watching a movie, which I somewhat also agreed too. Without making it sound too much of an excuse, we both asked each other, and after she “stopped” asking, I might’ve asked three more times in total, which were closely up to each other.

She said she doesn’t like to reject me, and I really haven’t been rejected by her yet other than a few days ago, where I asked if she wanted to chill but she was just saying “No, I am not feeling well, and I am also with a friend”, as she was having a really bad day from sickness. As I understand now, it’s not my duty to take care of her, at this stage so I made a mistake again. This was before she told our sharefriends about me. 

Well its been days, and im giving her air, I havent directly spoken to her, but we have said goodmorning at the school.

So why am I writing here? Well it’s because I am super worried how bad this has gone, and how do I avoid this not being akward and try to repair the done damage, in hope I could get a chance on trying to not be needy.

I am nor in a rush, but anxiety is making me thinking alot and my thoughts become less controlable, I would rather have a rejection now than later, however I dont wanna ruin a possibility.

At this point, I think I am unsuitable to have a girlfriend, or at least dating :P

415,"Hi! It's been some time since I posted something here. Hope you're having a nice day.

Well, here's my situation. I don't longer know where I'm standing. What am I'm talking about? I'm talking about how I feel towards someone, a girl to be specific. I've been liking this girl since almost a year now and right now we're close friends. Ever since I started liking my feelings have grown more and more. I considered telling her but I decided it was to early for it. So while time passed I started seeing ""hints"" that she liked me. Sometimes she wouldn't show those hints. Sometimes I got frustrated about this. I would say to myself to tell her but I still thought it wasn't the time. Time passed and I discovered that she really didn't care about having a relationship and she would be focusing on college but that things could change. That kind of lowered my expectations. Sometimes I would decide to drop those feelings but I just couldn't. I would say I was obsessed with her, and maybe it's true. Also she didn't seem to be eager to message me (but I really can't tell if it's that). The thing is I also started to like another girl during summer and my feelings for girl 1 kind of dropped. But by the time college started again and I started seeing her again, they rose. And right now I don't know where I stand, I don't know what to do, I don't know if my feelings are true, I feel like I should drop everything and choose to focus on me. I'm confused. This not what love is supposed to be, so that's why I considered dropping this for the moment. But I just can't seem to let go. Telling her could maybe help but I'm scared of telling her now because I don't want to bother her with this and that she drops the friendship (if she didn't feel the same way of course).

I feel like I'm in chains right now... 

Sorry for the long post... have a nice day!

I was seeing a guy (not dating) and he went on a family vacation with myself, my mom, and my “stepdad”. He (the guy I was talking to) had to leave a little bit early but said he would be back (this happening after I wouldn’t have sex with him because I really liked him and was afraid he wouldn’t like me if it was bad) so I suspected he didn’t like me anymore because I wouldn’t do what he wanted and I noticed he had taken all of his belonging but his mattress and pillows, so I told him I’d do whatever he wanted if he came back. He said we could only be friends after that because my statement made him uncomfortable. He was supposed to come back the next day so I waited on him 8 hours just to get a text saying he wasn’t coming. I cried about that for a long time. I met a guy I didn’t know to give him oral because I thought it would be good to have practice (I know it wasn’t safe or smart) and now he doesn’t message me anymore. He was messaging me multiple times a day and now he doesn’t even respond to me half of the time.


Neither of my parents have jobs and neither do I. I’m currently in college but living at home and I’m home alone if I’m not at school. Nobody knows it, but I’ve been really suicidal. I planned exactly how I’d do it if it ever got too bad. 

Both of my parents have anxiety and depression, but I don’t feel like I can talk to them. When I mentioned it to my sibling, she tell me it’s stupid and I need to get over myself. She has called me names since childhood and it’s really affected my self esteem.

I’m sorry this post is so long, and I have a lot of unnecessary detail, but I feel like it would give reasons why I feel this way. 

I just don’t want to cry every day of my life and let my past control me so much. I’m afraid if I don’t get help somehow, I’m going to end up taking my own life. ",06Sep2018,4

434,"I'm 18 and from the UK.

Without being specific, I had some problems that lead to me having to drop out of school. This means that I've only got started with my A Levels recently, when everyone else started at 16, so my timeframe is messed up.

But I really want to pursue higher education, and I plan on going to university to study medicine.

But I'm a little worried about my age.

I was thinking of applying this year and doing my exams next year which would be very hard, but the only real reason I'm actually fast tracking my A Levels is because I'm scared of being 'too old' for university.

Now this is not to say that I am judging anyone over 19 who goes to university, but I'm scared of being the 'old dude' during freshers week, or the 'old dude' on my course, or the 'old dude' in my accommodation (most are 6 people sharing a kitchen/living room).

Basically, I want the university experience. I want a friend group. I want to have adventures and enjoy my course and all that is commonly associated with university, but I'm scared that this will all go away if I'm 20 instead of 19.

Is a 20 year old starting at university weird for all the 18 year olds? Is being 20 weird when everyone goes to the clubs or hangs out?

Taking 2 years for my A Levels is obviously the smarter and safer move, but is my age a big deal to the people starting at 18? I don't want to be seen as weird or old by anyone, and people typically go to university at 18, so will I be outcast? Or does no one care as long as there isn't like a generational gap?",06Sep2018,1

440,"Hello I need help to understand what I am feeling.

Throw away account for obvious reasons...

So years ago my father in law told me he was surprised my white soon-to-be wife was going to be marrying a white man.

He also said that he had worked out with his daughter at college and that all she did at the gym was ogle black men. 

This disturbed me at the time, but I don' t think I really let myself process/deal with it all. This has been bottled up for a long time. A truly wonderful vintage! 

Anyway, its been lurking in the back of my mind of a long time. I finally told my wife about it last night. And I don't even know what to think but I just feel so weird right now. I feel awful. I am upset and I am not sure why. The delayed response makes it truly feel like trauma.

I am mad that he could have been fucking with me. I mad that he played some sort of weird racial/sexual game with me.

Its made me worry that I am racist or that I am inadequate.  Its been a big hot jumble in my head and I don't know how to feel.

442,"Hey guys. 

First of all, sorry for the long post. Hopefully someone can find the motivation to read everything.

 I'm 18 and as the title says I started college two days ago. I decided to study Maths, as it has always been my favorite subject. It is true that I was never 100% sold on studying this, as I was always a little insecure, but I ended up doing it anyway. 

So the first day was just introduction but the second day (this morning) we had our first class. It was 3 hours long and although it was tiring that really wasn't my main complaint. I was lost for mostly two thirds of the whole duration of the class and I was just copying things that I had no real understanding of. To be fair it was the first time this has happened to me but I'm mostly scared about the fact that I don't want this to go on forever. Starting the first day already brought me so much stress and anxiety (I had an anxiety attack on my way there) because fresh starts are always incredibly hard for me due to the bad experiences I had for most of my school life. Thankfully everyone I met is really nice and I do feel welcome, I just doubt myself, my own capacities and wonder if I made the right choice.

My brain feels useless. When I try to focus it goes too fast for 2 seconds and then it stops altogether and I go completely blank. That has been happening for a long time now and along with my usual dissociation and loss of perception of myself it's really been nerve-wracking, stressful and extremely tiring. I feel like I cannot do anything and I find myself wishing I had chosen an easier path, somewhere I could relax a little bit and not have so many things bringing me stress that I cannot really fix any of them. I know it's only been 2 days and I've repeatedly said that to myself but it doesn't help at all.

All that coupled with some more personal stuff has made me want to disappear more than I've ever wanted in the last few years. I don't want to die because my life is terrible, I want to die because I don't think I can even remotely deal with everything that's coming and I feel completely powerless and stupid. My brain just goes on 'if you weren't here, you wouldn't have to deal with all of this' mode 24/7 and it makes me wish there was a way to either lose my conscience or go and live completely alone and isolated without having to make myself meet social standards and goals. 

I'd very much appreciate it if any of you had advice! I really need it right now as I feel there's no way out of this situation, in a way, not even suicide is a way out because I doubt I would ever have the actual guts to do it. Thanks everyone so much in advance and (again) I'm really sorry for the long post.",06Sep2018,4

444,"A few days ago my next door neighbors pitbull got out of their backyard by punching a whole through a (new) fence and started terrorizing dog walkers that would walk in front of her house; she would then promptly return to sulk on the front porch. 

Aware that no one should approach the dog, my fiancé and I go outside to redirect pedestrians away from the front of their house and try to get a hold of them. It starts raining so we decide to go inside while we wait for more contact info from the land lord since the info we had was outdated, afterall no ones going to be walking in the rain and the dog is very content with her spot on the porch. 

My roommate comes home and tells me that in a passing conversation the neighbors told him they would be gone until Saturday(currently Monday). 
 We decided that if we couldn't get a hold of the neighbor by the time make dinner and we'd call animal services. 

My roommates girl friend comes home and starts pounding at the door because it's storming and.... there's a pitbull sitting next to her on our porch. 
Before she can finish saying 

""This dog looks lost""

Our I finish saying

""Don't let that dog inside"" 

The pitbull runs inside. The same pitbull that has snarled at me every time I go in my own backyard and the same one that was terrorizing pedestrians not even two hours earlier. 

My fiancé scrambles to secure our two cars and one dog while I get between the pitbull and the rest of the house. 
Much to my surprise, the dog is so spoiled by the storm that she's docile and shivering. 
We kennel and feed her and her demeanor doesn't change. She cuddly, needy, and pretty damn sad. She follows my fiancé around like a puppy. 

We begin noticing something is off about her. Her tears are elongated and she looks to either be early pregnancy or have recently given birth. On top of that her teeth are all filed down. She's pretty obedient as long as there's not another dog or a new person. 

Then the next day comes and I take her back into the neighbors back yard so that she'll do her business. There's two buckets and a tub full of water, and a bag of open dog food. 

I'm almost certain that they left these things out for the dog but  intended to leave the dog completely unattended. 
The phone contact info from the landlord is completely disconnected. We resort to messaging and friending every one our neighbors family members that live in town and leave a note on the front door on the off chance that someone is dog sitting. 

Wednesday night comes and we get a call from the next door neighbors sister. I ask her if there's anyone watching the dog. She says she will ask and call me back. 
She texts me later and says she can get the dog the next morning. 

She comes by and gets the dog. I warn her that the dog is aggressive with other animals and that she can't be in the backyard on her own because she will get out again. She says she's got two dogs and will have see what she can do to accommodate them. 


Lo and behold the poor pit is chained to a trampoline in their backyard with a tub of water and some Tupperware for food. It's about to storm again. 

I don't know if I should call services. I feel bad for the dog, but I know that calling services could possibly be a death sentence for the dog and bring some bad blood with my neighbor. 

Tldr; been caring for  my neighbors neglected and unattended pitbull for the past three days because she ran into my house after terrorizing pedestrians , returned her to the neighbors sister this morning,  now she's back in their back yard chained to a trampoline. Neighbors won't be back until Saturday, left last Friday: to call services or to not call services? ",06Sep2018,1
445,"Background: I was married just a week before I moved overseas.  That's just how the timing worked out.  I only consistently keep in contact with the woman who was my maid of honour.  I've lived overseas for about a year now.  Her ex is a piece of crap.  He was a drug dealer, he was mean to her, and he was not a nice person. For about \~6 months before I moved (my entire engagement), I was telling her everyday to get away from him, she deserved better, etc.  She refused. I was stuck in a weird place because we had a short engagement and you can't just tell your MOH.  

They broke up three weeks after I moved.  For literally the past 11 months, all we've done is talk about her ex.  Trust me when I say all we've talked about is her ex despite all my efforts to not.  She would complain and ask if she did everything wrong.  I would always reassure she was fine, she was in the right. I tried to change the subject, I asked her if we could talk about happier things, she'd agree and eventually circle back to him.  It got to the point to where she would not talk to me for weeks because she would go on these binges where she would  hang out with him or, if he didn't want to - stalk him and show up wherever he was, unannounced and then would call me asking me for advice. I hate to use the word 'literally' but she literally never asked me anything about my life or my move to another country.  When I wasn't working, she would text me constantly until I answered.  I saw her once in April for dinner.  She was 45 minutes late and we again talked about her ex again. Her ""How was \[trip?\]"" Me: ""Oh, it was good - we -"" Her - ""yeah, that's totally cool, so I don't want to talk about \[ex\] but..."" and so the cycle repeats itself.  It got to the point where I literally started ignoring her if she mentioned her ex.  Again, please just trust me I tried so hard.

We haven't had a real conversation since I moved.  Every time we've talked, it's been about her life, her ex, her job, her friends.  If I ever mentioned my husband and I had a spat, she'd say, ""it's just hard."" That's it.  When I was looking for a job, she'd say, ""oh, you're fine."" LITERALLY and change the subject.  It started to cause stress between me and the hubs because I would get so frustrated at her using me as someone to vent to instead of an actual friend.  I would take out all the stress and frustration on him because, well, he was here. 

Her ex recently got engaged and she called me throwing a temper tantrum because he's only known the other girl a year (I knew my husband for just barely six months when we got engaged). I texted her back that I didn't agree with his career path but I wasn't going to talk shit on anyone's love life considering my own to which she said, 'it's different' and didn't text me for a while. A week or so later, after just not responding to me, she booked a trip to come see me (and other neighbouring countries). Every time I ask her what she wants to do, she just says 'nothing, I'm entertained just walking around.'

I am not excited for her to visit.  She comes here in two weeks and today was the first time she's asked me how my new job is since I started six months ago.  I sent her this grateful text about how glad I was she asked and how much I liked it (what I was actually doing) and she responded, ""that's cool. I don't mean to talk about myself and make it about me but I'm going to be sick. look..."" and she sent a screenshot. Her ex joined instagram. That's it.  I have no response and I feel like I'm so over our friendship.  They've been broken up for a year, he's engaged, she can block him on instagram, and I just feel used.  I feel like I've just been a listening post for the past year.

I'm not sure if I'm being selfish or a bad friend.  All I've wanted since I moved is for us to remain friends.  I don't have a lot of friends in my home country. I mean, I do, but no one I keep in touch with as consistently. But I'm just not excited for her to visit.  She's staying with me but each time I ask her what she wants to do, she just says 'nothing!'.  I feel like we're just going to talk about her ex the entire time and she's coming her because she feels obliged.  Does anyone have any advice regarding long-distance friendships that have changed or handing the aftermath?  I don't want to be a bitch but her unloading on me whenever I have my phone has really worn me down and made me negative and unhappy.

446,"Ill start this out by saying that I am sick of my line of work. I work in accounts payable and its horrible. I left my first accounting job at the beginning of this year and started another accounting job at a different company. I originally thought that the company I worked for was the problem (which is why I switched companies). But now it seems that all accounts payable jobs are all one in the same. I completed some schooling towards an accounting degree, but I dropped out. Other than that my job history is mostly in retail.  

I dont want to be in accouts payable forever. I want out of the industry, but Ive gotten used to the pay (about 45k usd per year) and I dont know where else I can go without drastically reducing my income/benefits.  I currently work a side gig as a hostess at a local restaurant and I love doing it. Its way less stress, but I dont get enough hours there to where I could only work that job. I also would not have benefits if I only worked there. 

Its hard for me to get interviews for anything other than accounts payable positions. Is there a line of work that is different, but I could still get into given my work history with decent pay and benefits? Im miserable and dont know where to go in life.

449,"This past November, my best friend and college roommate came over to my house to hang out. I currently live with my mother. My father passed away about a year and a half ago. That night, my mother had her friends over to thank them for being there for her through my father's passing from cancer, so I also invited my friend over. My friend was invited to have Thanksgiving with us as well, but turned it down due to having Thanksgiving with her boyfriend instead, which I thought was great and fine.

When my friend was leaving, my mother asked if my friend was going to marry her boyfriend, and she said maybe. My mom then went on a bit of a rant about how maybe isn't good enough when you're thinking about marrying someone, and things like that. It was basically my mother projecting her own thoughts about love onto my friend. I went over and escorted my friend out. I texted her as well as she was leaving, saying that I hoped my mother didn't offend her and that my mom loves my friend like a daughter. My friend seemed fine. In addition, unprompted by me, my mom sent her a   long apology text the next morning, and again, my friend seemed to accept it.

A couple of days after that was my friend's boyfriend's birthday party, which I missed because it was the first Thanksgiving without my dad and honestly, I was feeling too depressed to go. I apologized for not being able to go, and my friend seemed to understand. After that, however, my friend started acting strangely and stopped replying to my texts. I kept trying to get together with her and she kept cancelling at the last minute. 

After about 2 weeks of thinking my friend was mad at me for missing her boyfriend's birthday and feeling horrible about it, I called her and she admitted that she was feeling badly about what my mom had said to her. She said that she felt very stung and judged by what my mom said to her. I immediately broke down in tears. I felt horrible that my friend had been feeling so badly about this, because it was more or less just about my mom projecting her own relationship stuff about my dad onto my friend. Which isn't great or right, but I felt it was understandable considering that my parents were very much in love and my dad is deceased. 

My friend said that I should have interrupted my mom or stopped her. In the moment, I considered that, but honestly, I didn't want to make a bigger deal of the situation than it was. I immediately apologized and said I felt so bad about everything and I was so so sorry. She said that she just wanted to not talk about it again. But she immediately stopped inviting me to things and initiating any conversation after this incident.

We have seen each other sporadically since then, but it has never been the same. We used to be the closest of friends, like sisters, and now that is all ruined. It's so awkward and horrible now. I feel terrible because I never judged her relationship in any way and I never wanted to make her feel that way, but also, it feels like she has cut me out of her life after this one interaction. I've thought about writing a letter to her about this, and my mom has wanted to apologize again, but I don't want to make things worse. 

Am I a complete asshole for the way I handled this? What should I do? I have been depressed about this all summer and have been barely able to do anything. I saw her and her boyfriend recently and they treated me very standoffishly at first, but I decided just to be myself and be very nice and friendly, and they were much warmer to me by the end.

When I don't necessarily believe that, I do believe something has come between us, and looking back on it she seems very selfish and self centred and I've tried to give my all to her and still do try but I feel she has definitely taken the foot of the gas in regards to me, she has depression and has been a victim of sexual abuse from her ex so I've tried to be extra careful and extra supportive taking everything at her pace, but over to e I feel that my mental state has slipped, I was once happy and confident and now I just feel like I have no energy and quite depressed, and alot of it gets attributed to her.

457," Hey I suppose I had a bit of remission from depression for a year, or two. Yet it seems I’m back in this stoop probably a culmination of things from a lot of school stress, and wanting an outlet. Turns out I guess I can only depend on myself. I usually have extremely low expectations to protect my self from utter disappointment but now when I need people to lean on I realize that it shouldn't be like this.

When I think of the closest people to my I can’t lean on them, or depend on them for example my mother she doesn’t listen to anything I say, and believes everything she says to be fact even if she’s proved wrong. Then my dad he borrows my money, and keeps extending the time, yet most of the time cancels on hanging out with me. My girlfriend she was the beacon of my life for a few months but recently stopped really showing affection leaving me with my heart open.

I’m dealing with a lot right now, and everyone disappointing me makes it worse. I’m just so mad, and feel frustrated with the lack of cares given about me, stuck in a repetitive cycle. I’m glad I can post hear so at least someone will listen, maybe chime in if you like I could also do with advice to thank you.",06Sep2018,0
458,"Hello everyone,

So basically I applied to this sales development rep position at this company that is relatively far from home and they were sooo nice to me. I clicked with them in the first interview and they asked me to come for a second interview.

Now i dont check my emails all too often so I missed the email stating they wanted a second interview and they were kind enough to reschedule me a second interview. I killed the interview once more and now they are asking for my references.

Thing is im only getting a 40k base with an OTE of 46k-54k at this company. They have been so unbelievably kind to me but my issue is the place is so far from my house and is in downtown (alot of traffic so i cant get there by driving i have to transit for an hour and a half). 

Now I also got an offer from this company thats literally a 15 minute drive from my house. It is an engineering company ( i have education in engineering) with a salary of 55k. This place is convenient for me and the people i interviewed with liked me alot and were also kind to me but they emphasized that this was a stressful environment as the stuff were producing is high end. 

So one is a sales job where ur calling maybe cold calling 60-70 times a day making 40k base. The other is an engineering job 55k. I wouldnt mind doing either btw. 

I also feel so sad if i have to reject the sales offer because the team really did click with me and they made me feel at home and everyone was so nice. The engineering job pays more, nice people too but it seems like a strict environment (its supposed to be,were designing high grade stuff)

I dont know what to do guys, please help.",06Sep2018,1

462,"Hey everyone, I’m wondering if I should drop out of university.  My whole life I’ve always envisioned myself going to college because that’s the path my parents pushed me to go on.  I saw college as a means to make as much money as possible, a great experience because of the party/social life, and a way to find myself.  Right now, as a 19 year old I dislike  college for a few reasons.  One, the glamorous social life that I saw on TV is not really true for me. I don’t have many friends here and this is making me feel like I have no obligations to stay.  Another reason why I dislike college is because of the amount it consumes my time.  I feel like I’m constantly having to study and this sucks because I can’t purse any passion projects.  I mean I enjoy the classes and feel like I’m getting enriched every time I enter the classroom but doing homework and studying just sucks.  My values have kinda changed too.  I used to feel that I should go to college and become a doctor or something and rake in like 300k a year. The problem with this plan is that being a doctor takes a lot of time and thinking that far into the future is bad for my health.  Also, I’m starting to feel like I would rather have financial independence from my parents rather than make a ton of money, and this will not happen if I become a doctor, rather the opposite will. Im staring to look into trade school options like dental hygienist or medical coder and notice that those pay decent wages. I don’t know how much it costs to really live a decent life because my parents completely financially support me so I might be setting myself up for a struggling future.  Other than regret of not doing something profound in my life, I don’t know why I should stay. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",06Sep2018,1

Hi throwaway for reasons but i just bought a 2000 ford f150 for 2000$ in the past few days,

and i payed cash with no bill of sale (stupid i know...) and the title was clean and ready but i put the wrong date,

i put the correct day and month but wrong year i put my birth year and i was told to fill out a statement of facts which needs the seller signature but i can no longer get into contact with the seller,

now what is the best option i had talked to the courthouse and they told me they could transfer it but i would have to pay a 250$ penalty because of the date which is crazy because the truck was not even made that year and i hope i heard them right if i could do this it might be the best option, or go to the dmv and get a bonded title which i do not know how they work,

or could i just correct the date which is super easy but i don't know if they put anything into the computer that could say i needed a statement of facts,

please help me out of this dilemma its making me sick.",06Sep2018,1
464,"Has anyone out there left a career they  always wanted to be in so that they could have more time with their family?

I am currently an assistant editor for a television company in Toronto, Ontario.

My current commute amounts to 2 hours each way, since my job doesn't really pay enough for me to live in the city. I've been passionate about editing for a long time, and still am, but I also have a wife and 19 month-old boy that I want to spend more time with.

It doesn't look like I'll be advancing at my current workplace for a very long time, if ever, as they don't usually promote people internally. It's all left me feeling pretty hopeless and looking at other options. There aren't any jobs in my field where I live, so I'd be looking at a different career. Sometimes I wonder if I should just take any job I can get that's near my hometown and just forget about career fulfillment, since it hasn't gotten me anywhere so far.

I don't know anyone in a similar situation who can offer advice, which brings me here. Has anyone struggled with a similar situation, and if so, what did you end up doing and how did it go for you?

TL;DR: I'm on my dream career path but am considering giving up on it to save from a four hour commute and spend time with family, what should I do?

465,"I feel silly even just typing this, but basically I (25F) moved in with my roommate (29M) a week ago. I found him on craigslist and we're on a yearly lease. He's awesome, we have so much in common, and we've been hanging out basically every day. I'm attracted to him, no doubt about that and it may be my dumb head interpreting his friendliness the wrong way, but I think he is kind of into me too. (Yes, roommates hooking up is a bad idea, I know)

I also have a Tinder that I haven't checked in a while. Today when I was randomly swiping I saw his profile, and he apparently superliked me. Idk if that was before or after we moved in, and I guess I want to ask if anyone else superlikes the people they know in real life just for giggles? We talked about Tinder before, and how we both hate it. He never said anything about finding me there before. I didn't want to swipe either way, so I just closed the app without doing anything about it because if we match it's weird but I also want to acknowledge his superlike.

472,"First of all, here is some background information. I am a senior in high school. The past seven years of my life I have struggled with anxiety and depression. There has been a lot of pain and misery, and I never felt like it was going to get better. After some time and a suicide attempt, I finally got professional help. Therapy, medication, all of that fun stuff. Around a year ago I stopped going to a therapist and stopped taking my meds. I felt that I was happy enough without them, and possibly that I might be happier without them. So far this has worked out fine. I actually look forward to my future. The anxiety attacks are fewer and further between. The miserable days don't stretch into months. 

The pressure to do well in school has definitely added to my problems. However, despite my past struggles, I managed to make it past the last three years of high school with a 4.0 GPA. It hasn't been easy. Taking in information and concepts is difficult. I will have to re-read something ten times before I actually ""read"" it. Organizing my thoughts into coherent work and sentences is difficult for me. I am constantly distracted and out of focus wherever I am, most of the time without realizing my attention was even diverted. It's like a little trance that I have to snap out of. As a result, what takes most people an hour to do will take me two or three. The workload is only getting bigger and the work more complex. Every year I am scraping by with less and less room. 

I want to go to college. However, I don't think that I will make it through with my current issues. I write very slowly, always trying to form the perfect sentence. Nothing ever feels right. The only thing that (most of the time) makes me turn in work is a deadline. I cannot study or take notes for shit. My notes are never perfect enough to keep. My handwriting, legible and far from chicken scratch, bothers me too much. I try to force myself to do it, but I just end up with 40 crumpled ""redone"" papers on the floor, all of them with the same first-sentence of my notes on them. It affects my hobbies as well. I love making art and improving my skills, but I rarely finish anything because it is never good enough.

Any task that requires focus is exhausting. For example... I've spent two hours typing up this post... even though I've been sitting here trying my hardest to write it up.

I feel very alone. I feel very stupid and inadequate to my classmates, and its starting to really depress me. Overall, everything just feels hopeless. I don't know how to resolve this, or if I even can. Any help would be appreciated.",06Sep2018,1

474," 

I'm in the calm before the storm as I type this. Next week I have several tests one after another and in terms of absorbing the content I feel like I've only retained 1%. How in the hell are we expected to learn like 30 chapters in 3 weeks. I have studied ever since school started EVERY DAY except for just THREE days. And it was because I was SO tired, I never realized the physical toll studying all day does to the body. I sleep for hours and I STILL feel exhausted when I wake up. It doesn't help that I have to go to school at the ass crack of dawn. Some days I just feel so exhausted I study half assed because I just can't focus. Just 3 days delayed that I did nothing and I feel like I'm behind. I feel like I don't know shit, I think all the information has just started to get cluttered and messy in my head because it's too much. It's Thursday and my first test is on Tuesday, the days slip between my fingers like sand. The hours pass by so quickly when I study and there's just not enough time in the day. I must just be stupid because I'm not retaining the information like I should be. pre-reqs were a cinch but idk why this just isn't sticking to me. I was warned this program has broken people to tears but I thought with my time management it wouldn't happen. I think it's gotten to me and I think it's literally going to break me. I can't afford a low grade on a single test because the classes are purely graded off of test, the extra grades are added AFTER you already reach the passing minimum(which is 77%). I should be studying right now but after napping for a few hours after class and trying to get back into the zone, I just can't. I can't because I'm so tired from studying yesterday and waking up so early and my class today that lasted several hours. But I still have to study at least a little. But then I KNOW I won't retain any of it. But I can't afford to not finish studying this section today because I have to move on quickly to the next thing tomorrow in order to be prepared.

The problem is I feel left out when others binge drink to get drunk around me and become loud and obnoxious. I see those people (who are my very good friends) as selfish and their behaviour as unhealthy. It puts me in a position of spite and I usually refuse drinks and become designated driver because of it.

I assume my stress and judgement for these people is out of jealousy. But I have been drunk before and still feel the same way. My experiences haven't been great, but they haven't been negative either.

My conscious thought-process follows a simple path. I see alcohol as a drug like any other drug. Drugs are the opposite to self-improvement and are self-destructive. If I see my friends taking shots, I will join in just to keep up. But I won't take any more than 1 or 2 just to ensure I am being responsible and taking care of myself. I will then mediate the rest of the night with some standard drinks so that I don't go overboard. When I see my friends excited to take shot 3, 4 and 5, I get angry and upset.

We didn't get to talk a whole lot, because of the icebreaker games, but she gave me her number to keep in touch. I held on to it, because I knew we were gonna see each other soon. First day of school comes around, and we have quite a few classes together. We talked quite a lot. She's very easy to talk to. When I talked to her I noticed that we had this deep eye contact, which can only be explained as sensual. We hung out during lunch, and talked on the phone after school for a while. That night she told me that I probably don't wanna date her because of her previously bad relationships, so there was just a bit of tension today. Nothing too bad at all though. After school ended, I met up with her and we walked outside. She told me that she liked me, and that it was kind of too much to hold on to. I told her that I felt the same way, but since we didn't know each other super well yet the feelings were probably of lust. So I said that we should get to know each other a bit better before we delve into a relationship, because if we started dating two days after meeting each other it'd probably not last very long.
