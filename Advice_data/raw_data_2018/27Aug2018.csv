0,"   Met this guy (25m) a while back, handsome, tall, quiet, shy, very laid back and especially tall and handsome.
We get on pretty well, fast-forward to some college dorm party in where the music is loud and the booze is flowing, me and dudebro are dating for 3-4 months when he tells me he will never love me while heavily inebriated.
Can’t. Fucking. Forget. 
   Current day: We don’t do the same drugs, he shields his phone, doesn’t use it around me, places it faced down. Tells me it’s fine and he’ll change, doesn’t of course. It’s been more than 6 months at this point.
   I can’t fucking break up with him, and honestly just thinking of getting a new snap and number to make it easier for everyone and just ghosting, what do...",27Aug2018,0
1,"My landlord just came to collect my rent. He drove here in a $300,000 Ferrari. I was disgusted knowing my hard earned rent money is going to his car payments. 

I don’t think he realizes how insulting that is to people like me and others who live in the building that are struggling to pay the bills.  Or maybe he does know this and gets off on it.

Also I noticed he raised the rents when he purchased a new beach home (which he bragged about for months). I guess he conveniently decided he needed a raise to pay the bills for that house. Hmmm.

Is he saying and doing these things on purpose or is he just oblivious? ",27Aug2018,1

The neighboring towns are all the same size, and I still have no luck.

4,"The past few days have been eye opening for me. I’ve realised I’m a monster. I’ve not talked about anything like this to anyone. I’m going to be brutally honest, I have no idea how this is going to go. 

It all started with my first two relationships I had a couple trust issues but nothing major, no red flags nothing that would scare someone off, but regardless I was cheated on in both relationships. It devastated me. I lost a of weight. Started wearing makeup. Wearing revealing clothes. Received compliments almost everywhere I went. Boys constantly asked for my number. I became self centred and big headed. I started to manipulate everyone. I get what I want from everyone and treat people however I feel like based on their looks and/or personality (except for my close friends). 

I became very self destructive and ruined a lot of friendships and claimed it was their wrong doing and turned everyone against them with how manipulative I had become. In my head I thought I was doing nothing wrong but at the same time I really truly thought I was a narcissist and/or sociopath and I was proud of it... up until a few days ago. I was proud of how I have everyone in my life wrapped around my finger and I could get whatever I wanted. I never cared about anyone and even bullied select few people how I felt ‘deserved’ it. Now I want to leave all of that behind.

This brings me to where I am now. I am in a relationship and I care and love for him so much. I’ve never used him or neglected him but I am also extremely insecure. I had a tracker on his phone which he knew about. I wouldn’t let him go out without me until a few months ago in fear that he would cheat. I’d constantly ask him for location updates as pictures when not together. Had to text from the second he woke up to the second he went to sleep so I know he wasn’t cheating. Ultimately this drove him to go behind my back and live his life regardless and looking back on it. I was livid at him for lying to me and broke up with him so many times. I forgive him for it now and I understand why he did it. But I’ve realised now I got into his head when all of this was going on for just under a year and i f*cked with his head so much I’ve tore him down to the ground and I will never forgive myself. He’s self harmed a few times and it’s all because of how I treated him. I need to change completely. I’m not happy with myself anymore. I feel depressed when two days ago I felt happy, confident and on top of the world.

I came to this sudden realisation and I felt like my entire world just stopped. I don’t know what came over me. I think the first step is admitting it, so here I am. I just don’t know if I need a therapist, a counsellor or to just work on myself? I’ve been trying to stop my manipulative and other terrible urges the past couple days and it feels like a fight with myself in my head but I’ve been doing okay. It really feels like a mental problem but I’m not sure as I’ve obviously not been diagnosed. Any replies appreciated.",27Aug2018,3
5,"I am a 17F with an asshole sister who's turning 16 in a month.
She steals my stuff when I'm not looking or home and claims it as hers.  II Ex. I was looking for my boots, saw them in her room and she told me that they were hers, when I got my dad (only parent) to talk to her, she gave them back II I've gone over this so many times with her that she can ask to borrow my things and I will let her borrow them. My dad has said this too. She says ""sure"" and ignores it and goes on taking my things. My biggest issue is that she smokes and is rowdy and will end up damaging them or they will smell like weed. I now have a lock on my door which she opens with a butter knife to get at my stuff. 
Anyways I'm at my last straw, whenever I try to talk to her she walks away from me and calls me a bitch.
I have a couple of ideas:
- put Nair in my shampoo, tell her not to use it but she will anyways and then lose her rats nest of a hair anyways 
- put shit in my shoe so when she wears it her foot is covered in it 
What do I do reddit ",27Aug2018,1
6,"I made a new Reddit, just because this is heavy and my overuse of aww isn’t helping me not want to cry. 

I’m in a really weird point in my life. I’m in a hotel with my husband and two boys after losing almost everything in an incident we couldn’t control. I’m almost done with a degree. My husband works an average of 60 hours a week. Both of my children are on the spectrum and nonverbal. 

I feel like I’m losing my sanity, and identity. I’m not depressed by any means, but when I was out yesterday after my card got declined I felt like the world just fell out from under me. 

We have one more night in our hotel, our savings has been torn to shreds. All we have is each other and our car.   Every negative thought I’ve ever had in my life seems to be coming to the surface. I feel like the physical representation of the image that often floats around of someone drowning in water that the outsider can look in and see they could stand up, but I’m the one drowning and the weight on my shoulders isn’t letting me stand up. 

I’m mostly looking for advice on how to tighten up, get it together, and overcome this rough patch that I’m certain isn’t exclusive to me. 

Our household income is too high for assistance, we don’t have family to speak of. I’m asking strangers on the internet just for advice on how to get out of my own way. 

I’m definitely not depressed, just overwhelmed, and I feel like someone who has seen or heard or even experienced feeling like this has even the smallest bit of advice. 

Constructive criticism, criticism even, or just advice could make even a small difference. ",27Aug2018,6

8,"So to preface this I suppose I should start by saying that I believed myself to have Narcissistic Personality Disorder up until around 16, as it was the closest thing I could self-diagnose myself as A). Without going to professional and B). It's symptoms were most closely related to how my character, for lack of a better word, was. So I'll be going through this based on that theory. 

Although, at the same time I can't believe I had true NPD because it's almost like I was forced to learn how to care about people, and to be humble. It's like every action natural to me, that of a general superiority complex (if you could call every action I did better than another fueling my belief of superiority a complex) and a general lack of care for people around me, was subverted by the people around me and how annoyingly caring they were. Starting from where I remember the most vividly, it was natural to me to not care about my girlfriend and her feelings, or my mother whom I actually consider myself to care for now, or the rest of my family who are actually quite lovely people. Although it seemed like if i expressed these feelings, I was made to feel guilty, and that only made me angry because i  was literally admonished for expressing myself in the most natural way possible to me- with apathy. I did not get it whatsoever. I generally considered each relationship I had and how it would benefit me, now how I could benefit the other. That's especially truthful when It comes to my aforementioned girlfriend of the time. I didn't learn that I was most likely lacking the ability to empathize with her when I was essentially verbally abusing(One of my most regretted moments, now that I'm able to look back and see how I had treated her) her until I eventually learned of what a relationship with someone incapable of empathy is like, which is to say, was almost parallel to how our relationship was. 

As aforementioned, I mentioned that despite these characteristics, I can't believe myself to actually have NPD because I actually did feel guilt, if not for a small amount of time, for how I felt about others. I've gotten more knowledge and understand of empathy since the age of 16 (which i feel like was some sort of turning point, which is why It's mentioned in the first sentence.) Although I still have a hard time understanding other peoples emotions, or even caring that their emotions changed, its at the very least better than it was. I feel as if I did have NPD I wouldn't be able learn ""how to care about people"" for lack of a better term.

So reddit psychiatrists, can I ask if my theory was accurate, or if I'm totally off the mark. Appreciate it. 

I wonder if I'll regret typing this :p",27Aug2018,2

Like, I wake up from a nice dream and think 'shit - I'd like to have a stroke and die peacefully rn'. This happens whenever I don't see people in like a few days, I just become reduced to a wreck. It's not like I can't cope with life, but I'm just waiting for either the next social encouter or a nice heart attack to take me out of this boredom. Boredom is an understatement. Sometimes I go to the park at night and sing loudly and lie on the floor. I'm not an introvert. I'm not about this life. I have lots of close, beloved friends, but if I want to do anything with them, it depends on their introverted ways and whether they can be bothered to drag themselves out. 

After I'm alone for a few days, I start to talk to myself only, as if I were with another person, and I say things I think would get me sectioned if I said them to another person. I just cant be alone. When I am with folk, I am happy and normal, I socialise, it seems like I get along well with everyone. I don't get t. People describe me as likeable, nice, kind, normal, even sensible. But if I don't see people for a little while, I unwind totally. Don't get it. Was tun.

16,"Posting from a throwaway because I am quite sure he also followed me. This is about a 32-year-old man who was asking for dating advice. I gave him some suggestions after which he messaged me to ask for more advice. I gave him a bit more advice and assured him if he got more socially involved, etc. he could find someone.

So. He sends me two more messages complaining about feeling alone and wanting a girlfriend. Then a third message about 40 minutes later saying: fuck all women, they only want money and to date Chads and are only good to have sex with and all have low IQs.

After that, I say very simply that he is single because he is hateful, and that he’s blocked.

Before I actually block him I see a message from him saying that because of me, he’s going to kill himself.

I wouldn’t take something like that from someone like that seriously and would typically assume they’re trying to guilt me into replying, but a check of his profile indicates that he posted a similar thing about being a virgin etc. on a Suicide Watch forum.

She was cooking and had burned something. She said ""Sorry I burnt the garlic,"" he responded with ""I've been at work all day and I've been waiting for dinner for 2 hours and now you're fucking it up.""  That's a fairly normal exchange.

I don't think she'd really hear me if I told her to her face (other friends of hers have said that they don't like the guy and she just calls them racist, he's a different nationality, here on a green card).

19,"Hey guys. Never posted here before but I like this sub a lot, and didn't really know where else this fit. Sorry about the long post, the full story is important. Anyway, I work at a department store in my area, and today a woman came in to the customer service area where i worked and gave me a book that somebody had left in a shopping cart in the parking lot. 

I took it with the intention of putting it in our lost and found, in hopes that the owner would retrieve it honestly. But i noticed a few papers sticking out the side of the book. There were three things here, each very strange. 

One was page 94 of a story the owner of the book had written. It was typed out and coherently written, but someone else had gone through it with pen and corrected numerous grammatical and structural errors in the writing. 

There was also a picture of a local McDonald's playground on a rainy day, dated 2013. 

The third was by far the strangest. It was 2 pages, typed, front and back. At first, it started out with an introduction with the writer's full first and last name. It was addressed with the header ""Hello Public"". It started with the writer talking about how he loved reading, and used it as inspiration to write some screenplays and stories that someday he hoped to have published or otherwise released. So far, so good. But after that first paragraph, oh man.

 It quickly descended into complete incoherent nonsense, basically walls of text that were sometimes pointless but revealed little bits of his life. This man is very disturbed, perhaps mentally ill. He included his full address, adding that he had left 12 copies of this same letter in various places across the town I live in, and wanted people to write to him so he could 'briefly meet them.' 

I would like to write to him, return his book, and learn more about him. He lives very close to me, however, and i don't want to give my address to someone who is clearly unstable to a degree. I can elaborate if anyone is interested in the very weird contents of the letter. Any ideas for contacting this guy securely would be appreciated. Sorry for the long post! ",27Aug2018,1

25,"Hey everyone! I hope this doesn't break the rules about medical issues, but I'm not 100% sure if it's something I need to take to a doctor. 

So the short version is that I got hit by someone running a red while I was turning left. There weren't any major injuries to anyone involved. Their car's front end was crumpled and their airbags went off, but I just had a dent in my side and a flat tire. I'm a newly licensed driver, though I've been driving on my permit for roughly 2 years. 

Regarding the accident itself, I'm mostly over it, but I do get anxiety when I think about it sometimes. However, I'm not as comfortable with driving as I used to be. I'm paranoid when taking left turns, especially at all sorts of intersections even if no one else is around. I also have a hard time when other drivers are being generally not fun. As an example of that last one, I was with my boyfriend going to a mutual friend's place. I was trying to change lanes but the cars behind me wouldn't let me through. Hell, the first one sped up when I tried to get in, which set off the initial panic attack. My boyfriend made me pullover into a neighborhood and calm down, before continuing to our friend's place and needing to take another breather there. The anxiety's been better than it used to be, but I really don't want to have another panic attack like that again. What if I can't pull over, y'know?

I'm sure the best solution to this is to just keep driving, but I'm currently in another town with no vehicle of my own and I'll have to rely on buses and walking to get around until about December. In the meantime, does anyone have any tips to help me recover until I get the chance to drive again? Thanks!",27Aug2018,3

It's the same with having friends over. I can only have them over for a few hours before I just lose all interest and get irritated. 

I know that I could just fake it and stay around them but it just gets to the point where I'll stop engaging in conversation and stare at the floor angrily.  

They dont do anything to irritate me, but just being around people for an extended amount of time makes me irritated.

32,"A little backstory I’m a senior in high school and so is my girlfriend. We’ve been dating since our freshman year and I’ve gotten pretty close to her family, as well as her obviously. 

Early in our relationship she used to sneak out all of the time to come spend the night with me. However I never really felt comfortable doing that because we ran the risk of getting caught so we stopped. On top of that her parents really did give us a lot of freedom anytime we ever wanted to go out on a date together. 

Yesterday evening I came home from a week long vacation and we really wanted to see each other. So the other night she snuck out for the first time in a very long time. But the next morning when I dropped her off, her neighbors saw us and ended up telling her parents. Apparently they’ve also seen us doing it in the past and ended up telling her parents about all of those times too. 

So now my girlfriend and I can’t contact each other for a month, other than being together at school. But that’s not even the worst part, I feel like I’ve completely destroyed the relationship I had with her parents. Her dad went as far as to say he would beat my ass if he sees me again. I want to go and apologize but I doubt I’m even allowed over there and I seriously doubt they even want to see me. I’ve thought about calling but I’m afraid it’s too soon to do that as well. 

TLDR; Got caught sneaking my girlfriend out and now her parents literally hate me ",27Aug2018,3

34,"I'm 35 and female, as an adult I've not had female friends.   


Currently I don't have any friends full-stop - I've lost touch with people for various reasons, I don't get much opportunity to meet people, as an adult it's hard to make friends, and I'm Autistic so it's harder to make/maintain friendships.  


In the past I've always had male friends, but I've also always had a boyfriend. I've found recently it's harder to make friends as many guys will only show interest if they want to get in my pants, it's so disheartening to think you're making friends just for them to turn around and ask for a date/sex or to find they stop talking to you if you're not interested.   


I had female and male friends as a kid, but as an adult the only female friends I had were part of a wider social group as they were dating one of my male friends. I just really struggle with other women, it's NOT a girl-hate thing...I think it's because when you reach teens our socialization gets so much more complex so it's harder to get a grip of the unwritten rules, also I suspect some less-than-great experienced with other women may make me feel intimated by women.  


I try to talk to women but they look at me like I'm an alien, it's like they can tell I'm not one of them.   


I think it would be nice to have female friends, to have friends who I know aren't just trying to get into my panties but also friends who can understand some of the things we go through as woman, it'd be nice to have female friends who can be supportive during a break-up and who I could do 'girly' things with like do makeup or swap clothes. I see all these female friendships where there's this deep connection and support, and feel I'm missing out on this.  


Has anyone gone from struggling to be friends with women to figuring out how to be friends with women? ",27Aug2018,190
35,"I am an 18 year old girl, but I’ll be 19 in a couple months. I’ve been thinking about the idea of getting pregnant for the past year. Especially lately, I’ve been considering stopping taking birth control &amp; just seeing what happens. 

My reasoning? Growing up I never had a bond with either of my parents &amp; I haven’t seen either of them since I was 10. I don’t have any close family &amp; I have always felt empty. I feel like if I have a baby, that he/she would always be apart of me. That would be family forever regardless. I know this is wrong, but maybe it would fill a void in me. 

&amp; I know that having a child is really fucking hard, not to mention very expensive. But I feel maybe all of the stress &amp; sleepless nights would be worth it? I’m currently in my 2nd year of community college, &amp; I know having a baby would make going to school a lot more difficult.

I have an ex who is 19, &amp; even though we broke up in April, about a month ago we started having sex periodically again. I don’t want to be with him anymore bc he hurt me so much, so don’t think that I’m contemplating getting pregnant to try &amp; “trap him”. I would tell him about the pregnancy &amp; I would let him come around for dr appointments &amp; stuff but as far as him &amp; I being a couple I’m not interested. I know that he would be there for his kid, bc he has always been a very family oriented person, &amp; is very good with his niece &amp; little cousins. So it wouldn’t be like I would be getting pregnant knowing that my innocent future child would have to struggle with going through life without a dad. 

&amp; I know it’s wrong to try &amp; get pregnant without talking to him about it, but I feel like when you have unprotected sex with someone, that’s a risk you take regardless. Now more than ever, I’ve been thinking about stopping birth control &amp; just trying it. How stupid is this?",27Aug2018,0

39,"So I recently realized that I've had Aerospia (Visual Snow) my whole life. I used to think everyone could see what I was seeing, but my eye doctor never knew what I was talking about. I've read that many people who have it also have some bad side-symptoms too such as migraines, and poor night vision. I haven't had these. All I've had is the ability to see lines rushing in my full field of vision. I also see outlines around people and objects.

The question I have surrounds my ability to see at night. A few years ago I started working in a national forest and often times I would find myself walking in the darkness of night. I realized eventually that I could get around pretty well without having to use a flashlight, even when there was no moonlight.

My question is: Has anyone else out there with Aerospia experienced improved night vision as opposed to worse?",27Aug2018,1
41,"I just got back from dinner with my parents, which is always a gamble. It can go fine or it can be a disaster. Sort of the latter category tonight. I don't usually seek advice online but this keeps happening and I need some sort of answer.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and I don't always get along. She's a nice person and has always been supportive of whatever I want to do. I couldn't be more lucky in that regard. But she's a terrible conversationalist. I'm 26 years old and she never asks me meaningful questions about myself. She has never asked ""are you seeing anyone right now?"" or even ""what music are you listening to"". Instead she talks about things in her own life. One of her go - tos for conversation is listing people she knows who she believes are doing interesting things but are completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand or anyone's interests. Tonight when she did this she listed off about 4 names I can't remember and then showed us a photo of an ex-coworker running a marathon. My sister and I poked fun at it, saying ""mom's name dropping again"". All in good humour. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later in the night I show my sister a photo of a tattoo, as it pertains to both of our interests and we were talking about it earlier. Mom says ""why is it okay for you two to show each other photos but not me?"" Caught off guard but realizing she was talking about the comment earlier, I opened up and calmly explained that it's just a little hard for us to relate to random people we don't know being brought up out of no where especially when nothing they do is related to anyone's interests. She took huge offence and went to the washroom to cry. When she came back she wouldn't make conversation with my sister or I. We paid our bill and left, I explained to my mother that we both loved her but she kept giving us the silent treatment. We all went our separate ways.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, am I a dick or is this what guilt tripping is? This is far from the first time this has happened. What can I do in the future when stuff like this goes down?

42,"I signed up to be a ""standardized patient"" which is when you're assigned an ailment or disorder and you must memorize a particular backstory and display symptoms in front of medical students who take an exam. Similar to Kramer and Mickey in that one Seinfeld episode. 


I was accepted to do this, however, I only found out during the very first training session tonight that the exams are fully video taped. You typically do 15-20 exams in a day. 


This may not seem like a big deal to some people, but I have a strong dislike for being photographed &amp; filmed. I also have major social anxiety too, although I can manage depending on certain things, including what I was expecting this to be like: just in a private room with the student + an assessor. That's it. The fact it's fully filmed throws a wrench in on my desire to do this. On top of that, I'll have to be shirtless for the exam. I'm in shape... but I know it will only add to my overall uncomfortability &amp; anxiety.

43,"So where to start? 
My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years. I met him when I was 17. 4 and 1/2 years later, he finally proposed. It was an awesome proposal actually. So we’ve been engaged for 11 months now. So now we are coming up on the 6th year of being together. My fiancé is 26, 27 in March. I’m 22, 23 in November. 
He is so immature I can’t even begin to wrap my head around it. He caused a huge scene at a restaurant this past weekend and embarrassed me so badly, all because he had straw paper come up out of his straw. Everyone was staring. He cussed out our waitress and I was left to pick up the pieces as he stormed out of the doors and left me. I apologized to the manager and the waitress and tried to pay her for the drinks. After we leave there, we decide to go eat at another restaurant and at the point my mood is totally down the drain. As we proceed to the restaurant he thinks this car cut him off and it definitely did not. We had another car length of room in front of us so he decides to swerve at them and act like he’s going to hit them while saying “who the fuck do you think you are cutting me off” EMBARRASSING. nonetheless is was 2 teenage girls, probably heading to the brand new Starbucks that had just opened in our area and it hurt my feelings so bad. We don’t live together because he won’t discuss a house with me or he makes up excuses about money but it’s hard to believe when he waving it in my face and says he just made 8,000 in 2 weeks and he’s got a lifted brand new Duramax a dirt bike and a rzr 1000. But noooo a house right now is just to expensive. Whatever. He won’t let me plan a wedding and if I try to talk about it he gets defensive and wants to know what the rush is for. After telling him many many times I was planning for 2 years out, nope still nothing. He does not want to even speak about it. He will not look at venues. Help decide on colors. Nothing! He’s almost 27!!! All of our friends have let their parents homes. I’m tempted to just go get myself an apartment because obviously getting a house anytime soon is not happening. The night he flipped on the waitress he gave me 200$ and no this does not ever happen. He’s only ever given me 50$ before out of our 6 years of being together. I just don’t ask because he makes it out like I’m a gold digger so anyways he stayed with me the night and the next morning he woke up wanting to have sex. I said no because I had cramps starting because my period is coming soon and he says to me “I gave you money and you won’t even have sex with me”  to which I replied I’m not a prostitute, I’m your fiancé. Also tried to politely tell him that I think he suffers from anger problems or bipolar disorder and he flipped his shit on me and got on my Facebook posting comments to my post saying “your bipolar” he is just so immature. In all honestly I’ve accepted the terms that he’s given me a shut up ring. I need advice, although I have a good idea as to what I need to do. Just want some opinions! Thank you!!! ",27Aug2018,1

After lunch my family left and I went straight to my room and ended up crying, which I rarely ever do.

47,"My family and I are currently in a pretty terrible living situation. It's my 5 daughters and us (myself and their step dad) and we have been given an opportunity to break out of the situation. But I'm having a hard time determining if it would be a better situation. 
Currently, we cohabitate an old house with another family who are friends of ours. They live downstairs in basement area, we are upstairs and have free reign of the upper two stories. However, with 5 girls and us, we have to share one bathroom. Said bathroom is teeming with mold. All of the walls are covered in it. No matter what we do, no matter how much bleach we use, it's still covered in mold. Also, the family downstairs own the house and we pretty much have to follow their rules. Not only that, but they expect my children to be their slaves. To do their chores for them, while they do nothing to contribute to the upkeep of the house, and charge an exorbitant amount of rent/utilities, none of which have ever been applied to renovations although they use that as the reason for charging so much. We can't even have people over without them taking control and telling us what we can and can't do. 
Now to the opportunity: it's in another city and would cost us more for monthly living expenses and as well as commute to our jobs.  And it's not a step up. It's very old and needs new windows, floors, paint, insulation, ceilings and doors. But it would be ours. Everyone else in the family is  on board with moving to this new place, and having to put in work. But i'm having reservations because I don't think it would be a good home for my family with all the work needed. I am not excited about the opportunity, but they all tell me we could make it work. This is honestly one of the hardest choices I've ever had to make, especially because I'm the one person out of the family who doesn't want to take it.

50,"Ok, here's the thing:

Growing up I had owned lots of pets (cats, bunnies, lizards, hamsters, chickens, etc.) but I have never owned a dog, due to most people in my family (including myself) being very allergic to them, and other than making a point to pet every dog I come across in public, I don't have much experience being around them. Recently I visited my in-laws with my boyfriend, and his parents had adopted a dog. While I genuinely like the dog, there were a few issues for me that popped up, and I'm hoping that Reddit will help me through them.

 First thing, I could barely see and breathe the whole time I was there, despite popping Benadryl like candy, and I barely slept due to how bad my allergy was. But the biggest issue for me, was the crippling anxiety I felt once I was given the list of all the things that could possibly kill the dog should she ingest them. It didn't help that the dog would constantly try to get into things, and followed me around religiously whenever I cooked, not to mention she tried to lick my plate every time I sat down for a meal. And being a clumsy person who loves chocolate (and who is now half blinded due to dog hair), I couldn't help but have panic attacks knowing that if I dropped something or was not completely vigilant over my food, I could KILL this animal. 

Being a cat owner (previously), I never had to worry about my pets eating things that could kill them, as cats are persnickety little things and will sometimes refuse the food they're \*supposed\* to eat. Also, if one of my cats was being cheeky and got into something, they're small enough to pick up and move easily. With a dog that weighed almost the same as me, this wasn't an option. While I was there, she got into the trash as I was throwing away eggshells, and I couldn't pull her away from it; I called my boyfriend over, and it took him 15 minutes to pry her mouth open to retrieve the plastic wrapper she tried to swallow. I thanked my lucky stars that she didn't get a hold of the onion skins I had tossed out, but the whole ordeal just made my anxiety worse. 

After nearly a month of panic-attack-hell, we went home, and the first thing my boyfriend wanted to talk to me about was getting a dog of our own. I learned that I definitely cannot live like that, but I'm having trouble telling him, since he is being very persistent about getting a dog, and he would think that my paranoia is silly. There were a few other minor things that bothered me like the drooling, the begging, the being stepped-on- tripped- and-knocked -over part, but I honestly don't think I could function with having to constantly make sure my pet wouldn't kill itself. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to talk him out of getting a dog? Or any tips on how I can overcome my anxiety about them?

52,"I recently turned 18, and my parents still treat me like a kid and I still act like a kid. I am very emotionally immature and suffer from anxiety and depression. I tried to arrange for my own therapy but my parents arranged for a non-state-certified 'Christian' counseling service that I will see hopefully only once tomorrow. I looked them up and they believe in conversion therapy and the pre-session paperwork I got gives me a bad feeling (one paragraph basically condoned abuse as long as it was cool with god).

54,"Hello Reddit, this is the most personal thing I've probably ever opened up about on the internet, but here goes nothing.  


I'm from the UK. I'm 22 and I feel a mixture of resentment towards myself for failing everything I ever attempt and resentment towards people that have influenced my life.  


At the moment, I've failed my second year of my course at university. And I am living in a state of constant anxiety and a level of unbridled anger that can snap out of me the second anything else goes wrong. Think Michael Douglas in Falling Down levels of anger.  


I'm unsure where to start with this, but the first time my education was affected was when I was 15. My high school English teacher was a despotic bully, who would repeatedly scream in my face (baring in mind I was always very visibly timid) and he would get other students to bully me by slandering my work in front of them, even when I wasn't present. This harassment continued until I left school. I scraped out with 5 GCSE's, a massive underachievement given my actual academic ability.  


I then went to college, which was a much better time that momentarily increased my confidence due to making proper friends for the first time and meeting my girlfriend, and I came out with decent A-levels where my second year was much better than my first and I was starting to build momentum. After I decided to take a gap year where I worked to earn some money so I could have fun when I got to university.  


Unfortunately, midway through my gap year in 2016, things took a turn for the worst. My father met a woman who was hostile to me from the very first moment. She is an expert manipulator and over time my dad's interfering worthless slattern of a girlfriend deliberately forced mine and my dad's previously okay relationship apart as she coerced him into agreeing with everything she did.

&amp;#x200B;

They progressed quickly. Deciding to move in together 2 months before I started university. This bitch refused to house me funnily enough and I lived on my grandmother's sofa until I got to go to uni which left me seething.  


Then, this bitch ups the ante even further by outright refusing to sign student finance papers because she simply didn't like me. This resulted in me getting the minimum loan of £3800 which barely covered my rent. A big loan that could have been mine if my father had waited even a few more months, and when I propositioned waiting he merely stated: ""but I want to get on with my life"". At this moment, I knew I had to cut my father off and accept defeat.  


Luckily my mother offered to pay for costs that my student finance didn't cover on the condition that I was frugal, which I have been. And while this should make me happier, it feels like a Pyrrhic victory as her husband is the opposite of X and instead of interfering, he completely ignores any sense of responsibility he has ever had towards me. Which I've found particularly infuriating as he split my family up by having an affair with my mother. This man has refused to house me ever since he entered my life when I was 13, but that didn't matter so much in the past as I lived with my dad and our relationship at the time was okay.  


My mother unfortunately is willing to put up with him not accepting responsibility for anything because he has a lot of money from owning a business.

  
This meant that I had to succeed by any means necessary as if I dropped out, I would have absolutely no prospects and nowhere to go and while I realise this could be used as fuel to some people, has merely put me in a state of paralytic anxiety. Even if I did succeed in my degree, there's still no certainty that I would be able to find a job in that field. It's not even like I can get experience as everything is littered with unpaid internships and I simply can't afford it things like travel expenses.  


This fear led to my grades slipping and then while at uni, my grandmother got cancer which led my grades in a downward spiral until eventually I became reclusive and didn't even go into uni for weeks. It made me even more anxious, even angrier than before. It's been like a constant landslide of shit piling on top of my shoulders.  


My anxiety and anger issues have become so severe that I now find it impossible to look for a job, as I fear either being ridiculed or embarrassed or bullied. Most of the time, I can't even bring myself to look at job pages as everything seems futile as it feels like I will be constantly messed around by narcissists who always get their way. I don't think I could even handle being criticised by a manager without going on a rampage. It feels like these people have mounted up over the course of my life to ruin me in whatever way they can and it's left me in a state of wanting vengeance against those who have wronged me.  


University have allowed me to resit the year, but I don't know in my current state that it's the best course of action. I'm good at what I do, when I have the right mindset so I don't think all hope is possibly lost.  


So the question reddit is where do I go from here? Do I attempt to resit the year and hope things turn around? or take a year out, live with my girlfriend (who is also at uni) and try to get myself back in the workplace, regain balance and go back afterwards? This was quite a ramble and I'm tired so if I've not made any sense at points and I've left any significant details out, point them out in the comments and I'll do my best to answer everything.",27Aug2018,1

I've wasted so much of my life doing nothing...literally nothing, sat in front of a laptop going on the same few web sites bored out of my mind, I've wasted years but can't figure out a way to escape. With executive dysfunction I can't be goal-orientated or see steps to changing anything, I want to change but I have absolutely no idea where to start.   


My disabilities keep me trapped here, but because I don't seem disabled - that I take good care of myself, I'm intelligent, capable, and articulate - there just doesn't seem to be any appropriate support eg. social services etc. to help me out of this situation. I think I literally need someone to be able to set-out goals and walk me through steps out of this situation, but there has to be something I can do for myself to try to change and move on with my life!   


It's infuriating to know once in work I'll likely not struggle or need accommodations, chances are everything else will slip into place, and that I'll realize how easy it could have been to get back on my feet years go. But for now I'm stuck.

My parents have paid a lot of money towards this, and dedicated their lives to this. I’ve always been pretty slim and had the right body for ballet but when I got to about 14 I started having trouble keeping my weight down at where my teachers wanted it. This has caused me to have some problems with eating, sometimes I’ll throw up my food and sometimes I’ll barely eat at all just so I can keep my  weight where it needs to be. I also feel like I’ve lost passion for it, it doesn’t make me happy anymore so I don’t feel like the pain I put my body through every day is worth it. I can barely do stuff normal teenagers are doing because I’m constantly training or too tired on my days off and I feel like I’m missing out on a lot in life. 
A while ago I tried expressing these feelings to my parents and they told me that not everything in life is gonna be easy, they then guilted me saying id be throwing away all the money and time they’ve put into  this. They said I’m just going through a teenage phase and if I give up I’ll regret it and will have thrown away everything I worked for. I really dunno what to do so I guess that’s why I’m posting this.

67,"So to start this off I just turned 20 and I have 2 brothers. One being 15 and the other being 17. Our mother died of MS only 2 years ago and my father never got along with my grandma but he keeps in touch with us. He has a couple other kids but I understand not everyone is perfect and we have moved past. I dont want to shut out the only parent I have. I also live with my grandma whose house it is and 3 aunts cause 2 of them were living together until they got evicted. I also have a 2 cousins whose ages are M20 and F18 who lives with us with our grandma. My grandma has the heart of an angel ascended to godhood. She lets us live there and has taken care of us when my mother became bed ridden. I am a total inside person and doesnt leave the house for a second. My cousin is the complete opposite, leaving the house ever day and coming back around 2 in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

 The problem with this situation is that my cousin is the main problem starter of the entire house. Everyone in the house can co-exist but whenever anyone asks or accuses him of anything he immediately loses it and goes on a tantrum of swearing and even getting physically violent. He has had the police called on him many times and he even beats his girlfriend and they have even gotten into physical fights where either she stabbed him with plastic or he punched her in the face. Its a lot more than that but that alone should give you the idea on what kinda relationship it is. Grandma tells him to smoke weed in the house and he only recently has he stopped. He does it in the garage where his friends and him go. I have seen at least 100 different people come and go out that garage of almost all ages. He claims he doesnt sell weed but its almost certain he does. People who I dont know come in and out the back door of the house around night who are supposedly his friends that he has let in to give or get weed to or from. Grandma toid us both that if we didnt get jobs we would be out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the problem. I fear my cousin may be rubbing off on my second youngest brother. Both of my brothers friends smoke weed and I make it abundantly clear that I dont want him smoking it so long as I am living with him. We live in an area where its not legal and you dont know what your getting half the time. If its not his friends smoking it then its my cousin who not only smokes it but sells it and in cases wheres he not at the house will ask my brother to take it to the people hes selling it too and to retrieve the money from them. This all happens not too many feet from my house. I know because my grandma already told my cousin to not get him involved in it. My brother also isnt very confrontational and is a serious pushover. I cant tell if its cause he fears my cousin so much that he cant say no or cause he generally doesnt see anything wrong with it. I have told him on multiple occasions to not do it or ask why he does would hold onto it for a stranger. I tell him he is risking his life every time he does this for our cousin and he just nods and mmm and goes on. I cant get an answer and I am at a loss. What makes it even worse is that he will call him late at night to go out to the garage and he would be gone for 20 minutes sometimes and I just wonder what hes giving or saying to him.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should do about my brother?** I dont want him really hanging out with my cousin but I also dont want to seem like I am trying to control his life and dont really want to damage the relationship we have. It just seems he will go along with whatever someone tells him cause he doesnt want to question it and it kills me to think of what might happen if someone pressures him constantly to doing something. 

Dont get me wrong, I am not picture perfect older brother. It took 5 years and a summer school to barely pass cause I was lazy and I used to steal and lie but this is all behind me now and I feel I have truly matured now. Its not that I have a problem with smoking weed but whatever my cousin is smoking isnt weed. Its smells of burning plastic and actually burns my nose. If its not that then its pills(bars) I found on his table that look like Xanax. All this is a VERY VERY condensed version of my living conditions so far but I hope I explained my issue clear enough.",27Aug2018,1
68,"TLDR: Manager from a rival sit-down restaurant offered to poach me from my fast-food restaurant.

I started a job at a new fast-food taco place about two weeks ago. I was hired and trained even before it opened and have been working there as a cashier/server/cleaner/restocker. Ever since opening it feels like a slowly sinking ship, especially with huge demand during rush periods and not enough cooks/efficiency to keep up. (For example, if someone ordered 20 tacos and someone ordered 2 tacos immediately after, we do the 20 tacos first instead of the 2) Some orders took up to 90 minutes to complete yesterday. This and Disneyland-like employee policies (Ex: forced smiling) are starting to make me dislike the job. The only reason I would stay long term is for free food.

75,"We have been on and off for almost 13 years now. She is the mother of my 11 year old daughter and her 15 year old daughter who knows only me as her father. We were never married. We live in the seattle area and the only thing really keeping her here with us is our financial need of eachother. I still love her, but I hate her too...
In the past when we have gone our own ways, her daughter would stay and live with me. Mostly because my EX cant make enough money to support the both of them on her own. I also suspect that it has a lot to do with the fact that she wishes she never had kids and ultimately feels that they are a burden. She plays only the most minimal role she has to to get by.
I bought a house about 6 months ago (my name only on the morgage) and in that 6 months she has had 2 one night stands and seems to think there is nothing wrong with  coming back home and hoping into bed with me. We have had talks about how I dont like it and how it hurts my feelings. She doesn't seem to care. I dont date out of respect for our living situation. Besides, what woman would want to date a guy who's ex lives with him? I'm sure both of the guys she has recently slept with know about me and dont care either. Why would they?
I would honestly be rid of her, as much as that would break my heart, but I would struggle greatly paying the bills and keeping food on the table without her income. I have no room for a roommate until I complete the remodel of my house over the next year. Also, as stated above, the oldest child would stay with me if my ex left and I dont have the capacity to deal with her teenage hormones and self harming and therapy alone.
I'm 39 years old and this is not where I thought my family situation would be. I've worked my ass off for the last 13 years to provide for everyone, to give them everything they could want, to buy this house... I thought that when we finally got to this point of stability that they would all be greatful... That they would understand the physical, financial and emotional struggle I pulled them through and finally I might get a little appreciation,  respect, commitment and understanding.
It hasn't all been bad times. We have had many great moments over the years. I am just having a tough time dealing with her sleeping around. I wish she would not while we live and sleep together.

I don't have relevant qualifications so I'd just be able to go for entry level which restricts me a little too.

Two years ago, I went out with a friend. He was a great friend, I trusted him wholeheartedly. I was upset, I drank a lot. I ended up spending the night vomiting in his bedroom. I've never blacked out before or after this night, but I remember only snapshots of the night.

I finished my bottle upstairs, then it was black. 

I was throwing up into a makeshift bowl, lying on a bare mattress.  Blackness.

I woke up to him on top of me, my skirt pulled up. Blackness.

I woke up to him telling me he shouldn't have done that, and he was sorry. I passed out.

In the morning, I cried in his washroom, removing my bloody tampon and trying to make one out of toilet paper. I wasn't going to stay over, I was going to have a few drinks with my friend. 

I pretended like nothing happened. I called a cab and went home.

I messaged him in the next day or so and told him that he was right, he shouldn't have done that and it was wrong. He said it himself.

I cried in the shower. I didn't shave or even wipe myself, if I had to pee I showered. I didn't defacate. I felt like if I touched myself at all, it would hurt. I felt so numb. 


I told my boyfriend what happened. He told me that I was probably lying to cover my ass. He told me that I was ruined, no good, and that since the man who raped me was black, that he would never be able to touch me again. 


I've seen my so called 'friend,' 3 times since this has happened. A year after it happened, I posted on his Facebook about it. I couldn't write directly on his wall, so I commented it on his friends posts. We went to high school together, we have a lot of mutual ""friends.""


I was promptly called a slut and a whore. I haven't said much about it since then. I've seen him 3 times. Every time, I feel all of the blood drain from my face. I can taste copper, my limbs turn to jell-o. 


He's always walking with young girls. 


Today, I was out going to my grandfather's house with my 1 year old son. I always see Him around my grandpa's house.

He was walking straight towards me. 


He was walking with some girl. 


I had my baby.


I froze. I stood there shaking, considering turning around, running though traffic to get to the other side of the road. 

I just stood there. He looked into my eyes, into my soul for the first time in 2 years. He smiled.

He smiled at me. I want to die.


I looked at the girl.. I probably looked like a lunatic, standing frozen on the sidewalk, white as a ghost, crying. 

All I could do was say, ""please.  Please stay away from Eli.""

I just got a raised eyebrow, and a long 'okaaaay."" 


I should have went to the police, but it's too late now. It's all fucking hearsay at this point. The statistics for rapists being convicted aren't very high after a year. They're almost nonexistent after 2 or 3. 


I don't know what advice I need. I have no family, my boyfriend (same one, ended up being able to touch me after all) isn't understanding about this.. I want to die. I want to disappear. I want to hunt him down and hurt him how he hurt me, but I'm not that kind of person.

Lesbian porn usually doesn't work for me, but sometimes it does. (Then again, so does male on male porn, so I don't know if that says something about my sexuality or just me being a general pervert?)
 I don't know how normal or not this is, and I do admire the female form a lot in general like on the train or walking to class or whatever. Like I tend to look at women's legs a lot. Quite alot.

It's like I subconsciously just assume that no woman would be or should be interested, and if they were to know I was interested in them it would surely only end in embarrassment, so I tend to just disregard any signs to the contrary regardless of how obvious they might be. 

I know a lot of guys get anxiety when talking to girls, but for me it feels impossible to get past. I'll see someone I'm attracted to, they'll make prolonged eye contact which presumably means they are also attracted to me, but as soon as the thought of approaching her crosses my mind I freeze. My breathing gets shallower, I feel as if I am physically unable to speak at full volume and I just get overwhelmed. Simply starting a conversation or asking their name feels like an impossible hurdle. This has been a problem for me since my very first crush in elementary school.  I am now 21 years old and it's just getting worse. So much so that amidst the anxiety I get frustrated and start dwelling on just how stressful this issue is, and then I literally start thinking about suicide. Big twist, I know, but I cant control where my mind goes. Its truly absurd. 

What's even more frustrating is that I know how irrational this all is. I've had plenty of people tell me I'm attractive, I have plenty of friends and they all seem to think highly of me, and in general it seems like people respect me a good bit as I try to be respectful towards others wherever possible. So with all that(assuming all these things are true and I'm not just hopelessly lacking in self-awareness), theres really no logical reason for me to doubt myself this much, but sure enough, as soon as the situation presents itself the anxiety rushes in just the same, and the only way out is to just give up hope and try to forget about it altogether.

 I've been in relationships before, but they always just sort of fell in my lap luckily. The thought of relying on luck to initiate my future relationships is just depressing, and I really want to shake this so I can finally start putting myself out there and meeting people. 

My apologies if this post is not particularly well put together. I don't post often, but a situation like the one I described happened just hours ago at work and I figured I might as well see what reddit has to say.

Her father was a complete mess, and her mom was so bad she never told me in full about their relationship. When we were together, she made me a better person. I've never loved someone so passionately. I was willing to give up everything to be with her, but she was too emotionally scarred to let me in. After we fell apart, I fell off the deep end. I tried to kill myself multiple times, and became a person I didn't even recognize. When we broke up, it was something I never got past. Last year, she tried to message me, and I didn't receive it until almost 6 months later. She told me how her life was in shambles and how much she regretted our breaking up. She reminded me of who I used to be, and said I was the best thing she ever had happen to her. I've heard she has a kid now...

I’ve been having some problems with keeping my anxiety issues in check with a flight that I have tomorrow (very short, only 2h 15m flight time) and I have only flown once in my life, about two years ago. 

With the weeks coming up to this flight, I have been reading up on so much material on how to properly deal with being up in the air in general and if I feel like I’m going to worry and panic, feeling like I have tricked my mind into thinking that this is a big deal and having a weird feeling that something is going to go wrong, fast.

I’m a 20 year old university student and I know I should be so excited about it but I’m just not at the moment, not with how much I have been worrying..

It sounds really stupid because this is my first time going on holiday with someone travelling with me and I’m feeling way more worried doing this with someone other then just by myself. I don’t even know what I’m worried about, I’m fully aware of most of the statistics of commercial flying and how hardly anyone experiences anything bad but I still just worry, worry and worry some more over pretty much nothing.

Now I know that it’s just around the corner, literally, I’m trying to make something out of nothing, a small blip on my great holiday that we have planned and I don’t know why. I guess what I’m asking for is just some tips and tricks that work for other anxious flyers on how to deal with the whole situation and to just chill out until I get there.

He’s listed as head of household on their lease and is going after their apartment. He already told her she should go live with her dad.

109,"My boyfriend’s roommate/best friend and I have known each other for two years now. He’s a good friend of mine and I enjoy spending time with him when he’s not being rude/offensive. I’m not sure how to handle when he is being offensive, particularly the sexist comments. (I am a female by the way, and my friend is a guy.) Usually when he makes a joke/comment I get really heated and can’t control what I say so I end up fighting back. My boyfriend always says that his roommate isn’t being sexist, and that I’m making the situation worse and making it a bigger deal than it is. He believes it’s just a joke even though it offends me.

Example of one of our conversations:

Roommate: R and L, I heard you guys talking to J’s mom about how J and I are babies because we can’t handle things that are gross. Just because we have bad gag reflexes doesn’t mean we are babies! We just don’t want to clean.

Me: Well geez if you guys don’t want to clean and it’s your mess why do we have to? What if I put it in your car because you guys like your car so much?

Roommate: I’ll just buy another car because men make more money than women, and men are the breadwinners so I never have to clean.

Me: Well... in my particular case, I happen to make the most money here. (This summer I had a well paying internship.)

Roommate: wait what do you mean, you don’t even have a job.

Me: I had one this summer; and I could’ve taken a co-op if I wanted.

Roommate: L started this by bringing up that we are babies!!

I understand I fought back pretty harshly but he makes comments all the time like “women should be the ones to clean,” or “I won’t clean my room because my girlfriend does it for me,” or “men make more money than women, therefore men are better,” and commenting on women’s weaknesses. He says it “jokingly” yet it still offends me and my boyfriend always takes his side.

I've been applying for jobs since December/January of 2017-2018 because I know my living situation was going to change drastically and I can't take out loans to pay expenses/rent.

112,"I recently fell back in love with the girl that I liked in 2nd Grade. It's a long story so grab some popcorn. Also some of the details will be weirdly specific, but whatever. I think guys will enjoy it. (and yes, I know I'm being slightly, if not very, illogical)

​

Back when I was seven years old, I had an innocent dream about a girl who was in my 2nd Grade class. In the dream I was talking to this girl in a wonderland and we were sitting down on the floor. When I woke up and realized who it was, I knew that I had to pursue this person. It was such a powerful, vivid dream, that it is hard to explain. It was such a great feeling. This was the first time that I ever had been interested in a girl.

​

When I went to school, I began to pay special attention to her, and I began liking her more and more. I remember that she had a dog who had just had puppies so she brought in pictures and hung them up and it was so adorable. At recess, a good portion of the students used to play soccer, but this wasn't your normal soccer game. It mainly consisted of picking the ball up and punting it to the other side of the grassy area that was our field. The boys would retrieve the ball and give it to the girl that they liked so that they would be able to punt it. Of course, I did this same courtesy.

​

Even though at first there was no reason for me to like her (except for some irrational feeling I had during a dream), the more I got to know her, the more I realized that I really liked her. And I even sensed that she might like me back. I wanted to know if the feeling was mutual, so I did what any logical person would do: I faked an injury. Sure enough, she came rushing to my side to see if I was okay. I wasn't 100% sure though.

​

Many recesses later, 2nd Grade was over and 3rd Grade began. I was so hyped out when I found out that she was going to be in my class. I was one of the smarter kids in my class, but I had trouble saying my R's so I had to go to speech therapy. Amazingly, this girl also couldn't say her R's. So for probably the first half of 3rd Grade, her, a few other kids and I got out of classes to practice. I thought it was perfect, but it got better. Her and I were *so bad* that when all of the other kids graduated in the winter, we had to continue speech therapy. That meant for the rest of 3rd Grade it would be just the two of us... and a teacher.

​

Those were good times. It was like it was meant to be. While we were playing different pronunciation games and trying to say the word, ""car,"" we were flirting, though we didn't know it. I became friends with this girl and we would play at recess. Though, it wasn't like a normal friendship because there was something going on between us.

​

For P.E., I remember putting in 19 consecutive pushups which was pretty good for my class. One day, we were on the sidewalk at recess when she jumped into my arms. It was so strange because I had this exact desire to hold her in this way. Of course, I couldn't really do it, but everything went fine. Then the big thing happened: we hugged. I remembered that she smelled so good. We did this one extra time, and it was the greatest feeling.

​

By the end of 3rd Grade, I got terrible news: I was going to go to a different school, a private school. I would lose all of my friends, but the worst part was that this girl and I were actually starting to get close. We were finally figuring out that we both liked each other. Not only that, but her and I were *still* terrible at saying our R's, so we would get to take another year of speech therapy with just the two of us... and the teacher, again.

​

4th Grade and 5th Grade were significantly worse for me as I had no way of communicating with her, except for one person. Her best friend lived in my neighborhood (and still does). When I was riding my bike around, I would talk to her friend and ask her how the girl was doing (It was obvious that I liked her friend, and she liked me). The girl's friend would get kind of crazy when I asked her about the girl. One time I had a speedometer on my bike and I remember setting a speed record trying to outrun her.

​

Me not knowing how to pick up girl signals, I didn't know why her friend was acting the way she was. I would try to ask her different questions about the girl. For example, one time I asked her if the girl remembered me (She obviously did, it was only a year since I saw her). Her friend would always answer no and say that she had forgotten about me. This kind of disappointed me, even though I didn't really believe what her friend was saying. But one day my neighbor revealed that she liked me. Now it all made sense. She was just extremely jealous. After that, I felt kind of bad and didn't talk to her about it.

​

In 6th Grade, I had access to an iPod which once again connected me with the world. Except of course, the girl didn't have an Instagram account so I waited. When I realized that she made one, I quickly followed her and messaged her, probably something really cringey like this post. I would recount some of the things I said but it would be very painful. I didn't say anything too weird and she definitely seemed interested in talking to me, even though my Instagram DM game was very weak.

​

Fast forward to sophomore year in high school. I go to a public school. I'm technically supposed to go to a different public school than the one I go to. And you guessed it. The girl goes to the one that I'm *supposed* to go to. I am 15 years old, and of course I don't have my license yet. I haven't talked to her in years. I know really nothing about her except that she still plays soccer and that in 3rd Grade, we had the best chemistry I had ever had with another human. Period.

​

Should I try to set up a date? I know it sounds weird considering the fact that we haven't talked in a long time. It would be a time for us to catch up, and maybe if things go well, we can even continue catching up with another date. Back in 3rd Grade, I had the serious intention of literally marrying her. I didn't get over her for **years** after I had last seen her. And apparently, I'm still not.

​

What I am asking is, what is the best course of action now? Is it even worth it? Would it be too weird?

​

TL;DR: I used to really like this girl in elementary school and she liked me. I have talked to her online (kind of) but haven't seen her in years. Should I try to set up a date/time for us to catch up on things or would it be too awkward after all these years (I'm a sophomore in high school)?",27Aug2018,1
113,"TLDR: How do I convince a stubborn middle aged man with severe mental health issues, childhood trauma, and possible early onset dementia to see a doctor and get some help before it's too late?

Full context:

Here's why we suspect he's beginning to develop Alzheimer's:

1.His mother recently passed away after suffering with Alzheimer's for years now. He knows and we know that that means he's definitely at risk. 

2. He's in his 50s, nearing 60,  so he's definitely getting older and more susceptible to these kinds of diseases.

3. He doesn't have any hobbies, doesn't read, doesn't really do anything other than go to work  super early and come home around 7, go to bed at 9, restart the next day. So he doesn't really work his brain, other than mind numbing activities.

4. He's very forgetful, and often will have the same conversation with us multiple times a day/week, and will forget the names of basic things, beyond what can be explained by pure forgetfulness. For example, calling pudding ""that chocolate cream stuff your mother bought yesterday."" He will also forget routine things like a band practice that we've had at the same time on the same day every week for the past decade.

5. Related to 4. He will argue with my mom alot and it's eerily always the EXACT same argument. It's like he keeps repeating himself, almost as if he doesn't even realize they argued about this exact thing maybe 10 times in the past months.
6. When confronted about his forgetfulness, he often brushes it off like ""ahh I'm just joking around,"" or ""ahh nobody likes to make conversation in this house anyway.""

Now he's also clearly suffering from depression and anxiety from childhood trauma that we only know a little bit about, since he refuses to talk about it or acknowledge that it even happened. Because of all his denial and bottled up emotions, he's constantly a ticking temper bomb and refuses to acknowledge that he has mental health issues. He overeats, projects his emotions onto us, is very violent and loud when angry, and is constantly paranoid that everybody hates him and is out to fuck him over in some way (even us, his own family).

Whether or not he's actually suffering from Alzheimer's, or if all of these symptoms are related to his other mental health issues are irrelevant, he still needs psychiatric help, but refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong. Personally, I believe he is just scared, and seeing a doctor would make his issues a reality, something I don't think he is willing to face.

Yes, he is abusive to us. Yes, after 20 years of living with him, we are exhausted and would gladly just leave, and most people would, but I would never forgive myself if I just let his brain deteriorate in a slow, painful death over the course of possibly decades. It would be suffering for him, and, selfishly enough, a chronic burden for me and my family to go through.",27Aug2018,4
114,"I know that being flirty is just part of being a bartender at a club. It helps get tips. I get that, and it doesn't bother me that he does it. He only does it when he's on the clock. When he's off, he doesn't give these people the time of day. 

I can handle people hitting on him, I get it. But when I hear that someone groped him. It upsets me. I don't know if I'm being jealous or protective or what. Maybe I just feel like he's being disrespected and so am I. But it makes me mad. I don't blame him. And he doesn't seem bothered by it. He says he just shoves off their advances and moves on. He thinks it's just part of the job. I've never been a bartender, so I guess I don't know. 

It's even gone as far as when we were together in public and he has ran into frequent customers of his and they literally flirt with him and touch him while I'm standing right there. And again, he totally doesn't play into it. He doesn't flirt back and essentially walks away from them. Which I appreciate. But it still pisses me off that people do this.

So last year when I was working a summer job at a grocery store as a cashier, I decided to steal around 300$ over the course of 2 shifts. Eventually I was caught and brought up to the managers room where they brought in a security auditor(?) to question me and basically get me to come clean. At the time I was very nervous and I did come clean (I'm glad I did). I was fired on the spot and the company didn't take any legal action which I am very thankful for. I worked at the store for around a month in total and stole the money on my last week of working there before I got caught and was fired. Now a year as passed and I'm looking for a new part time job at an office supplies store, however I'm worried that my employers will somehow find out about what I did at my past workplace.

1. To what extent can new employers check information of my past employment, and what is the likelihood of them doing so (I am applying for a part time retail job at a office supply store
2. What are/are there any realistic long term ramifications of what I did in the past (stealing)
3. I have been considering meeting my old employer/manager (from whom I stole from) to apologize, is this a good idea? It's been around a year and I only worked there for around a month

 And before anyone tells me how stupid I was for stealing, I'd just like to say that I am aware and have learned from my mistakes. Thanks in advance guys. Sorry for the long read

121,"So, me and my best friend have known each other for a long time but I think he's taking drugs. I try asking him why and he just tells me to stop ganging up on him. Meanwhile my other friend I'm pretty sure is fucking my girlfriend. All of this is going on and I can't even get the promotion at work that I deserve. I feel like everybody betrays me. No matter what I do my girlfriend barely talks to me and acts like I'm crazy just for expressing how her silence affects me. I try talking to my best friend and all he can do is comment on how good my girlfriend looks, and that's not even the one I think is fucking her.

122,"So let's start with a bit about me, I'm nearly 20 and have a very decent job for my age bringing in enough to live very comfortably on my own. I have aspergers syndrome so I am a bit socially awkward but don't think it's that inhibiting... it's pretty mild tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I'm having is that I literally have 0 friends except some online that live in different countries over 3000 miles away. I've never been in an actual relationship and have had lots of social issues over the years. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you guys is, what can I do now to make actual friends and potentially a girlfriend. I've tried dating apps but let's be honest, those are pretty trash. I've also tried looking for local clubs but they're literally aren't any in my area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've definitely struggled with this and have had some dark nights but I don't think I'm depressed, I just get very lonely and normally go into a work fueled rage to pull myself out of it.

124,"to begin- i am a 17, almost 18 year old (in less than a month) girl who just graduated high school in june and im currently in a gap year. so far, i’ve worked my ass off at my retail job, working more hours than any other associate, constantly picking up shifts for people, never turning one down, etc. let’s call my manager jess....
-
i’m coming up on my one year anniversary at said retail job, and in the beginning and when i interviewed i was highly considering an actual career in retail long term, wanting to be a general manager and working myway up to be a district manager as time went on. at this point, i’m realizing there is so much more out there in the world for me....i am not saying i hate my job and i feel like it’s below me in anyway, i just know that i will go crazy doing this forever and i want to be challenged in some way. it’s almost as though i have learned everything there is to learn at that job and done everything and i want to try out something new. i also have a license in floral design and i’ve only ever worked one job with it which ended horribly and i would love to give it another shot because it was one of my real passions (that’s beside the point but whatever). whenever i tell jess that i am interested in getting a second job she completely laughs in my face and tells me ‘no’. and then continues to tell me she’ll have me working full time, even though no associate or manager at my job works full time. she has almost hinted she’ll either turn everyone against me and or fire me if i do. 
on top of that, i am currently deciding what i would like todo with the rest of my life and what i’d like to go to school for come next fall. everytime i bring up a possible area of study or even the topic of community college itself, she gets extremely passive aggressive and tells me to ‘not waste my money’ and ‘just work here forever’. it honestly hurts so much, these people i work with (even jess, as mean as she can be) are like a second family to me. i don’t want to quit my job but i also want to work a second job and go to college without being belittled! i really can’t be wrong for wanting that...how do i confront her and be like ‘hey...i’m getting a second job...’ and/or eventually ‘hey ive got classes...’
this has been so hard on me! what would you do in this situation? how would you handle it and what would you say? it’s honestly so tricky... and before you say ‘just do it!’, id have to give jess my availability so i could still be scheduled there. 
thank you all so much in advance and god
bless. ",27Aug2018,1
125,"Short background: initially, my roommate said she had a guy friend who may be over every now and again but he’s here during most of the weekdays and sometimes on weekends. I would not have any problem with it if he were paying rent, DTE, internet, or any bill that’s connected to my address. How often should they be there before you suggest to them that it’s time to pay? 

I am a person who believes that if you’re not paying bills, my morning and night routine should not be impacted by your presence. I should not be late for work because of someone else’s company.

126,"Deleting this account for obvious reasons.

Backstory: I am 23 (f) I just had a baby 3 months ago. I had a very hard pregnancy, my labor was long and painful, ended in an emergency c section. I suffered from very bad postpartum depression (still am) on top of that I have been having gallstone attacks which are worse than labor pain. A week ago I had another surgery to get my gallbladder removed. On top of all of this I have been severely depressed and sad, also in pain considering the surgeries and not fully recovering. On top of that I’m taking care of a 3 month old and my husband doesn’t really help. Just occasionally, I’m with her all the time and he gets her maybe a total of 2 hours in a day without me there. We live together. My husband doesn’t have a steady job, I’m on disability and that’s the only income we have. Thank god for my parents allowing us to live here for free. My husband is sitting on this dream of becoming a professional skateboarder and/or musician. He claims band practice and going out making skate videos is “work” (he doesn’t get paid) if it weren’t for my parents I would have any help/support from him. On top of that he smokes weed all the time because he claims it helps his depression and anxiety. His mom enables him and send him around $50-$120 A WEEK for weed, or gas to get him to band practice or skateparks. As you can see I am highly frustrated on top of everything I’m going through (surgeries, postpartum). No matter how many times I have to explain to him everything and for him to grow up and step up he doesn’t get it. He turns everything I say around and makes it about HIM. Today I broke down bad crying and yelling telling him I’m tired of everything no help, support, etc. from him. Again, he turned this around in him and I couldn’t do it anymore I walked out of the room before I started to punch him or something because of how frustrated I was. Hours later he then started leaning over the baby telling her sorry, crying telling me sorry, playing sad music on his phone turned the lights off and said he loved me he’s tired, he’s letting everyone down, he has no purpose etc. he’s done this all before multiple times. As if he’s saying “goodbye” I don’t like how he uses this every time and he basically “cries wolf” I know everyone is different and it’s not always good to think “I’m going through things too” or “others have it harder” but what about me? I have to go through everything AND be strong AND take care of a baby AND take care of him. What do I do ? I really need help I’m lost. ",27Aug2018,2
127,"I understand that it's what men/women do. It's normal. I don't watch porn but I know that so many guys do.

I hate porn because it makes sex so unrealistic. Some men actually believe that women are always going to wear sexy lace and makeup with their hair done all the time.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years and both of us were virgins when we met. I knew he watched porn before we dated because we were best friends first and him and his buddies would talk about it.

In the first year of dating I found out that he had specific porn stars that he watched. Like ""favorites"" I guess. He also had a couple on his Snapchat where they posted nudes. This made me very uncomftorable. I talked to him and he said he always imagined having sex with me when he watched it. (This was before we started having sex). He said he liked specific porn stars because their body looked like mine. After that talk he said he never watched porn again and he took the porn stars off his snapchat. 

Since we've had sex he talks about how the positions he watched in porn don't even feel good and how their moans are obnoxious and mine are cute. However I find it hard to believe that he actually stopped watching it. It's killing me knowing he probably does. I'm a very jealous person and the thought of him watching it kills me. He swears he doesn't though. What about times when I'm not home? He says he pleases himself when i'm not there by looking at pictures/videos of me. So I need advice.

1. Are there guys out there that actually don't watch porn?

2. How do I get over the fact that he probably does still watch it?

3. Do you think having favorites and having them on snapchat is a little overboard?",27Aug2018,2

He went to a colleague of mine after the fact and admitted to the situation and words used. My colleague encouraged him to apologize and he told him, fuck no. 

Today, he was called into a supervisor’s office about the incident. He reported he wasn’t disrespectful, those words were not directed at me, and he apologized but I blew it off. I got an email reporting exactly that along with something along the lines of client was given grievance forms and forms to speak to a supervisor regarding incident. 

Needless to say, I was PISSED. I confirmed the conversation my colleague had with the client and responded to the email with that information. I have yet to hear back.

131,"I have been told both indirectly and directly that I can be cocky and arrogant. The thing is, I don't know how to turn down that side of me, I feel like my confidence is a big part of who I am. I consider myself a very nice person and it really drives me nuts when I hear people think this way about me. I put a lot of importance into how people think of me and I get depressed when I feel like I am not liked or singled out, especially with my friends or at work. I go out of my way to be nice to others and help people without accepting anything in return quite often. I think part of the problem is I am very good at what I do and am a top performer. Another problem is I am very social, extroverted, and speak my mind without much of a filter. I can also be very critical of others. Work is also not the only place I have been told I am arrogant. My whole life people have disliked me for what seems to me like no reason, but I'm starting to think its because of how I carry myself. I feel like I am a very nice person, but there's a side to me that really gets under certain peoples skin with what I say and what I do. My confidence (perhaps overconfidence) comes from a place in my head that thinks I am always right. This is part of the reason I am so good at sales and am good at persuading others, but I believe this also hurts me a lot. Most self-help stuff I've found on the internet tries to help cocky people who's confidence comes from a place of material value or false confidence. I believe my confidence is warranted because I am very good at what I do and in general am pretty good at making people like me. But theres a part of me that makes all the good about me not matter, for many people. Not all people though. I have a lot of really close friends and many people accept me and my personality and accept it. Probably because they know its my personality and I am a good person most of the time. But If I could learn to humble myself a bit and filter my words better I would be much better off in life.

I have a big question for my 5 months relationship. I have met a 27 y/o Chinese boy when he traveled to Vietnam (I’m 24y/o Vietnamese).

At first he told me he want to do some business in Vietnam, because his father was also start a business himself in China. But 5 months has passed and he hasn’t done anything... in addition, he has been traveled in China for 2 years before coming to Vietnam.

Last month I went with him to see his family. His parents were incredibly nice people. They also makes more money than my own family. They have enough money to buy house and car, too.

The problem is, my boyfriend is not working. He often says a lot about his ideas and about our future. He insists on marrying me. In fact, my boyfriend is very caring and I can feel his love towards me, he can even cook and help me do many things. But he is still childish sometimes. He talks about his ideas without having a detailed plan of doing it. He would spend a day for watching and playing game.

Now I feel very confused. I know that every man will have a hard time before they can succeed. But seeing him haven’t done anything makes me very worry about our future. Recently he told me he would become a company salaryman first. I found some interesting JD on Facebook and recommend to him, but when I asked for his CV to send to the recruiter, he asked me to send him the CV sample...

We really do care for one another. We've talked and pictured a life after college together and it seems so sweet.

It seems my only option is to do a long distance relationship. I will see her once every 1 or 2 months at the absolute most- I'm willing to spend the money I've saved up working on plane tickets so I can fly her up and spend time with her.

Due to job loss/change, I’ve decided to put my house up for rent and relocate for the time being. 

&amp;#x200B;

The event: 

Nice hispanic family (dark skin) leaves my house after showing for rental. 

Neighbor from 2 houses down comes to my front yard asking to speak to me for a minute. I am with real estate agent. 

Starts yelling at me: she doesn’t know what’s going on but she doesn’t like what I’ve done. Says she opens her door and she sees black people. She states their three black teenagers will play basketball in the streets and she doesn’t want to see that. She said the cops will be here every night writing my house up. She told me she pays a lot of money to live in her house and she can’t have me ruin it by letting black people live on the block. Told me my town is a white city. Said she doesn’t want to see blacks, the lady next door to her doesn’t want to see blacks, the people across the street from me don’t want to see blacks and pointed to a few more houses saying they don’t want to see blacks. (From my 4 years in this neighborhood, she’s the only one I know to stick her nose into everyone’s business and goes from house to house to probably gossip and pass rumors. We exchanged short conversations a few times but mainly kept to myself. None of the other neighbors seem racist to me) She told me she prefer it if I find white families or even some Korean families or whatever group I’m from. (I’m Chinese) 

Real estate agent is shocked. Tells me I could sue but I can’t think of any benefit of winning a case against her except probably spiteful rumors around the block. I look for nice people…they will be in my house after all. Race really does not matter to me. Is this worth challenging? I know there’s fair housing laws but I can’t imagine a good time for tenants finding out there’s a proud racist 2 doors down. Should I tell minority potential renters about the neighbor? Pretty shocked…never felt so disgusted. I feel at fault because I just stood there and took it in. I feel now I should’ve shouted back or shown anger but I was more stunned than anything I think. Should I speak to other neighbors to see how they feel about the crazy lady?

There's always the chance I'll screw something up, and 2. Even if I do it perfectly, it wouldn't be the box she gave me, if that makes sense. Kind of like the Ship of Theseus dilemma.

159,"I proposed divorce yesterday to my wife of 2 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my view of the history:

&amp;#x200B;

It was a fast marriage and, at its conception, was only for convenience. ""If it doesn't work out, the price for the convenience is just a little paperwork"". To this day, most of her family does not know. The relationship turns out better than we thought, but then ten months in, two things happen which pivot our relationship. I start to notice a habit of alt+tab when I walk into view of her computer screen which is something I was all too familiar with doing at home to my parents. I give into privacy concerns because I'm insecure, shoot me. Turns out she is talking with other guys via dm on a social site. She was having a hard time making friends in our new area so she looked online. Honestly, nothing wrong with that; however, it turns out that the people she's talking to always ended up being explicit (asking for pictures, talking about sex, in general flirtatious). She never seemed to encourage the behavior, however she didn't halt it. Never mentioned she was married, either. Whatever, its a hole we can dig out of. But then less than a week later, while I was walking our dog... her dog (11 mths), he slips out of his collar and b-lines it for the road. If you don't know the loss of an animal, it is painful. There was a solid month of mourning. I blame myself and, though she claims it's not my fault, I feel she does too. We don't touch each other the entire time. She's still depressed. I'm still depressed. We fill the hole with a another puppy. I start looking for comfort, apparently still too early for her. That causes problems. I periodically talk to a shrink. She won't, thinks it is for crazy people. We start to get back into a routine as closure finally sets in. We make love maybe once a month, at times less. She works part-time, I work full. When she gets home she buries herself in her computer. I still haven't regained trust concerning that. There is fighting often, about regular petty things. More than once, at the start of an argument she gets extreme and says she wants a divorce. Surprising the first time, depressing thereafter. Sex frequency somehow gets brought up practically every fight. She claims it's all I want and that if she doesn't put out that she's feels she's going to be out the door. I feel physically and emotionally deprived-- like I do not provide what she wants. She slowly starts to put on weight as she doesn't leave the computer and has poor diet. She puts it on the birth control. The last two fights we've had were brought on by me. Talks about our relationship problems and changes I would need to see for me to continue being invested: couples counseling. First time was a bust and she outright said no. Second time she agreed, but we never followed through. While away for the first time on a 30 day work venture, it was apparent to me that we both don't like talking to each other. We spoke once on the phone for maybe 10 minutes, and txts were far in few between.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum things up, we fight often, are unhappy, don't make love but once every other month, don't hang out aside from errands or at the dinner table, I've blamed myself for the death of her dog and think she continues to blame me too, she has not committed to the marriage fully to her family, she has flaked multiple times on getting help, and I have a lack of trust for her which she has yet to regain.

&amp;#x200B;

The above is very condensed of the heavier topics. And after reading it, seems all over the place. But that's also my mind after recent events. There are other smaller things here and there and things she does that get on nerves as does anyone in any relationship. So I decided it was about time after my trip. I told her yesterday that I want a divorce. We cried, we talked, and cried some more. She says she can change. Offered to make appointments for her anger and depression. Offered to sign us up for marriage counseling. Offered to take nutrition advice and workout routines (made a point that dropping birth control would also help). She says she also wants to change all the little things that peeve me. She says that these are all things that she wants to do for her and for me. I do still love her and I want these things for her, but I honestly don't know if I believe she would or can... or should? Beyond that, I don't think she can change mind on certain things like the dog, her sex drive, her respect for me.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*So the advice I'm looking for is:\*\* at what point is a marriage too broken to be fixed? I'm sure it all depends-- on the marriage, situations, and eagerness of the involved. But in general, where do you, should I draw the line? To state that you want to end a marriage is the absolute worst feeling in the world that I've felt so far and I don't want to do it all over again on a hunch that she could maybe change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, please note that I understand that I'm not perfect either and that I have too contributed to the failure of my marriage. I'm flawed and have work to do for myself. This is more, as stated before, a view from my perspective.",27Aug2018,1

165,"This may be a little long, but I will try to keep things short. I was a very happy-go-lucky child. Now, I am a fairly confident 18F, a relatively good student, only child. My relationship with my father has not affected my life outside of it except stress and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

My father used to be abusive, both verbally and physically (never sexually), from ages 4-10 years old. Physical in which he would hit me if I misbehaved, or ""teach me"" how things worked by using them on me, e.g burning me to teach me not to play with fire, pushing me down the stairs to teach me to be careful, etc. He would also *scream* at me. My father is a large man, about 6"", and every time I crossed him I would get a blast of swears and insults, over things as little as wearing a t-shirt he didn't like. At the time I thought this was normal. I only saw my mother once a week because she was constantly working, and my father didn't have a job (and still doesn't have a ""real"" job). I loved my mother with all my heart and I still do, and as we grew closer she became my most precious person.

By the time we moved (11 y/o), I had grown up enough to fight back, but not enough to truly comprehend it all.  I still loved my dad, despite mildly understanding the abuse I went through, even though he constantly ignored me and only payed attention to me when he was telling me I was worthless. One day, I took my dads computer to play computer games, and asked my mother for help. She discovered that he was cheating on her for SIX YEARS. He came home, denied everything, lied to both of our faces. When she left, he started shrieking at me for ""ratting him out."" I didn't know what to think.. I became a shoulder for my mother to cry on and didn't see my father for about a month, until my mother forgave him and invited him back into our family. But I felt cheated, and betrayed by my mother. This man has done horrible, horrible things to us and you, my mother, continue to support him? What about my right to stay a happy-go-lucky kid? I had no say in this. 

After he came back, sure the physical abuse stopped, and he started yelling at me less frequently, but we still had fights constantly. The insults continued, only they were thrown both ways now, my mother often acting as a mediator to cool things down. Here, I started to really, really hate him. And after *years* of screaming at each other every day, at around 14, I completely cut him off as my father, and turned to see him as some guy that makes my mom happy. 

I was so filled with hatred and disgust as I truly realized the horrible things he had done to me and my mother. But I was also filled with self-hatred. I have half the DNA of the person I hate most in the world. I inherited all of his disgusting, horrible traits. I had a brush with self harm for a while, but the worst was that I didn't have the heart to tell him I hated him with all my heart. He still told me he loved me, gave me hugs, etc. even though I hated it when he touched me. I didn't have the heart to crush his heart, if that makes sense. Even though he lost the right to be my father, even though he doesn't deserve anything positive I have to offer for him, I couldn't rob him of the satisfaction he gets when he pats himself on the back for being a good parent. After YEARS of bottling it up inside, letting him believe that he's a responsible, loving father, I told my mother everything, as we had grown much closer. She cried with me, talked to him, and scheduled him therapy, and thought it would be the best for me to leave the house and go to boarding school, which has been a very good experience.

Fast forward to now, and for the last 2 years. Since his ""therapy"" and my distance from the family, he has seen some improvements. Yelling fights have lessened, to only once or twice a week, when we have them they're mostly started by me, since he constantly twists stories and lies to put himself in a better light. For the most part though, he avoids me and I avoid him. When I'm home, a social day would be a short conversation. Feelings of hatred have subsided, and I have, in some ways, accepted that I can't remove him from my life, and that I cant live my life in hatred. But I can't avoid him forever.. and I still strongly dislike him. He still believes that our relationship is positive, and if not more positive than ever. 

But how do I move on from this..? I don't know what to do with my feelings of hatred at him, guilt for avoiding him in my own house, insecurity, betrayal from my mother, so many emotions. I don't know what to do now nor what I want our relationship to be. I cant just let it sit there, can I? Part of me wants to spill all my negative feelings and make him feel horrible, part of me wants revenge, but I don't want to stir the pot. My mother is happy and he makes her happy, and I don't want to ruin her happiness. I feel like a burden even complaining to her, as she's had to deal with so much, and since she's the one not only supporting me but my father as well. I think I'm scared that she'll pick his side again? I don't know. 

I am sorry this is a jumbled mess. Please do not advise me to go to therapy.

166,"Hi. So over the last few years things between my mom and I have not been great. She's constantly is fighting with me or my dad. She goes into rages where she screams and throws things. blah blah blah but now my sister has started fighting with me and causing problems between my mom and I.

I used to think my sister was my best friend and that I could tell her anything and trust her to not tell people certain things that I tell her. No bad secrets obviously but if I'm complaining about my mom you would think she would just listen and move on but no she told my mom that my dad and I talk about her which really pissed off my mom and now she's mad at me. 

I confronted my sister about it and she basically said that I've been a bitch since i started my job and I shouldn't complain when my mom doesn't help with housework. (My mom and sister don't have jobs btw) It's kinda frustrating when I go to work all day and then do the grocery shopping after and my mom won't even help put away the groceries because she's been ""working all day"" even though she doesn't get up til like noon and sometimes 2 pm.

 I told my sister that yeah I'm a bitch because I'm unhappy that I gotta work so hard while my mother just gives her everything. I started working as soon as I got out of high school and I'm putting myself through school and I pretty much pay for all of my own stuff now. My sister couldn't graduate on time, she's only had one job and she worked there for like two weeks, and my mom pays for her schooling.

I'm just at the point where I don't know what to do. I feel like I can't trust anyone. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells because I don't want to make my mom mad. I don't want this to turn into some huge family fight that lasts like a week because that's happened before and last time I was so stressed out from it that I felt like I was gonna faint. I really want to get my own apartment but unfortunately I don't make enough money now. 

So if you have any advice please share :)

They were very accommodating during the process and we really appreciated it (we were first time home buyers). We stayed in touch for a short time afterwards and wished each-other best of luck before falling out of touch.

It has been about a year, and I received an unexpected late-night phone call from one of them-- I thought it was weird especially because it was late, but I picked up since they were such nice folks to us. He started telling me how relieved he was I picked up, because he needed to talk to someone ""technical"" he could *trust*. After that it was all sorts of things about how is car was unlocking and locking itself, and how his his ex-partner had met a new man that was a ""hacker."" This man was putting malware on his flashdrives (which he figured out because it showed the ""darwin kernel"" etc)... he was completely letting loose his mind about stuff. Totally incoherent shit about bluetooth and other ""BMW car technologies he read about in forums."" He was sure since I was an engineer I could uncover this mystery if he just mailed me his flashdrives. The whole conversation started kinda normal like ""I'm having a hard time stuff"" and then just slow-rolled into full fucking too much LSD word-salad.

I tried to be as soothing as I could and talk him down from all the crazy stuff. He sounded like he was his heart was at like a jillion BPM or something. I spoke really slow and calm and tried to tell him I totally understood, and his electronics were not gonna be compromised etc... He calmed down a bit but I lost him after awhile. He started talking about how there was a squirrel and how ""it was getting closer, **wow**!!!"" Broke my god damn heart in half because I just have no idea what is going on on his side.

Just barely a year ago this dude was 100% here, lucid, and selling a nice (imo) starter home to me and my lady. I honestly just have no idea what to do here. I've never dealt with anything like this before. I have no idea how to get ahold of the gal he was dating at the time. I feel like I need to call someone who can help this guy but I have no idea where to start! Calling law-enforcement and saying a fuckered dude from Ohio is having a hard time is gonna get me laughed off the line at best. 

Is there any way to help this guy?? all I have is some kind of wal-mart trac-phone number and his email at this point. My Stomach is in a knot trying to figure out what to do. All I could get out of him as far as a location was a library in Ohio. Nothing else because he was too damn paranoid.

180,"There’s a lot to this but I’m going to try and condense it as much as I can. Over the summer I ended up being forced to leave my fraternity for underage drinking while on a trip with a few of the older brothers. The next week, me and my girlfriend at the time broke up. Although upset about both, they were both major hindrances to my life and it felt good to lose all that weight for once. 

Fast forward to last week I returned to school. I wanted nothing more but to swiftly disaffiliate from the fraternity completely (I need to hand off a fraternity item for it to be complete). Along with that, anything with my ex I wanted it to be in the past and not worry about it. Low and behold, I got a call last night from someone who asked me if I had “threatened to hurt” both my ex and another person who had caused me to disaffiliate. I was shocked. I had only brought it up to a small group and even then, I didn’t say anything threatening towards them. 

Tonight a resident hall director came and visited me in my new room with four new roommates, and asked me about what I had said. I opened with the fact that someone had previously told me. I also stated that I have no negativity towards either one, although upset about the situation, I would never escalate something especially Something in a threatening way. I gave him a few names of people to talk to that would vouch I never said anything like the sorts that I was around for the past few days. After this, he left and I went back to my business. 

After this, I texted two people to clarify any issues. I texted someone who was part of the initial group I told what happened, but he wasn’t present. He told the people that were in the group that I said something, which means he got information from somewhere. I only informed him that I did not in fact say anything of the sorts. The second person I texted was the person who was also apparently targeted in my comments. They received the text but never replied. I don’t think we are on good terms.

Overall I’m just worried about how this will affect my school life, any relationships I would be making in the future, and overall my safety. Everything that was said to me I know I did not say. When being asked about it they had no proof at all of anything, just accusations. It really upsets me that people are starting up drama when this year I needed to focus on doing better in school and improving myself. It sucks and I don’t know what to do moving forward, especially with many people now thinking I have threatened these two people, especially one being an ex girlfriend that did not end up in a great way. We have not talked since the break up and have no intention of talking.

My sibling, older by 3 years, is planning a trip. I have noticed that this sibling has no regards for the rules of my parents, always being in a stand-offish mood and taking off with or without permission. My parents have been outstandingly patient with her, letting her stay despite the fact that she's over 18 already. They only ask a few things from her, such as a 1 am curfew and helping out with chores.

I love her completely and want to be supportive, because she has always been supportive of me, but this is her plan. She stated how she is going to ask for permission, and if they say no, then she is going to start a fight so that she can take off anyways.

I'm usually on her side with things, but to me this sounds completely disrespectful and selfish, considering how kind and understanding my parents are.

197,"I bought the ink from Staples. The printer is an older model: Epson Artisan 800. The ink pads are ""at the end of their service life"". It won't do anything. It is effectively bricked. 

Epson support page explains in a nutshell that printers are supposed to break after a while and that I should just get a new one. Or I could pay a boatload of money to ship it to a service center and have the pads replaced. 

I stupidly threw away the receipt for the ink. I only unwrapped 2/6 cartridges. I kind of doubt they would give me store credit or a refund. 

Any tips on how to proceed? I've never had to muscle up a refund or discount from a retailer before. I'm thinking I should start with Epson and ask them if they could at least buy back the extra cartridges?

198,"Just a background about who I am. I'm a college student who lives away from home. I have a part time job that I do really well in (for a college kid). I take home enough to pay rent, feed myself, and go out a few times a week. I typically don't spend to much money day to day and have been doing things to cut my daily cost of living. Skateboarding to school to avoiding parking passes, meal prepping so I'm obligated to eat what I made rather than impulse buy food. And I've also been selling off some old electronics I had laying around. I can sustain myself being alive basically. I however need to pay tuition and other costs like medical costs and vehicle repairs. For that reason I take about 5500 in loans a year from the school and they give me about 4500 in my pocket AFTER tuition, so I end up with about 5G every semester. Again, this is to help with medical, vehicle, ect, and even to help me get time off during the holidays and what not. I however have picked up a bad hobby. I started playing airsoft at a local field. I spent 500 on a kit to get me started, it's about 35$ for admission when I go and I usually spend a few bucks on gas, I bring my own lunch to reduce cost but I find myself itching to get more and more kit. It's hard not to brows websites for hours on end looking for things I want and I ended up buying another 200$ worth of gear. I just feel really guilty about all of that spending. I take loans out and I'm using it for childish games. I have the most fun I've had in a long time but idk if it's worth the temptation. How do you Ballance fun and money?",27Aug2018,2

202,"Hi all,

So i really need some solid advice from my favourite people on the internet, i am currently 19 years old studying a diploma of engineering here in Australia. I know this is long and i am very sorry but this has been bottling up for a long time and i just need some help from everyone, i want everyones opinion no matter how weird or out of the ordinary, okay here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

So i come from a family who has never been to university as my grandmother came to australia to escape the nazi's, so she didnt really have much of an education and my mother dropped out in year ten due to lack of interest and surprise surprise i dropped out of school due to just hating it point blank. I found myself wanting an actual education as i didn't want to be classed as uneducated so after about 3 years of jumping from business to japanese studies and now finally to  engineering i find myself in a position that i don't really like. My degree is set to finish in the year 2024 and i will be 25 and i am very worried that it will be too late to graduate.

But here is where it gets tricky, for all of the australians here they will know of something called HECS it essentially means you can study anything as long as you don't go above $100,000 AUD now being the little shit i was when i was young i didn't care and thought id have my life all figured out but ther time i was 22 and way under that price... BOI i was wrong so it turned out that my degree will cost me $45,000 AUD and that goes over my hecs debt meaning i won't be able to complete my final year of university because ill have no money for HECS and barely any money at that period of time to spend on school fees.

In my stress i was looking up alternatives and remembered im part German (i can only speak at a B1 level but i am improving on that) and that education in Germany is free (relative) for German citizens and thought great, so i got in touch with my local consulate and they told me everything and i filled out a bunch of stuff and it turns out i am eligible but have no money....  So i was thinking of taking a year off to save as much money as i can, now to some people will say ""that sounds fine no reason to stress"" but my family really does not want me to take a break as they fear i just won't go back.. 

On top of all of this i currently have a girlfriend who i love dearly but i worry about what the transition from Australia to Germany will do, she speaks no german and shows very little interest in german and germany in a whole and i truly worry about that. 

I am so committed to learning the German language and moving to Germany and continuing my studying there and on top of that, i've been wanting to go since i was about 9 years old because ive heard all of the stories from my German cousins and family about how amazing Germany is, ive just put so much stress on myself as i don't know where to go and ive spoken to family members about this but they are strong believers on making your own choice and see how it turns out. So out of all of this i hope you guys can give me some advice on where to go and what to do because right now i am clueless.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Having trouble in life (who isnt)

\- No money to complete degree

\- Eligible for german citizenship

\- Want to take time off to save up money to move but family wont like that

\- Want to continue study in germany 

Thank you all for your time :)",27Aug2018,0

210,"Hi everyone! 


So I moved into this apartment back in December. Shortly after moving in I started noticing this crazy air compressor/heavy machinery like noise coming on at random times. At first I thought it was some kind of building issue, like pipes or a water heater but the longer I’ve lived here the more I’ve noticed that it’s definitely human controlled. There’s obvious human movement and activity that makes really distinct noises before the horrible sound comes on. Normally, I would just ignore it, but it’s so loud and powerful that it actually vibrates the floors of my apartment. I can hear it through headphones. I’ve tried really hard to ignore this issue as I don’t want to become that person who is an annoyance via complaints. It will run for HOURS as well. Often in the middle of he night. There is no distinct pattern or schedule for this noise. After 7ish months of listening to it, I decided to start documenting whenever the noise came on, noting time, volume, and whatever else I happened to notice. I took videos of the sound, tried knocking on doors of neighboring apartments and even the neighbor I suspected to see if we could just work it out like calm people before going to my landlord. No dice, not a single person answered their door. So I emailed my landlord with all of my notes and the video. They agreed that it was quite loud and disturbing and said they would look into it. They also said to continue notifying them whenever the noise comes back on. 

I did get responses from my landlord about 3 times after notifying them about the continuance of the noise but they have since stopped responding. They said that they were still investigating the issue. I don’t know what else to do and this noise is so loud an obnoxious that it’s both preventing me from sleeping as well as just making me insane in general. If it’s this much of an issue for me then I’m certain this is effecting others in the building as well. 

What are some steps I can take to make this stop? Who can I talk to next about this? It’s absolutely unreasonable, insane, and frankly pretty disturbing to have seemingly industrial equipment run for 5 hours at a time below me. ",27Aug2018,3

More recently I have been trying to view myself differently but have been putting off dating until I'm in a better place mentally. I want to get my own place (I live with my parents), a proper job, get in shape, quit porn, work through some mental issues and become more confident before I start dating. In other words, I want to be a completely different person - something I've been trying to do for years but never achieved.

Going by that evidence I will never achieve any of those things.

So I'm thinking I should just sign up to Tinder and Bumble and just try. In my mind I reject this idea and all these bad feelings and thoughts start to flow. For example; what if someone I know/used to know finds my Tinder profile and show other people and they're all laughing at my pathetic attempts to appear attractive? But maybe I should just try to push through all that shit and do it anyway? Maybe if just one person finds me attractive and wants to talk to me it would be enough to trigger positive changes in my fucked up brain.

216,"My dad died just recently last July at 48 years old. He was a great father to us, a good husband to my mom, a good public servant as he had been an active figure in politics in our area. Overall, genuinely a very nice guy. 

But he was human too... 2 years prior to his death he began to be act very weird. I was able to eavesdrop on him taking calls at odd hours in the morning/night at very odd places around our house (in the CR/garden etc). He speaks in a different way with this person... very soft, very flirty and sometimes very sensual. During that year I was able to confront him with it, he stopped taking the calls but we never talked about what happened. I always think about it but I never had the chance to ask again because I was afraid my mom and my siblings would get hurt discovering that my dad is cheating  on us with someone else. I didnt want to make an issue as it would also hurt his career as a politician. 

Fast forward to the present, when my dad died, the doctor gave me the things he was carrying with him when he died... including his phone. I found out on his inbox that the last text messages he received was from a man who texted various romantic messages which two adult men wouldnt normally send to each other unless they're dating. I deleted them immediately in fear that my mom would get hurt finding out that my dad cheated on her with another man. My dad's boyfriend has been leaving flowers and gifts on my dad's grave recently. Nobody questioned it because my dad's friends with everybody so it could be anyone. But then days ago, the same guy has left a letter detailing their relationship on his grave. I secretly took it away for the same reason that I deleted his messages to my dad. 

I'm really confused right now as to whether I should still feel angry about this and confront the guy (who is also married to a woman with a family) or should I let it go since my dad is dead anyway. But then if he wouldn't stop doing those things my mother would eventually know about it, and I know it would really break her heart. She's been struggling a lot with what happened and this certainly will not be easy for her. What should I do?


TLDR: I found out my dad is cheating on my mom with another man through his phone after he died and now his boyfriend is leaving letters detailing their relationship out in the open and my mom and other family members are yet to know about it unless they decide to pick them up and read them",27Aug2018,5
217,"A bit of a venting post requiring advice after a few minutes ago my father wanted to show me another conspirationist video featuring a song that goes by the title of something like ""NASA is faking it all"". Ugh

A bit of a background here, both about him and me.  
Him: grew up in the South of Italy, very little inclination for studying (you don't say?), so no finishing high school, no reading at all and avoiding books like plague, low-skilled job... So he was one of those (too many!) kids with no cultural stimuli whatsoever, deeply religious parents and family (nothing wrong with that and I say it from a non-believer perspective) who would believe in, uhm, unconventional stuff - miracles from people even discredited by the Church, superstition... you name it. Politically speaking, they would be like ""well, who cares who we are voting for - it's always *them* deciding"", although I'm obviously phrasing it in more contemporary terms. So yeah, afterall just a typical family from Naples, who would believe in what I've just mentioned, who would struggle to get to the end of the month and whose objective in life (at least, one of) was getting a house of their own and live comfortably enough to have a nice dinner and a glass of wine every day.

Of course, it isn't all that dark. My grandparents i.e. his parents are one of the greatest people I know, especially my grandfather; I won't start talking about how sweet, caring, compassionate, funny, loving and just amiable this man is. Everyone in the little town I come from knows him for this. He's the kind of man who would buy some bread or coffee for African migrants (who have quite a hard time here), dry food for all the dogs and cats that he finds on the street (he always has some of it kept on the side of his car) and generally he's so generous to the point that my grandma has limited his cash, because really it's not like they have a lot of money and he's really *too* kind.  Going OT a bit but I could go at length talking about thim.   
But the point is that my father, growing in such a family, would also grow up with some good values. He really cares about his family too, he's reserved but he always manage somehow to show us (me and my sibilings) how profoundly he cares.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's my turn. Though growing up in almost the same environment, I came out quite differently from him. As I child I would be shy, yet proactive and able to speak up when needed. I would read for many hours a day and generally be very curious. I was always the top student of my year and I am now going to attend the third year of the the best university in Italy and can speak fluently 3 foreign languages (although my English here might betray me a little eheh).  ""Yeah, okay, you came from a declined context yet you made it just like thousands of people before you have, clap clap"". 

Well, thanks. But it's not about bragging.  And now comes hopefully for you the focus of this outburst.  
I'm both extremely worried about him and also don't feel like having the slightest idea of how to handle the thing both emotionally and practically speaking. 

I'm *worried* because he believes in basically every conspiracy theory you could think of: 9/11, Earth being flat, no moon-landing, Earthquakes are controlled, New World Order and all that jazz. And of course he doesn't vote because, again, it wouldn't matter.  
It's absurd. I mean, if you wouldn't hear him pronouncing those things you could think that he was yes, an ignorant working-class man, but overall smart and good at some kind of reasoning (he's pretty good at mechanical stuff). And then... here it goes. I think he once told both me and my mother that his blood was alien-like or something like that. Yep. If I would only hear that from him I wouldn't wait 5 seconds to think he must have some mental problem; but I know he's capable of so much more, that I can't just jump to that conclusion so easily. But I really don't know what to think. Lately I've been thinking: what if this isn't ""just"" a sort of arrogant delirium that leads him to believie he's more witty and cunning than, well, the majority of people on the planet and even of the most brilliant minds (because I would say that conspiracy is all about this, ultimately; but I doubt he conceives it this way), what if... What if there's more underneath? I mean, he's now almost in his 50s, although I can remember crazy stuff going out of his mouth even when I was a kid - but now he seems to have gotten much worse (nonetheless there might be bias in this, given by my growing more aware of things; but of course the Internet has played a big role in his fall)... I mean, my grandpa (yep, the sweet grandpa) is 80 and was diagnosed with dementia a year ago. What if my dad will also end up like that? What if these are the signs? 

This was for the ""I'm extremely worried about him"" part. Now, here the progression to the ""how to handle this *emotionally*"" and ""how to handle this *practically*"" - both things I'm here asking advice for.

It goes without saying that on both sides I've been doing quite disastrously.

218,"My Dad and I are currently on a trip in Europe and we stopped in his home country to meet some relatives. We spent a day with my grandmother and his cousin, and had a chill time eating pizza and talking. After we hang out, he drops off my grandmother and his cousin at my grandmother's apartment, saying he needs to do some errands with me, and then we both take off in his car. He takes me to a big house in the country, about ten minutes away from my grandma's city, and we enter it and wait in the kitchen. He explains to me why he didn't bring my grandmother and his cousin along.

The house belongs to the man who killed my dad's father (who is my grandfather). This person is a relative - my dad's uncle, my grandmother's brother, and my dad's cousin's father. Both my grandmother and that cousin haven't spoken to this man in years, but my Dad has been meeting him behind the scenes because he is a Christian, forgiveness, etc. I knew before that my Dad kept in touch with this guy but I didn't think I would actually have to see him myself. I was pissed when he told me that because I didn't feel comfortable hanging out with the guy who killed my grandfather, and also because we were doing it behind my grandmother's and my dad's cousin's back. Double my anxiety when I saw on the table a long knife (my grandfather was killed by a knife in the neck) that laid between us all. 

Even though this guy has long since put that murder behind him and improved his life, I wouldn't be casually meeting the person who killed my grandfather if it were up to me. I'm so annoyed at my Dad for being obnoxious enough to think he is ""the glue of the family"". I guess it all depends on what you think of forgiveness and Christianity. Would you feel comfortable if you were me?

222,"So yeah. I'm 17. Uni starts in about a week. I'm staying up all night listening to music and most of the day to keep up appearances, with long naps here and there. The usual for me. 

I got in with some sort of open arts admission cause I got rejected for kinesiology and biomedical, my average was too low. ~87 in sciences and math, but since English 30 is included, my overall dropped to about 82.

Her and I were close friends throughout grade school and junior high, but sort of drifted apart during highschool. She's part of the popular crowd. Me, not so much. We're not on bad terms by any means, and occasionally text on snapchat for some time every few weeks. So here's the deal, I've liked her since I met her, but I never made a move, neither has she.

I asked if she wanted to hang out that day, she said yes, but hasn't really brought it up since, so I'm thinking it was one of those ""yeah! For sure!"" things that people say to keep you happy. I don't know if I'm supposed to like, make a plan and let her know, or what to do honestly. I've gotten close to people before, but never really been on a date. I'm also not sure if I want to put a 7 year friendship on the line. Here's the kicker. We're both follow the same religion, which prohibits things like dating and sex before marriage (or at least that's what my parents have been pushing). I'm not the most religious, but I honestly don't know if she is. She's super nice, definitely wouldn't turn down a friendly invitation, but I'm not sure if she'd be down for anything more. It's not that I've known her to be very religious, its that I have no basis to assume she not. That's the all of it. I'd love some advice on the whole situation honestly.

So on a more personal note, I have issues with my appearance. Throughout basically all of my life until 10th grade I've been a tubby kid. I've lost a lot of body fat, but it's definitely still there. A soft chest, and love handles. I run on the treadmill for about two hours three times a week, do pushups and pullups semi regularly and get out of the house as often as possible. I weigh 140 and am 5'8. Both of those numbers scare me a little. I want to eat healthy, but I really don't have the money to buy my own groceries and my family isn't the richest, so I wouldn't want to burden them with personal expenses. I've tried intermittent fasting, and it really does work, but I usually end up binge eating it back whenever my mom cooks a good dish. I can't really do much about my height, but would LOVE some advice about weight. Looks wise, I consider myself average on good days but my friend rates me at an 8-9. He's biased. 

My sleep schedule is abysmal and would love to fix it but I end up doing the same thing every night. YouTube for an hour, Instagram for an hour, and the remaining 4-6ish on Reddit. To me, nights are my personal time where I don't have to talk to anyone at all and can just do whatever I want. It's an escape, but leaves me exhausted all day. Any suggestions would help.

If you read this the whole way though, I love you. Please help me.",27Aug2018,1

224,"Long post alert. And I’m writing this on mobile so hopefully it turns out okay. TL; DR at bottom.

My cousin got engaged at the beginning of the year and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I accepted at once, I was and still am so excited for her. We were very close growing up and she was a bridesmaid at my wedding and organised me a super hen party.

She asked one of the other BMs to organise her hen do which I was quite relieved about - I’m not much of a party animal and this other lady seems to know her stuff. I offered my assistance should she need require it. The costs rose and rose on the weekend and I scrimped and saved but managed to get enough together so that I could go. I’m self-employed and usually I’m putting aside money for bills when I have quieter months, and if I’m honest if had been anyone else’s party but hers I would have had to bow out.

Flash forward nearly 8 months and following several events and circumstances I have found myself knocked sideways and struggling with depression and anxiety. The approaching hen weekend was working me up. The night before I had a breakdown and decided to get a good night’s sleep and make a decision in the morning, my parents and husband said they thought I shouldn’t go. The next day, though still worried, I decided to make myself go for my cousin’s sake. I was giving her a lift, as well as my mum, my aunt and another BM, to the house that had been organised for the weekend. Before hand I took her to one side and explained the basics of my situation, being honest and saying that I was not in a good place but I wanted to be there to celebrate her weekend with her, and if I needed to step out at any point I would of course do so without a fuss or announcement so I could collect myself. She told me she understood and that it was fine.

Being a bit introverted anyway, I found it a bit hard to integrate into her friends as they all knew each other so well. I felt like I was doing okay. A Butler in the Buff was the first major activity and it just didn’t sit well with me, but I felt okay sitting and watching everyone else until my mum tried to get me to go up and interact with him during a party game. I shook my head and once the attention was off me I went to the bathroom and cried on the phone to my husband for a few minutes, gathered myself and went back.

The next day was quiet until we had massages booked in the afternoon. The other hens had headed out with my cousin for a walk, and I felt so low that I kept quiet about joining them and a few minutes after they left I went out myself and walked into the nearby city centre and back, just in tears. On the way back I bumped into my mum and aunt who expressed they thought I should go home. I said again that I didn’t want to let my cousin down and I’d see how I’d feel after the massage. Got back to find a few of the hens had returned so I made myself sit with them and tried my best to join in the chat but felt so awkward and paranoid that I was bringing the happy atmosphere down.

The back massage went fine and then we went up to get ready for a night out before a cocktail making class. During the class I felt okay, a bit happier and really proud of myself for pushing on. Then just before we were due to go for a meal, I felt incredibly drunk, I think the cocktails hit me in one go, I’m a bit of a lightweight with alcohol as it is and had not eaten a lot either, which of course wouldn’t help. We got to the restaurant and I had one mouthful of my food and had to go to the toilets to be sick - again I was coherent enough to leave quietly to do this but I am sure my absence was noted. Following this I felt better but didn’t eat anything else. Another hen was completely drunk and fell asleep at the table. My mum decided we both needed to go home and called a taxi. I told her that I didn’t want to go and she reluctantly let me go back in while she and my aunt took the other hen back to the house. I vowed to stick to water for the rest of the night.

The rest of us went into a nightclub (my idea of hell but we had a booth booked). I sat down beside my cousin but she seemed to not want to speak to me, and then after a couple of minutes she got up and moved up the table. I felt really hurt but tried not to take it personally, trying to reason that it may be in my head. My mum and aunt returned after dropping the other hen back.
I then had to go to the toilets, but they were out of the back of the club. I walked across the dance floor feeling extremely vulnerable and anxious, having a few drunk men making a pass at me, and once I’d finished I headed outside to get some air. My husband rang me while outside and started telling me to go home, having just seen the messages I had sent him while drunk. We had an argument and following this I tried to get back into the club but the bouncer refused me, I’m assuming due to hearing our argument. I panicked a bit but before I could message my mum she came out of the club on the phone to my husband. I was so relieved but she turned and screamed at me to stay put until she called me a taxi, ignoring my protests that I hadn’t drunk anything else and that there had been a misunderstanding.

When we got back I tried calmly to explain what had happened but she shouted at me again. I went to my room and then stayed awake listening to her talking on the phone to my husband about how I had disgraced myself and that she didn’t know how to handle me.

In the morning I went downstairs to clean up the kitchen, lay the breakfast table and to take down the decorations in preparation for us leaving. The BM who organised the weekend came down and I took the opportunity to apologise to her that I had been flakey over the weekend. She said that she had been told that I was having a difficult time but I need to “lay off the alcohol” because I clearly can’t handle it and if I was to be put onto antidepressants then I would have to get used to the idea that I couldn’t have it. I shocked into silence, given that I am not a regular drinker at all, practically tee-total, and I had had no intention of getting drunk. I was mortified that perhaps I had given the impression that I often did that.

I apologised to my cousin when I finally got her alone a bit later and expressed that I hoped that her good time had not been affected, and though she said it was fine and she had really enjoyed herself and it hadn’t detracted from her weekend she seemed a little distant. After I dropped everyone home she quickly hugged me and said she’d text me later. She didn’t.

Obviously I am just saying it from my point of view, I asked my mum what had happened and her run of events were the same as mine, and she apologised for not handling the situation well, and not listening to what I had been trying to tell her before she called the taxi.

Do I tell my cousin I think it’s best I bow away from being a bridesmaid? She gets married in 2 months. I don’t want to risk being anxious or flaking out on one of the most important days of her life. I have already vowed that I will not touch any alcohol on her wedding day to ensure that I have no drink-induced problems, but should I go that one step further? It was never my intention to take any attention from my cousin’s hen party, I’m a very quiet and introverted person and I am mortified to think I may have tainted it for her.

TL;DR - I made myself go to my cousin’s hen weekend despite struggling with anxiety and depression, struggled all the way through, and was sent home early on a night out. Did I ruin her party and do I back out of my bridesmaid duties?",27Aug2018,5

226,"I am from Canada.

Long story short - We both don't get along. There has been many occasions where we get into verbal arguments on a variety of things. This is not a person you can reason with or have a normal conversation, she will threaten you by taking something as hostage - like my laptop - or threaten to call the police on me after any sort of argument. This is one of her famous tactics, she will bring in a third party and say absolutely anything to almost incriminate me for domestic violence or make it like I'm the instigator. Most of her text messages are just constant profanity, line after line. There has been times where I had to restrain or assault her so she doesn't destroy or damage something. If I were to hide my phone or wallet, she would go for another item. I don't know what to do, my parents stay neutral. I'm not in a position to move out yet, but, I'm contemplating on pressing charges. I'm in the process of building up evidence against her cause I know something will happen one day and I want to be prepared. I don't like to idea of having police involved or third-party guidance. Police isn't there to solve domestic problems. My sister always chants ""I'll show you soon"" or ""watch, I'm going to get you"".

228,"So long story short, I was in an 8 year relationship where I was having sex easy 4-10 times a week, she fell pregnant once which lead to a miscarriage then 2 years ago it ended. I recently found out that my ex just got pregnant from a guy she only had sex with just TWICE!! is this extreme coincidence or something more ? I was single for a year had a bunch of unprotected sex (I know not smart but no STI’s either so bullet dodged I guess) and in a 9month relationship which started in feb this year, she was on the pill until 3 months ago and we have sex even more than my last relationship and still no pregnancy. 

Let me just be clear I’m not actively trying to make someone pregnant but when your aces with these statistics is kinda worrying. I have been to the hospital where they had taken a sample of my sperm and I got a letter which more or less said ‘everything seems ok’... I dunno as much as I should feel relieved by that I think I’m gonna go back again as when my partner and I ARE ready I don’t want to be the one that holds us back.

I should also state my current partner has been pregnant twice before so there’s definitely nothing wrong with her.

229,"I have a really hard time trusting someone and opening up to someone. I notice that this is the reason why all of my relationships (incl. friendships) are quite superficial.

When I get too close to someone, I pull back and shut down. I got hurt so many times in the past when I trust someone, and I'm just so scared that it will happen again.

I didn't notice that I was doing this but turns out I am.

I've only had one friend who I truly trust with everything in my heart but we've stopped being friends years ago and I cannot reach out. I don't know where he is anymore.

I'm not a complete loss in friends making, I have friends, and I have a boyfriend but, I just can't trust them enough to tell them that I feel shit most of the time. And that I am losing myself and I want to break down everyday.

I'm scared of opening up because I don't want to be hurt.

I opened up to my boyfriend and he broke my trust a couple of months ago, and since then I haven't been able to trust him and just everything keeps going downhill.

I feel really lonely and alone in this. I don't know what to do. I have no one that I trust, and I'm going crazy. I just wish I have someone that I can trust, or that I have the ability to trust someone and to be able to handle it when they break my trust.

230," A bit of a venting post requiring advice after a few minutes ago my father wanted to show me another conspirationist video featuring a song that goes by the title of something like ""NASA is faking it all"". Ugh

A bit of a background here, both about him and me.  
Him: grew up in the South of Italy, very little inclination for studying (you don't say?), so no finishing high school, no reading at all and avoiding books like plague, low-skilled job... So he was one of those (too many!) kids with no cultural stimuli whatsoever, deeply religious parents and family (nothing wrong with that and I say it from a non-believer perspective) who would believe in, uhm, unconventional stuff - miracles from people even discredited by the Church, superstition... you name it. Politically speaking, they would be like ""well, who cares who we are voting for - it's always *them* deciding"", although I'm obviously phrasing it in more contemporary terms. So yeah, afterall just a typical family from Naples, who would believe in what I've just mentioned, who would struggle to get to the end of the month and whose objective in life (at least, one of) was getting a house of their own and live comfortably enough to have a nice dinner and a glass of wine every day.

Of course, it isn't all that dark. My grandparents i.e. his parents are one of the greatest people I know, especially my grandfather; I won't start talking about how sweet, caring, compassionate, funny, loving and just amiable this man is. Everyone in the little town I come from knows him for this. He's the kind of man who would buy some bread or coffee for African migrants (who have quite a hard time here), dry food for all the dogs and cats that he finds on the street (he always has some of it kept on the side of his car) and generally he's so generous to the point that my grandma has limited his cash, because really it's not like they have a lot of money and he's really *too* kind. Going OT a bit - I could go at length talking about thim - but the point is that my father, growing in such a family, would also grow up with some good values. He really cares about his family too, he's reserved but he always manage somehow to show us (me and my sibilings) how profoundly he cares.

​

Now it's my turn. Though growing up in almost the same environment, I came out quite differently from him. As I child I would be shy, yet proactive and able to speak up when needed. I would read for many hours a day and generally be very curious. I was always the top student of my year and I am now going to attend the third year of the the best university in Italy and can speak fluently 3 foreign languages (although my English here might betray me a little eheh). ""Yeah, okay, you came from a declined context yet you made it just like thousands of people before you have, clap clap"".

Well, thanks. But it's not about bragging. And now comes hopefully for you the focus of this outburst.  
I'm both extremely worried about him and also don't feel like having the slightest idea of how to handle the thing both emotionally and practically speaking.

I'm *worried* because he believes in basically every conspiracy theory you could ever think of: 9/11, Earth being flat, no moon-landing, Earthquakes are controlled, New World Order and all that jazz... And of course he doesn't vote because, again, it wouldn't matter.  
It's absurd. I mean, if you wouldn't hear him pronouncing those words you could believe him yes, an ignorant working-class man, but overall smart and good at some kind of reasoning (he's pretty good at mechanical stuff). And then... there he goes. I think he once told both me and my mother that his blood was alien-like or something like that. Yep. If I would only hear that from him I wouldn't wait 5 seconds to think he must have some mental problem; but I know he's capable of so much more, that I can't just jump to that conclusion so easily. But I really don't know what to think. Lately I've been thinking: what if this isn't ""just"" a sort of arrogant delirium that leads him to believe he's more witty and cunning than, well, the majority of people on the planet and even of the most brilliant minds (because I would say that conspiracy is all about this, ultimately; but I doubt he conceives his behaviour this way), which is something quite popular nowadays with the Internet etc. What if... What if there's more underneath? I mean, he's now almost in his 50s, although I can remember crazy stuff going out of his mouth even when I was a kid - but now he seems to have gotten much worse (nonetheless there might be bias in this, given by my growing more aware of things; but of course the Internet has played a big role in his fall)... I mean, my grandpa (yep, the sweet grandpa) is 80 and was diagnosed with dementia a year ago. What if my dad will also end up like that? What if these are the signs?

This was for the ""I'm extremely worried about him"" part. Now, here the progression to the ""how to handle this *emotionally*"" and ""how to handle this *practically*"" - both things I'm here asking advice for.

It goes without saying that on both sides I've been doing quite disastrously. Every time he comes to me and exhibits one of his spectacular findings, matured after a long and thorough *research on the Internet*, I encounter multiple feelings. Not in order: anger, despair, frustration, sense of absurdity, sadness. I have many times broke up in front of him because it was just all too absurd and sad too bear. I won't talk about why I experience this feelings, since I they are pretty easy to figure out with very little time or thought.  But then, one might ask, what about the rest of the family? Well, the rest is basically my mother and my older brother, since my lil sister is definetely too young to do be considered. I consider both of them to be quite smart, especially my brother. When such situations occur, my mother usually just rolls her eyes to my dad, speaks up a little (she's way more educated and bright than him and therefore, at least, won't shut up and won't believe that nonsense) and overall just tries to end the conversation ASAP, because from experience she knows she'll only be called out credulous (ha, the irony!), to which will likely follow a discussion. She doesn't seem to be worried about him (???), and I kind of get it because there are so many things already to worry about, so I think she just shrugs this crap off as some quirkiness of him that nonetheless makes her quite angry and a bit ashamed too. As far as my brother is concerned, we don't talk about it because, oh god, what could we ever say. We simply exchange texts about a new theory of him sometimes and that's all. I'm sure he's worried too, but we are so closed to each other (best friends like) that, paradoxically, we don't talk about it just like we don't talk about it with our friends (no need to be pitied by someone we know). 

Which is basically the reason why I'm asking for advice here: because I feel ashamed. Ashamed that I'm 20 and """"successful"""" and yet I found myself in such a weird and absurd situation, plus I have no idea how to approach it let alone fix it, and the only thing I can come up with is a post on a subreddit.   
Here is how I've ""managed"" and how I ""manage"" it: I haven't been talking to him for idk, 3 or 4 years (not because of this specifically, it was something else; but in retrospect it still had to do with his utter arrogance and ignorance), I have resumed talking to him as of recent and now I just try not to think about it, almost dismissing the whole thing, just like my mother, as little whimsies of him in my mind - still being aware of how worrying it is. So aware that in conversation I try to ""slalom"" through all the topics that might trigger the revelation of one of his many silly beliefs.... At least, this makes me lay in a bit of comfort thinking that he might have change his mind on stuff (ha! Only for a second really). And, of course, there's no way I could talk him out of this mindset. Again, it's something you might easily figure out the reason why.

&amp;#x200B;

After all these too many words (sorryyyy), I feel a tad better but only because I'm sort of relapsing back to that state of *not really thinking about it,* which is what we tend to do with uncomfortable thoughts but which... don't really help in getting around the problem, as this post proves sufficiently.

  
I'm really really sorry for the length (and tediousness!) of this, I know it doesn't really suit the appetite of the average internet user - I myself would have probably skipped it. Still, for those of you who will read this and even spend a few words trying to help me out, I'm very grateful and I wish you all a good day.

  
Trying to getting to a point and also **TL;DR:**

My father believes in conspiracy theories and I'm very worried for him for this reason. Also, I grew up very differently from him and so it's hard for me to feel close to him, and such beliefs only seem to make the distance between us ever larger. Ultimately, I fear my relationship with him could suffer even more from this.

232,"So for a very long time I've been dealing with crippling anxiety. By the way I am a twenty six year old male. My anxiety runs very deep in just about anything I've ever done. Its always self doubt and self hate. It gets in the way of me playing video games, girls, friends, and also my job. My manager has told me that I move with extreme hesitation over everything.

I have tried taking medication and that is almost always a bad idea. the medications I've been on has always turned me into a zombie. I reached my breaking point a few days ago when I was at a friends house and there were a lot of people there. Okay there was like eight people there but it was a crowd for me. The anxiety was horrible and everyone treated me badly for not trying to be a friend with them or having the same interest as them. 

I needed something to change so I tried taking CBD. It's been a few days and I've noticed a few big changes in my mood and personality. The voice that is always saying all the evil shit in my head is now very quiet. I'm now a little better at trying to talk to people and overall being in control of myself. 

But the biggest change I noticed is with my choices of entertainment. Usually my brain will pick something and just stay with that thing no matter what. Take for example Battlefront 2 for a video game. I have all these other games I got so i can play with my friends and I could never get myself to play those games. It was always battlefront 2, Everything else took hard work to get me to play them. Today, I booted up Battlefront 2 and then said to myself. ""Why the hell am I playing this again. I got all these other games! I'm gonna try Fortnite!"" and not only did it not take that much effort to switch to another game I had fun to. I enjoyed it. Also, today I'm now watching My Hero Academia! where as before i tried CBD. I would have never have tried to watch that show and now I am. My music playlist are all very old to. BBBBBut now I'm trying to find new music. 

So I guess what I'm trying to ask is... why? Why was I having such a hard time trying other things that other people liked? Why am I trying to find and do new things? Why am I going from introvert to extrovert? And now the bigger question. Should I try and talk to all my friends about all these changes?",27Aug2018,3

I'm just extremely depressed and have now direction in my life of where to go, I go to college but I have no clue if it's right for me, this semester I just feel like giving up with it already and just saying screw it. I do get my college all paid for because of my disabilities but I just don't see even any use in college, I'm just completely misreable with my life. I have no idea where I want to go or do with my life. I do live my with my parents still but it is really rough. I don't get along with them that well, mostly because I'm always agitated all the time from my sensitivity. My parents usually only trigger it which I'm still trying to understand and figure out how, I think they just mostly want me to move out of the house because they see other parents kids being successful. It makes me feel like a burden obviously but then they try pushing me to do things that make me extremely uncomfortable, they don't have any patience for me anymore I guess. They helicoptered as a child a lot and I guess they think I need to ""grow up"" and act like a ""normal adult"". I really wish I could move out but I worry if it came down to that I'd have no motivation at all and lose my job or become homeless. I'm just hoping one day I can move out and live with someone I love/charish. I don't know how to get to that point because I feel I'd never make enough money with no college for being able to afford that.

So I finally got out of my comfort zone and asked a guy out.  He finally answered me a few days later.  He actually said yes and he said he was 'gonna hold you to it'...then the next day, we made plans on where and what we are doing there.  We didn't set a date.  He told me he will let me know when.

That was 6 days ago.  He hasn't talked to me since.  Is he serious or just playing me?  Am I being unreasonable to expect anything more like a 'hi' at least?

243,"My husband grew his hair long several years ago to see if he could find a style he liked (his hair is extremely curly). He was wearing it in ponytails for a long time before he asked me to show him what a braid would look like. Fast forward three years later and I am now responsible for braiding his hair every day. Sometimes this makes me juggle my morning tasks/run a few minutes late to make sure it gets done. Often it’s just that I can’t go walk the dogs early in the morning so I can make sure he can be ready on time. Every time I broach the subject that he should figure it out/find another style, he gets upset and says he gives me the world, why can’t I do this for him? He has almost always been the breadwinner in the family and I have evolved to be more stay-at-home, but usually with a part time job. I cook him breakfast lunch and dinner, do his laundry, take care of the dogs, etc. We are starting a business that relies on my skills and we plan on starting a family in the next year.

246,"Recently an old friend, someone who was for many years was the best friend I had in the world, took his own life. We had a big falling out (over a woman. Stupidest mistake him and I ever made. Both admitted to that but never to each other. DONT FIGHT OVER A LOVE INTEREST KIDS. BE CIVIL)  to the point where we hadn’t spoken in almost 10 years. 

It’s been over a month since it happened, said my goodbyes, saw his family. Cried. Got angry cried some more. Tried to eat my weight in tacos. Cried even more. Listened to a bunch of emo songs from our teen years. Ate more tacos. Its getting easier every day to swallow the pill that he’s gone and I’ll never tell him that I still loved him and that he was a brother to me. Through and through. 

My loving darling wife is doing her best to try and help while letting me grieve however I need to. But whenever she has given advice to me it’s been very harsh and rash. I’m only assuming she’s trying the tough love approach now as I can only guess she’s just wants to see me be my normal self soon.  I’ve tried telling her not to worry and I’ll find myself but I just feel I need to do it alone. She didn’t understand the dynamic him and I had.  Or what had transpired through our fight and why it hurts so much more knowing I never got to tell him I was sorry. 

I guess I just don’t know how else to tell her without ruffling feathers. I know she’s trying but I feel as if I just need to go this journey alone. For now at least. 

No I am not grieving or hurt to the point of doing it myself. Like my wife put it, “Don’t be the Chester to his Chris Cornell”

248,"Alright so I am 30, getting married in February. My older sister is 33, and has been freaking out ever since I got engaged. She has always thought one of my friends is cute, but there's never been anything there beyond maybe some mild flirtation - this is over a period of like 10 years at this point. They have never been on a date, and there's never been any real indication of interest from my friend towards my sister that I'm aware of. Despite that, my sister decided that during the wedding process with engagement parties and all of that, she and my friend would end up together. In June, my friend started dating a new girl who is one of my fiance's close friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she is furious with me, even though I told her (truthfully) that we didn't set them up. I told her she has no right to claim some ownership of him because they have never dated. We have a Labor Day weekend get together and my sister and my friend (plus his new girlfriend) are all supposed to be there. Now she is telling me I need to tell him he can't stay at the house with us because it will make her upset. To be clear, this is the house I share with my fiance, and the new girlfriend is one of her best friends too. I tried talking to our parents to see if they would talk to her about how she's acting, and they immediately took her side. Am I wrong on this? Do I really need to be shitty to one of my best friends just because he's dating someone else while my sister has a crush on him? He's dated girls before and she has never really cared. This may seem silly, but it's now been a consistent issue for about two months, and has caused fighting with my sister and parents all against me the whole time.

I really think she's just freaking out about me getting married while she is single and hasn't ever really dated anybody, and acting out.

249,"The neighborhood kids where I live tend to invite themselves over to my place to play around. It all started last year when they were looking for menial tasks around the yard, such as raking leaves. 

Recently, I have given up with giving these kids tasks because the leaves aren’t near as bad as they were a year ago, so they want to mow the yard for us (loosely including my roommate’s). They don’t have a mower of their own, and want to use mine, but I don’t feel like kids and lawnmowers are the greatest combination. 

Last weekend, one of the neighbor kids just randomly wheeled into my garage on his bicycle while I was grilling food to get out of the rain. He just says to me “yea man, I just need to get out of the rain”. I asked him where he lives and he gives me a description that I know isn’t even a far bicycle ride, because I apparently cross this area during my morning runs. 

I ultimately didn’t care that much at the time that I he just randomly invited himself into my garage area, but looking back now I probably opened the door to more of what he’s doing unless I nip it in the bud. 

Saturday afternoon, I was grilling steaks for my two roommates, and I had was coming in and out of the house to clean plates, etc. the steaks eventually were finished grilling, and I put them on a plate, I was then making room for the side dish to cook on the grill. I made the mistake of leaving the food out in plain sight. 

That was a mistake (missed-steak?) because when I came back to the grill, one was gone. This really threw me into a reality check, because I thought I had gone mad. Nope, the steak was stolen, on Sunday that was admitted to me by the same kid who invite themselves over. The kid who stole it didn’t even provide an apology when he admitted it, he just says “*expletive* you make some good food!” 

I’ve never seen his parents a day in my life, and I had to inform him that stealing is wrong. Still, he didn’t give an apology. The kid and his brother soon saw all the stuff in our garage and started playing with everything. He first grabbed my golf club and started swinging it, then instead of putting it back in the bag, where he got it out of, he drops in on the ground. 

The same kids knocked over my guitar, albeit this was more accidental than anything. Then they started grabbing fishing poles out, and started playing in my kayak, which was more of the same disregard that they displayed with my golf clubs. These poles were also really expensive, and there’s damage as a result of their playtime. The same is true for my kayak, the seat got bent because one of the kids sat on it improperly. 

The part where I drew the line was when one of them picked up my compound bow. I told them that they had to leave because “ugh, I got guests coming!” Yes, they even asked for a reason, almost as if they were going to disregard the request if it wasn’t a valid reason. 

I’m being a total pushover about this, and I wish I wasn’t, because I don’t appreciate what these kids have done, and I don’t want it to continue for the entire year. I just don’t have the heart to say anything to these kids. 

Yea, this house is a rental, but I must have the authority to remove unwanted people from the premises. I surely have the right to some privacy. So what do I need to do to ensure that these kids won’t be back after what I experienced?

261,"Hi. This is obviously an Alt. Let me give some back story on this first.

I'm almost 18 and will be finishing whatever you call the last year of school before going to university (it varies from country to country). I've always been kinda introverted and never had many friends and for the past couple of years, (since around 2012) I haven't really had any really close friends.  

With that said at the start of this year, one of my friends started dating a girl from my friend group who I really hadn't spoken with much before and then just by complete coincidence me and her ended up in every class (except 1) together. Over the course of this year she and I have become really good friends and we have an almost scary amount of things in common.  I feel like this is the first time since I was younger that I've had a really close friend that cared about me as much as I care about them.  

I know that there is no reason that our friendship would just stop existing, given current circumstances that would be legitimately difficult to achieve but the last few weeks I have just been randomly stressed that maybe it would happen. Speaking face to face is fine and always relieves the stress but simple things like initiating a conversation through messenger, snapchat etc. or thinking about our past conversations I just can't do.  

My entire life I have never really had any stress or mental health issues of any kind, and it's taken me about 7 hours just to draft this post because I couldn't work out what exactly I was looking for advice about.

Not sure when she will be released but I am getting on a flight in 12 hours and have no clue what to do. I know that this is a sensitive topic and I'd rather not trouble her with my concerns because she's obviously dealing with a lot right now. Normally I wouldn't be so worried but this is a pretty extensive trip that had us moving every other day, involved multiple flights, ferries, and renting a car.

I really dont know what I should do because originally I just wanted to go to greece but she loved turkey and I've wanted to go and thought going with her would be the perfect time and since she was an expert (been many times) I left a lot of planning to her. She also booked half the hotels and the ferries and I called them and basically it needs to be changed to my name if I want to be able to check in (even if everything is paid or I offer to pay, both were adamant it has to be in my name). I'm not sure that she can do that where she is or provide me the info. I basically have to wait for her to send me the information if she can.

At this point I feel like i dont have the time to redo the itinerary so worst case scenario I try to follow it best I can. Problems arise with the hotels/ferries/car rental. She booked the hotel for day 2 so I dont even have much time to sort out not to mention the money involved. I'm essentially flying there and have one night then have no clue what to do. The car she rented was manual and I dont really know the details about it she just said she booked it. Also a lot of our trip was drive to x y z. She said I can do everything by bus but not sure how that would work given the tight time frame and I know nothing about schedules., prices, tickets etc.

I care a lot about her and dont wanna come off as uncaring but at the same time I dont know what to do because I invested a lot of money into it already. I just feel so lost and I have no clue what im doing (if nothing was booked I'd be more ok with doing a see as I go but were talking upwards of 1k in reservations/bookings).

For the last 3 years or so I’ve been renting a house my parents own which is next to their house. They’ve been on and off about selling their house and the one I live in for over a year. One day they’ll say they’re going to sell then they tell me they changed their mind, then they tell me I’ve got 2 months to find a place and they’re going to list the house after that, then they change their mind again and tell me they decided to keep their place after all. This came up again a few days ago and they basically made it seem like my wife and I are preventing them from moving or we’re taking too long to figure it out but I feel like that’s really unfair when they keep flip flopping on whether I actually need to or not. Moving is a big ordeal and it seems like a dumb move to pack up and try to find a new place to live when I might not need to. My wife recently finished school and we’re waiting to see where she gets a job because that is a big factor on where we live. That’s another reason we haven’t already moved because we might move and then she gets a job somewhere else and we have to move again. 

Anyway, I’ve been looking for a place the last week or so and I can’t find anything. I’ve looked before and it always seems to be the same story. Everywhere I look is too small, too expensive, too far from my job (I already drive 400+ miles a week for work and I don’t want to do more if I can avoid it) or doesn’t take pets and I can’t imagine parting with my dog. I feel pretty upset about my parents insinuating that I’m stopping them from moving cause it’s not as if I don’t want to at this point. I do want to move cause I’m a bit tired of my parents shit, but it’s really hard to find a place that fits my needs and I feel like they’re forcing me out before I’m ready to leave. I feel annoyed and honestly hurt by all of this. I feel like I’ve always been a good kid to them (never got into trouble, steady job since 16, no debt ect...) but they always seem to be punishing me for no apparent reason. They’ve always been overly nosey and barely give me and my wife any privacy and lately they’ve been acting like I’m the reason they haven’t moved as I said earlier. I know for a fact that I’m not the problem because they’ve repeatedly stated that they had things they wanted to do to their house before they sell it and again, they change their minds about it every month it seems like. This is sort of off subject but part of me feels like they want me out so they can let my brother (who is a single dad with 2 kids) live in my house, because my parents constantly watch his kids and it’d probably be easier for them to do that if he lived next door. I think this because they keep saying their going to move and then not doing it, making me think they’re trying to fake me out so I move and then they change their mind again. 

I know it seems like I hate my parents or something but I don’t. I love them both very much and that’s part of why this bothers me so much. They MUST know how hard it is to do all this and yet they’re forcing me to do it and not offering me any help as of yet. I know  this is a lot and it’s honestly fine if no one responds but I needed to vent. However, If anyone has some tips on how to find a place to rent or any ideas on what I should do I’d appreciate it. Otherwise, I hope you at least got a chuckle out of reading about my problems lol.",27Aug2018,1

284,"I recently started working at a graphic design company and it’s only been a month, but I think I’m pretty good at my job. Not because I think I’m better at designing stuff than everyone else, but because I have a fairly good work ethic. I love what I do, and even though it doesn’t feel like I’m working hard, I usually get a lot more done a lot quicker than some of the other employees. I’m highly critical of my own work and I’m constantly trying to improve my designs and illustrations. My boss has noticed this and I think appreciates my work. He has gradually been assigning more work with shorter deadlines, but without putting too much  pressure on me. 

Some of the more relaxed employees in the office don’t seem to care about the work as much, and seem to be there because they need the money (this doesn’t bother me, different people have different motivations and goals, i understand that). This became a problem for me when I had to work with them on a project. I was assigned a slightly time sensitive project in which I had to depend on one of the more chilled out employees for help. This was excruciating painful for me as the guy spent most of his time on tea breaks and office banter. I kept calling him to work but he didn’t take me seriously at all. He didn’t take the project seriously until the boss finally came around to see how it was coming along. And even after that, he didn’t take a lot of my input seriously. I had to tell the boss that we wouldn’t be able to complete the project in time, even though we had been given plenty of time to work on it. It felt shitty, and I think we could have done a much better job if he had just taken my input more seriously. 

I think my age and gender (22F) combined with the fact that he’s been working here longer played a part in him being quite dismissive towards me. I feel like I need to change some aspect of my behaviour to command a little more respect from my coworkers, but I don’t know how. Help.

286,"So I am 17 and have this recurring problem of waves of depression. They have all been different though, starting as just mildly being upset with my performance in school and getting progressively worse. This has been on and off for a little over a year but only really got ""serious"" when my head teacher called my mom and said she was worried about how my attitude changed. Since that I have been to counseling which helped out a lot, but now I feel like I am back where I started and I blame everything on myself. I hated putting in hours at school just to get shitty results (I am just finished school now) I am about to start college and I'm terrified because I worry about everything and I'm not sure why. It might not be worrying about an actual thing but worrying I might fuck something up. I came to my school with no friends and made about 10. I'm done now and I have 3 and I don't mean like those ""I have 3 friends"" memes. I literally have 2 friends that I talk to a fair amount, and one friend that I am closer to than anyone. I had a really strong friendship with a girl who lives about 2 hours from me which was non sexual for the most part, we don't talk anymore and even though I have been told by her other friends and even recognize myself that it is her fault, I still worry about how I possibly did something. I feel like I push people away. That is a big part of it. If someone doesn't reply to my snapchat, my brain instantly goes to ""you did/said something wrong"". I notice myself thinking like this with every person and every situation lately and I don't know why. This isn't like my depressive episodes before where I knew I was sad but didn't know why, It's different. Right now my two fears are starting college (I am going in about 2 weeks) and losing my best friend. Like I said I have 3 people that I hang with and talk with, I have lost the rest, (mostly their fault but I find a way to think it's mine) The 2 I talk to now and again don't worry me because I know they are casual talking and video game friends, but the third one is my best friend in this world. He is a guy who I looked up to since I met him. It literally feel extraordinary to be such good friends with him. He has one more year of school left so I can't see him during the week anymore. I know there isn't a problem between us because literally 2 days ago I made kind of a scrapbook with pictures and memories to give to him at the end of Summer, He said he really liked it and it made him cry. We just hugged and went home and everything was fantastic. But yet somehow I feel like a burden always and worry about how I treat him and if I'm ever clingy or annoying. I don't want to worry about everything and the worst part is that usually there's nothing to worry about. But I'm just writing this to see what replies I get because I know if I drop out of college or lose this friend then I will become worse than ever and I don't want that to happen. My hopes of studying Psychology at college and this friend who might as well be my brother are the two things that I smile upon when I am at the worst part of these worry phases.",27Aug2018,1
287,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 17 year old male, and I am in need of quite a bit of help.

In the past several months, my life has gone from not-so-great to absolute hell.

To begin, I returned from a long stint in a rehab facility on May 19, 2018. My family consists of my mother, my stepfather, my biological sister, and my stepsister. My father committed suicide on September 28, 2014, when I was 13. I was the one to find his body and it scarred me. I am not using this as an excuse; I am saying this because it might give a little bit of a backstory. My mother remarried to my stepfather on February 24, 2016 after dating for exactly one year. 

I have been in a shaky mental state for the past year. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, along with Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). I was also diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum back in December. For my entire life, I had always been odd and my family members knew that something was up. It just wasn't confirmed until December 2017.

Anyway, my continued presence in our household is tearing our family apart. I just keep breaking the same rules in my household over and over again. I am a pathological liar and an expert manipulator (just like my late father and my grandmother before him), which, combined with my consistent bad decision making (stealing their car, taking my mom's money/debit card, using technology when I'm not supposed to), has resulted in my family having absolutely zero trust in me. In fact, if there was such a thing as NEGATIVE trust, I'm sure that'd describe how little they trust and believe in me. I am mentally unstable and I frequently have outbursts and do things entirely on impulse that result in me getting into MORE trouble. I have no self-esteem or self-confidence. There are times when I feel as if I were better off dead but I never follow through with those thoughts as I would never put my family through that again.

The unfortunate thing is, I see my mom crying and literally breaking down because of the unimaginable stress I put on her from my frequent attempts at running away and breaking the rules more, but I don't feel an ounce of guilt. I can fake it (believe me, I am EXCELLENT at faking remorse at this point), but whenever I hurt someone to any degree, I just feel like ""...um, okay."" Like if you look up Saitama from One Punch Man doing that ""ok"" face, THAT would be me whenever I hurt someone and am destroying their sanity. It is things like this that lead me to believe that I am becoming a sociopath.  I am always getting into verbal fights with my stepfather. He scares the HELL out of me and there are times when I am afraid of coming home due to being scrutinized by him. He never actually physically hurts me, but has frequently expressed that he WANTS to hit me because of the amount of psychological torment I put my mom through.

...And I feel nothing. No remorse. No guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

I once had a girlfriend. We met on Instagram approximately 10 months ago and we have had MANY shaky times, but eventually, we fixed the rifts between us and she actually flew down to where I live to spend the night at my place about a month ago (we had not met in person up until this point). I was home alone, and she came down, and we had an amazing time. She thought that she wouldn't like it, but she ended up loving every moment with me, and we actually kissed each other. It was incredible.

However, because my parents found out (they ALWAYS find out), I got into a lot of trouble while she pretty much got off scot-free. I ended up sneaking phones and doing anything possible to keep talking to her, which ended up getting me into more and more trouble and she realized that her being in my life was causing me nothing but trouble and she felt it was best if we break contact. This only increased when I ran away twice. It was clear at that point that I was mentally unstable and that I needed help. She said she still loved me and cared about me but I need to work on myself before I can give any consideration to her.

My mental state continued to deteriorate due to the increasingly bad situation at home. Eventually, I thought it would be a good idea to fly up to her place and try to make amends with her. I swiped my mom's credit card late Friday night and booked a flight up to where she lived. I got there, and was too scared to knock on her door. So I waited on the curb near her house. Eventually, she came out to check the mail, and she saw me. She yelled across the street to me, ""WHAT the HELL are you DOING here?!""

I tried to explain myself but it was clear that nothing I said would have made a difference. Mind you, HER family doesn't like me as well, so she said that I would be DEAD once her mom got home. (She's 18, by the way.) She said that this was easily the stupidest thing that I have ever done, and got my mom on the phone. I talked to my mom to no avail, and my now ex-girlfriend actually called the POLICE on me because I was an unwanted guest on her property. My mom agreed.

The police were very kind to me, and it was at that point I broke down in tears because my little ""idea"" just backfired on me like 250%. I was escorted back to the airport in a police cruiser and was subsequently booked on the next flight home. I got home, and my family was beside themselves. They didn't know what to do. I don't even want to get into details. 

But, as I found out, my now ex-girlfriend is going to put a RESTRAINING ORDER on me. I am absolutely shattered. I don't blame her; I was essentially stalking her, but I didn't MEAN to do it. I was trying to visit her to make amends and go to a place where I thought somebody cared about me.

So, here I am, on a Monday morning, 2 days after this event. My parents are beside themselves, I am about to get a restraining order slapped on my ass by the girl I love, and it is clear that I need serious help. My parents are trying to find me a residential place that specializes in people with behavioral issues on the autism spectrum, but I don't know where and when I'm going, if at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Please... I'm in despair. I don't know where the hell I went wrong and now it seems that everyone I cared about is now turning their backs on me... I need advice or help or SOMEthing.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",27Aug2018,1

291,"Hey everyone, I was hoping some of you could help guide me to a decision about what I should major in/career I should pursue. 

I just started my senior year of high school and I’m applying to a few colleges. My top 2 choices are Indiana University and DePaul. Most of my life I wanted to become a doctor, but recently decided that 8-10 years of school wasn’t worth it to me. Since then, I’ve mainly been considering a degree in Informatics and Computing or a degree in Business. I would have never known about Informatics until my mom brought it up to me a couple years ago. She told me that she thinks I would be good in that field (I have a fairly analytical mind). One of my sisters is a junior at IU right now and she is in that field and also thinks I’d be good at it. I really don’t know what a career with an Informatics degree would consist of (don’t know much about Informatics at all). However, I still think that major would be a good fit for me. I think majoring in Business would be great as well though. I’ve been an excellent student my whole life (GT program in elementary school, lots of Honors/GT/AP courses/ and always a 4.0+ GPA) so I don’t think either would be particularly difficult for me. One thing about myself that I think would give me an edge in the business field (although not drastically) is my size and presence: I’m 6’2 and 225 lbs of mostly muscle. I know that doesn’t matter that much but I have read before that larger men are more intimidating/ better at closing deals etc.

292,"I also posted this to r/dogs. I'm just looking for some opinions. We think the answer is yes. But we're well aware the responsibility of a puppy and I'd like to sound off my concern and get some opinions. We're both overthinkers. We have our names in for a pup and we're just waiting on a call back from his foster to see if he's the right fit! It's exciting but I had a normal pang of doubt. 

My husband will be starting a new job about a half hour away in two weeks. He'll have to work in office for a bit more than his last job but will be able to work from home often once he settles in. I'm not working right now, and my only responsibility right now are some online part-time classes, so I'm home basically all the time. 

We have one dog right now, she's around a year and a half and we've had her about 9 months. She's a great dog, fairly high energy and does well with basic commands and recall. The things we're still working on are jumping on guests (she's really good with us, it's the guests who like when she gets riled up and like the jumping that we're working on...), she's come really far with pulling on the leash. She still grabs tissues that I'll carelessly leave out but our diligence is going to increase tenfold if we bring a puppy in. She cycles between being cool with car rides and panting/shaking during them, so I'm a little worried if we do get this puppy, that her anxious energy might pass on to the pup and give him a rough start to cars. We still haven't figured out the pattern of what makes her anxious in the car, but some days she'll just lay down in the back and be completely chill, maybe hang out the window a bit, others she'll shake like a leaf and won't stop nervously panting until we're out. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have a 10 day trip coming up in late April/early May next year. We've never left our dog overnight before so we were planning on a long weekend away before then to prepare her for it. I'm not sure what age is best to leave a puppy but he'll be 8 or 9 months by the time that trip comes. We haven't decided if we're going to board her somewhere or have someone stay at our house.

I can't imagine doing this job the rest of my life. Whats the point of starting and providing for a family if I come home unhappy? Unfortunately, every time I think about quitting, moving to where I want to live, and searching for new employment that I might actually enjoy- I become crippled with anxiety and indecision over whether or not I'm making a mistake and if I'll ever find a job of the same caliber. I begin to think about the times my parents were growing up and how drastically everything has changed, and how much more difficult it is to get by in this world, and its only getting more competitive. I worry about being a provider and I think about the issues that can be avoided/mitigated with having money or ""means"". I don't desire any sort of luxurious lifestyle at all, but I find incredible value in things like not having to worry about bills or how much my groceries used to cost, and eventually owning a house one day.

She is a single child and lives only with her mother, her dad isn’t in the picture.

She sometimes gets in huge fights with her mother and sleeps at her aunts house, who lives a few minutes away. I was always uneasy about this.

In the past I've copped the same denim jacket as her because she said it's fine. She also introduced me and the friends to a swimwear brand and as well made me discover some cool brands i didnt pay attention to before. Anyways, now to the point. A while back she confronted me of copying her and her style, which I of course felt bad about but acknowledged. HOWEVER - she has these sneakers that I've been craving for almost the whole summer since she got them and with some digging I found that these sneakers have a newer design that will hit the european sites soon hopefully. But I remember when she got these sneakers she EXPLICITLY told me to NOT get the same ones. Which I understand I guess but the new design looks, well - a bit different from hers.

SO, am I ""allowed"" to get the shoes? I'm way too scared to ask her because I don't wanna make her mad but so far everyone has told me to just buy them if I want them. I just hate how much of a copycat I can be but in my defense these shoes are trendy these days. (Fila disruptors btw).

Last year, her son tragically passed away and she came to stay with me for the mourning and memorial for about 3 weeks, which was a bit long, but what you do for friends in a horrible situation.  This past April, she wanted to come out and see her two remaining children for 2 weeks.  We were on a vacation for some of the time, so it worked out fine, as she housesit for us while we were gone.

However - this fall, she wants to come out for 4 weeks to visit her kids, etc.  We will be out of town for one week so that is a nice trade, so she can watch the pets, etc.  However - the other three weeks seems a bit long.

Details - she will be here for the 1 yr anniversary of her son's passing, she is an alcoholic, her one grown child has a spare room in her house, but has not offered it to her own mom. The son still lives with friends ex-husband at home. When my friend is here, she goes to lunch and stuff with her kids, and they come hang out over here, but that's it.

300,"My wife and I have been talking about buying some rental property in order to provide ourselves with some passive income.

Separately, my wife's sister who previously lived a few states away is moving nearby next month.  Money is tight for her because she's still paying for an apartment where she used to live, and she's having trouble finding a decent apartment here she can afford.  I made an offhand suggestion the other day that she just look for a house to buy, because she could probably get one cheaper than she could rent an apartment.  My wife pointed out that she doesn't have a down payment saved, and doesn't have good credit, so that's probably not an option.

And then my wife says ""What if we bought a house and rented it to her?""  I kind of brushed the idea off, but my wife seems semi-serious about it.

I did some back of the envelope math quickly and we could definitely afford to buy a small starter house, and could rent it to the SIL for less than nearby apartments are going for and still have enough coming in per month to cover the mortgage, insurance, and taxes plus some extra money to save for maintenance.

It just seems like a terrible idea to me though.  Her sister isn't too great with money, and I can imagine a situation where she mishandles her money, and we're forced with the decision to either evict her (likely ruining their relationship in the process) or let her live rent free and just eat the losses.

make 1500 a month at 40hrs a week for an office job that is extremely micromanaged with room for growth and bonuses based on job performance (not sales) ..it’s a more professional option with better opportunities but extreme responsibilities filling/sending prescriptions for pets/people, helping customers in a call center atmosphere, ect. calls are graded every week. I also would have to pay 180 for the license by sept 21st but i’m extremely tight on money atm. it’s also something i’m not 100% comfortable i can do my best work in because i’ve never done something like it.. but overall a great company.

or

make 2500 a month at 75hrs a week for bitch work (super laid back) cafe position and my current full time job (been there 9 years also laidback and free health benefits, not great but FREE) and possibly my other side job which would add another 200$ plus tips at all three jobs...i know it’s a lot of hours (i’ve worked maximum 60 in the past) but im extremely comfortable with both and can make bank..These positions would be temporary, just until i’ve saved a comfortable amount.. and then i would apply for a better position.

302,"Everything started with a mutual friend introduced us on Discord to play a few games with more people (at this point we only talk the basic in game). A few weeks later it was that friend birthday and he invited her, it was the first time that we talked in person. 
After that she started to talk to me, from that the friendship grow and we talk about everything, we talk about our problems, shared memes, and play video games. Basically we talk every day for a few hours. 
She also helped me laugh in a hard moment on my life. 
And them I started to have feelings for her in the beginning of August (feelings that I didn't choose to have). 
I didn't knew if she liked me (almost sure that she didn't), I didn't say/did  nothing to try to preserve our friendship and that nothing changed between us. I was expecting that my feelings for her ended with out saying nothing. 
Now back to middle August and our group of friends went camping (once again I didn't try anything), the first day was normal he talk just like we talk online. 
But something changed in the second day, I noticed that something changed, she was avoiding me soo I decided to give her some space. In the last day I confronted her and she said that everything was ok, and she assured me that it was. 
A few days passed and she had stopped talking to me, soo I confronted her again because we used to talk everyday and that stoped. She at first said that everything was ok, but then Sê asked me if I liked her. 
I said that I had feelings for her, (I didn't choose to have them) but that I didn't said/tried anything to preserve our friendship, 
Then I ask why did she was avoiding me, and she didnt gave me a proper answer. 
I also said to her that I didn't want to lose our friendship. 
She said that the friendship wouldn't be lost but we wouldn't talk with that much frequently. 
I said that I didn't want to us to became just people who talk ""socially"", and she assured me that that would not appen. 
Now we just talk socially when the both of us are in the same Discord server, and even that we almost don't talk. 
And what is bothering me is that I lost a friend that I could share anything. 

Now what I should I do?

304,"The main thing I want advice on is the title question but I feel like I should expand, so read on if interested or advise without the extra info :) 

The deadline to apply for graduation is in two weeks so I need to make this unexpected and difficult decision quickly. 

Here's what my plan was: I was going to take three classes in the department of my major and two classes towards my history minor this semester, and then take the final project seminar for my major in the spring alongside the last two classes for the minor, graduating on time in May. 

Here's what changed: My advisor misinformed me that I could take the final project seminar in the spring. It turns out, for my major, the final seminar is only offered in the fall semester. In order to take it, I have to drop a history class due to scheduling conflicts and credit overload - BUT it means I would complete my entire major at the end of the fall semester and would be eligible to graduate.

Here's some background: Last semester wiped out the last remaining interest I had in academia and I barely made it through - I literally had to beg one of my (major's) course's professor to let me do an extra credit project or I would have failed that class. My mental health until this month was in the gutter - I am seeking help and going onto medication otherwise I'm not convinced I will graduate at all.

At this point, I don't plan to use my major in any way in the future but I'm too late to bail now since I've paid for 3.5 of 4 years and that would be stupid. If (and this is a big if because I am so burnt out on education) I return for a secondary degree it would probably be in a library sciences type of program, for which I feel the history minor would be helpful. 

Here's what I've done: I dropped both history classes to register for my major seminar because I have to take it this semester. I have proceeded to panic and stew over life in general.

Here's what I see are my options: 
* I can apply for graduation in December, forgetting about the history minor entirely but receiving a degree in my major with a secondary minor I've already completed in another department. This would require breaking my lease (ends in June) which obviously has a price tag, although calculating it (I think) comes out to still be less than what I would be paying for housing and tuition for another semester. I went to college out of my home state and have since realized I have no interest in staying here, so all future jobs I plan to seek would be in my home state. (I could get a temporary job in my current location until the lease ends, but I believe that would be detrimental to my mental health.) 
* I can finish my major this semester, then stay for a spring semester in which I take four history classes to complete my minor and graduate in May. Side note: There were only 3 history department classes relevant to interests, 2 of which are fall-only courses, so taking four courses in the spring would mean 1 class relevant to the rest of my degree, one class about the history of pirates that seems kind of cool, and two other misc. history classes for the sake of having the minor written on a piece of paper.

So uh. Please advise. I don't know what I am doing. (This seems to be a theme in my life. Gotta love your 20s amirite..)

TL;DR Would it be worth it to break my lease in order to graduate early?

we made out and cuddled a few times about 4 months ago but he cut me off because he started dating somebody 

but about 2 weeks ago they stopped dating, he said hello and stuff when we saw eachother out and so i added him back on facebook but a few times when i messaged him, he never replied so i deleted him again.. this saturday just passed, i heard he was at a party i was going to and because a few people try to “fire me up” about him they said they were gonna say something to me in front of him to make me “shame” because i have a massive fear of rejection,
which led to me having an anxiety attack but i had my sister speak to the person that said they would do the thing so i could calm down and come to the party to have fun...


anyway the whole time we were there i didn’t see him look at me and he never spoke to me but he left before everyone to goto the club, anyway when we got there he never said a word

we went back to where the original party was once the club was closed, it got shut down because the neighbours complained about noise, so me and my bestfriend decided that everyone could come back to ours for an afterparty and that’s where the boy finally said hello to me.. we were kind of just looking at eachother and flirting and when everyone left it was just us and two of his friends, i asked him if he wanted to sleep over and he said yes and we cuddled and stuff but didn’t kiss until he left the next day.. i haven’t spoken to him since but my bestfriend said that apparently she caught him looking at me all night, especially when i was speaking to other males

I studied 1 year and half in Oporto(that is a big city far away from my hometown in Portugal) because the schools there are better and I can get really good grades unlike in my hometown town, wich is a little town and the teaching system isn’t that good, there are a lot of students leaving the school every year because of it.
I was studying in Oporto as I said and I came again to my little town and why? Because when I went to Oporto I started smoking weed, in the beginning it was only on the weekends but as after some time I started smoking too much and every day. I was skipping classes, and started to spend too much money, that's when my parents started to notice, and I told them everything because I felt hopeless at this time. I was living with my sister(19y) and away from my parents, my mother was in my hometown town and my father in Algeria working in order to support our expenses. 
Then my mother decided to bring me back to my  hometown where I finished this school year and stopped smoking weed. My grades weren’t good as expected, with this life changing process. My parents divorced and I’m living with my mom. 
I need to repeat this school year in order to get better grades and I need to go to Oporto again, my father decided to let me go with the condition that I will not smoke weed, my mother doesn't like this idea, and she doesn’t want me to go again.Because she didn't want to let me go alone, without her. My father made the apartment that me and my sister were living for the three of us and he permited my mother to live there.
My mom doesn't want to go because the apartment is my dad's and she's just going if she gets another apartment for both of us .But she won't because she has no possibilities to support the apartment and our day-to-day needs.
What can I do to convince her? I really need good marks and I know I made really bad mistakes.

315,"I'm not sure if I should tell my employer their longtime employee is contributing to their high turnover rate.


Background:
I [21F] started working this job back in June, knowing I would have to leave it to go to school in September. The job is full time on a family owned farm and quite physical. It's a somewhat relaxed environment in that the way I was hired is I showed up for my interview and they put me to work, there's no clocking in timesheets or whatever and no one micromanaging me. Everything is legal, I filled out a W2 and they've been taking taxes out so it's nothing under the table. My employers enjoy having me there (they've told me multiple times) because I do my best and maybe also because I ""understand"" what they say to me. I am the only female working at my level... and the only English speaker at this level as well. All the guys I work with are from Mexico/Central America while my superiors are American English only speakers. I've gotten close with most of the guys (about 5 of the 7 who work there) because we do the same work and interact a lot. I try to keep a positive attitude and joke around with the guys. I don't know a ton of Spanish and the guys don't know much English but being around them has helped me pick up Spanish relevant to the job pretty fast. It took them a bit to not be ""shy"" about our broken language communication. Of the 5 guys I've become friends with, 3 of them started working there AFTER me. I was told this place has a super high turnover rate but I didn't really understand why... show up, do the work, go home, no problem.  


The 6th Guy:
There's a 6th guy who has worked at this place for a VERY long time, I think he's been here over a decade. He refuses to train any of the new guys but gets mad and talks bad about them and acts extremely passive aggressive towards them whenever they do something the ""wrong"" way or ""too slow."" His teeth aren't great so it can be hard to understand him but he does speak English and Spanish fairly well. He pretty much just ignores me which is fine, I don't care. I've sensed him being passive aggressive towards me and the way I know he talks bad about everyone is the guys have told me. They were upset and I asked them what was wrong and they told me ""[6th guy] talks too much"" and when I asked what he says they would shake their head and just say he ""talks too much"" again or he ""talks bad about everyone, you, me, everyone"" and ""stay away from him, he's crazy."" They told me his difficult attitude makes it a bad environment to work in and not worth the stability for them this job offers. He talks bad enough that the guys have literally walked away and called their previous employers to see if they had any open positions to return to. Because of the way things are set up, my bosses aren't really around when he's acting this way because we work in different spheres...


So...
This week is my last week. I'm wondering if I should say something to my employers because I've enjoyed working for them and I know the guys I'm friends with don't feel comfortable speaking English? 


I've seen my employers bring in a woman to translate so they could negotiate a raise with the guys... the woman they called in was the 6th guys daughter... It's a family owned business and this guy has been around long enough that they know his family too. I don't expect them to fire the guy or anything like that but it might be good for them to be aware of something contributing to their high turnover rate. With me leaving, a couple of the guys have said they won't work there anymore (may just be talk) because I've helped counteract the negativity the 6th guy puts out.

I’ll try to stick to keeping it as short as possible but I’m sorry if this overruns and is a bore to read.

Also I know how the internet works and I guess there might be some trolling comments but I’d appreciate it if they’re kept to a minimum please? :) 

So growing up I was kind of that guy that had a lot of friends but not really many close friends. I didn’t have the best childhood (father left when I was young followed by my grandma dying a few months later, subsequently my relationship with my mother deteriorated) which led to a lot of unresolved anger issues, which thankfully I’m a lot better with now.

I went through a rough period in my life where I ended up technically homeless living out of the small garden shed in my family homes back garden, only eating when my stepdad gave me some money. I’ve always had bad eating habits, often choosing to eat as a method to cope with whatever circumstance I was dealing with at the time. Cookies, brownies, crisps, anything that would make me feel a little better inside but ultimately was bad for you.

Fast forward a few months and I managed to get myself into college and subsequently was accepted to go and study for a degree in psychology and criminology. I was so happy because I felt like this was the peak of my life at the time. During my college year I met a wonderful girl and we started dating, deciding eventually that we were going to try and make it through university long distance.

This period of time was so difficult for both of us, young and inexperienced as to what would happen, we found it tough to adjust to long distance but we made it through and I recently relocated back to my home area to be near her.

However since I’ve been back it’s been difficult for me. I miss my best friend who was my rock through a lot of times at uni and generally having that friend to always chill with or talk about football or anything of the like.

The house I live in now is shared and everyone kind of does their own thing so I feel quite lonely. I also don’t start my new job for another week but I’m hoping that will be a big boost for me because it will give me something to focus on and meet new people.

The thing is it’s just different to how I thought t would be, I knew that relocating and readjusting would be a big step in my life but i find myself getting agitated or annoyed at absolute minor things when I’m normally not like that.

What things can I do to help with readjusting to being back in a new area where I don’t know many people, as well as readjusting in my relationship so that things don’t go Pete Tong(wrong :p)

I'm very socially isolated and currently can't work so I spend all day sitting on this laptop on autopilot bored out of my mind, it's both caused by and contributes to my depression - because of that depression I also don't find any excitement or joy in anything any more. My main drive to find hobbies is to make friends and try to beat my depression.  


People say to do what interests you but little interests me, I'm interested in social issues but find it hard to find anything locally to get involved in and they tend to be quite unwelcoming to folk who aren't highly educated - I've tried going to a lecture on Marx and going to a local feminist group but I felt judged or shot-down when I tried to join-in discussions. I've an interest in more unusual things like death...but it's not like that opens up many options for hobbies or socializing!   


Things I've tried:

* Gym - became disheartened that I made no progress and there was no social interaction.
* Volunteering - I work for a few charities but it feels like a job rather than something social or an interest.
* Archery - fun but I don't see how it'd progress and everyone else there were older/elderly.
* Art group - it was okay but again it was older people (this seems to be a common issue with activity groups).
* Climbing - without the ability to go rock climbing for real it feels pointless and without friends it's no fun.
* Politics/feminism - see above, when I've tried to get involved I've not felt especially welcome.

Things I used to like:

* Gaming (MMORPG's like Star Wars Galaxies or Everquest) - I can't afford any sort of gaming system or PC plus not sure I'd be much better off socially sitting on my own staring at a game rather than sat staring at my laptop. 
* When I lived in California I used to love off-roading, camping, geocaching, exploring, visiting film locations, etc. - I'm in England now, *very different* to California, plus no car and no one to do these things with. Geocaching is an option on my own, but without a car I'm stuck with local urban caches, which I've mostly already done and it gets boring. 

In an ideal world I'd have friends to hang out with, I'd also have the money and means to do more things. If money were no obstacle I'd travel (dark tourism, adventure holidays, etc), I'd quite like to try dancing and acting too if I could find classes for adult beginners, maybe learn photography and try to learn an instrument like guitar or sitar too.   


Without friends, without a lot of disposable cash, and living in small city all means it's pretty hard to find things to do too - I'd think most people get into hobbies through personal interest or through joining their friends.

That was the last time I had the chance to enroll. On that same day I created a loop with the sleeves of my jumper and tried to hang myself. Now I'm on vacation with my family and I don't know what to do when I get back because I literally have no where to study or continue on my education. 

To clarify, my parents aren't very supportive. My dad's an alcoholic and my mom is an enabler. I struggle to express how I feel simply from the environment I grew up in. During the break I got my mom to book an appointment with the doctor to get help for my anxiety and depression, he said there was nothing wrong with me and that I just had to take a walk in a park. I'm still not sure how true this is, I just find it hard to believe he came to such a conclusion after only a few secs from reading my 4 page letter. It made me feel invalidated. Even getting the appointment booked was a huge deal to me and I won't be able to go again honestly. I'm not going through that again. ",27Aug2018,2

331," I (19M) have been in a relationship with a girl (19F) for a year now and we love each other so much. We see and speak all the time and people who see us think we’re the perfect couple. It was literally attraction at first sight however little do people know is that we’ve had our issues and I can’t stop my brain thinking.

When we became official everything was good. The only downside to the relationship at that time was that she had issues processing her emotions and then would turn her issues (such as worrying what people think about her, work stress, etc) and turn them into my issues (why do you do this, etc). She would be immature about it as well by name calling and doing impressions of me and I would just take it just to get us back to that good spot (and on rare occasions she would post a sad face on social media). So yeah, there was fault with both of us there, me not standing up for myself and her not being mature about her issues.

Then one day when she has a lot of work on she turns around and says she wants to go on a break. I was reluctant but eventually I agreed however we both agreed that neither of us would do anything more than a kiss. A week later she would tell me she spent a night with a man and they engaged in some form of sexual activity (I didn’t ask for details) and then she got mad at me when I was upset (yelling at me for crying because she probably felt bad). She said she doesn’t know anything about our agreement but I don’t believe her because A) She was acting the way she does when she’s lying B) There were lots of holes in her story that didn’t add up about how she could not have known about he agreement and C) How can you forget something like that – like in its entirety as well?

I stuck with her after that – numb and not sure about what I feel and think. Suffice to say I’ve always looked at her differently after that. I’m not sure how, I guess she seemed less perfect.

Four months pass and we officially end the break (though in reality it was practically over after a month). Finally, everything was exactly how I wanted – a girl who cared for me as much as I cared for her. One who thinks about me and wants me to succeed. Three months have passed and we’ve only had two arguments. They’re the same thing as before where she has an issue and she tries to make it my problem except this time I stood up for myself. I told her how I felt and she didn’t like it. She cried, we spent a few days where we didn’t talk to each other (she eventually messaged me) and she missed my birthday for it (also did that thing where she moves the “in a relationship with” from her home page on FB and just has it in her “about” section and posted more sad emojis).

I decided that although I love her so much I don’t know if I entirely want to be in this anymore. I’m currently in Poland with her meeting the rest of her family (the ones that don’t live in the Denmark where we live) and all is great but its dawned on me that I’ve gone not to see how great she is and to change my mind but actually because I’m here to find a reason to break up. Not only that but I now find myself constantly thinking about a mutual friend of ours. And now I’m here and she’s being lovely to me I’m wondering if I thoughts of leaving were silly – though she’s still being what I call “immature” about some of her family. On top of this I now keep having thought for a mutual friend of ours.

Summary: GF did stuff with at least one other man 7 months a go and never apologised, and now that time has moved one and she's so good to me now I can;t forget it. Find myself looking for reasons to end what is now a fantastic relationship and I keep thinking about a mutual friend of ours. We love each other and it breaks my heart to think of leaving and I'm not sure what to think/do/feel",27Aug2018,0

336,"I'll try to be pretty brief...

My sister is awful. She's always been overbearing. When we were kids, she would threaten to burn or take/throw away my favorite toys. She would trick and steal from me (mainly money). When I was 17 and she was 21, she had a kid and abandoned it with my parents and I to run away from home to drink/do hard drugs. So, I had to raise it since my parents worked. She dumped another off onto us two years later, same basic story.

She continued to steal, lie, steal, lie. Some easy examples: she would show up for birthdays, get the kids' birthday money, and use it. She would take her kids' game consoles, toys, and even a nice leather jacket my mom gave one, and pawns it all off to get money. She steals money and medicine cabinet-type drugs if she can find them. She comes over to my parents' house to eat all their food and disappear again. She's threatening, vindictive, and super two-faced. She even sold my parents a broken laptop and digital camera (they didn't know they were broken, they're too trusting overall) and then ""borrowed"" the laptop, claiming she was going back to school...and sold it to our uncle. (And he got mad because it was riddled with viruses, poor guy.)

And that isn't even the tip of the iceburg. 

But she isn't just bad in those ways, she's delusional and makes *everything* about herself. There have been so very many birthdays and Christmases where we worked hard to make them amazing...and she would come and absolutely ruin them by making herself the focus. All while behaving as if she is perfect and innocent of everything and anything.

And my mom wants me to invite her to my wedding. Nope, nope, nope. People say, ""she's family!"" and mom says, ""she will cause a fuss and make life harder for me."" I say, ""It doesn't matter, I don't want her there"" and ""Just tell her it was my decision and that you tried to change my mind but couldn't, it's fine if she blames me.""

But no one listens. *Dad* understands why I don't want her there, but he's too sick to argue the point in my favor. I don't know how to convince them. I'm 28, it isn't like I'm trying to be petty or immature about this. But I want the day to go well and be about my husband and I, I want it to be happy and relaxed. I'm an anxious and shy person anyway, I don't need to be stressed or crying at my own wedding. I don't want bad memories at my wedding.

Mom got annoyed that I invited out neighbor (whom she's had a bit of a spat with) and not my sister. Well, I don't expect the neighbor to do anything awful at my wedding, and the spat isn't something I'm involved with anyway. 

People think family is such a big deal. It can be, sure, but I feel like I have the right to cut or decrease toxic people from my life. I just can't make people understand that.

I'm also afraid she will find out from someone else and show up anyway...no idea what to do there, but it's a one-step-at-a-time affair I guess. We considered just going to the courthouse but I want this to be a big happy day so badly. :(",27Aug2018,1

I then was asked for my ID. I could’ve swore I put it in my purse. However when looking couldn’t find it. I pulled everything out of my purse and still couldn’t find it. The lady just went with my debit card thank God.

Maintaining my current lifestyle in London would completely trash my savings and be generally challenging on my finances... so, I am thinking about moving out to somewhere with a cheaper and better quality of life.

I'm a British citizen and therefore an EU citizen (for now!)  
I speak English and Dutch and could reach a minimally functional level in Italian, French, German, Spanish (in that order)

Some preferences:  
\- I would like to be able to cycle and use public transport. A city or town which isn't built around cars would be great.  
\- crossfit or functional fitness equivalent gym nearby  
\- paddlesport/kayak centre nearby  
\- coffee culture - cafes where it's acceptable to sit and work on my laptop with a coffee and wifi  
\- very reliable internet  
\- LGBTQIA+ community  
\- intercity railway  
\- I like the sea  
\- mild winters - not too many days below freezing  
\- meaningfully cheaper than London!   
\- for short-term one bedroom flat rental

350,"A few weeks ago at my school, we were tasked with making a video about human rights, each of the 30 groups was assigned a right, my group's right is the fourth which states the ban on slavery.

The video's objective would be to let people know why we should defend this right, it is not supposed to be an informative video about the right or its history, it's just to make sure people understand why we need it.

Now we're about to make the video, but after explaining my idea to some people, I'm starting to think its a bit too subtle, some other people have said that it is actually a really good and poetic idea.

The video would be something like this: 

Scene 1: We see a someone hammering a nail, but the hammer breaks. 

Scene 2: We see a man trying to get a glass and the glass falls off the table and shatters, the words ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AN OBJECT?"" appear on the screen. 

Scene 3: Someone is cutting a wire with some pliers, and the pliers break, ""A TOOL..."" 

Scene 4: We see a guy buying a plier a hammer and a glass, ""...CHEAP AND REPLACEABLE?"" 

After that, the scenes start repeating without the words appearing and the music starts to get louder, the scenes darker, everything starts speeding up until it cuts to black and a calm view of the countryside appears, birds singing in the background and we see on the screen ""Say NO to slavery. 4th Human Right. Made by:"".


TL;DR: For school, I'm making a video about slavery, that makes an analogy between tools and humans trying to get you to sympathize with the tools. It never shows actual slaves nor states that humans aren't tools.

My question is, is it too subtle?

353,"TL/DR: Caught spouse in non-relationship-compromising lie. They don't know they're caught. Need help deciding if I should bring it up, or ""pick my battles"" and let it go. Driving myself crazy by (over-)analyzing it.

First, I have always trusted my spouse 100%. I've never questioned their loyalty or trustworthiness at all. Since day 1 we've always agreed that judgment-free communication is priority 1 in our relationship. That expectation has come into question occasionally, but therapy has helped us work through it.

FYI, I'm being intentionally vague for anonymity's sake. Please bear with me, and accept my apology for the limited details. Now to the issue at hand...

Logic and simple research after a couple of red flags led to me catching my spouse in a lie about their whereabouts one night. They don't know they've been found out yet, because I'm trying to decide if it's something worth bringing up at all. I'm not sure about bringing it up because I'm 99.9% sure that the lie was NOT in service of anything that would make me consider leaving. For example, I don't believe it was related to infidelity.

I don't know if I should say anything, but our relationship-long standard of having open lines of communication tells me that I should. Without saying too much, the suspected thing is not something that would put the marriage in jeopardy - at least from my perspective - based on what I know at this point.

Being that it wouldn't make me consider leaving, I can't help but wonder why they lied in the first place. It's not something that I would just sweep under the rug, but I would see it as an opportunity to open a dialogue about the issue. Are they ashamed or guilty? I can't wrap my head around why they would like about it too begin with... 

The more I think about it, the more I drive myself crazy, too. I'm an airhead most of the time, so I'm now wondering if this is the only lie? Have they lied about doing this before? Have they lied about other things? Have they lied about worse things?! 

Introspectively, have I missed other lies (regardless of what they might've been) because my head is in the clouds and I didn't see the flags? Have I missed other things because they're a good liar and they just slipped this one time? I'm finding myself questioning everything now. I keep catching myself recounting other past events and wondering if I missed clues. I'm bad about remembering details, so reflecting on the past is just making me question myself more. Then I wonder if I've just conned myself into thinking there's a lie here when the reality isn't. After all, I've committed my life and have always totally trusted this person. Although the evidence makes me confident in my suspicion, I can't help but wonder if I'm just making this up in my head.

Again UMUC is regionally accredited, but it kind of runs itself like a for-profit degree mill. As a Computer Science major, would attending an online school make my degree any less credible? Most of my credits I've earned at a Taylor which is pretty good academically for what it is. I'm concerned that my degree would not be respected and all of my work at Taylor would be squandered by going to this online school.

Tl;DR: Should I transfer to an online school to graduate in a semester or continue at my current school to graduate in 3 semesters.",27Aug2018,1
359,"I love following erotical models on Instagram. They look pretty and have amazing bodies and I appreciate female beauty (sometimes I used them as sketch reference) Honestly erotical photography has allways been alluring to me but I had never really considered.   


This week however one of my favourite IG erotical accounts made a calling for new sets and can pay up to 500 dollars for pictures and a chance to feature new models and I'm considering it. I talked to my SO (who also follows erotical) about this and although he's not thrilled, he told me he would support me if I did. I want him to take the pictures and help with details so that he doesn't feel left out or get jealous. But even though this excites me I still have a bit of doubts. I know I can, I'm beautiful, confident and secure. 500 dollars sound great and I can pull it off... but, should I? I mean I have read the mean comments on many of this girl's pictures, the unwanted male advances and I know one or two have had problems with people of their community finding ou and telling their families about their jobs. I am not a US citizen (it's a US based site) but internet is big and finding people isn't that rare... I dunno.

360,"This may be a bit long, so I provided a TLDR at the bottom. 

Me and me hubby currently live with my parents and our 10 month old daughter, but now that she’s getting bigger and we have saved some money up, we are eager to get our own place. We don’t want to own a home quite yet, so we were looking to rent a house for a year or so in the mean time. I started out looking on the Facebook market place, then moved to Craigslist just to see what options were there. 

I saw on Craigslist some houses that were a really good deal, and I mean REALLY GOOD. One was a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house listed as $650 for rent a month! It also stated that utilities were included in that price. So we would be paying $650 flat. I was ecstatic by this deal so I contacted the email on the listing to get more information. 

Then while browsing some more I saw another house for rent that was asking for $500 for a two bedroom one bath. Also stated that utilities were included. Again, this sounds amazing but at this point I’m thinking they both seem a little too good to be true. But I message the email on this listing as well to get more details. 

Then I checked my emails this morning, and both had responded and the emails seemed eerily similar.... like they were by the same person pretending to be two different people. Different numbers listed, different emails, different name... but their explanation as to why the houses are so cheap was the same basically. And the writing styles were very similar. 

The first one I opened was stating that he was a deaf man who moved just moved to Nevada, and somehow  got caught up with a dishonest agent while trying to sell his home. He pulled it off the market and now wants to rent it out himself. I opened this one first before the second one, so I did exchange some information with this man before I got suspicious. 

The other which I opened later states that he is a family man who moved to NEVADA, and also got caught up with a sketchy agent who wanted to scam him when he attempted to sell his home. He too pulled it off the market and now wants to rent it out himself. 

I created an Imgur link with screenshots of all the emails so you can see them. I have omitted some details (address, last names, numbers), but I can tell you now the names were completely different as well as the emails and numbers. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/Q8RhueS

In your opinion, is this a scam? Should I pull out now and simply stop messaging these “two” men?  I have messaged the “first” man going by Zuniga about 4 times and exchanged information, but nothing extremely personal other than first and last name, company I and hubby work for, how much we make, when we can move in, and the fact that I will be moving in with hubby and baby. 

TLDR: I am looking to rent a home with my family. Found two REALLY good deals on Craigslist, and after messaging them the email responses were eerily similar, yet apparently sent from two separate people. I provided screenshots of emails above. Is this a scam?

362,"Hi. I'm a 16 year old high school student who just got a job this summer in fast food! Unfortunately, things didn't go how I was hoping. My co-workers were very rude to me and everyday before work I would have terrible panic attacks. I decided that for my own mental health, I should quit and find a job better suited for me and my situation. 

Normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal, but the problem lies with me getting my final check (honestly my first and last check from the restraunt). After quitting, I went in to get my check feeling very confident and happy that this part of my life was now on standby. These feelings came crashing down when my ex-employer told me that my check wasn't there and I would have to come back next month.

I did come back at the recommended time she gave me, only to discover that they were unbelievably busy. I waited for a good 15 minutes before my anxiety chipped away at me and I went back to the saftey of my home. 

My parents are extremely frustrated with me, which I understand their reasons to be. They're pushing me to call in and see if my check is there, but everytime I do, a manager tells me that I need to physically come in to see if the check is there (spoiler alert- it's never there).

The check should be just a tiny bit over $100 and honestly I feel as if it's not even worth it anymore. This whole situation has sparked up so much anxiety that it makes me physically sick (I wish I was joking). 

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I've asked my parents to take me to a doctor so I could hopefully be put on some kind of medication that would calm my nerves, especially with school starting soon for me. I feel this would help me a lot, but my parents are reluctent to take me, and if they do decide to take me, plans are cancelled last minute due to how busy they are. 

Please help me figure out what to do about this situation or my crippling social anxiety. I really need this help.

367,"TLDR- One of my internet friends who probably has a mental condition is really annoying the crap out of me. I don't have it in me to delete him or say anything because he's overall an ok person and probably isn't trying to be annoying. Just want to know what you guys think I should do.



I kinda need to vent and would like to know what you guys would do in this situation. Thank you for reading.

To start, I'm in my early 20s. Just so this all makes sense a little more.

So I was desperate and lonely a few years ago and joined a ton of Facebook groups that were interest-related (ie fandoms and the like) to try to find friends who were like me. This wasn't the smartest thing I've done but whatever. Anyways, I added this one person, who I really liked having around on my FB for several months. He acted supportive and friendly and whatnot. Something always was off about him but I was like, whatever.

Turns out... This person is SO annoying. I will definitely sound like an asshole but I accept that judgment. Anyways, it started with him sharing links or photos on my timeline one or more times a day. At first I was like ""he remembered I like this (insert fandom or subject matter), that's so nice"". But it was a daily thing. Every. Fucking. Day. So much to where I blocked the ability to post on my timeline. I don't like it when people do that anyways but whatever, they can't anymore. Then it turned into sending links in messenger. I used to just talk about it to him and whatever. Now I just leave it on read cos I just have no more time to read articles about something that, while I do enjoy it, isn't something I need to read every deep unnecessary article or analysis about. I like stuff without reading into every little detail. It's doable. However this person isn't getting it. I'm really bad at directly saying stuff like that because I don't want to be mean. 

The reason this case is so hard is because this guy is 25-26 or so (I can't remember exactly), and he is... Off. I don't mean to be offensive or seem rude to people on the spectrum, but I think he's on the spectrum or has a mental condition. He is really not very mature and acts like he's about 13. In the 3 years I've known him, he has not matured AT ALL, which is fine, but I have matured a lot over that time and have done a lot of adult transitions in 3 years. He is still living at home working part time, buying comic books, band merch, and whatnot with all his money, which again is fine if he and his parents have agreed on it being ok. He's ALWAYS on Facebook. I've moved very far beyond that point in my life and I don't have time to goof off on Facebook all the time. I don't have time to read articles about how such and such comic book is including an LGBT character. That's cool but I'm not going to linger on it. Or how such and such band's album ""changed the genre"". It's music and listening to it is cool. I've probably seen whatever band meme.

If I don't respond he proceeds to send me a similar link a week later. I'll usually reply ""cool"" or something like that. Then it becomes the same conversation every time (this is literally the exact way he says things):
Me: cool
Person: very good how is the buttsplosion666?
M: fine, just busy, hbu
P: good good how are your birds
M: they're good
P: awww good birbs
M: yeah
P: how is (my so's name)
M: they're good, just busy
P: awesome did you hear (band's new album)
M: yeah it's fine
P: awesome I'll have go check it out when I go out tomorrow
M: ok
P: what do you like about it
**By this point I'm kinda annoyed that I can't seem to get out of the conversation politely**
M: idk I just like how it sounds and whatever
P: it must totally reek of awesome (he says this all the time....)

This is usually where I just stop responding. I would be much more willing to chat if I didn't have to fight to leave the conversation politely and if it wasn't the same thing every fucking time. I'm not even kidding. It is almost exactly the same, like a script. It gets old. I don't want to be rude to him because he likely means well. Deleting him would be rude in my opinion, but honestly the thought crosses my mind. I've already unfollowed and blocked timeline sharing. I turned notifications for messenger on silent because my phone will go off non stop. 

I'm really sorry for the lengthy vent. What would you do in this situation? I know directly talking would be the obvious answer but I'm not sure how to say it without implying ""you're annoying"". I'm at a loss. Thanks for reading if you got to here. I know it was a mess and rambling pile of shit but I want some second opinions about what to say.",27Aug2018,1

369,"My family has a trip planning to our cabin this next weekend. My brother has a 2 year old and I just got a dog. 

The dog is, admittedly nervous around strangers but has shown absolutely 0 aggression toward adults or children. My nephew and dog have met and it was totally fine. My brother has a dog, and my other brother have a dog, they'll both be coming and are both fine with my dog. 

My sister in law got bit by a dog awhile ago and has been paranoid every since, so her anxiety is justifiable. 

However, all of a sudden, aka tonight... my brother and his wife decide they don't trust my dog, and want me to drive 2.5 hours (on top of 5 hours to the cabin) to drop my dog off at my boyfriend's mom's. 

I put my foot down and said absolutely not, we're not coming without her, this is just ridiculous. Now, they're not coming because they don't want to ""risk it"" and are making me feel guilty for being the bad guy. Aka, other brother sent me texts saying ""Don't make them stay home because of your dog"", ""If you insist on bringing Shelby, then you're making them stay home. But they've decided that either the kid or the dog get to go, and I think you know who should win that battle. "" 

Now, my once highly anticipated weekend getaway is a massive source of anxiety and tension. Can you guys tell me if I'm in the wrong?

370,"I am about a month and a half into a relationship with a girl who I really like. I tried for months to get her so I have put in time and effort and finally got her.

I have been reading about it and I need to realize that even though I don't see the good in me, she does, otherwise she wouldn't be with me. We spent 3 days camping and I got a little pissy with myself on the last day. We didn't speak much on the way home. When we got back to her place, I ended up going home and we didn't speak much that night. Of course, I spent the whole time thinking something was wrong or I did something or said something. I know I need to just drop it otherwise she is gonna realize maybe she doesn't wanna be with me. I am gonna drop it and try to just move on and act like it's ok. After all, it is in the past and self loathing people tend to live in the past or the future, worrying about things that havn't happened yet. 
Anyone else do this or gone through this? What is the best way to get past this and not have her thinking things will always be this way?

371,"So, we moved in our current townhouse in 2011 with our Rescue dog, who is a poodle/terrier. He barks when he sees things, he barks when he hears things. I work from home Mon-Fri, so the times where he is actually home ALONE where someone won't stop him from barking are minimal. Mostly on weekends, and even then it's only for a couple hours. 2-3 Years ago a new neighbor moved in, and has been complaining about our dog about a year into living there. Six months ago in an effort to stop him from complaining to me we bought one of those bark collars that sends a small shock to him.  Unfortunately because of this my Dog suffered a disc injury and for about a month I literally had to pick the dog up and carry him around because he couldn't walk. Despite not putting him to sleep (like people were advising me) I wanted to give the poor dog a chance to heal, and sure enough he started to walk again, and went back to his normal self. 2 Weeks ago I told my neighbor that we couldn't use the shock collar anymore because it caused him injury and we're not taking that chance again. (I was trying to make it clear that I wanted him to STFU about my Dog without)

Few things to clarify:

1. My neighbor has been ""injured"" for almost 2 years now so he is ALWAYS home, despite somehow having a new fiancee they are ALWAYS home. He's become EXTREMELY irrational not just with us but with the neighbor on the other side of him, fighting over a parking spot to the point where she took him to court to try and get a peace order. She has since moved partly to just get away from this guy.
2. If we are going to be gone for an extended period of time (more than a few hours) we almost ALWAYS drop him off at my Parents house
3. My neighbor has complained when we leave him to roam the house free (his favorite spot is on the landing on the steps where he can see everything and there are 3 walls between our house and his. 
4. We've recently locked him in the living room when we leave so he's not running up and down the steps possibly reinjuring himself.
5. I don't want to have a feud with my neighbor, all conversations have been ""cordial"" but I thought I had made myself clear last time when I told him the only thing we can put on our dog is the ""beep"" setting on the collar to prevent injury.

Last night after being gone 3.5 hours I get this text message

""Hey PHM just to let know &lt;dog&gt; was barking all day since u left today...it went right through the wall, it's just hard to listen to all day thx &lt;neighbor&gt;"" ....all day is 3.5 hours? and like I said I highly doubt he barks from the second we leave to the second we get home. There's ZERO evidence of that. I've seen what my Dog looks like from barking from an extended period of time without being told to stop, and he is NEVER like that when we get home.

I mean I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm not getting rid of my Dog and breaking my Kid's hearts, and I'm not going to possibly risk injuring him anymore, he's 11 as it is, it's not like he's a puppy. He was this way when we rescued him and he'll always be this way (as long as he's healthy). We were here first, and so was our Dog. 

Does anyone have any good advice as to shut this guy up once and for all about my Dog without starting WW3? He seems kind of unhinged and I don't want to have to scout the back yard for poison or something because he wants to kill my f'ing dog. 

I also find it hard to believe that from the SECOND we leave the house the Dog starts barking until we LITERALLY get home. If that was the case we'd come home to find him panting and exhausted. I can't say how many times I've walked quietly back up to the house and it's SILENT until we open the door. If my Dog was barking from 8am-5pm every day or something I'd totally understand but like I said, literally the only time he's home alone is 30 minutes when I pick my Sons up from school Mon-Thurs and a few hours here and there on the weekend.

**Just to reiterate ONE more time, we don't leave the dog for more than a few hours and NEVER EVER late at night or early in the morning. It's not like the dog is barking at 2am or something like that. We're talking daylight hours. We have kids so we're not out all day and night.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking for a tactful response that will get the point across of ""Sorry, this is just the way it is"" that will get this guy off my back once and for all without starting a huge war. I literally NEVER complain about anything on HIS side of the house.

375,"Recent grad considering next big moves,

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated with a BA degree in IT a few months ago. Didn't really apply for many full time positions because I honestly didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do after graduating. After having some time and considering a few different paths I've thought about my personal career goals and decided that I want to go into the realm of marketing. Currently back at home for the time being and considering a couple of options...

&amp;#x200B;

1..) I've been doing a lot of research into graduate schools that have one-year masters programs in marketing *(M.S., NOT MBA)* and have specific concentrations to choose from. A lot are here in the states within the price range of what I would be able to afford and some are even out of the country. Long-term I think I want to end up residing in Europe so really thinking about doing a grad program abroad and using that time to network/get good internships that with all of the stars aligned could potentially turn into a full time offer. Plus I really think I'd benefit with a lot of the learning opportunities these programs offer since I didn't really do anything marketing related in undergrad.

&amp;#x200B;

2..) Although I have not had any specific offers yet I obviously could just go right into the workforce and do my best to find a full time job at this point. Only thing with this is I wouldn't want to end up in a position that I don't like for a year plus (life is too short). I suppose another issue is not necessarily wanting to find a job in the field that my undergrad degree was in... However I do see advantages to getting ""full-time"" experience first.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I'm leaning more towards just getting the grad degree since the programs I'm looking at are short, and it would give me time to find internships while I'm completing the program to gain even more work experience in the field that I want to go into. It would also give me some valuable insight as to what living abroad or in different cities that I would want to end up in is actually like without having to commit to a full-time job yet and being locked down in a 9-to-5. Hopefully it would also give me some networking opportunities that I can also use to end up where I want to be, especially if I end up doing grad school abroad and can use my time to network locally.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on just going for the degree..? Are there any major downsides to doing a short-term MS program with minimal work experience, as opposed to just going straight into working full-time? Would it potentially hurt my employment prospects in the future, even if I am getting some work experience like short-term and summer internships along the journey to the masters...? As I said before family/financial situation is such that cost of the programs I'm looking at is not necessarily a huge issue, but I wouldn't want to go with the grad school route in the spring and then risk being seen as ""overqualified"" after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. also looking at doing internships this fall in the meantime just to get some more experience under my belt.

379,"hi, using a throwaway account. I'm 18 years old and just got my license ~3 months ago. About an hr ago I got in a car accident at the school parking lot. It was my fault, their car has a paint scratch on left rear, mine on left front. I was so in shock and COMPLETELY forgot to ask for any of their info such as name, car model, phone number, insurance, DL. I didn't save their license plate either. They did ask for my insurance and all that. I only took some pictures of the damages on their car. I do have a dashcam though, and it captured what happened. 

How fucked am I if they try to lie their way through this since my info is limited, and how can I go through the insurance claim process with this little amount of information?

Also tbh, I've always been paranoid of driving for the fear of getting into an accident (a minor accident is still an accident) which was why I delayed getting my license for almost 3 years.

I don't even have that much to stress about. Some of my friends are taking all AP courses, and I'm only taking two this year.

I'm terrified and anxious about so many things this school year. Studying for the SATs. AP classes. Volunteering. Getting a part-time job. College apps. Even the smallest things like driving, writing essays, reading, or just hanging out with friends have begun to stress me out. I'm either in a state of anxiety or numbness from everything. When I tried talking to my mom about this, she called me lazy and started talking about how it was all over for me if I succumbed to it. I don't even want to raise the concept of therapy to her because she doesn't believe in depression. So I approached my guidance counselors but all they recommended was that I needed to take less classes or stop worrying. Why is everyone's advice always to see a therapist or stop worrying and do?! I've tried to take action but it takes me so long to do homework now and focus that is just demotivates me even more.

Maybe my mom's right. Maybe I just need to keep going to the library so I can study. I wish I could just turn off all these stupid thoughts so that I can just actually get stuff done.

382,"I will keep this short. I am a male student in my twenties living in Europe. Last semester I got friends with this foreign exchange student and eventually we figured out that we both liked each other. We openly knew that but it was never something official and we didn't want to take it to that level because we knew that she was going to leave my city. So almost 3 months have passed since she left and we are still very much in contact and we miss each other A LOT. 

&amp;#x200B;

She is going to come in November to visit me and also she wants me to come and stay with her for a week. She also said that she was willing to visit me again next year. PLUS there is a 75% chance that she is going to come to my city again for a year in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is: I don't know what to do. I have had some relationships but I have NEVER had so much feelings for a girl. For the very first time I can say that I love a girl from the bottom of my heart. I think about her all the day. Since I have known her, I haven't had any interest in any other girls anymore and I really want to keep it that way. I think about her day and night, when I study, when I work, when I'm at the gym, when I'm with my friends. There have even been times where I wanted to say something and just accidentally said her name instead because she is on my mind ALL THE TIME. Of course, I don't know if she thinks the same way of me.

My Mom and I are really close and she made so many sacrifices for me and I really wanted to do this for her. The things that I like doing don't really require that much money so this was going to my bank anyways so I figured I could do this.

​

I have a special inquiry. I am looking for the name of a journalist. I have read an article about him (with a picture of him), but I just can't find that article again. So I will describe him the best I can and hope somebody will find out who it is. Just post the name of people who you think are the journalist, so I can find out

​

The person who I'm looking for:

\- He is a journalist

\- He is American

\- I think he is from New York City, even though I am not quite sure about that

\- He could be affiliated with New York Times, but I am definitely not sure about that

\- I think he is Jewish, even though I am not quite sure about that either

\- His age is roughly between 50 and 70 years old, please do not take that for granted

\- He wears glasses with dark frame and square shape.

\- He has brown to dark hair (probably grey), but definitely not blonde.

\- He has a small Wikipedia article, so he is relatively famous

I hope you guys can help me! Just post the name of you think it is, and I will see it, because I can remember the face when I see it.

391,"So this is going to be rather long but I’m looking for any advice because at this point I have no where else to turn. 

To begin with, my sister has always been a horrible brat (I know this sound immature of me to say but it’s the truth) she is the youngest and has always been spoiled. When she doesn’t get what she wants she shrieks, breaks things, threatens to call the cops on my mom, literally yells at the top of her lungs and on multiple occasions took a steak knife into the bathroom and threatened to kill her self just bc my mom wouldn’t give her money to go hang out with friends. These friends btw had begun to get into drugs and my sister started lying to my mom about where she was going, what she was spending my mother’s money on (she used to go out to eat with friends and she was only 15/16 so my mom lended her money). 

Anyway, she had begun to hang out with the very wrong crowd and began to do hard drugs and steal my mother and fathers money out of her purse/his wallet. She began selling all of her stuff and sneaking into my room and my parents and brothers to steal and sell whatever she could. This resulted in me putting a padlock on my ****ing bedroom door. She was about 17 at this point. My mother tells her she cannot hangout with these people anymore, she refuses to listen and just leaves the house or screams and runs around threatening to call cops/ kill herself. So my parents decide to send her away to some form of school where she can get help. 

She goes to said school to finish high school and seems to be fine. However, it has been a year and she has already had 3 jobs in the past TWO weeks. She shows up for one day then decides F it and doesn’t go back. My parents just spent thousands of dollars on her so she could start college. She doesn’t go on the first day. Says she doesn’t care how much they spent. Mind you it was HER idea to start school. She is now back to the same thing she was doing before she left. She’s doing drugs, lying to my mom, stealing money, screaming and throwing literal tantrums whenever she doesn’t get what she wants. She’s 18. 

The “deal” my parents made with her when she was to come back was that she needed to get a job. That obviously didn’t work out. My parents don’t know what to do. She comes and goes when she pleases. Completely disregards anything my parents say. Is doing hard drugs, stealing from us and continues to throw these god-awful tantrums. I cannit take it anymore. She is literally ruining my families life. 

I  tell my parents to kick her out bc all she does is make things worse. They say they can’t bc she’ll just try to break back into the house. They’ve never actually kicked her out but apparently my parents spoke to a cop at some point regarding her and this is what they told them. 

They love her bc she’s their kid. They know she is ruining their lives, mine and my brothers life. And even my moms asks me advice on what to do. I give her advice and she doesn’t listen. She is abhorrent and I cannot stand being around heranymore. My parents are good, kind people and she is ruining their life.

396,"Okay so, I’ll give a quick little summary. So I’m still in school, and I have three blocks without anyone from of these people, but fourth block (Algebra) and fifth (Life P.E) I have them. I’ll call them Dan and Tony to make this easier. So, I used to be friends with these guys, they seemed really cool at first and I thought ‘why not?’, but over time I’ve found both of them to be complete asshats who constantly make fun of me and physically abuse me. It’s gotten really bad, and for the most of last year Tony was homeschooled so I had a bit of relief from him but he’s back, so it’s started up again. Not only are they absolute cuntbrushes, but they both do drugs. Alcohol (I have no problem with), and drugs. When I say drugs, I don’t mean just a bit of weed, but they do a whole lot of it plus some other stuff that’s worse. Here’s the thing, I tried to stop talking to them and just distance myself from them to not be friends anymore because I absolutely despise them. Problems arise though, they don’t get the message. They don’t understand I don’t want to be their friend at all and they don’t get the memo, and even worse is that Tony is friends with most of my friends, and when he insults me then so do they. To make it worse, they’ve been trying to pressure me into doing drugs, and I absolutely do not want to do any. It may be just marijuana but I don’t care. My thing is, I want to get into the Air Force Academy, I want to be a Pilot and it’s a goal I have set, and if I want to then I can’t touch drugs at all. Not once. But that doesn’t stop them. They tell me to try it, or they threaten to force me to try it, and they’ll try to pressure me into it, but I’ll refuse. They’ll then ask why and I’ll either say “because I want to get into the Air Force” or “Because I don’t want to”. Its then that they try to explain that it’s only in my system for threeish weeks and that it won’t matter then insult me for thinking that I will get caught. I don’t want to risk it. To make matters worse, Dan wants to get into West Point Academy, but he’s a stoner and I doubt he will but he keeps insisting. It’s gotten really out of hand lately and they’ve been getting all up in my space, physically Abusing me, and whenever I try to talk to my girlfriend or any friends, they’ll come and fuck it all up. What do I do? 

I don’t want to go to a counselor or principal because then they’ll tell them who said it (me) and they’ll harass me for it, and most likely get physical.

402," Hello [/r/advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/advice),

Me and my 2 friends are moving into a really nice apartment here in a few weeks. Yesterday we met to go over the pre-move in basics (ground rules, setting up accounts, ect.) One of the topics we had to go over was to figure out who would take the master bedroom, and who would take the 2 garage spaces. The master isn't terribly exciting, it's slightly bigger than the other two and has it's own bathroom. As someone who lives in a place where September through March can turn my car into an icicle overnight, I was ready to pay up for garage access.

I thought we'd have a pretty intense discussion about the Master, but *NOPE!* Nobody wants it, but everyone wants a garage space.

Right now we've settled on the idea of having a 2 week rotation for cars in the garage (4 weeks in, 2 weeks out) and draw straws for the Master.

The other proposal that's still on the table is that whoever takes the master is excluded from the garage. I'm starting to debate if it might be worth it to jump on the master. Here's what I've worked out so far:

**Pros**

* Own bathroom
* No roommate sharing the next wall (Both admit to staying up waaay late to game)
* &lt; 3 miles from work; Could walk/jog in and out
* Could walk across the street to our regional rail and get off at the next stop if I'm running late.
* Boss is fairly flexible if I'd like to work from home because of weather.
* Car is old and the body doesn't need love.
* Don't really need the garage besides in the winter.

**Cons**

* Have to stay on top of cleaning my bathroom
* Living room where a mounted TV might be is outside the master.
* &lt; 3 miles to work, likely to still drive most of the time.
* Would like to take advantage of the space to slightly renovate my car (repaint, clean headlights, replace parts, ect.)
* My car's door seals are fucked and it's common to have my doors frozen shut on any night that might dip below freezing.
* What the fuck does a guy do with 2 walk in closets?

Should I stick with the current plan or take advantage of the master?",27Aug2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

1. Avoid/ignore him (most plausible, but my worries are if I encounter him and he starts something up)
2. Be the bigger man and try to reunite with him and see if he changed (hardest option and I have a feeling that he still hasn't changed)
3. Try to stand up for myself if he decides to talk shit about me (I gotta be less sensitive and more self-confident, which I'm still improving on)
4. Just forget about it and resolve the past (intention of not being friends, but not enemies either but that will be difficult as he either likes or hates people, no in-between)

419,"Hi all - well, I don't really know where to start - but essentially, want to start it out by letting you know that my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year, and everything is good except for his sister who is terrorizing him and his family over our relationship.  We are in our late twenties, both have professional jobs, normal and functional relationship, honestly nothing to freak out about, right? Well, in her eyes, that's wrong.  Anytime she sees a picture of us together (and we post like, 2 pictures a year together because we're both just not overly-PDA on social media types, which makes this even more insane), she calls him going into a mental breakdown because ""she doesn't want to see pictures of us together because it makes her upset"", and tries to BULLY him into like, hiding that we're together just so she doesn't happen to come across it? Also, his family and i don't have a relationship because they walk on eggshells around her and don't invite me to anything because they don't want to upset her.  I don't want to judge their parenting with her, but all I have to say is that if that was anyone in ***my*** family acting like that, it wouldn't have gone on this long. Trust me.  Also, we all used to be cool together and him and I even asked her if it was okay that we started going on dates and she was fine with it (I have the texts to prove it), but it's like the second her and her bf broke up, she's focused all of her anger and energy on trying to make him feel like a POS for being in a relationship (with me? at all? not sure).

She suffers from depression and anxiety I believe, but honestly he doesn't know the full extent to what she takes medication and sees a therapist for, but knows that she has dealt with mental/emotional issues since high school (she's in her 20's also).  I know that these outbursts are a direct result of her ""not being able to deal with reality"" as he says, but what are the next steps we can take?? I don't even know what to say to him anymore when he calls me saying she's called him 50 times in 15 minutes (he has the call log to prove it) because i changed my profile picture to a picture of us.  Like...should he file a police report? Can someone come take her to a mental hospital? Do we have any kind of legal rights against her here if she's not making direct threats but is essentially harassing him?  Literally don't know what else to do, and it's starting to drain me to the point where I don't want to marry into this and feel that I should break up with him to not deal with this anymore.  Please help.

420,"We have a 15 year old cat that we have had since he was 6 months old. This cat has one good quality (he is super sweet) and about a million terrible ones but, the worst offense, is peeing. He has always been a pee-er. Since about age 2 he started marking and he has never stopped. I’ve tried everything the vets have recommended (feliway, multiple litter boxes, changing food, changing litter, cleaning the box CONSTANTLY) and nothing has worked. Last year, we made our 5th move with this cat into a new home and, already, he is destroying things left and right and the pee problem seems to be getting worse. I made the mistake of getting a blacklight to assess and hopefully mitigate the situation and was horrified to see about 30 pee spots on one rug, near the litter box. This is the worst spot but certainly not the only one in the house.  

I’m at my wits end with this cat and don’t know what to do anymore. At 15 years old it seems cruel to surrender him and force him to live out the remainder of his life in a cage because, who is going to adopt a 15 year old cat that pees everywhere? I honestly just kept hoping he would die of natural causes but he is holding on strong and is in good health which makes the alternative, putting him down, even harder. That said, it seems like the less cruel option. I truly don’t know what to do and, to make matters worse, I can’t seem to talk to my partner about it at all. He is equally frustrated by the situation but any time I try and talk to him about it, he gets angry or shuts down. I feel like he is pushing me into making a hard decision alone that I feel we should be making together. I’m hoping someone might have some ideas or options or even commensurate with our situation and offer advice on how you handled it.

425,"Short background. From earliest memories on to my teens I was sexually assaulted by multiple abusers. Everything up to and including rape.

I've never consentually participated in anything sexual with anyone, nor would I want to. There is too much trauma there so I have purposely avoided intimacy. But I'm male, and with being male comes the reality that the body often doesn't give a hoot what the mind thinks.

Arousal creates a lot of anxiety, and a lot of fears of it being noticed by others when I'm out in public. Then there are doctor visits with physical exams where there would be no chance of hiding it if it were to happen.

I'm in therapy with a trauma counselor and we have talked a little bit about my general anxieties, discomfort with sexuality, etc. I have said I experience anxiety with arousal, but they just nodded and said makes sense and that was all. Nothing more.

I don't know how to come out and just say ""getting a boner freaks me out, what can I do about this"". Talking about it would be so unbelievably crass no matter the language I were to use, and it would create a discussion between my therapist and I that I would be totally uncomfortable having. I can't imagine they would be comfortable talking about that either.

434,"Alright, gotta get some context in here. 

Just started my senior year in high school! Yay! I returned to my old high school (been about two years I was absent), and I got reconnected with my friends and everything seemed to be going well. 

The second day, I met this kid, I'll call him Jim for this. I met him and talked to him a bit. He invited me to sit with him at lunch. When i told my friends I would be sitting with him, they didn't like it. They don't like Jim. I sat with him anyway, since I literally knew nothing about the guy.

So, at lunch, I am sitting with Jim, and, all of a sudden, he just starts talking about his problems. Like, it was out of the blue. Some of the things he ranted on about were depression, anxiety, Asperger's, and seeing a therapist. He then went on to say that he had a hard time keeping friends. I, honestly, a bit taken aback by it. He, right off the bat, trusted me enough to dump all these issues on me. I mean, I can relate to some of the things he struggles with, but I am dealing with some major stressors at that moment. I was too nice to tell him to not talk about that sorta thing, since we just met.

Each passing period, he would hang around my locker, and keep me from getting to my classes. I was almost late to multiple hours, lol. After school, we exchanged phone numbers. He immediately sent me a meme, but when I didn't respond for a few hours, he got worried. I told him I was not good with these types of communications.

The next day, right before first hour, he was hanging around my locker, then my original friend group approached. We chatted for a bit. When they left, he turned to me, and said, ""I think you were ignoring me just now."" In my mind, I'm thinking 'dude, I only for a day why do you think i would be ignoring you?' I told him I wasn't and then he proceeded to say that he believed my friends were ignoring him. I didn't know what to say (cause I know they are avoiding him), but tell him that's between him and them, not me. If he wanted a clear answer, he should talk to them himself and not me.

I tell this to my friends and they say I should avoid him and tell him I shouldn't be friends with him. They begin to tell me some things that happened with them and Jim. 

\*Jim confessed to one of my friends at homecoming (she was with her boyfriend)

\*He always asks why people hate him

\*Apparently, his online friends call him an attention whore

\*He never seems to get better

\*Guilt-trips people so they pay attention to him

I've seen certain negative traits about him. (clinginess, insecurity, maybe a little attention-seeking). All my phone conversations always sway to his problems. I try to be encouraging, but it drains me. I don't want to straight up ignore him because I believe he has good intention (wanting friends), he just doesn't really go about it in the right way.

I want some advice on what to do. I know addressing some of his behavior will a must, I just don't know how to tell him gently.",27Aug2018,20

Hello not a troll and please be respectful,

I am a 23 year old man. For the past year or two I have had ideations of being a stuffed animal. Recently though I have started to be put off to my normal self and I feel a strong urge to be a stuffed animal. Back in the day I used to be a very philosophical person about making the world a better place and seeing how we could perfect a society. Now most of the pull is towards futurism because I feel it provides chance to become a stuffed animal. In a sense this issue is about helplessness and I can be a pretty horny person in a submissive way. Venting things sexually does not work at all. In fact I think it just draws me away from more normal and conventional sexual norms. It’s more about being the object of someone else’s desire that they can enjoy, but in an extreme sense and not like 1-to-1 partnership.

The delusions do somewhat impede my social life. Sometimes I draw away from people and friends in general and deep into thought for weeks or months. The only times these thoughts are broken is when I leave my musings to rant nonsensically about dread and the dysphoria related to not being a stuffed animal. It feels like an existential loneliness because no matter how well other issues go, this still remains in some form. This lack of self-esteem, not respecting myself very much. From what others tell me, I’m not exactly an unattractive person, and I get a lot of compliments for being nice and talkative when at my best. People truly seem to love having me around. But these generally go in one ear and out the other. I don’t feel like the man they think they’re talking to. I feel like a trapped stuffed animal or some other celestial being. Trapped in the ins and outs of daily life and swept under the wind. And this whole world with all of its negativity is the cage restraining me from being who I want to be or even feeling that I can. As good or bad as it may get, when the lights turn out it always returns to this ground state.

I don’t feel any actual desires to harm myself or anybody else other than the normal call of the void, so I don’t think it’s dangerous. It just causes distress sometimes in which case I just tend to draw away from more productive parts of my life in favor of hedonistic pleasures usually drugs or pornography. Of course those just numb the general dissatisfaction for a little while only for the problem to stare me in the face again every morning. And while I like to be a good person and to actually care about others, I feel it causes me to somewhat take them for granted.

Any suggestions or questions would be welcome.",27Aug2018,1
436,"Works been busy. 
We have about 200 people where I am.
In the last month three people including my boss were away. 
Needless to say work backed up.
I did my best to juggle the load but deadlines were missed.
Everyone was back today and we had a progress meeting for one of the jobs.
Almost immediately a junior colleague threw me straight under the bus. ‘I don’t mean to throw anyone under the bus, but take for example X. I can’t do my job if X doesn’t deliver... insert 5 minute rant including swearing about performance.’ 
Watch my boss and the manager of the project try to ask this guy to focus on his own work and concentrate to get results not more conflict.
Everyone knows how busy we’ve been but the colleague felt it nessessary to point me out and no one else. He could have pointed out the manager. The staff member who up and left half way through. His lack of experience in never doing a job like this.
I’ve got about 7 years more experience than him. He’s worked at 4 different companies in 3 years.
I know it’s purely from a lack of professional etiquette and experience.
He doesn’t want his performance to be tied mine.
And rightly so. 
Why work with someone who’s priority isn’t your jobs. You want your jobs to shine, dam his work.
I can see his point of view.
I’m neither the manager of this job or the owner.

Quite frankly - I’ve been working 10 years and have learnt to just do your job to the best of your ability. If it’s not enough, those who deserve it or want it more will simply coast on past you and those who don’t will worth with you.

For some reason though this is really bugging me and I can’t sleep. 

From someone who’s been there and done that. Can I get some successful advice on how to move on? I know that’s exactly what I need to do. He already expressed that he doesn’t want specifically me working on his project and I’m fine with that 100%. I’m fine never being involved on any project with him ever again.

I don’t have the time or mental energy to train or change him. I’m not going to implement some management tool to help monitor work loads. 

I don’t want to be his friend because quite frankly he’s not the sort of person I’d normally hang out with. Completely polar opposites.


So moving forward and developing a working relationship with this person...
I’ve already called my manager in and talked to him about this guys attitude and his response was ‘you’re experienced enough to get over it’ which is right... lol but why am I struggling to let go? 

Are there any hypnosis tips? Training tips? I seem to get into fights with people rarely, but when I do it’s always because of a personality clash and it’s always seems to be explosive. Is it because I let it fester? I don’t speak up enough? 

Do these kinds of people exist in all workplaces? Are there jobs where you can just get along with everyone? 

I work 38 hours a week. I balance that with raising a family and I don’t want to sink in extra hours because I know they aren’t rewarded so it’s about working smarter not harder. 

That said I’m a community leader and have other responsibilities to the profession and head up multiple groups representing the state for all professionals. So it’s hard to see myself as being wrong when so many people look up to me as being right.  I know in this case I was wrong, I over committed and couldn’t deliver. 

TL:DR
Over committed at work, missed a deadline. Coworker/subordinate threw me under a bus. Doesn’t want me working on a project.

439,"Hi guys. 

So I’ve been having a really hard time deciding what I want to go to college (again) for. I initially went for biology, but I was more focused on baseball than real life. 

The reason I chose biology was because I assumed I would figure out what I wanted to do soon enough, and the classes I took would be required for that yet-to-be-decided major anyways. I’d just change my major and keep going, I figured. 

I’ve always had interest in science, which is why I thought I could make that decision without much of an issue. 

Long story short, I was injured and couldn’t keep playing baseball. I then realized how much I didn’t enjoy being at that particular (small, private, very overpriced) school. I also realized I had no idea what I wanted to do as a career, since no more baseball forced me to think about that a lot more. 

I decided to stop wasting money (and time), and didn’t go back after my 4th semester there. I’ve worked for a year now doing cheap general labor, trying to come up with a plan, while paying off student loans and saving the rest. And that brings us to the present day. 

As I said, I’m mainly interested in science. I’ve thought about environmental science, environmental engineering, geology, ecology, and a couple other things. It seems to me that the jobs I could get with these degrees would be either relatively low paying (sub -$60k), unfulfilling, hard to obtain, or a combination of the above. 

A fulfilling career, to me, would be one in which I can use my knowledge and experience (which I have yet to obtain) to help reduce the negative impact of humanity’s consumption on our planet. I’d also appreciate it if I was paid well, but that’s a little less important to me.  

Any advice you guys could give me on how to decide my career path? If you know anyone in your life who works in the environmental field (and enjoys it), please let me know what they do and how they got to that point. Help this young dude figure his life out!

About 3 months ago I started talking to someone I met on r/R4R and we've been talking ever since, becoming very close and even though I don't believe I'm ready for a relationship as of yet (still have some other aspects to improve on) I do see there being something more in the future, whatever happens though I'm very happy to have a friend like that in my life.

443,"Hey Reddit, this my first time doing anything like this so please bear with the potentially bad writing/story telling.

I'll start with the background first. We're a family of 4. Me, my sister, mom &amp; dad. I've moved out about 4 year's ago, making it my mom,dad  and younger sisters living together. Mom and dad divorced about a year ago. The main issue being all three of them still live together in a very toxic environment.

The whole divorce was not a surprise for anyone, except for my dad who couldn't believe it was happening. He's still to this day making excuses about mom is not acting rationally and believes she's going through some kind of menopause/depression and about 20x more other excuses he would try and convince himself, he's a very proud man, being the only one who ""made it"" from his side of the family.

My mom has always had depressive symptoms, coming from an abusive family, and not the kindest of circumstances when growing up in general. Anyway the depression has made her into a person I cannot recognize anymore. Nothing she says or does makes any sense anymore, turned to heavy drinking to escape from the toxic environment that she has to deal with at home, and mostly not being able to deal with my dad.

My father on top of all this has now developed cancer. Luckily he responds very well to the treatment and is now in remedy. But all the chemo and medication has made his whole body into a massive mess. 

Now what grinds my gear the hardest is not how sad and depressing this situation is, it's how it's handled of my parents. My mom being fully aware of how shitty my dad's financial and byrocratical situation is still decided on taking a divorce on him, I'm definitely not saying the should stick together. Them getting away from eachother is the best thing I could have wished for them. It is her attitude off, ""skrew your dad, I couldn't care any less if he lives on the streets with cancer"". She is aware of how hard it is for him to find his own place, as I said his paper work isn't the best. And is absolutely refusing to talk to him whatsoever. 

My dad on the other hand refuses to do anything about the situation, I've offered him jobs and place's to stay, only to be rejected by him, because he has ""a better solution"". Which I know is bullshit, and his ideas always fall flat, again I believe this is his massive non existent pride in the works. And also him being hurt of the divorce, like a teenager going through their first brake up.

They haven't spoken to eachother for they last 6 month's, or rather mom refuses to  speak to dad. Mom drnks non stop, and also believing that dad living in the apartment is her only problem in her life. She refuses to help him find a new place to stay, making me and my sister having to look for apartments for him. My dad is fighting cancer, trying to find a place to stay, but refuses any help, but also not making the situation any better. 

My biggest fear out of this whole ordeal is the mental health of my sister. She just started university, and has to live in that toxic environment day in, day out. I know she loves her studies and I'm scared this will fuck her up for life, because my parents are too big of babies not being able to sort their own divorce up. 

I don't know if this makes any sense, I'm just increadibly confused in what I'm supposed to do, feel or think. Anyone please help me out.

I am of West African Descent, and I had to return back to my country after completing my MBA because I couldn't find a job to push on in Italy. I am 30 and will be 31 in two months. My issue is really that the job market for the food and beverage industry in my country, in particular, is not that great. So to get by, I would have to do more consulting or business. I don't have the experience yet for consulting, so that leaves me with business. I don't have the capital for business. I have negligible savings. But then the other angle, would be to find a job. The thing is there are great jobs in other countries but even though I qualify for the jobs, i am not eligible to apply since I don't possess the visa (I would require sponsorship of some kind or have an employer have to offer me the job ahead of domestic candidates). So I feel trapped. I could probably get a job that is unrelated to my field in my country, but then I feel if I don't start to build towards a career now, its probably gonna be too late for me to get a career in the area I would like.

448,"We are both in college, and we have been living on the same dorm floor, which is partly what makes this situation difficult for me.  In the months after we met, we weren't close (although she remembers this differently), really just mutual friends. However, this summer she started reaching out to me more, and in time, I found that she was struggling with depression. This was all about two months ago. During this time, she became a lot more clingy. As in, calling me everyday, and calling me multiple times in a row when I don't answer (which has become much more frequent, as I am at my wits end here), and when I finally do answer, she interrogates me as to why I didn't pick up the phone, and often becomes angry when I give her excuses.  On top of all this, she frequently will scold  me during our phone calls on things like , how dumb I act (although in a joking tone, I'm not sure that she is joking though?), and how I disappoint her, and that she only calls me because I'm a last resort, etc. All the while she is very attached and demanding when it comes to me and being with anyone else. She seems to feel entitled to all information regarding my life, while I don't feel comfortable sharing most things with her, as I know she talks about other people (she has to me, about some of our closest friends), and I have heard she tends to spread other peoples secrets around. 

What makes this so difficult for me are a few things:

1. She has a tendency to have situations involving her get hugely out of control, and gets very offended easily.
2. We have several mutual friends (who have also tried to distance themselves) and I don't want them to be dragged into this 
3. I know she has very little people she can talk to about her depression. Mostly because she has ""cut them off"" because she believes they have wronged her in some way. I seem to have become a type of support system for her. Which I have no problem doing at all. I truly want the best for her, and I do care about her wellbeing. But all the other stuff that comes with it, is too much for me. She also has a bad relationship with both her parents, so I don't want to leave her all alone. 
4. Lastly, because we live so close to one another, if things turn out badly, it would be extremely awkward and hard to deal with. 

Also, calmly talking about these things with her is almost entirely out of the question, because she cannot handle anything that she perceives as criticism, and she gets very angry and offended very quickly. I feel that we are really too old to be dealing with behavior like this, especially in college, but I also do not  want to start what could become a huge problem with her. What should I do about this? I don't want to hurt her, but I am concerned her behavior will only escalate once we move back on the university campus, and it is already very emotionally draining as it is.

465,"21M and I just graduated college a year early. **I've never had a ton of friends, and was never ""popular"" in HS.** I even recently got rid of my Facebook (except messenger), and the only reason I keep Instagram is for following sports accounts and funny stuff to laugh at. **It was just after a while realizing that no one really cared.** I haven't posted any thing to social media in over two years now...

**But I have a small friend group of 4 other guys that are all close.** We are all a lot a like, we were never the ""popular"" people in high school. Never were partiers, or into any thing like that. **But we get along and are good friends.**

This year we are all a lot busier since I am working FT and they are finishing the last year of college. However, there is one friend that started his grad school program and just turned 21 last month. Since then he's been... douchey? maybe just saying ""the opposite of what I am like"", is more appropriate

###To explain, he's becoming everything I DON'T want to be and everything I hate(d) about college....

I don't like the bar atmosphere at my college. Its a very very very party heavy college, top 5-6 in the country. I always thought of bars as stereotypoe ""Its always sunny in Philly"" Bar. But my college its not. Its LOUD music, girls dancing and wearing hardly any clothes, hardly anywhere to move, LOUD again, and I hate it.

Anyway, I've never been a partier, or that type, but he likes to drink... He's been out every single night for the past month. He's meet a lot of guys in his school program that he goes out with. And they are all stereotype frat guys to the fullest (even though they aren't literally in frats).

###Because of this He's *come off* as more douchey than he normally is to me

**He's always had a bigger ego, but its big time lately.** He has always been about money, but its even more so lately. Talking about how much money he's gonna be making, talking about changing his career goals on a whem just because _____ pays twice as much as ____ so **""why not? I want more money.""**

One of our friends said something about how he was a little ""**cocky last night after he had a few beers. especially with these frat guys""** and his response was the following:

&gt; Look at all the hot ass bitches that these guys pull. I wasted the last 5 years of my life with someone who everyone hated and now I have the people around me that will just hang and have a good ass time. I get that we all look and act like tools. But honestly that’s what I’ve always wanted. I do think that going forward I want to have just us nights and things like that because I still love my boys but I also really like going out and being a tool

which is the exact opposite of me. I don't care about ""hot ass bitches"" I don't want to be a ""tool"" I'm not trying to be anyone. I'm not trying to be known by everyone.

###I can also no longer relate to him because I've never been in a relationship...

**I'm 21 years old and still never held a girls hand. I've never been in a relationship. I'm that loser.** 2 of our friends in our group are already engaged. But the past two months he's talked/texted a solid 6-8 different girls. Now are they interested in him? idk, it seems like half already have other guys. But the point is hearing stories from him about these girls in his life and I have absolutely no way of relating and its depressing to me.

Ever day I wake up without anyone hoping that one day I will be able to say that I do. For the past year I've done everything I can from my career, to dressing nicely, to getting up at 5am to workout to be better, to struggling incredibly hard to try to pick up things I can call talents like guitar or painting. Trying for the love of god to not follow death and all his friends. Only to hear about these stories that make me feel more worthless than before.

We always got along and while in college I felt like everyone was trying to be someone. Except our friend group. I never tried to be anyone, and now I realize that its partly because I'm not anyone and all of this together makes me feel like a ghost in all of this.

468,"Hi there,

So, I'm a 20 year old Dutch student and am looking for a job to do besides my study. I received bilingual education in middle school, making me an official ""near-native English speaker"" (IB-certificate), and now I want to put my knowledge into practice whilst making some money along the way. 

I thought of doing translation work, but noticed you (often?) need certification of a higher level for that to be an option. I looked online and found some open-ended and community-based sites where you could do some translating for a small amount of compensation. Too small, however, in relation to the work, which can be quite demanding at times. Finally, I would have to translate Dutch-to-English and vice-versa. This is not a problem, if it weren't for the fact that Dutch is not a major language, and, as such, there's only a limited amount of offers, especially online.

Other than that, I could not come up with any other possibilities. I live in a small village and, allthough there's a larger one relatively close-by, it's far from being a metropolis. 

Has anyone got any suggestions? 

Thanks in advance.

469,"I'll try to keep this as compact as possible for privacy reasons. I live in a college town in North West America. I quickly gained a reputation for drugs because those were the only people I spent time with. It is a decent sized school of approx. 25,000 students, so there is no way every single person has known about me. In the last few years I developed a problem with uppers and would engage in sex acts for hours, annoying my neighbors in my apartment complex (even though I tried to keep it quiet and thought I was) to the point that even though I'm clean now, they either laugh immediately upon seeing me or refuse to make eye contact entirely and act really uncomfortable. There was also an incident where allegedly a gun fell off my belt at a party and a ton of people saw and I left immediately while apologizing profusely. After that alleged incident almost everyone I recognize acts scared of me whenever they see me in public even though I've never done anything directly physically harmful to anyone and haven't made a violent threat in my life.

I have only 3 friends left in that town and they don't know about these situations. I feel ostracized as hell. Like I'm the black sheep of the whole fucking town. I'm filled with anxiety everytime I leave the house and avoid doing so unless absolutely necessary.  If people don't know about me from the sexual situation or the gun situation, there's still a good chance they know me from the general drug use, as I knew some people higher up in the game and saw a bunch of people come in and out. So naturally, if I find a girl I like, we go on a few dates and then she hears the gossip about me and never contacts me again. This has happened about 5 times already. I'm terrified as to what this could do to a potential career.

There is a city about an hour and a half away that I'm thinking about moving to. But the problem is, a lot of people from that college go on to get jobs there, so everytime I try to find a roomate on the internet, they ghost as soon as I send a link to my social media or tell them my name. I really don't know how far away I need to move to escape my reputation because it embarrasses the hell out of me every time I think about it.

471,"So backstory, my friend Jess has been renting a side apartment from my mom for over a year. It has an adjoining door, but they treat it like a separate wall and stay in their own units.

We're pretty good friends, but I haven't lived in that city for years now and rarely visit. Things were going well, and Jess basically thought my mom was great, and even though we don't talk much, we stayed close.

Then my aunt died, and shit kind of hit the fan. It's the third death in the family in 6 months, and she and my mom were close. Meanwhile, Jess has a lot of issues with anxiety/depression and she isn't really seeing someone for it right now (I don't know if she has the time or money, not sure). My mom was going to be away for about a week for the funeral, so she arranged for my dad (they're separated) to come over and feed the pets. He gets off from work after 9 or 10 most nights and Jess goes to work very early in the morning so she is usually in bed by then. My mom thought she told Jess that my dad would be coming by, but maybe she didn't. After all, her sister had just died, so she was a little distracted.

We went up for the funeral, and my mom was a wreck. The night before, she gets 10 LONG, upset texts from Jess. Jess heard my dad coming into my mom's side of the house, and she didn't know who it was. She almost called the police, and had a massive panic attack over it. And she was upset because he came over late (10 or 11). Over text, it seemed like she was really angry and basically demanding an apology (later to me she said she wasn't angry but that didn't translate well).

My mom got pissed. It's like, midnight before her sister's funeral. She said some nasty things to Jess. Jess says some really horrible things back. A few days later my mom called her and they ""resolved"" it, but really Jess doesn't think she did anything wrong and never apologized, and my mom is hurt and still mad as hell. They haven't spoken much since.

My mom was planning on moving out of necessity, and Jess knew that it would be happening soon. But my mom has recently avoided and ignored Jess because she's still so upset, so until yesterday she didn't tell her anything solid. Then yesterday she gave her 30 days notice to leave. My mom believes Jess is unstable and wants nothing to do with her, because she thinks Jess has the capacity to hurt her emotionally without taking responsibility for her mental health or her actions. Now Jess is freaking out, because she doesn't have a car and suddenly has to move with only the legal minimum requirement for notice.

During all of this I've asked them both to leave me out. It was too much for me to handle around the funeral, and I'm close to both of them and don't want to be pitted against either. Jess had difficulty respecting this at first. Then Jess told me yesterday that she was right and couldn't trust my mom, I told her I was sorry but didn't know what to say. Jess keeps venting to me even though I won't respond. 

I feel like I'm going to lose my friend. I love my mom and know it wasn't healthy for her to be around Jess, and probably unhealthy for Jess to be around her too. Since the funeral, Jess has only talked to me to complain or stress vent about my mom. I feel torn because I want to be there for her, but I feel like 1) she hasn't been there for me recently, and 2) she is forcing me to be AGAINST my mom. I think both her and my mom did shitty things and I wish everything was okay between us, but I dont know what to do. Is there any way I can salvage any of my friendship with Jess?",27Aug2018,2

Should I respond to her post saying it is a fake?  The only people that have commented on it are intrigued and appear to be her real life friends. I worry about embarrassing her. ,27Aug2018,3
