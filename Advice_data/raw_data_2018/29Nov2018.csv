X has been taking deliberate hostile actions specifically targeted towards me. Her actions are increasing in hostility. She has created a hostile work environment for me starting Sept 14, 2018 and it has gotten progressively worse. I have done nothing to provoke these actions, nor will I. 

She was not always hostile towards me. I believe it started because, after I gave her rides to and from work for 10 days with no compensation, I asked if she were to get her car fixed soon. The very next day the hostility began. 

Sept 3rd, 2018

I start giving X rides to and from work

Sept 13, 2018

I stop giving X rides to and from work

Sept 14, 2018

X stops acknowledging my existence. When I say hello I am ignored. When I say goodbye I am ignored. In all aspects I am ignored. This may seem trivial, but the effect of being ignored is a negative one. This behaviour is consistent and continues until present day and extends to closing doors in my face.

X leaves a passive aggressive note directed at me in my work space. A workspace which has been operated by me, mon - fri from 6am-230pm, for over a year. The message read ‚ÄúSharing is caring. Drop the attitude‚Äù. I have no attitude and have done nothing to provide cause for her actions. In fact, I walk around with a smile on my face and openly talk about how much I love and appreciate my job. I literally have told every person I know how much I love this job. I got my best friend a job here on the sole premise that this is the best job I‚Äôve ever had. My attitude towards it has never changed.

2. X raises her arm into the air above her head and gives me the middle finger as I operate the booth all in front of customer at the busiest time of operational hours. This is prompted by zero interaction with each other.",29Nov2018,1

Hi!

11,"We currently have a newly promoted RGM at our restaurant. She sucks at making schedules and would sometimes only schedule three people to work a whole shift. One of the days, I was scheduled to work ten hours and leave at 4pm. It was already 4:30 when I asked if I can clock out even though there was still so much to do, I was tired and worked 10 hours. She said no I'm not allowed to leave till I finished everything. This could have been easily done by the next oncoming shift if she hasn't scheduled all trainees that barely knew anything yet. The next day everyone was telling me I walked out when. I clocked out past my scheduled time and specifically said no when asked to stay back. After this, she posted many things about me in the work group chat and said we will have a manager meeting about my behavior.

Since shes worked with us she has a close friend that's actually walked out in the middle of her scheduled shift and nothing was said or done about it. Supervisors tried to get her suspended but the RGM wouldn't approve it.

One of the days I was told to work till 1am and come back again 5am since her friend was not feeling good. I was willing to do it but during the day her friend called in I saw them walk in the restaurant together and stayed there to hang out, she was not sick at all. Our own boss let her call in and pretend shes sick even though she knew she wasn't and told someone to take her shift without being asked.

27,"4 years ago, I left an amazing job that I often regret leaving. 

&amp;#x200B;

 It was a few hours from our hometown.   I left because my wife had got a new job in our hometown and we wanted to be near family in the midwest.  So I followed her there because there was a job position for me nearby.   I started working at my new practice an,d it was very tough on me emotionally.  It was a lot of hours and a ton of stress.  I often feel the ill effects of the stress.  That being said, I survived and managed the workload.  After 4 years, I was promoted to partner and I will get a little more vacation and be compensated very well.  I am now the primary breadwinner in our household.   It is nice being partner however, I do think I will  still  leave after a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past few years, I have kept in touch with my old job about possibility going back at some point.    Ironically, a few days after I was promoted to partner, I got an offer to go back to my old job.    So now, I'm back at a crossroad in my life.    Yes, I will make less money but the job is MUCH better.  I think its worth it.  I would be a much happier person day to day.   I would do it without hesitation if I was single.   I also have concern leaving immediately after partnering into a group.   I know I will burn that bridge.    However, on the other hand, I don't know if my old job will ever offer me another chance if I end up declining them a second time.  

&amp;#x200B;

Adding to this complication, is that we are expecting our first child and  obviously my wife doesn't want to leave our hometown because both our parents live here.  I understand the incredible help it is to have grandparents nearby.   My wife is still very supportive of me and told me that we will make it work whatever I decide.   So here I am.

29,"Hello everyone, 

Before I get labeled as pretentious based off of my title, let me get my main points down:

1. Our school has a weird grading system with ranges instead of specific numbers.

2. I had the exact same lines of code as the girl to the left of me because she asked me to show her what exactly the teacher was teaching us. All she did was put in a different image than me; otherwise, we had the same thing because this was a very simple assignment. I got a high 70 while she got a high 90. 

3. I follow the rubric exactly as written and he only made changes to make things harder for me during this assignment, interrogating me about things that he didn't bother asking my classmates about when grading them.

4. This isn't the only time this has happened. The girl next to me was relieved when she got some multiple choice questions completely incorrect and the teacher didn't deduct marks from her; however, he once failed one of my smaller assignments because my writing was messy. I, however, had written my correct answers in a box as neatly as possible because we were never told that neatness of solutions contributed to marks; in addition, we were only performing binary arithmetic. 

5. The guy in front of me had nearly nothing, so the teacher promised him a bit more time. He cheated when there were 10 minutes left before the end of class and the teacher stated that it was a bit suspicious, but still gave him a 90.

6. I spent a great deal of time on this subject to appease my teacher, but the students around me are getting higher marks than me even when they make more mistakes than me. It's really frustrating.

Grades are genuinely important to me as I want to get an academic award, but I don't want to sound pretentious by saying ""so-and-so got a higher mark than me even though we had the same code!!!"" Any advice? ",29Nov2018,1

I visit him every weekend, and sometimes on a week day and leave early the next morning to get to school. My bf doesn't travel much to where I am bc we would have to get a hotel and that get's expensive.

Though the train ride isn't fun and long commutes are tiring, I don't mind it. Sometime I think about how I used to live so close to my ex (30 min away) and I would HATE the travel, but with my current bf I'm just happy to see him. However, no matter how many times I tell my bf that I don't mind, he still feels terrible, and wont ask me to come hang out with him. He feels bad that sometimes I literally travel 4 hours to spend 12 hours with him, in which we sleep about 7-8 hours.

She's got several pets, including dogs, cats, and rats so finding a rental was not going well. She moved into a friend's garage and has been living there. 

However, it's an awful situation. The friends mom is a paranoid hoarder. The garage has no heat and cannot run enough electricity to stay warm. She and her animals are not in a good situation or safe. 

She works full-time and has several part-time gigs but is having trouble qualifying for a home loan or finding a place that is affordable and suitable in her area.

38,"To give a little context, I'm an account manager at a software company. I'm also a full time student about to graduate (15 credits) and I also have a weekend job that's typically 10 hours on a saturday or friday. 

I started this new job as an Account Manager about a month ago, they hired me while I am still in school and gave me a part time schedule, 3 days a week. 

Needless to say, I am extremely busy and can barely find time to do my homework while juggling all this work and I feel like I'm not ""getting"" my job fast enough. 

I've only been in the office 12 times, and I haven't had too much direct training. They want me to pick it up on my own time during the work hours, through shadowing and reading etc...

The problem is I feel like I'm having a hard time remembering all the information I'm taken in. The company I work for has a massive line of products, and the one I'm specializing in utilizes about 5 of them. All of them are in a field I'm basically unfamiliar with. 

I had to run a demo meeting today and all though I got a lot of positive feedback from my boss and peers, I ultimately missed some very basic and important stuff that I really had no reason to forget aside from just not sleeping and forgetting (I slept 2 hours last night and had to present). 

My boss told me I'm about 70% of the way there today, but I'm still worried that I'm not picking it up fast enough. I have decent anxiety that I've learned to suppress over the years but it's starting to flare up, especially at this new job. 

It's a very good company and I don't want to blow it. Am I worrying over nothing? I don't think my boss particularly likes me, even though he's the one who hired me, but I have nothing to really back up his dislike of me aside from feeling like I'm outside of the little click he has with some of the account managers. That could be because I'm new, but I'm just worrying, I don't want to mess it up. 

Also, these 12 days have been spread over the course of a month so I'm having a hard time remembering what I learned the day before given that I have a grueling class shedule in my off days and then a weekend gig on top of that.

41,"BACKSTORY
About a year ago a few dudes and I were about to smoke at a spot that we usually do. My one friend named Max called asking for a lighter and for me to roll his blunt and I just asked if he wanted to match instead. He was kinda hesitant saying like I might just wanna smoke at my house. I was 100% fine with that. I told him yeah do whatever you are most comfortable with and offered the option of bringing him home if he couldn‚Äôt drive. I said this STUPIDLY thinking nothing would happen because he‚Äôs drove high before! I also asked if he would want us just to pick him up so he didn‚Äôt have to bring his car. He ended up coming but wanted to drive his car for a reason I forget. Showed up and everything was going smoothly until we were finishing up smoking. Me and Max shared a blunt while my other friends shared another. All of the sudden he says ‚Äúhey I can‚Äôt see anything‚Äù I was like what? What do you mean you can‚Äôt see anything? I thought he was talking about out in the distance because it looked he was looking intensely at something far away. He then said ‚Äúeverything is black‚Äù I immediately got kinda scared and was like woah hold on just sit down for a bit... before I could help him down he fell backward into the side of the shed we were behind, hit his head, and fell to the ground flailing his body. I knew he wasn‚Äôt seizing up because he was making controlled movements just in a spastic sequence. He army crawled all the way to a dumpster like 12 ft away and we were all like what is going on right now.... we got him on his feet and his movements were that of a drunken stupor or something. Couldn‚Äôt walk straight, didn‚Äôt form complete conversations, was pale as could be, and was paranoid as could be. He insisted he needs to get home so in my panicked state I tried just sitting him in his car to relax. Things didn‚Äôt get any better and weren‚Äôt looking like it was going to be that way for a while. 

INCIDENT
I was panicking hard core and ended up having to drive his car home. Here‚Äôs the thing. When he got there he essentially parked in an impossible spot. It wasn‚Äôt even a parking spot... He parked where it was perfectly lined up with a guard rail 6-7 feet behind the car. I did not realize this at the moment because it was dark and I was panicking. Completely overlooked. So as I was in reverse trying to get just enough space to put her and drive and adjust I run into something.... the BARRIER. The metal edge drove into the bumper and lower part of the trunk lid. Even at the time I was like wtf was that because it wasn‚Äôt visible from any mirror in the car. From the perspective of inside the car it looked like it was flat and completely paved behind me... it wasn‚Äôt. 

FACTORS
We have talked about this a good amount and we both agreed upon me giving him $200 to help out with the accident. I have continuously reassured him I‚Äôm getting him that money. And until I got him the money I made a vow to myself that I would help him in any shape or form. See I‚Äôm a high school student with a part time job. Although $200 does not seem like a lot it has been hell trying to gather it for him. This eats away at me but I essentially live off my own income excluding me living at my dads place (free shelter). Food, gas, water, etc are all paid for by myself and Max understood this. I am paycheck to paycheck which is hard especially considering my area really won‚Äôt pay a 17 year old more than $9 and hour. My latency on paying him is my fault and non other that mine. The problem comes into play when he just texted me a few days ago saying he wants me to pay $1500 for the damages to his car before we graduate. This is something I simply cannot do. I will never be able to save up that kind of money in that timespan.
 
CONCLUSION 
I realize I have many fuck ups in the story such as my fault in crashing, not getting him $200 quick enough, and probably more that you guys will point out. I guess my point of view is kind of stubborn. I really don‚Äôt want to pay this kid $1500. He‚Äôs been a dick to me and the main thing is that no body forced him to smoke with us. No body held a gun to his head? I guess I think that if he was willing to come smoke with us he should‚Äôve known his limits and been more mature about smoking. I didn‚Äôt HAVE to drive him home, yes I mentioned driving him, but I also mentioned picking him up. The biggest thing is that if kid had to get home and couldn‚Äôt get caught by his parents high why did he smoke with us in the first place? &amp; why do I have to pay $1500 for only trying to help him out so he didn‚Äôt have to get behind the wheel and end up killing himself in a car crash. I GET IT. I crashed the car so I should pay the $15000 blah blah blah but we already agreed upon $200?? Why not just leave it at that. Because I‚Äôm completely willing to pay $200. Just not $1500

Idk what do you guys think... sorry this is so long! Just wondering what you guys would do in this situation

I‚Äôm harbouring resentment for all of them because I think that they‚Äôre self absorbed, willingly ignorant, and deceptive‚Äîeven the best of them. When I try to express myself, I become passive aggressive or just too emotional to the point where no one takes me seriously. So I‚Äôve fallen increasingly quiet over the years. This doesn‚Äôt bode well for my significant other who is nothing short of an alien to my family as he is of a different race and culture. I don‚Äôt help with integrating him much because my standing is no better. If he and I don‚Äôt work out, this will be why.

I‚Äôd like to be warm, loving, accepting and willing to share with them my perspectives and advice in a way that is non-judgemental so that they don‚Äôt have their defence up. The reality is, I‚Äôve never been that, and there‚Äôs a chance I never will be.

I think it‚Äôs inevitable I‚Äôll have to lead a double life. This is what I both fear and look forward to. I think I‚Äôd be happy if I could at least partially express myself to my family and not feel so tense all the time. But if I can‚Äôt do that now, when will I?

So there is this pair of hobnockers that I work with. The woman (in her mid thirties) is married and has children (not with the guy I mention). The man (19) is nice enough I guess. So basically everyone I work with, myself included, call them ""the couple"". They are SUPER blatant about the fact that they are cheating with each other. They are ALWAYS together, sometimes they even match outfits. It is well known that they use work to cheat with each other, after every shift they go out to whoever's car and have sex, then she goes  home to her husband. People have even caught them outside of work (when they both called in claiming to be sick) eating out in public. She literally has a kid only 3 years younger than him. I guess what I need advice about is, should I attempt to contact her husband and inform him about what is going on? I have been cheated on before and everytime I see them it just makes my blood boil, and all I can think about is her poor husband. Would it be bad to track down her husband and tell him?

I told him one night I needed to cancel our plans because I'm getting feelings for him (i could tell they weren't reciprocating). I said I didn't want to ruin the friendship and he replied saying he likes us being friends and it was courageous of me to tell him.

Fast forward a few weeks, we're back to normal. He talks to me of messenger pretty much every day, we're helping each other in class and hanging out as a group with another guy. Everythings great. Till he started a conversation about him wanting a girlfriend to travel with, that he was going to have an open mind about women, and he was feeling ""desperate to find a girlfriend"". I personally felt it was insensitive to say to me after what I had been through, which I kind of pointed out, but nether-the-less continued with the conversation. Which honestly made me feel like he found me ***so*** unappealing I didn't match his already low ""desperate"" bar. But I let that thought pass and continued on with the friendship.

We reach today and I'm perplexed. I'll see him and enjoy his company throughout the day, then i'll go home angry that I'm putting myself through unnecessary pain being around him.

56,"TL;DR: Girl I knew in high school is clearly interested in me. I am not immediately interested in her and am scared of taking up a potential date offer because she might start to feel for me and I will not be able to reciprocate it. At the same time, I‚Äôm lonely and want someone to spend time with. 

I graduated high school earlier this year and haven‚Äôt really talked to anyone from school since, didn‚Äôt really care.

I‚Äôve begun talking with a girl who I went to school with, we never talked a ton. She‚Äôs nice for the most part and I think she‚Äôs a good person to talk with. 

We‚Äôve started talking quite a bit, just casually but I can tell she‚Äôs interested in me (in some form). She threw out the idea of going to a movie a while ago, and I have yet to take that offer up, because I‚Äôm very conflicted.

I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend and any attempts I‚Äôve made in the past have been next to nothing, I honestly just hate the idea of dating in general (dating apps and such). On one hand, I like being alone over everything, it‚Äôs always been better for me. I avoided a lot of dumb shit in high school because of it, on the other hand, I‚Äôm lonely and want someone to share my time with.

I think I could definitely handle it, I have a job, a car, I could easily make time for someone to share time with.

Issue is, I‚Äôm not immediately attracted to this girl. This is my fear with a relationship, I just would feel so out of place if I end up asking her out and don‚Äôt like it, yet she might get attached and I will then be in an absolutely horrible situation, the last thing I want is to break someone‚Äôs heart.

And I know it would be that way because I know she‚Äôs giving me signs. She‚Äôs always saying ‚ÄúI wish I had someone to cuddle with‚Äù and I know she wants me to reciprocate that but I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt lie to her.

I can tell she‚Äôd be clingy, emotional, and constantly want my attention. I‚Äôm not entirely prepared to do that because I don‚Äôt truly feel for her. And if I ended up saying it isn‚Äôt working out and called it off, it would crush her. 

At the same time, I want this so bad. I want to spend my time in a meaningful way. I‚Äôve beckoned for positive change in my life forever now and this could be my chance, I can‚Äôt waste away in my room anymore.

I should make up my mind by Friday if I want to ask her out, I might see that things go well. It might go exactly the way I expect it. Hell, she might not even give a shit about me and just treat me as a friend the whole time and I‚Äôd feel stupid for typing all this out and doing it in the first place.

I know she had a shitty ex who used her and broke her heart in the past, and I really don‚Äôt want to add on to that. I feel like it‚Äôs almost better if I purposely avoid her, for her and my own good.

Sorry for this long ramble. I‚Äôm just so confused on this shit right now and I‚Äôd love to hear any feedback people might be willing to give me.

57,"My friend Nick visited me in LA from Asia and rented a car from Dollar Rental. He made his booking online for $511 and when he went to pick up the car, he purchased the cheapest insurance and took the agent's offer of $60 for a newer vehicle upgrade. He signed off the paper work and took off (he didn't check his receipt at this point).

&amp;#x200B;

After 12 days, Nick went to return his vehicle and received a $2300 receipt (in addition to the $511 he already paid) See below for breakdown of cost.

**vehicle upgrade $60per day = $720**

**liability, insurances, premium road side assistance: $786.60**

(LDW @ 31.99 per day + LIS $17.58 per day PAI,PEC @ 6.99 per day  + premium RD SVC $8.99 per day )

**concession fee recovery (I was told this was an airport fee) $253.52**

**tablet GPS: $263.88**

**other taxes and fees: $276.21**

**total: $2300 + $511 rental =$2811**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming the agent took advantage of Nick being a tourist and not being perfect in English. But Nick is not stupid and definitely didn't sign up for $60 PERDAY upgrade and specifically chose the cheapest insurance option. Do agents get commission? How do they charge more for an upgrade than the cost of rental? The upgrade was just for a newer model of Mustang - it wasn't no Mercedes that's for sure. 

I already called Dollar - they transferred me 2 times, hung up on me once, wouldn't give me the contact number to the LAX location. All they told me was that the receipt was signed by Nick, therefore he approved the charges and there is nothing they can do.

I understand it's Nick's fault for not checking the receipt but this is ridiculous. What are my options to fight this and get some of the charges back? I can't believe he got charged $2800 for a 12 day Mustang rental . Any advice will be helpful!!!

62,"Hi there Reddit! I don't post often and am a career Reddit lurker. I wanted to reach out because I am always blown away by how insightful some of the people on this site can be, and was looking for a bit of assistance with a problem of my own.   


I have a short fuse.   
Patience has never been my strong suit, and I am a type-A worker. I currently work as a Project manager at a small digital agency and part time at a certain video game retailer for funsies. The problem that I have is with my own personality. I can be a pretty sensitive guy and get really upset over minor inconveniences or overwhelmed by challenges I don't see coming. So many of my reactions to things can be handled better with an improved attitude. My main job is chaotic and ever changing and I try as hard as i can to be adaptable, but sometimes my lack of patience slips through or I get overly negative about things that I don't really need to be negative about.  I know I'm a downer and want so badly to contribute at work and socially at the same level my more positive peers do.   
Lately at work I can sense that I'm being handled ""delicately"" and my supervisors are saying things like ""deep breathes!"" if they sense my agitation.   


I have a great job, a great partner of six years, two dogs, and live comfortably. Theres no reason I should be as ...I dont know...jaded?

I'm hoping for some advice on how to be more patient with the people and situations around me and inject a little positivity in my life. What kinds of things have helped you ""slow down"" in the moment and handle things more gracefully then I have. Currently my coping method for working out negative energy is going to the gym and throwing around heavy ropes and tires, but thats a ""later"" catharsis, and Im looking for something I can incorporate into ME rather than an hour of my daily routine... I hope that makes sense.   


Also, yes, before anyone asks, I have tried the therapy thing and was seeing a very helpful therapist for a number of months. I found it helpful for dealing with my not so pleasant childhood, etc. but didnt get much help in this particular department. I guess I'm looking for alternative methods. Mantras, mental exercises, and such.   


Anyway this was kind of just a mind dump (sorry I dont do this often), but am happy to provide additional details and answer any questions.

Then came my girlfriend who I love an immeasurable amount. She began to take his place, she started staying at mine frequently leaving him behind to a degree. A combination of this and his excessive drinking over the summer break lead us to drift gradually apart but never disconnect entirely. Then in September my girlfriend started having issues with her mother which resulted in her staying at mine for a few nights, time in which I had dedicated to my friend. I told him she might need to come because she could not go home and had to stay with me, he said he would not go if that was the case. I called him unfair and stated that she was clearly being abused, he said 'I don't care'. This obviously hurt me so I took a break from him for a few weeks, upon talking again he maintained that it was a genuine mistake and he absolutley resented himself for saying that. My girlfriend had none of this, she told me that if I resumed my friendship properly she would have nothing to do with me and essentially reduced me to the point of a close friendship to a very distant and strained friendship. She has even told me I'm not allowed to get the bus with him leaving me to see him purely upon circumstance at college. We have talked frequently about this and every time I bring it up she either argues profusely or cries.

&amp;#x200B;

 Long story short 2018 has been awful for me and my family. I am between jobs after graduating in May and am doing r/beermoney and selling extra stuff to pay my bills. I am interviewing and applying for jobs and have had bad luck with jobs. But I am trying every week to get hired. My family is a mess at the moment over job, health, vehicle, and property issues. It is another story every week and to keep up with my family is becoming a reality tv show. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am stressed beyond belief over all of this and do not know how to handle this situation. I am planning on hanging out with a friend this weekend, and another one in the coming weeks and do not want to dump on them. Both of these friends I have not seen for awhile so there are tons of stuff to catch up on.

How do you guys handle being overwhelmed over your life situation?",29Nov2018,1
69,"  

I'm a 26-year-old felon. Like the title states, I have no idea what to do. In 2015 I was charged with Wanton Endangerment, 1st degree. To avoid a jury trial, I pled guilty in 2016 and have been labeled as a ""violent offender"" ever since. I didn't server any jail time, but I'm still under probation. I do have the option to expunge this since it's a felony diversion in Kentucky, but I can't do anything about it until mid-2021. This is literally the ONLY criminal charge I have ever had.

I graduated college in December 2016 with a BS in Information Technology, but the problem is that I pled guilty just before graduation. So, as I try to use my degree to find employment, the background checks all come back that I'm still under probation and no employer is interested. I can't even break into my field since I have no professional network and zero professional experience in the field. I thought getting my CCENT and CCNA would be assistance, but employers don't seem to care. I have no trouble landing interviews and I do great during the interviews, but I always get rejection emails stating interest in other potential candidates ""despite my background and qualifications"". I know it has to be a combination of my felony, lack of experience in the IT field, and two-year gap since graduation. Potential employers do background checks and see that I'm some danger to society, which is in no way accurate as to who I am. It was just a bad situation that was blown out of proportion. 

It has been nearly two years since graduation and I'm stuck working just above minimum wage at a part-time job I absolutely despise. The only other jobs I can find are more part-time restaurant positions, which I have worked in the past and I know I'll hate if I quit my current job. I can't even make enough money to reasonably expect to move out of my parents' home. I can't just move somewhere else due to my probation's travel restrictions. I can't go back to school since I don't have enough money (and I'm not willing to go into debt). I can't find employment in my field and my other passion, gunsmithing, is illegal for me to do. My backup plan of joining the military is no longer an option since I'm still under probation and they're unlikely to hand out a felony waiver after I can get my record expunged. My other interests aren't even remotely marketable. Don't give me the spiel of ""Start a business/invent something"". That's complete bullshit. 

On top of it all, my girlfriend broke up with me today. I'm at absolute wits' end and I don't know what to do. Is there anyone that has had a similar experience? I feel so alone, broken, and worthless. No one in my family or circle of friends has ever had a criminal charge, let alone a violent felony, so they can't relate, as much as they try. I'm so used to having an answer for everything, but this felony I can't shake has ruined everything I've worked so hard for. I don't see what any other options are. What would any of you suggest?

71,"Hi guys, I have no idea whether this is the place to post. it may be a little too heavy for this thread.

I just moved in with my boyfriend. We have been together for a year but we haven't seen each other much during this time because he goes on work related trips often. Moving in together was also an attempt to bring us closer because our schedules are difficult. I'm now about 3 weeks into the new living situation and its beginning to dawn on me that, although I m naturally very cautious, I may not have been cautious enough... I see a lot of good things in him: extreme intelligence &amp; creativity, hilariously funny, very warm, generous and kind-hearted but I m terrified these qualities came with a high price.

He has some type of hoarder problem. The way he is messy is unlike anybodies worst mess Ive ever seen. its like his brain doesn't hold on to concepts of orderliness, he doesn't understand that things have a permanent place. I am a very clean person and he knew beforehand that one of my primary conditions to agree to the move was for him to clean up his act. Lets just say, I have been doing the most of that work since I've been in the shared flat and one room in the apartment still looks like a trash dump.

Furthermore, he has narcolepsia which causes him to have a pretty insane wake up/nighttime routine where he snores like hell during the night to the point where i need to change beds &amp; he needs to snooze a million times in the morning &amp; eventually has to take Ritalin to stay awake for the day. He has had this condition his whole life yet it appears he still hasn't learned how to handle it properly and basically every day is a unique struggle. Its also impossible for me to wake him up, he gets like a stubborn toddler and doesn't remember a thing later. I guess its due to his condition and I can't blame him for not being reactive.

But wait, there is more. He doesn't take care of his health. he hasn't seen a dentist in over 3 years. He will frequently have health problems like bad breath, extreme snoring, stomach problems and more but he will never manage to make doctors appointments telling me either that he is scared or that he simply cannot keep appointments and will forget them or doesn't know how to make them (we are in Germany, healthcare is free).

He never works out. He doesn't know how to cook. Doesn't want to see a therapist. He basically lacks every single skill when it comes to self care &amp; home care. We are both 26. He lied to me about basically the things mentioned here, making it sound way less bad, making excuses.

He does, however, have a well-paying job which he manages to keep despite the narcolepsia. Keeping this job seems to be about the only thing he can manage. When he comes home he is absolutely exhausted and just passes out mentally.
But what happened today was some next level stuff and its actually the main reason I m posting here. The problems I have described here could be solved practically, theoretically. I help him although I fucking hate being a mom/therapist and my attraction suffers. Yet, I still had hope.

Today, however, something else happened which I don't know how to solve. A group of his work colleagues/friends came over to our apartment today and things turned weird very quickly. His friends also know him as an eccentric weirdo and have developed a thick skin but today was different. Firstly, he told them they needed to hang out in the one messy room in our apartment because he thought I would not want guests in the clean rooms. That is too weird to even wrap my head around. Moreover, when we are in the company of others, he constantly talks in the weirdest ways to me, constantly asking me whether I'm ok and just says the most random things to the point of embarrassing me.

Yesterday, I had a private talk to him about him slowly balding and carefully suggested he may cut his hair off some time in the not-too-far-away future. This talk was of utterly private nature and it happened in a loving and a looking-out-for-each-other manner.

When we went out to dinner with his colleagues/friends, he suddenly blurted out ""I'm balding, guys. Should I cut my hair off?""- and everybody went dead silent. I was just staring at him in disbelief. The mild inappropriate affect he displays often reached peak levels.

He somehow confused our private relationship content with something appropriate to tell a crowd. He has done this multiple times before but never as bad. It makes me scared for the things he tells his colleagues about my private life and the things I don't want people to know.

But the worst thing is, it makes me scared for his mental health. display of inappropriate affect is a very serious indicator of mental illness or personality disorder.

Overall, I m super overwhelmed and its all slipping away from me. I was hoping so much that I had finally found somebody who I could be serious with but i m starting to have serious doubts...

**TL;DR: Just moved in with my boyfriend who lied to me about having his life way more together than it turned out. On top of practical things, I'm now also worried for his mental health. It overwhelms me and I don't know what to do.**",29Nov2018,1

74,"My (29m) gf (25f) and I met in the summer and hit it off instantly. It was magic, the chemistry was amazing. She left for Europe for a gig she was signed up for. She left the gig after two months, and decided she wanted to see me. Two days after she left the gig I flew to Amsterdam to meet her. We spent the next 2 months with no plans, going wherever our hearts desired. We did have our alcohol infused arguments every once in a while, and I feel like not a lot of them were resolved, but only swept under the rug, and why not we were in Europe.

 I footed the bill for most of the trip, dinners, massages, Opera Tix, Broadway shows, the whole nine. I was convinced she was all in and this was it. There was a time, about our 4th country in, the sex started slowing down from a few times a day, to maybe once or twice a week. When I asked her about it she said she just wasn't in the mood. She became kind of distant, on her phone a lot more than the beginning, if I asked her about it, she'd claim I was having trust issues. I knew she had a lot of guy friends, and was still close friends with one of her exes. But I still never accused her.

We talked about the future, and plans to be together, future plans, future trips, we were all in.

After 8 countries and countless adventures and memories we headed back to the States. We were planning on going back to separate States with intentions on linking up once we got everything in order. I asked her before we left Europe if she was still serious about us and the relationship and she assured me she 100% was. With that knowledge and reassurance I purchased us tickets and a hotel in NYC so we could spend a few more days together. We went to Broadway shows and comedy clubs, museums and nice bars. Knowing the end of our amazing trip was near we started to feel sad. 

Fast forward a few days, and I barely hear from her. Maybe a short text here and there. No substance, no emotion. About a week and a half after our returns home I confront her on her lack of effort to stay in touch and it becomes this whole deal about how she needs to work on herself. I thought it was fine to do so, but why not still be committed or make an effort to try anyways. I thought it was a lame excuse.

Anyways, no contact for a week now, we've broken up. I don't know what happened really. I'm lost. I don't know if there was someone else and she thought maybe the grass was greener. But I'm a mess, I thought I had found her, but now I'm feeling used and abused, and lonely.

My friends are tired of seeing me like this, I'm sick of feeling hollow and empty. I literally would have done anything for this girl, and I think she knew it, but somehow it just wasn't enough.

How do I feel normal again? Should I reach out to her?

TLDR: Flew to Europe to meet my gf, after an amazing 2 months going to 8 countries, she ghosted me.",29Nov2018,1
76,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

You guys probably get this sort of post pretty frequently, so I'll only bore you with the important details -

&amp;#x200B;

I have two years of French experience and dabble in basic, amateur animation. I don't have any of the ideal equipment (yet, I'll be getting a drawing tablet on Christmas) I would need to expand on this. I love animation more than I love French, but I still love both and I dream of being bilingual and travelling Europe at some point in my life. I understand that in order to accomplish these things it will take a lot of time, money and effort.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm curious to know - if I were to major in animation in college, how would this become viable apart from freelance work or YouTube? I would love to be able to support myself on those two alone (one of my biggest inspirations is Alan Becker but I'm pretty sure even he doesn't live solely on that), but I want something stable. I don't really want to become a French teacher, I want to be more of a translator, if I were to go with French instead.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion - what should I do? Thank you all in advance for the advice.

For 3-4 weeks we‚Äôve been trying to schedule, but our schedules never cross in a way were we are both free. What makes it worse is these types of conversations that happen now didn‚Äôt happen at first, but they are getting really odd. I‚Äôll say I can‚Äôt meet a specific day because I have school at that time (and have mentioned I have school at that time many times before), but the next text is ‚Äòso can you meet‚Äô? At first I thought it was a misunderstanding, now I wonder if they‚Äôre ignoring every other word. 

When they suggest a place to meet it‚Äôs always a LONG trip for me (over an hour round trip) with no ideas on what we could do once I get there. Our houses are around 20 minutes away from each other and we could both drive 10 minutes to meet in the middle. After I point that out they‚Äôll offer to drive to me, but it‚Äôs a weird reversal and leaves me with an odd feeling. 

The fact that it‚Äôs taken this long to meet again makes me question if it‚Äôs even slightly realistic to build a relationship. They seem to only hear every other word and have asked (what I consider to be) inappropriate questions (for example I got sick for a few days with a mild code, they started questioning a lot about medication). 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is frustration on there part the same way it is on my part, or why it‚Äôs starting to go ‚Äòsour‚Äô on my end. Either way I have a few questions for people who are impartial.

1) Is this relationship even worth attempted to continue? 
2) If it is not how can I ‚Äòuntangle‚Äô this and stop the relationship?

99,"Before seeing each other in real life, I‚Äôve met him just about year ago through a video game. He‚Äôs 23, I‚Äôm 20. The more I got to know him, the more feelings I developed for him. I know it was weird for me to say I had feelings for someone I had never personally met. We were pretty much very similar people, although he‚Äôs the more determined successful one out of the two of us. Similar tastes in games, music. We come up with the same ideas etc. 

We had a bit of a flirtatious phase that went on from December last year to about mid year 2018. I confessed how I liked him back in April, but it didn‚Äôt seem like he showed any interest back. Soon after that I didn‚Äôt want what we were doing anymore and I thought there was no point continuing it, so we decreased and had minimal contact up until about September where we just caught up with each other and had a laugh about the bad dates we had in the meantime. Shortly after, he confessed that he‚Äôs liked me the whole time but didn‚Äôt want to do anything about it because he had a lot going on. I was focused on another guy from Tinder at this point, so it didn‚Äôt matter too much to me back then and was rejecting any advances he was doing. 

3 weeks later, Tinder guy broke my heart and I was crying to him, he was there for me, like he was when I had a huge problem with my father at home. I still thought of him as a friend and forgot about anything that could happen between us two like I did in the past.

We managed to keep everything friendly and casual up until a month ago, and somehow we picked up from where we left off. I don‚Äôt know why I let it go down that route, but then he announced he was visiting my country to travel. Deep down I was excited at the thought I would see him, but I tried to brush it off because I was scared to get hurt and thought that maybe we wouldn‚Äôt get along like we did online. But my feelings were starting to be rekindled.

Then 2 days ago, I finally saw him. Everything went so much better than expected. He hugged me and kissed me at the airport, and we pretty much acted like a couple the whole 2 days we were together. We would kiss and hold hands in public places. Hug each other randomly. I remember the two of us agreeing before his trip here that we would keep things casual and see where it goes... But I‚Äôve never felt so comfortable with anybody and that I could be myself. I instantly felt ‚Äúat home‚Äù with him. We would cuddle and he‚Äôd kiss me on my forehead and my lips, and those kisses genuinely felt they were full of love. And it was also the first time I had sex with somebody that felt I had a genuine connection with and truly liked the person I was doing it with.

I thought I could suppress my feelings and wouldn‚Äôt be worried this much about him, but after laying in bed with him last night I realized ‚Äúthis is gonna hurt like a bitch when he leaves‚Äù, and my feelings are stronger than ever before. 

I didn‚Äôt want to say anything because I know we are both scared of the ending if this doesn‚Äôt work out, especially with his PhD/tight schedule and my fear of getting heartbroken, and overly strict parents. We‚Äôve both been single for a while. 

Now that he‚Äôs gone to continue his travel all across the country, I really miss him so much. But I‚Äôm scared he feels much less than what I‚Äôm feeling for him, and I don‚Äôt want this to be a one-way street. I know timing and distance can be a bitch, but I feel like there‚Äôs no way I can back out from what I‚Äôm feeling for him now and I wish I could stop. I don‚Äôt know if whatever happened in those 2 days meant anything to him. What do I do? I don‚Äôt want to get hurt. 

TLDR; Met videogame ‚Äúfriend‚Äù in real life 2 days ago after a year. Had on/off feelings for him and he turned out to be an even more amazing person in real life but I don‚Äôt think we can be together due to circumstances. I think I‚Äôm falling in love and it‚Äôs unexpected. I don‚Äôt know what to do because I know this is going to somehow end in heartbreak ",29Nov2018,1
102,"I am a 28yo, single, Caucasian male and I have lived in the US my entire life. I've been living in Los Angeles for 8 years now. I have a pretty good job working for a company that is international and has an office in pretty much every major city.  A primary goal I have is to own property and start building something for myself. I want to leave LA because I do not believe it is feasible to save up enough money to buy a house here. 

I have a couple of options, I can either move out of the US (which I'm leaning towards), or to another city in the US. I have two cities that I have been researching. I've been to both for extended periods. My first choice would be Bangkok, Thailand and my second choice would be Warsaw Poland. I realize these are completely different realities, but they share a similar characteristic, cost of living. 

The advice I'm asking for is for any recommendations on where to move. Perhaps some details on your experience in the city you recommend.  I don't really see any good alternatives between the two listed on this site.

Theres been times where i sold all my things to get my doses, and times like now that it wont bug me as much when i run out. Im now 24 and own a business , engaged and two kids. My girl and i both snuff but dont stay up all night and eat everyday too. My kids always have what they need and want . Im not a very rich man but we do live comfortably. 20% of the time i want to stop using cat, but i still enjoy using it specially when im gaming. But at times i feel so bad thinking that im too busy gaming and just cant stop to go kick ball with my 3 year old daughter. Or im crashing hard and dont have the energy to do so.

107,"The neighbors across the street are retired and.. well, old. The wife is the only one I ever see out doing yard work, raking leaves, pruning bushes, putting up decorations, etc. I‚Äôve seen her shovel too but here in Minnesota we tend to get storms that leave several inches of snow, sometimes very wet snow ... the kind where people make the news for having heart attacks while shoveling heavy wet snow. 

So I can definitely appreciate that clearing the driveway can be difficult for this couple to do on their own. 

Out of everyone on my block, I‚Äôve lived here the least amount of time (which is actually 7 years now). I‚Äôve learned relatively recently that this couple (the husband mostly) has pretty well burned their bridges with all the other neighbors for taking advantage ... getting favors without giving anything in return. 

In the time I‚Äôve lived here he‚Äôs asked me and I‚Äôve pitched in a few times to clear their driveway and he‚Äôs pretty much always come by later with a 6-pack for me. But the last couple of seasons he doesn‚Äôt ask so much as he simply expects that I‚Äôll get his driveway every time I‚Äôm out doing mine (‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing mine next right?‚Äù). He does still bring 6-packs, so far.... but I‚Äôve avoided shoveling my driveway on occasion to avoid him catching me outside. (That worked for a short time until he got my phone number)

My time is valuable to me; I have a family to spend time with and I have a job to go to... so it‚Äôs not always convenient for me to do other driveways, especially with the heavier snows when it takes over an hour to clear. I don‚Äôt have a very big snowblower so often I‚Äôm just shoveling by hand. And since he burned his bridges with the rest of the neighbors I‚Äôm usually on my own when I do his driveway. Actually last year we got 24 inches of snow once and it took me 2+ hours just to do my own driveway... the other neighbors helped me clear his driveway that time but that was a turning point for me. 

I‚Äôm torn because if I don‚Äôt help out I know they might be stuck doing it themselves which could be bad for their health (well I‚Äôve never ever seen the husband outside doing any kind of yard work or shoveling.. only the wife). When I do it‚Äôs taking me away from my family and my job. I feel like a dick saying no and that I don‚Äôt have time (or I just don‚Äôt want to)... but it‚Äôs not like they can‚Äôt afford to hire a guy with a plow either (maybe I shouldn‚Äôt assume that though). 

Thank you in advance for reading and for any advice or input on how I might go about it this season. Winter is about here and I‚Äôm not looking forward to another year of being at his beck and call when it snows.",29Nov2018,1
108,"I think I'm falling for a longtime friend (he's male, I'm female).

115,"In short, my dad moved out because he had been cheating on my mother. After that, my mother was distraught (developed a short term drinking problem) and my brother became more isolated and started to care less about school. My brother and father had a good relationship before this where they would often go on camping and fishing trips by themselves. Every weekday morning was more or less a shouting match to try to get him up between me, my brother and my mother. We dealt with this throughout the school year and it was tolerable (his grades went from a star student to barely passing during this time).

&amp;#x200B;

The next school year (17-18), things became much more difficult. He would refuse to get up. When taking his phone, my dad would complain that we were cutting his only line of communication dispute him repeatedly skipping school so we weren't really able to take his phone. High school soccer kept him going through the fall, but things got much worse after soccer season ended. When we were able to take the phone, my brother would just say ""fine, I'm not going to school until I get it back"" which he would do. Shortly after soccer season ended, he was diagnosed with both depression and anxiety by our local doctor. He was prescribed a low dose of Zoloft and he started to regularly attend counseling . Shortly after starting the Zoloft, he visited my dad and he told my brother not to rely on pills, so he stopped taking the Zoloft. The daily struggles goes worse after he came back, and at some point, my brother started smoking weed and stealing from me and my mother. The behavior problems continued along with the drug use and he barely managed to pass (his diagnosis helped excuse many of the missed days). He stopped counseling towards the end of the school year as he didn't feel like it was helping and the excuse notes gave him more of a reason to skip.

&amp;#x200B;

This school year so far has been the worst. He refuses to go to school and when he does go, he goes 1.5 hours late (I drop him off on my way to university). I believe he's skipped the past 4 weeks except for 3 days or so. He has home instruction where a teacher brings some of his make up work and works with him one on one. The only good things happening right now are that he's somehow managed to hold down a job as a lifeguard for the past 6 months and he's been taking his Zoloft (more frequently).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been more distant with him over the past year, but I still try to do things with him (talk to him, help him with homework, and watch shows together). Both me and my mother try to show we care, but we also can't let his bad behavior slide so its hard. Part of the behavior problem I think is that my dad treats him more as a buddy than a son(buying him things and talks about how my mom is ""controlling/bossy"") and another part of the behavior problem is my bother values my mother less because the guy shes dating (a 60 year old wanna be rockstar that still lives with his mom). The school attendance problem is a product of my brother not doing the work (i.e. if he has a project due on that day, he'll skip school until its done so it isn't marked late(?)) and the school district giving punishments for repeated lateness (i.e. in school suspension if late more than 10 times). So in his eyes, its best to skip than have to deal with in school punishment or detention.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm pushing for my brother to move in with my dad as it would give him a fresh start. According to my brother, he would like to attend university to become a psychologist but at this point his GPA is so low I'm not sure if he can do that (he wants to help people who have gone through struggles like him). I know this post is long and all over the place, but I feel like I just need some advice right now. Thank you.",29Nov2018,1
116,"My dad‚Äôs wife is very fake. She used to act super nice and friendly but since they got married, she‚Äôs been controlling and irrational. Not directly to me but she does it to my dad in front of everyone. 
-Shes a complete hypochondriac, something‚Äôs always ‚Äúgoing on‚Äù with her. She will take any situation you go through and tell you a fake -story about how she once had it worse (ie my friend passed away recently, I found him dead. To ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù she decided to tell me about how sad she was when she was 15 and her friends cousin committed suicide. To make it sound even more dramatic she said, ‚Äúand I was the 4th person he had called before he did it‚Äù). She literally lies about having a story for ANY situation you could imagine. Oh you had a miscarriage? Her too. You got shot? Her too. You died and came back to life? Her too. It‚Äôs so annoying. It‚Äôs to the point that we all know she is lying and it‚Äôs just awkward to call her out- she‚Äôs a grown woman. 
-anytime I try to talk to my dad, she wants to join the conversation and be extremely overbearing by disagreeing for some crazy reason or making things about her or just having some irrational opinion supported with absolutely no logic. Sometimes if it‚Äôs just a conversation my dad and I can discuss, she will randomly become controlling and like demand that he does something. ‚ÄúShow me the email for the plane tickets NOW! No! Now!‚Äù In the middle of us talking. It‚Äôs so annoying. That‚Äôs the point, where I get up and go to my room.  
She also has a problem with completely lying about things and arguing something that isn‚Äôt correct. I went to Cosmo school awhile back and she once tried to argue about color theory with me. She works at a department store and I was in cosmetology school- why would you try to argue that with me? Something you know nothing about? 

-she‚Äôs jealous if my dad tells me to say hi to my grandparents (moms parents) for him (my mom and dad stayed friends- I was a teenage pregnancy. He‚Äôs known these people since he was 17 years old. Of course he‚Äôs going to say hi). She‚Äôs jealous when my dad and I go out without her and do some activity. Shooting, shopping, etc. she wants to come.

-she ruins every event/party/activity we do by having a ‚Äúbad time‚Äù. We went to an escape room and all a sudden she‚Äôs throwing a temper tantrum because ‚Äúmy dad isn‚Äôt listening to her‚Äù, girl we are a team of 6 people.. what? 
Oh it‚Äôs thanksgiving? She had a terrible day at work. Everyday, she has a ‚Äúterrible‚Äù day at work. Some costumer did this or her boss said this or some guy cut her off while she was driving home. It‚Äôs always something! She always wants to be the center of attention and have anyone sympathize for her. 

-she‚Äôs also like way obsessed with me. If I‚Äôm downstairs cooking or something, she‚Äôs literally STARING at me. I once could see her reflection in the microwave door and turned around quickly to catch her in the act and she tripped on the table trying to act like she was doing something else or had an actual reason to be in the kitchen with me. She always needs to say something to me. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúHi_____‚Äù in the middle of the day when I‚Äôve been home all day and just saw her an hour ago or if I‚Äôm eating she wants to tell me there‚Äôs something on my face or that I dropped something. At family parties she wants to tell me that my hair is out of place or that I dropped something on my shirt.

On thanksgiving, I made taco dip. One spicy, one regular. In separate containers. I labeled them because I like spicy food while my family does not. And she decided to tell me which one the regular one was and which one the spicy one was. Don‚Äôt you think that I would know? I MADE it. Like honestly why? Why did she need to tell me? So annoying!!


I am just so tired of this behavior. I rarely even see my dad now, and we live in the same house. 
I can‚Äôt be around her, I always have to be in my room. I can‚Äôt stand her at all and I miss my relationship with my dad. We used to be so close. 

My dad doesn‚Äôt even want to help me pay for my car anymore, which he told me that he would. But then proceeded to buy her a 10k car on his own.  She saved up $600 for it, he told me. But then later she lied to my face and said she saved $3000. 
She‚Äôs gotten into so many accidents. I have a 5 year clean driving record. Since I was 16, no accidents what so ever. I only needed 350 from my dad to get my car fixed... I had the rest. But no, he‚Äôd rather buy her something that‚Äôs $9000 more? 

Why? I don‚Äôt get it. Someone please explain why he thought that was cool? She doesn‚Äôt have any ambitions, she doesn‚Äôt try to find a better job. She works less hours than I do every week and I‚Äôm a college student who also works 30+ hours a week.  That‚Äôs not even full time and I work more than she does!?

What can I do? It feels like she‚Äôs replaced me, which doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Like I‚Äôm not his love interest, I‚Äôm his literal child.

120,"So I had this roommate for the first two years of college, we got along really well, laughed a lot together, I enjoyed her general vibe. We considered each other to be best friends etc. So towards the end of sophomore year, she had a bit of a break down. I noticed she was depressed, feeling a little lost, totally a normal thing for someone in college trying to figure themselves. At one point I remember being really worried about her and contacting her mom to let her know I was concerned about her general mental state.  Long story short after the break down she left my university and transferred to the university in our mutuahl hometown. Through the rest of college we talked sporadically but when she left it was on a kind of weird note since i was really enjoying being away at school and she wasn‚Äôt. So fast forward to now ( almost 5 years later) we now both live in our mutual home town. She reached out to me when I first moved back about a year ago and we made plans to see each other about 6 months later.

122,"I have been volunteering for several years while in college at a school my SO works at. During that time a board member has become upset over not being control of a creative endeavor while she was acting as a volunteer also. There was once a complaint that I had swore once, (parents and children are overtly sensitive sometimes) and another board members spouse even went as far as to attempt to blackmail me and my SO because she couldn't get her way. At this point you might be asking why would I want to work there. Well it's because of the students and my desire to be more and give more than what is expected of me, despite everything. A position was posted and it was communicated that I wouldn't be hired because board members have it out for me and past complaints. The thing that strikes me as odd is how is it okay for me to be approved to be a volunteer but not in a money earning position, not even as a sub. I know it might all sound weird, but there's a load of toxicity in the board. I planned to meet with the principal and superintendent to convey my seriousness and that I desire to understand completely. The principal and everyone in the school vouches for me, including staff. The buck stops at a new superintendent and the board. What recourse do I have? I think because my SO is already established and can't really be removed they are taking it out on me. Also before we got the new super, the complaints weren't brought up when it came to my renewal of volunteering.",29Nov2018,1
124,"Hey y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm 18 and a senior in high school. My mom is overbearing, and she‚Äôs been getting worse lately. When I was 16, she treated me like I was a normal 16-year-old, but it seems to have gone backwards from there. She‚Äôs gotten stricter and stricter. She barely trusts me to complete simple, everyday tasks. And mind you, I haven‚Äôt done anything to break her faith in me. I get good grades, I did my college applications correctly with no help from anyone, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke or anything, I‚Äôve never dated, I‚Äôve held the same job for 3 years and never gotten written up, and my driving record is clear. I‚Äôm very innocent and I‚Äôm confused as to why she doesn‚Äôt trust me.

I think she might have an anxiety disorder of some kind. She‚Äôs always very stressed out and sometimes panics over things that aren‚Äôt worth panicking about. I know she has trust issues with other people in her life and I think she might be projecting it on to me. I try to be empathetic, but at this point I feel like her behavior is actually detrimental to me. I‚Äôm afraid to talk to her because she‚Äôs emotionally unpredictable and can be very scary when she‚Äôs angry. 

Here are some examples of her behavior if you‚Äôre wondering. Feel free to skip over this part; it‚Äôs going to be long.

**********

When I was barely 17, she let me go to a few completely unsupervised sleepovers. Nothing bad happened. But last time I asked to go to one of those (a month ago), she yelled at me for even daring to ask permission. I‚Äôm a freaking adult. It‚Äôs not at all unreasonable to go to a sleepover where no one‚Äôs parents are home. 

Every single time I‚Äôm a passenger in her car, she narrates her driving to me (‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm going to make a left turn, so I have to wait until there‚Äôs no oncoming traffic...‚Äù like I‚Äôm a young child or something) and lectures me about super obvious stuff like looking out for pedestrians and cyclists and no-turn-on-red signs. In any given car ride, this conversation happens once every 15 minutes. I have had a driver‚Äôs license for 2 years now and I‚Äôm not bad at driving. Of course I‚Äôm not perfect, but I definitely don‚Äôt need to be reminded to pay attention and obey laws, especially not on a daily basis. She didn‚Äôt do this nearly as frequently when I was 16. I take pride in being a safe driver, and my mom‚Äôs doubt of that is really frustrating.

On a similar note, she is terrified of letting me drive in the snow. I drive to and from school and work daily. We live in Northern Illinois. We get 4-5 months of snowy, icy wintertime every year, which means I‚Äôve driven in the snow hundreds of times before. But she‚Äôs really paranoid because ‚Äúwe‚Äôve never had this much snow in November‚Äù (yeah, but I‚Äôve driven in February, which is usually worse). So this week I‚Äôve had to listen to her tell me how to drive in the snow at least 5 times. And also she rushes me out the door in a frantic hurry 45 minutes before school starts in the morning even though the school is about 2 miles (3.3 kilometers) away.

Also, she has access to my account on the scheduling app my work uses. She checks this instead of asking me to tell her when I work. I‚Äôve never missed a shift and I‚Äôve only been late, like, once in the 3 years I‚Äôve worked there, but my mom still doesn‚Äôt trust me to know my own schedule. Also, my managers said I‚Äôd probably get promoted if I apply, but my mom won‚Äôt let me apply for reasons I don‚Äôt fully understand. 

Oh, and she‚Äôs tracked me for the past year and a half using a tracking app on my phone. And she doesn‚Äôt just use it if she‚Äôs suspicious that I‚Äôm up to something. She checks it very frequently and thoroughly, often mentioning to me if she noticed something mundane, like that I took an unusual route home from work or stopped at Dunkin‚Äô Donuts or something. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly being watched. I don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve this. 

**********

I feel like I had more freedom at 15-16 years old than I do now. I‚Äôve put a lot of effort into being a good daughter whom my parents can 100% trust and it‚Äôs hurtful that my mom ignores this. Also, by smothering and sheltering me, she‚Äôs made it difficult for me to learn how to act like an adult. I‚Äôm afraid to make decisions for myself because I‚Äôm rarely allowed to.

How do I put a stop to my mom‚Äôs behavior? If I can‚Äôt, how can I put up with it for the next 9 months until I go to college? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

125,"I (26F) have had mostly guy friends my entire life. I‚Äôve always kept my friendships as just friendships. One of my best friends (31M) has made some comments recently that have me concerned that he may have some serious feelings for me. We‚Äôre both single and have been friends for many years now, and over the last year or two have bonded closer over some similar emotional turmoil that we have both been experiencing (separately). He has confided some things in me that I know he hasn‚Äôt told other people, which is totally fine as close friends, but I don‚Äôt have any interest in him as anything more than a buddy and I‚Äôm thinking that he has other ideas. 

I do not want to hurt him, nor do I want to damage our friendship, but I want to make it clear to him that as close friends as we may be, we are only friends. 

Part of me thinks I shouldn‚Äôt bring it up at all unless he tries to pursue something. Part of me thinks I should address what I feel is the elephant in the room. In either case, I don‚Äôt know what to do to protect his feelings while drawing clear lines. The discomfort is causing me to want to distance myself from him a bit as to not let him think I‚Äôm leading him on, but I realize that‚Äôs unkind.

There is also a chance that I‚Äôm misinterpreting what he has said and I don‚Äôt want things to be awkward if I‚Äôve assumed something that isn‚Äôt correct.

127,"The week before thanksgiving my mom went into my room to get something. I was asleep and had my covers over me. However, I was only wearing a long sleeve shirt and a pink thong from Victoria secret. Yes I am a guy and I have a kink for wearing girl panties. But I wear them when I sleep sometimes. And I never expect anyone to lift my blanket and see me wearing it. However my mom was looking for I believe a necklace she left in my room. And after she found it she then noticed my alarm kept going off. I kept hitting snooze and she was pissed and yelled for me to wake up or I‚Äôll be late to class. And I ignored her cause I was still half sleeping. And then she does the unexpected. She yanks my blanket from me to make me wake up and all she sees is me in a shirt and a pink girl thong. She thought I was butt naked at first until she glanced over and saw the pink strap of cotton in between my butt and screamed saying ‚Äúomg wtf‚Äù and walked out. I woke up minutes later to her screaming to my dad saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe what I saw in his room‚Äù . When I woke up I realized my blanket wasn‚Äôt on top of my body and that she was in my room. So I figured she saw that I was wearing the underwear. Week later at thanksgiving where we having over 40 relatives. She put me on blast and said ‚ÄúI saw my son wearing pink panties the other day‚Äù and she said it out loud to the whole room.

128,"I currently work at an office job and been working there for about a year. I started off as a receptionist for a couple months and then got promoted to team coordinator. Our new receptionist quit and the director and HR manager sat down with me and presented me with a new job offer for office manager. It would entail everything I did as a receptionist (which was a lot- not just picking up phone calls and greeting people) plus more managerial duties and responsibilities like handling invoices and more. One thing that strikes me as odd was that the director said they would not offer this position to anyone else and if I did not take it then they would hire a receptionist, not a clinical manager. When I asked if the pay rate would change she said it would change after a ‚Äú3 month probation‚Äù and then they‚Äôd discuss the pay rate. Upon searching and discussing this with a friend who majored in HR management, there‚Äôs no such thing as a probation once you‚Äôve been hired and technically this is a ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù. I feel like they disguised this job position because they absolutely hate hiring receptionist because they cannot find one who is willing to do the amount of work with the low pay rate which is the main reason the current receptionist is leaving along with the 3 before him who quit. I don‚Äôt know whether to trust them because they are a bit shady and sneaky and have this authoritarian clique. I‚Äôve seen them talk and do a lot of shady things to others and it‚Äôs a small company, so they always low ball incoming employees which is why our office is predominantly young fresh-out-of-college employees. All in all, this could mean an eventually higher pay rate but I would not know the amount and that money would help and make life easier with expenses and all. Now I aspire to have my own shoe collection and even tried to go to school for it, but there are lack of resources and programs that focus on shoemaking. Recently I came across a shoemaker who is willing to teach me and allow me to use his resources to learn to make shoes along with his mentorship IF I can intern for him for little to nothing for 3 months and then he‚Äôd decide to hire me full time or not. Quite honestly, I do think I‚Äôd get hired (not in a cocky or egotistic way) because first and foremost, it‚Äôs my passion and I always give my all and more to every position I take on. The dilemma? I am conflicted between should I take the safe route and take the job offer or quit my full time job and get one step closer to my dream at the expense of finding other means of income to support myself and bills?  Another option I was thinking about is keeping my full time job, but trying to maintain some relationship with the shoemaker, but then again he was very adamant about needing someone during the weekdays and daylight hours. Before you go on to say take your dream job-duhh, really rationalize the facts that bills don‚Äôt pay themselves and $15 an hour full time barely covers all my costs/expenses and no I do not spend on going out or other extra money-wasting activities. I‚Äôm in a pickle and would like some helpful insight. Maybe even experiences of your own? ",29Nov2018,1
129,"In a week my final Game Making class is hosting a huge playtest session in a large computer lab. 

I can't skip or I'll fail.

There's around 15 people in my class and I'm not really friends with any of them. 

My teacher said to invite friends and family to get as many people as possible to play our games but:

I can't really invite family, and 2 of my friends outside of that class aren't available in the exact time slot on that day I need them to be there. 

I don't want to be alone or look like an anti-social loner in front of everyone else whose bringing people.

So I'm now on the edge of planning to post a preview video of my first person shooter game on Instagram stories.

It has really cool and attractive graphics, and I'm planning to attach a text with it that reads:

If you're interested in playtesting my game and offering feedback, dm me for more info. 

It would mean a lot to me &lt;3 

However, most of the people who watch my stories are old friends who I barely talk to. And part of the reason why I'm doing this as this might be a last chance for me to get noticed by or talk to one of my old crushes and friends.

After long talks with my father tonight, he told me that through out his entire career as a graphic designer, he never felt secure in his job. It was only in the 7th year of an 8 year job at his last company, that he was bringing in enough money for the company that he finally felt secure. Then the next year he was laid off.

I‚Äôm just at a complete loss of how to think about it all. For some reason I thought going into technology, learning web development, (i‚Äôm still a newbie, but enough to implement a basic website. Nothing crazy custom, but enough to make a small to medium sized business happy) would lead to at least some longevity, and eventually security. But this keeps happening. It‚Äôs happened now 3 times, i‚Äôve been let go from a contract or job. It just never turns into a real job, man.

I just would like to find some hope out there. I‚Äôm worried that my father is correct in his experience, and that no job experience doesn‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs just like santa claus and the easter bunny. How do you cope then living a life full of never knowing if you have a job or not?",29Nov2018,1

Going back to what I said earlier, still going on a mutually agreed upon actual date in two days. How should I take this? Is she into me now and doesn‚Äôt feel it for him anymore?

The other day we were talking and then he said he had to go because he got to eat dinner and he would call me after 20minutes. I said okay. This happens all the time sometimes i have to go to eat /shop / do other stuff, sometimes he has to go. Then after an hour he did call. I was waiting for him while reading something else, so i got curious so i called him why did he call. He said :'i was distracted by games' this just made me very annoyed because this is not the first time he does this-- said he would call and then do something else. 

I dont have anything against games. I dont even need to speed a lot time with him, i have other stuff to do as well.but i just feel he is so rude not to even text me tell me he is busy with other stuff, when he knows i would be waiting for him. And after i called and confront him,he said why did i make such a big deal of it, is it becos my  Culture or something.  in his country that is what people do always be late. 

I was super mad and said' no it is not a culture thing it is ur fault. When u have to do other things u didn't even bother to let me know to not wait for u.

 i just let it go when the first time it happened. And then this keep happen, i just feel like he doesnt care about me or my time. He doesnt think he  is wrong, and hasn't apologise yet.

Apart from that he is good friend. But we are having a  Discussion/argument about this.

We considered each other to be best friends etc. So towards the end of sophomore year, she had a bit of a break down. I noticed she was depressed, feeling a little lost, totally a normal thing for someone in college trying to figure themselves. At one point I remember being really worried about her and contacting her mom to let her know I was concerned about her general mental state.  Long story short after the break down she left my university and transferred to the university in our mutuahl hometown.

 I get upset because I don't need some sort of validation from him that in the future I'll be able to relate to someone or be in tune to the point that they'll have an interest in me in that way. 
I'm 17 and I've never asked a girl out because every Crush I've had I've been able to come up with a reason as to why I shouldn't ask them out.

I can't get over myself even though what I see as the only thing missing in my life is a partner that I feel comfortable with which could easily be solved by just asking girls out.

Every other part of my life I can't find fault in so this one issue of me continuing to live my life this way has a huge weight on me that constantly feels like it's growing and that I should have had these kinds of experiences already so if I don't do it now then I'll end up unable to do so further down the road in my life.

  It's incredibly hard for me to be put on the spot about this topic like C does since it always happens like 3 hours into us hanging out as a group and smoking and since it's smoking I can't express my thoughts in a coherent way so how do I fix this situation that's giving me anxiety?
Is it unreasonable for me to expect my friends to see my point of view and approach the topic in a different way?

145,"This is going to be a bit to read, so I'll add a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm having massive fucking trouble improving myself. I think I'm a genuinely shitty person. Now I feel like when someone says they're a shitty person, most people assume that person thinks they're a shitty person for being an asshole, but in my case, I think I'm shitty because I can be an asshole, and I'm mentally weak. It really only dawned on me that I've been a shitty person for a few years now only recently. I think I'm a bad person because I'm so quick to judge things and people, and I also catch myself seeing the worst in people, even my dear friends. I notice myself being selfish at times, whether it be eating the last popsicle in the fridge or just not spending time with my family just because I want to do other things instead. I let people treat me like a doormat at times. I've always been the one in the group of friends who was most sensitive or got laughed at the most, although at the moment I have a group of very supportive friends. I can never come up with good comebacks and I take too much stuff to heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm constantly self pitying, the want for a girlfriend is constantly eating at me, and I'm pretty sure at this point it's crippled my ability to talk to girls. For a good while now, I've tried to go out and hang out with girls on dates and stuff. If not all them ended with me getting ghosted after hanging out the first time. I also hold on to shit for too long, I had my first real girlfriend for about 3 months a few years back in sophomore year of high school and after it ended, I was brokenhearted about it for nearly 6 months. A girl who ended up pretty much leading me on for a week back in July only recently stopped constantly popping up. In school, I half ass everything and so far I've pretty much floated and coasted through High School, I have about 7 months left of my senior year. I recently also noticed that I've become flaky or unreliable. I blame this on some strange anxiety that I have, it constantly makes me tell myself that I'm strange or that I make people uncomfortable. I'm always working out to reach the goal of being completely fit instead of just accepting that I'm not even fat or that I have nothing to worry about. I consider myself unattractive, despite having some girls who tell me they're interested in me. Sometimes I don't even message back people who hit me up first on tinder out of some weird fear of rejections.

&amp;#x200B;

I never got close with my family. At an early age, my family moved to a completely new city from where I was born and where my family was from. Being the only ones in our entire family thousands of miles away, I never really got the chance to form tight bonds with cousins, aunts, uncles, even grandparents, we usually go back to where were from to see everyone but that's really for a week once every 2 years. Despite some of my shittiness, I almost never deny anyone of help, I try to help my friends and family and sometimes even strangers. I have a few hobbies, but sometimes I don't even stick with them.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't get any of this off my chest, and it's definitely weighing me down. Up until recently, I've had an extremely hard time opening up my feelings to anyone. Whether it be my friends or family, I got it in my head that I'm bothering them or being too much of a poor me, or even a downer, Reddit always seems to be the place where I get stuff off my chest and even then I don't want that to always be the case. Besides wanting to become a better person, I'd like to learn how to not give a fuck, not in the selfish way, but I want to become someone who is good and at the same time is secure and cares nothing about what anyone thinks of them.  How can I seriously work on myself?


TL;DR: I'm convinced I'm a shitty person for a few reasons. I don't want to be a shitty person anymore. I'd like to learn how to not give a fuck. Advice?",29Nov2018,1
146,"So I'm 18 and I've been wanting to get a tattoo for a while now. I want to get a forearm tattoo of my zodiac sign. 

I've told my parents about getting it to see if it's okay with them and they said that I should wait until I graduate high school and see what career path I choose because some don't accept tattoos. And also because they want me to make sure I really want it and not regret it later.

151,"  I was talking to my friend today about my dad. She got mad at the way he treats me and my sister and my dogs and mom.  She said it was verbal abuse and it leads to physical. She is, of course, right. I accepted this, I planned to protect Maya (My little sister). But the way she was angry, how much she cared. ***It made me realize I cannot do this.***

  He screams at me, he uses names on me and *my 11-year-old* sister like idiot, stupid, retard, etc. and yells for seemingly no reason. He speeds on busy roads to overtake people, he curses. He gives me glares of pure hate, makes me come close to him just so that I'm aware he CAN hit me and I can't do anything about it. Sometimes he says it verbally. He also uses the electric shock collars on the dogs unnecessarily, kicks their crates while they are in them and keeps them in there all day. 

  My mom watches. If she isn't there I tell her. She cries but does no more, she was abused as a kid. Her arthritis is acting up and she can hardly move. She is scared and blames me. I don't know why.

  My grandparents on her side disowned us, they hated my dad and this was the final push. My uncle is in the military, my other uncle sided with my grandparents. That's that entire side of the family gone.

  My dad's brother lives at my granny's house with his 3 kids as he divorced last year. He can hardly keep up with being a firefighter and them, let alone my dad. My other relatives are in other states. My dad's mom lives with me, she only ever pulls me and my sister aside and tells us it isn't his fault.

  It just hurts so much, I dream about being hit. My heart collapses when I leave my room. I'm scared and alone, except for my sister, who I watch.  (I'm 14 for the record) I have 2 questions.

Hi, so I [18M] am in my first semester of college. I have ADHD and went to a high school designed to accommodate this and other learning disorders, so it was much easier there. A lot of the time I feel like I'm not really as smart as I looked on my application, because I don't think i could ever get the same GPA at a normal high school. I guess I took the same SAT and ACT as everyone else, but I was able to learn the material so much better in that school than I would otherwise. I guess maybe it was just leveled out, but now that I don't have that kind of learning environment I feel behind everyone else again. idk I guess it sounds like impostor syndrome except with a legitimate reason to believe I really am not supposed to be here.

anyway... getting to the main point. it's been really hard for me to keep up with the pace of college. I feel like it takes me way longer than other people to do the same tasks. I see a time management tutor every week to help, and it does help a lot, but I can't accurately predict how long things will actually end up taking me so the plans get messed up a lot.

I don't know how to finish all my assignments AND take care of myself AND have a small social life. I don't even want to go to parties or see friends very often (I don't even really have friends here right now), I just want to see my boyfriend on weekends. 

I was staying up until 5am every time I had an essay due the next day even when I started early and put over 10 hours into it  for like a 2-3 page essay that I have outlined and should be easy. 

this was a problem, so I started trying to go to bed even I hadn't finished everything. this is what I've been doing lately, and I guess I feel less tired but I've lost so much time and feel really behind. I've been turning things in late and incomplete, and not absorbing material or taking the time to make it good.

I really wanted to do well this semester, since it will likely be my easiest semester and it's hard to come back from starting with a bad GPA, but finals are next week and that's how it's looking like it's gonna be.

I want to get into medical school someday, so if I ever want to do that I need to learn to get this figured out.

right now I'm having a lot of trouble finding the time to shower, eat, sleep, and exercise would be great for me but it just doesn't even seem like a possibility. I'm barely doing those things if at all and I'm STILL turning things in late and unfinished. it feels pretty hopeless and I'm trying really really hard not to fall into a depressive episode. I've got some bad stuff going on in my personal life too and everything just feels like a mess that I can't fix.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the messy post title. And please don't harass me for the kinds of medications I take, it's not kind and it's not relevant.

Back in September I moved out of state. I had informed my PCP, who was the prescriber of my medications, in advance. Since I knew finding a doctor out here wouldn't be a quick process (is it ever?). She has been mailing my RXs out to me but as of the November RX, she said she wouldn't be able to continue mailing me fills since I'm technically not her patient anymore.

When she sent my Nov rx out, she sent it to my old address. So a new rx needed to be mailed again, since the other one got lost and never received by me. However, a couple days ago, I received the original rx she had mailed out, since my USPS mail forwarding is still in affect, I assume. Which I was not expecting.

I thankfully have been able to schedule an appt, but it's not until Feb. And everyone around here seems to be booking out even further than that, with little availability. I'm pretty upset, I feel like I had no option here, and am disappointed my old PCP is okay with me just not being under treatment for over two months. I also take antidepressants, and I don't think it's going to be great to suddenly withdraw from them.

That being said, am I legally allowed to take the second rx, (the one that was assumed I wouldn't receive due to it being sent to the wrong address), to the pharmacy when my refill would be due? Or is it basically a copy of the RX I already filled in the beginning of Nov? I don't want to get in trouble, and I certainly do not want to be put under some red flag pharmacy list or whatever. I would still be filling at the usual 30 day mark, not sooner, not twice in a month.

TL;DR: Moved to new city. Couldn't get an appt sooner than Feb with new doctor. Received copy of rx twice. I'm just worried about having to go until mid-Feb without my adhd and anti-depression meds , and since she doesn't want to fill anything further til then, I thought maybe this accidental rx I got in the mail might be a blessing to buy me some time until I can figure out a sooner appointment in my new city.",29Nov2018,1

Back in late June, I began to experience swollen tonsils. I‚Äôve had mono and strep throat before so I though it was just one of those because there was white spots. My lymph nodes were also inflamed and I had a general feeling of malaise. I went to the dr and she didn‚Äôt do any tests and prescribed me antibiotics. After the round was finished, I emailed her saying there was no change to my tonsils. She prescribed me another dose and I finished it. 

At this point, I felt better than I was feeling before but my tonsils were still swollen. I gave up and went on with my life. About 2 months later, the white spots showed up again so I went back to the dr. A strep test was done but it came back negative but I was still prescribed antibiotics. I finished them and while it got rid of the white spots, my neck lymph nodes and tonsils were still inflamed and I was still feeling generally sick (fatigue, loss of appetite). About a month later, I got a UTI so I was prescribed a FOURTH round of antibiotics. Still no change in size and still feeling poor. 

It is now tonight and I can honestly say this is the 2nd worst I‚Äôve ever felt in my life. No sore throat but everything else is bad. My stomach is so bloated, it‚Äôs extremely painful and I can‚Äôt pass a bowel movement, I feel nauseous, muscles are very sore, swollen tonsils are making it difficult to swallow, very dizzy and weak, shortness of breath, and while my temperature is normal, I feel very feverish.

I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôve been researching my symptoms all night (dumb move, I know) and my parents are convinced I need to go to the ER. 

I have an appointment with a head and neck specialist on Monday so I was just going to wait it out but it‚Äôs making me very nervous and anxious to not know what‚Äôs going on, especially with persistent symptoms that wouldn‚Äôt go away after four rounds of antibiotics. 

Should I go to the ER or wait it out until Monday?

Sorry it‚Äôs so long. I posted this on r/askdocs too. Thanks. 

Tl;Dr: Swollen tonsils/ lymph nodes for 5 months and general feeling of sickness. Nothing has changed, even after 4 rounds of antibiotics. I feel very bad tonight (dizzy, nauseous, bloating, weakness). Should I go to the ER or wait for my appointment on Monday? ",29Nov2018,1

It's not the biggest problem in the world but it really distresses me seeing photos of myself. It knocks my confidence, it means I've no photos of myself with friends to look back on, photos like this appear on the public site for people to see which freaks me out (especially as I was trying to look sexy so in a skimpy outfit thus it looks even worse), also I seriously worry about my sanity that I can think I look good but I look so radically different in photos verses the mirror.

190,"I should preface this by saying I tend to ramble and suck at organizing my thoughts so please bear with me ha.
Aaaaaaanyway, pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. I have strong feelings for a girl I work with. We‚Äôve worked together for about 3 years now. (It‚Äôs a mall retail store). The work environment is really laid back and most of us are all ‚Äúfriends‚Äù even though management heiarchy still exists. Despite this, the company, as policy, has a pretty set in stone ‚Äúno fraternizaton‚Äù policy that our store follows.


She‚Äôs a full time assistant manager and I‚Äôm a sales associate. Having known each other and worked together for three years, (and two years of me shopping there as a regular before I got hired when she was still just an associate), I‚Äôve developed pretty strong feelings for her over time. She‚Äôs smart as hell, really cool, and insanely beautiful and I just feel like I can 100% be myself around her and be accepted. Despite the difference in our work positions we still get on like friends and know each other pretty well, and we really care about one another as more than just mere work acquaintances.
But here‚Äôs the problem: she‚Äôs crushing on someone at the moment. It‚Äôs a really superficial crush (as she‚Äôd admit I‚Äôm sure) and both her and the dude have only ever had casual conversations with each other (he works in the mall food court) and haven‚Äôt so much as exchanged phone numbers yet. But...it‚Äôs there just the same. He‚Äôs also much better looking than I am, which shouldn‚Äôt worry me since she said once that she‚Äôs more concerned with who a guy is than how he looks, but...still.


I was planning on leaving the company at the end of the year for another job anyway, and letting her know how I feel once I‚Äôd been departed a couple weeks or so. But now that things may be picking up with this other guy who is 1) infinitely more attractive than I am and 2) not technically her employee, I‚Äôm getting nervous.
She had been dating someone for like four years but they split (on good terms) this past spring. While they were dating it was easy to ignore my feelings and keep them tamped down. But ever since they split those feelings came bubbling to the surface and it‚Äôs been basically impossible to ignore them. 

I feel like I might‚Äôve had a chance were circumstances different and still would, all things considered, but I feel like I can‚Äôt wait anymore. There‚Äôs a window there and the fact that we work together is a giant obstacle dropped in my path.
It‚Äôs just eating me up inside and I don‚Äôt know what to do about it. I can‚Äôt talk to any of my coworkers about it because itd probably be an ~issue~ and make things awkward. Especially since our store manager is a big stickler for protocol and rules and such.
Even if she straight up turned me down, I‚Äôd have at least put it out there. She‚Äôd at least KNOW. It wouldn‚Äôt be broiling inside me anymore. But, again, for know that kind of has to be how it is and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. 

I really value her as a friend and presence in my life and I know I‚Äôll regret it forever if I do nothing. But for now, ‚Äúnothing‚Äù seems to be all that I can do.

TL;DR I have strong feelings for a friend I work with and have known for 5 years, irritating workplace policies prevent me from doing anything, she has a crush on someone prettier than me, it‚Äôs killing me having to keep my feelings hid.",29Nov2018,1

The thing is that everyone in the server just has kind of accepted that he is a trouble maker. For context, we were chatting about kpop and I posted a certain picture of a singer and he immediately responded with absolute nasty, vulgar comments for really no reason of how she's ""ugly"" and that she should be ""raped, they were just completely wrong and I was really thrown off at how such a decently nice person could be going out with someone like that. I messaged her soon after in private and she admitted to me that it's been a running issue with him and that it's caused a lot of drama with other members of the server in the ast. She's confronted him in the before to no avail, he just doesn't care how he talks to others and most likely does it for some kind of shock factor or it's just his sick idea of humor.

218,"Ex and I weren't together long, I was very happy and he seemed to be committed but he stated becoming sexually manipulative and then emotionally abusive during arguments about that - he dumped me when I tried to talk to him about this, as he'd been accused of emotional abuse by his ex wife he took my bringing it up as a 'deal breaker'. 

He and I met via a shared social group - I'd only just joined after moving back to the area - because I didn't wan to see him after the breakup and because he was so much closer to that group I decided to leave the group - in general this felt very unfair, I'm left with no friends/social life despite not having done anything wrong. 

I've no way of knowing what he may have told people but he's had to have explained it somehow, people of the group apparently considered me 'out of his league' so they'd likely think it was something big for him to break-up with me, and being how he tried to blame he breakup on me I have no doubt he'd lie to try to maintain his image. 

I've briefly seen a few people from this group: one blatantly tried to come onto me and apparently his friend was dating my ex a few weeks after me so I worry what he may have heard about me through her, one just seemed kind of uncomfortable with me which could have just been him not knowing how to respond, and today I saw one of the girls who just kind of blanked me which could have just been that deal when you pretend not to s someone to avoid small talk. 

I've no proof he's said anything to anyone, I'm just anxious knowing he might have.

I may run into him and this group when out some time, I'm anxious about how to act.

219,"Need help with these 3 assholes at school.

Currently doing some hardcore boxing and I seem to have amazing stamina for my age, but I lack in strength.

I've already told the teachers about them not once, not twice, but 37 times this year.

Can't take anyone with me, because everyone's friends with these retards.

I wanna take them on in case they start something (which they will).

&amp;#x200B;

I've identified my 3 foes:

&amp;#x200B;

The first one: Spoilt, rich Indian bloke with skanky parents who can't seem to shut his fucking mouth about how stupid and poor I seem to look; no fighting experience whatsoever.

The second one: I have a mutual relationship with him, but if I defend myself from the first, he'll come in and give me hell. He is currently doing martial arts, and is a relatively large bloke for his age. And it's not the first time I've fought him, so I know his weak spots and exploits. If I can get real close, evade his hits and strike him one then I might be good.

The third one: The first one's literal fucking puppet and slave; a smaller bloke with no experience at anything.

&amp;#x200B;

So the questions that need to be answered are:

1) How do I avoid getting in trouble? It's three of them and one of me.

2) I might have a little trouble with the tall bloke; he does a great headlock.

220,"
I started a new retail bakery job in June. It was 40 hours/week and low-stress. However this entire month I've been expected to work 55 hour weeks and I'm lucky if I get a single day off. I missed Thanksgiving with family I probably won't see until next November. I have no social life. I'm not sure how I can even think about school next quarter with my schedule as intense and unpredictable as it is now. Call me a lazy millennial, I don't care anymore. This schedule has taken a serious toll on my mental health and I don't know how much longer I can handle it. 

I haven't once complained to my manager about these long weeks, yet she felt the need to rudely say ""Welcome to adulthood!"" while writing last week's schedule, which included a clopener (close at 7p one day, open at 5am the next morning).

We have hired a new girl but I do not know when she can start taking more shifts. I assume it won't be long. Probably 2-3 weeks.

I've decided to try transferring to the pharmacy department at a different location. It comes with a $5 raise, rotating weekends, and I'll have a stable schedule that will work around school. 

The thing is, I don't know how to tell my boss that I'm transferring. I told her a few months ago that I wasn't interested in going back to pharmacy (used to be a pharm tech at a different company) because it was high-stress and the bakery just isn't. 

I know she's either going to chew me out and eat me alive or magically find more days off for me. Possibly both? 

So now I can't even sleep, I'm so worried. I had a panic attack after I told my store manager of my intention to transfer (company policy). I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to stick it out because things could get better soon, but the other part of me wants to get the hell out. I'm not sure what to do.


TLDR: I feel overworked but that might end soon, and I'm tempted to switch to a slightly higher paying, higher stress  job within the same company. Not sure what to do.",29Nov2018,1

230,"I‚Äôm not a very confrontational person, but, the reason I‚Äôve been staying at my girlfriends place so often is due to how fucking unbelievably lazy and and irresponsible my roommates are.

They both exclaimed, profoundly, that they‚Äôre the cleanest people they know and absolutely hate it when people don‚Äôt clean up after themselves, or leave dishes out, or don‚Äôt wipe up when they‚Äôre done cleaning, etc. However, after living with them for 5 months now or so, every single month, it‚Äôs continuously gotten worse. There‚Äôs constantly dishes in the sink. The oven top hasn‚Äôt been wiped down at all after they get done cooking. There‚Äôs just plates of fucking food and unwrapped bread just sitting on the counter tops.

It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs zero consideration for my presence whatsoever. I understand I‚Äôve been gone at my girlfriends, and not here. However, I don‚Äôt feel that is grounds for justification at ALL to leave hoards of messes around and not clean up after yourselves.

234,"*As the title says, is College really worth it?*  


**Backstory:**  
 I am an 18 year old freshman college student attending a community college in hopes of completing my GE requirements. I haven't declared any major because I have no idea what I truly want to be. Except now, I have somewhat of an idea. Because of that, I plan to transfer to a CSU under the Computer Science major. One thing you should know about me is that I don't have a knack for school. I have major anxiety from very minor things, especially when it comes to test-taking. I also have been pushed around a lot throughout my younger years as being ""stupid"" or any other harsh names related to that. So... growing up wasn't easy. It has been ingrained into my head that I would amount to nothing. I constantly second guess myself, even if I have a good feeling about what is correct. Another big problem about me is that I cannot focus in class. I don't really know if I can self-diagnose this, but I want to say I have A.D.D. Because of this, I am mentally unable to stay focused on one specific task. The ironic part is, when I am playing games, I am 100% concentrated (odd huh?). Anyways, yea... I like games. I play video games day and night. It's my passion. I can't say I'm very good at many of them, but it keeps me going. That's why I want to get into computer science. It seems that a lot of people want to do that now-a-days, and yes, the gaming industry is growing very swiftly.  


 Back on topic, I am slowly but surely becoming more and more discouraged every single day I attend my college. Every time I think about it, I become more and more depressed over the fact that I'm spending countless days sitting in a classroom and learning some information, only to regurgitate it onto an exam to determine how well you know the subject.  
 So why don't I just drop out? Well... I also fear disappointment. Out of all the younger generations in my family (basically all the cousins and siblings), not a single person has dropped out of college. Where did they end up? With relatively good paying jobs under the career that they chose. The difference is... a lot of them have book smarts. They learn at a much faster pace than I do. When it came down to me, I am a slow learner, I am a horrible test-taker, I have anxiety that reaches really absurd levels when the smallest things happen, etc. So the only thing really keeping me from dropping out of college is this constant fear of disappointing my family. I'm constantly at an up and down with what I want in life, but surely, the one thing that I hate is to know that I have disappointed people who once cared about me.  
 Even if I decide to drop out of college, people ask me, ""Well what are you going to do then?""  
 The simple answer is... ""I don't know."" I truly do not know what I would do instead.  
 The most common response, ""Well then you should stick to college. College is there to guide you and make it easier for you. It is there to help you get a better future. The future you want.""  
 What do I say to that? Surely... the odds are not even. On one hand.. you can take a route that can either lead to your crappy life, with a small chance of making it out with a great life. On the other hand, you have a somewhat much more stable path that statistically has a higher chance of giving you that ""successful"" life that you wanted.  
 It's a no-brainer that you would choose the 2nd option right? Well, how about if you're someone like me? Who is (to put in very simple terms) ""not good at school.""  
 What would you do then? Do you want to stick it out and keep pushing through day by day or would you rather drop out and hope to find something that you're much more comfortable with?  
 I honestly don't know where to go in life. So far, my plan is to stick it out for one more semester to see where I currently am and possibly drop out my 2nd year. Is there anyone who can relate? Give advice? Share thoughts? Anything?",29Nov2018,1

So, I talked to him about it and he reckons I'm really hot and outgoing, and we get along really well, like we hold hands sometimes and joke about sexual things. I don't want to be mean but I think he treats her more of a friend, however, because she talks to a lot of people about him, people think they will become a couple. But I kind of like Tavi, because we get along so well, have a lot of things in common and even caught him staring at me quite a lot of times. Yet because Im friends with Kate, I don't want to hurt her by going out with him (even though she told me she wouldn't care), it's hard and I'm debating whether or not to just back off and let it be and honestly I don't know what to think. What should I do or say? Sorry this is a long post, just wanted to give some context..",29Nov2018,1
256,"My uncle has two daughters and maybe a son by now, it's been a while since I've last been in contact with him so I'm not sure if the third child has been born yet. They're all very young and living in what I would call squalor when I last saw them. My aunts and uncles all talk about how dirty and unsafe it is but none of them seem inclined to DO anything. I've brought up CPS once and everyone told me that my uncle would never forgive the family if he lost custody of his children. I personally don't care if he never forgave me but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. I was told recently that he sold that house quit his job and moved into something that one of my aunts considers shittier I haven't actually seen it but if it's worse than what I've already seen I'm gonna lose my mind. He has no job has maybe 3 kids a girlfriend?/baby mama who invites strange men to the house when he's not home and maybe works? Am I overreacting? should I call CPS?

258,"so i was born and raised in america for most of my life. i speak english fluently. my parents decided for some reason to bring me to estonia and just keep me here (my mother being estonian), and then they encountered problems, the government stepped in, and now i'm in a foster home.

from the beginning, i had problems. the wifi would go off at 9 pm, turn on at 10 am - not a big problem, but i don't go to bed at 9 or 10 most days. all the friends i had would usually finish their stuff right before my internet went off and i'd have to go to do something offline. all my american friends would have an even smaller time frame to talk to me, having to go to school in the morning and getting out right when i go offline. i complained, the people in charge said they couldn't change it, i complained some more, they said they couldn't change it again. i stopped there.

then they put me in a public school - the only problem here was that i didn't speak any estonian at all. it's been one and a half years, i still don't speak enough estonian to participate in classes that don't require physical activity. i had a tutor, but he was provided by the school, not a private one. 90 minutes of tutoring a day for 3 days a week, and up to now. it feels like i'm still inadequate in speaking and listening to the language, and only barely adequate in reading and writing. 

up until this point, i was using my laptop as my main source of work and entertainment - programming, video games, khanacademy for my academics. after a while of going to school, they started taking away my laptop at 9 pm as well. again, i complained and they didn't want to make a change again. so i had a bit less time on my laptop after school, nothing too big, really. but it built on to other things.

at some point, they also decided to not allow my dad or mom to send us anything or give us any money. from the foster home, i get 12 euros a month. my mom was only allowed to see us on weekends. my dad isn't in the country so he can't really come visit me, i just keep contact with him online. my mom and dad didn't agree with this, and my mom kept giving us money, so this turned into the people at the foster home barring my mom from seeing any of me or my siblings at all. what i don't understand is the specific reason why she can't do that - usually, when i ask the boss over here, it boils down to 'that's just the rule' and i can't get a reason for why that rule actually exists. other rules i don't understand: the fridge gets locked at 9 pm, (beforehand) i wasn't allowed to meet with my mom at all.

after a few weeks in school, i got tired of sitting around and doing absolutely nothing - didn't speak the language, all i could really do was sleep or play games on my phone. so i started skipping academic classes and going to the library to study either estonian or another school subject on my laptop. the foster home didn't like this - not the fact that i was doing nothing in my school (more on this in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/a1ft95/is_being_in_a_school_and_not_being_made_to/) post), but the fact that i was skipping classes. so they took away my laptop for a while (they probably had other intentions, but the way i saw it was that, i'm not learning anything in an institution made for learning stuff, so i decided to go and learn stuff, which they didn't like, so they took away my means for learning stuff.)

this is how it remained for almost a year. but then school started again and things changed again.

i made the stupid decision, that, during a school vacation for a week, i'd go to sweden for four days. visit some friends i had there and just hang out. planned it so that i wouldn't miss any school days, and made sure of everything. i used my dad's money and his debit card for everything (he wasn't allowed to give me money, according to the foster people, but in the end, not me nor my dad faced any repercussions for that), bought the round-trip ticket and hotel accommodation myself, and had enough money to last the entire trip.  the foster people found out, and as punishment, they took away the passport i had and my gym membership for the month of november (basically the only thing i don't pay for that i do). i wasn't grounded, they didn't take my laptop away, just those two things. it's like they didn't care about me disappearing for a few days - they didn't even bother to call the police to make sure i was safe when i contacted them and told them about it (per my friend's dad's request) on the second night there.

now, them taking away my laptop was their go-to punishment for just about everything. it's basically the only thing i had anyway. so i was pretty surprised when they didn't take it away after i literally vanished for four days. but then i missed two classes on thursday (at this point i'd stopped purposely skipping classes, the reason i missed them was because my estonian teacher did an extra lesson with me (didn't record it and it looked like i was absent from the class i was supposed to be in) and i couldn't figure out where my class was for another. so they took away my laptop and phone as well. however, despite the fact that i had no phone, they didn't instruct me to come home right after school, or bother keeping track of my location. i could go wherever the fuck i wanted and it's like they didn't care at all. and, to top it all off, i found the boss of the foster home trashing my room, looking for any extra electronic devices. she'd gone through all my clothes, my bookshelf, under the bags i had under my bed. she unplugged my second monitor for some reason and gathered all the cables and hard drives i had around into a pile on my desk.

so after losing my laptop and phone for almost a week, they give it back, only to inform me that they'll be taking them away the next day (as well as all my siblings' devices) and replacing them with one computer in the house, which each of us could use for one hour a day (two on weekends). there are four of us total as well, and we're not allowed to share our hours on the computer with someone else. the reason for why they were doing this wasn't given.

and that brings me to here. i regularly spend my entire day at a cafe after school, with a friend's laptop. i don't go home until 10:30 pm. they can't contact me prior to that and they have no clue where i am after i leave school because i have no phone and they don't have my skype phone number. there's no concern for if i get lost or need emergency services, because they haven't complained at all about my behavior in any way since they took my phone and laptop. my education feels like it's regressing with time and i feel really inadequate in the language. i can't buy christmas gifts for my friends overseas with the money i currently get, and i'm not allowed to use my parent's money to (but i did anyway), and my parents can't give me anything for christmas either. right now i'm looking into getting a job for a food services company (wolt) and hopefully i manage to get it.

i just want to know whether i'm complaining too much, or if something is actually wrong, or what i should do. any input is appreciated, criticism or support.",29Nov2018,1

268,"So over the Christmas break I decided to work and save up some money to go travelling next year. Handed out a bunch of resumes and decided to accept 2 different jobs since I thought they wouldn't give me too many hours anyways.

First job is selling jewellery and the other is selling laptops and other tech stuff. Both jobs are pretty enjoyable but both pay minimum wage (for me thats around AUD20 an hour). I earn commission from both but at different rates, 1.5% of total sales at the first job and 1% at the second. However I sell a lot more at the second job (8 grand a shift compared to 2).

My problem is that both jobs are offering a lot of shifts now and they're starting to overlap. I've thought about trying to keep them both but it seems pretty unlikely. If this was purely economical then obviously I would just quit the first job but my manager there is super nice and I think I enjoy the working environment there a lot more.

I've been best friends with the same girl since school and we've always been super close, 4 years ago she started seeing a guy in his 30s, we were only 18. They're still together. The thing is, I was sexually assaulted by him. I told her this, she appeared to support me and then just stayed with him. I haven't forgiven her totally for that but I've always supported her. Flash forward to a few months back and a girl I had confided in brought it up to her, she calls me out of the blue yelling and screaming, saying that she's going to the police about slander and hangs up, I screenshotted the messages I'd sent from years ago and sent them across to her. She full on denies it. Her partner showed up to my home with a samurai sword, screaming and disturbing the whole area, threatening me, my partner and my pets.

285,"Hi all,

So I've been friends with two guys from school for about 8 years or so now. We are in our mid 20's.

We've always shared similar interests and humour which is what brought us together.

The problem is they are lazy. Not lazy people, but lazy friends. They expect me to arrange almost everything, and it is always on their terms. In the past I have cancelled or not responded in protest, but this never seems to change anything.

It gets me really mad. I get mad when they don't respond or give lame replies over whatsapp. They are both very selfish and would never offer to help out or check on how I am doing, even though I would do this for them.

I spend so much time getting irritated by this friendship. My girlfriend says I should tell them how I feel, but I know them too well. They will just dismiss it and pretend it's not a problem. 

Whilst I do have other friends who are certainly better people, because of circumstances, I just don't speak/ see them as much.

I left to go live abroad with my amazing girlfriend. Instead of being happy for me, they just made me feel as if I were doing the wrong thing. They've never said anything positive about my girlfriend or my life plans. I feel they are punishing me for 'abandoning' them.

I'd like to keep in contact with these two, but how do I do so without getting mad everytime they let me down? How does one remove their anger from a friendship?

291,"First post here, hi.

So I was recently offered a position in a student organization I am a part of, and unsure about how I feel about it. Currently I'm sitting as the secretary, and the offered position is the president.

Some background info: I'm studying at uni and since a few years back I've had quite a tough time with failing grades in 90% of the classes. That, in combination with an overall feeling of ""I'll never find my place in this world"" led to severe anxiety and a depression diagnosis. I was in CBT therapy which helped a lot, and nowadays feel that while I haven't conquered the depression thing altogether, I have accepted it and have loads of tools at my disposal for dealing with it in an effective way.

About a year ago I discovered my passion for a different subject than the one I'm studying, and I have now finally pulled the trigger and applied to a different education program at uni (in a totally different field). I will probably get accepted, but of course I can't be sure until I get the reply.

The student organization I'm in is a little more than a year old. I won't get into details, but we can say that it is kind of a combination of what I'm currently studying (subject A) and the subject I'm about to start studying (subject B). So the organisation combines these fields and stretches across multiple disciplines. Although so far we are &lt;20 members in total, we do work with a budget (which is a new thing for me personally). We've arranged a few events such as panel discussions this far, and tbh it has been quite fun. Again, my position is secretary, so I keep the protocol during the meeting and spend around 2-3 h a week in total, on this. The protocols are simple text documents, although I'm considering learning some Latex to make them a little more professional. It's a lot of fun.

But a few days ago, the current president pulled me aside and told me that she due to some personal issues wouldn't be leading us much longer. She bluntly asked me if I was interested in taking her place. She said she had noticed my passion for the subject and thought I'd do a great job. My spontaneous reaction was that I was very happy to be asked (I've never gotten a question like this before), but I got a little worried about my near future. I am after all, in the middle of a big change (switching education), and while I think it'll be just right for me, I can't be sure until I tried.

I'm definitely a little on the ""better be completely sure before I throw my punches""-side of the personality scale!

So I thanked her, and said I would consider it for a few days. Unfortunately, our big yearly meeting (during which things such as these are decided) is in just a few days, and will happen before I'll know if I got into the new education program or not.

I had extensive conversations with both my SO and later my dad about this. They were both happy for me and supportive, and I noticed I'm probably over-thinking this too much. I should probably just take the offer. All honestly, I am very grateful that the president thought of me as her first hand-alternative.

So that's pretty much were I'm at. Any input/questions/thoughts about it appreciated! I'm happy to hear what you guys have to say.

Have a great day.",29Nov2018,1

304," Hey everyone, I had an academic integrity violation and would appreciate any help. I've tried speaking to my academic counsellors but they haven't been too helpful in the matter.

So last year, I had some accommodations and extensions for my exams because I was very physically ill and had severe depression and anxiety. I had to extend the deferrals I got because my physical and mental health worsened and I was bedridden. I had to get a note from a doctor confirming this and I did. However, when I got home I realised that my doctor didn't properly acknowledge the dates I told her I was sick and wrote an incorrect date. I had a lot of anxiety with leaving my room and speaking to people at the time, so I made the dumb mistake of altering the doctor's note to the correct date myself. So after my faculty office noticed this altercation, I was booked with academic integrity violation. They were sympathetic with my circumstances, but wanted to enforce punishments for the serious offence I committed.

While I appealed the decision to fail me in 3 of these mandatory courses, I still received sanctions on these courses. The outcome of this appeal would be for me to write these exams, but I would need a certain mark on the exam to pass the course and my grade would be capped for the courses. The whole appeal process for this took around a year, so understandably I forgot a lot about the course content and it became apparent to me that it would be extremely difficulty for me to successfully pass these exams. I had to keep rearranging exam rewrite times with my professors because of my mental health getting worse and some personal circumstances, and my professors were very understanding. If I were to fail any of these courses, I would be required to withdrawal from my program due to the academic regulations of my school.

I've spoke to some advisers at my school about how my mental health is getting worse and I don't see myself being able to successfully write the deferred exams this semester and they told me it is not possible for me to drop these courses without academic penalty because the academic integrity panel thought they were very lenient already with my decision. For me, the best outcome would be if I were allowed to retake these courses entirely, as I'm someone who needs to be engaged in the class to learn rather than self-study for the final exam for these courses. The ombudsman recommended I propose to the counsel if I could re-enrol in these courses, but the sanctions would still be held. I'm likely going to propose this to the academic integrity panel, but there is still doubt in which if I will be able to get this request approved.

I also did some reflection about the severity of the sanctions I got. I wanted to know from people in academia if they saw my punishment as just. I saw my actions as an action of weakness, and the panel acknowledged I had no malicious intent; but a stupid mistake. While this is an extreme example, I get extremely upset when I think of how students with criminal charges in crimes like sexual assault are allowed to finish their degree with no sanctions but I am sanctioned for a mistake that was largely rooted with my mental and physical illnesses. It will also be extremely difficult for me to pursue the jobs I want and enrol in grad school, as the grades for these courses are capped at a C for me.

I was wondering if there are any alternatives to what I plan on proposing to the panel - which is re-enrolling in the courses with the same sanctions... and I was wondering if I could convince them to drop the sanctions that would penalise my grades...Any insight or opinions would be appreciated.

TLDR: I altered a doctor's note because she wrote the dates wrong and I was an anxious and bed-written shut in. I have deferred exams to write and don't think I can pass. Was wondering if there are any alternatives and if my school is being too harsh.",29Nov2018,1

307,"My wife and I have wanted a dog for a very long time, and its getting quite frustrating that we can't seem to figure out the details.

Here's the scenario: my wife and I live in a European city where I don't speak the language. We both have full time jobs that mean we are out of the house from 8am-6pm Monday to Friday - and we can't come home for lunch walks. We need to travel to visit our families often, making our vacation time limited. The city/country we live in doesn't have a ""dog culture"" in that daycare and dog walkers aren't as easy to obtain/find. We also live very centrally downtown. Finally, we may move in the next few years and would be terrified to put the dog in a cargo hold of a plane, hence thinking a smaller dog. 

We've thought about a puppy of course - but our concern is that we couldn't take enough time off to raise it right. We also feel like we'd be doing an active dog a disservice by not being there during the day. So it would seem that our only option, if we can figure out where/how to adopt, is to find a dog that's more than 1 year old, could travel in the cabin of a plane, doesn't require a lot of exercise (but can go for long walks), and which is ok being alone.

Has anyone out there faced a similar situation and overcome it? 

Are any of my assumptions here wrong? E.g. I shouldn't actually be worrying about it? 

Finally, if we did adopt a dog that fits that description, any advice on how much bonding time it would need with us (how much time we should take off work to be with it 24-7)?

315,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

So I am currently in my first year of Politics at a well respected University. At the very start of my course I totally thought I wanted to escape this degree and I was not enjoying it at all, so I applied to a different university in the same area for a degree in Advertising. I have an interview next Wednesday and I am not sure that I will be making the best choice if I go to this university instead of the one I am currently at. I would be aspiring to be a copywriter / coming up with the creative ideas if I swiched to this degree as a career however I have been told by the admissions person at this university that my politics degree is going to help me in this Advertising degree. This makes me think that I would be in better stead to just stay in attendance at my current university which is more well respected and I feel more proud of, with opportunities for copywriting experiences like the magazine / work experience workshops / CV workshops than switching to the other degree to start next September. I wanted to know you guys' outside opinion on this?

Basically my options are - stay in my current well-respected university to finish my degree in Politics or switch to the less respected university to do a degree in Advertising.

What do you guys think?

Couple of days ago she said she loves me and that I will be her's forever. I didn't found this troubling since a lot kids this age tend to get attached on person very quickly. The problem occured today when she touched my ass three times. I said to her that this is not ok, she was smilling and ran away.

Hi, I'm on my phone, so sorry for any formatting issues in advance. I'm fairly new at a job, been there less than a year. Since I've started it was told to me that one of my coworkers is cheating on her fiance. Now, I dont know her too well, and we dont hang out at all outside of work or talk much at work. But I know she is 100% cheating. She is cheating with a coworker and I've seen them out on dates before. Everyone agrees that its screwed up but no one has told her fiance. I dont know him at all or even met him. I know if my fiance was cheating on me, I would absolutely want to know. So, what do I do? Should I tell him?

I work there during the week and I met my boyfriend there and he works there on shifts. My mum also works there! She started off as deputy manager, and very  recently became the manager. In the past couple of weeks a few people there are being very nasty about me, to my boyfriend - as if he isn‚Äôt going to come and tell me what they said?

330,"Hey,

I‚Äôll try to keep this short and thank you in advance for any advice offered. 

I had a falling out with some friends a bit ago. I would do some things while drunk which would upset them, like acting like a dick. I‚Äôm not here to offer excuses or deny any bad that I did. 

However, I truly loved my friends like they were family, and still do. I was very apologetic for my behaviour and after they really got mad, said I would quit drinking as I didn‚Äôt want to be a burden to anyone and upset anybody just in case. 

A few of my friends were supposed to move in with me soon, but it turns out the other week that they have decided to move in with our friends, who are upset with me. 

This upset me as we always planned to live together and while I‚Äôm no saint, it still hurt. I felt like I had been screwed over and have now been left on my own to find a place for January. 

My friends who are upset with me are conveniently forgetting all the things I did for them. I also like to think that if this was the other way round, I would be way more forgiving. 

I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for being mad at me when I have messed up, but I feel like I‚Äôve been abandoned by my friends and I don‚Äôt feel that is deserved. It also kind of stings as I introduced everyone and now feel like that they are leaving me behind. 

I made it clear to my friends that were supposed to move in with me in January, how I felt, but they either didn‚Äôt get it, or tried to deflect with things that had nothing to do with all this. 

We all work at the same place as well which makes things awkward, like really awkward. 

Do I just ignore them? Should I forgive them? No matter what I did, I truly feel hurt and backstabbed too. I don‚Äôt know what to do next. 

A part of me wants us to all be friends again. Another part of me worries that they‚Äôll hurt me again and break my trust again, but they are the only friends I have so idk what to do. 

Sorry for the ramble and long post. Any advice would be great. ",29Nov2018,1
331,"So I was stuck in a parking space (overcrowded parking space with cars parking in random places as all the proper spots were full) and it was clear I couldn't get out since one was behind me. I went into the reception of the building and asked if the owner of car xxx with blah blah registration could let me out and that was all fine, they came down and let me out

However after reversing out of the spot then going to drive off, it was a hill start and I rolled maybe 10cm backwards with another car behind me. At the time I thought ""no I didn't hit it, I would have felt it"" as well as there being both the person who let me out and another pedestrian watching me neither of whom reacted as if anything out of the ordinary just happened. I did the little ""thanks"" wave to the one who let me out and they did the little ""no problem"" wave and I left

However because of me accidentally slightly scratching another car a few days ago in a similar situation I kept getting more paranoid that actually I did hit it, so I've rung up the reception of the place it's parked basically saying ""I don't think that I did, but if that car got hit, sorry it was me"".

338,"So this just happened to me a couple of days ago, I can't seem to let it go. I'll start with some background. During my 3rd year as an architecture student in 2015, I meet this exchange student on the first day of school. She just came up to me to ask where a class was. Turns out we had the same class so I let her know where she could go. Later on I found out that we had multiple classes including our main design studio which is 3 days a week for about 4 hours. For this class we were to have partners so we ended up being partners. Over the course of the semester I became very fond of her and we became very close friends. I had a girlfriend at the time who I broke up with midway through the semester and she had a boyfriend so i never really mad an effort to express how I felt. She was, smart, funny, sarcastic in the same way I was, and she was gorgeous. We had up and downs during the semester but like I said I had a crush on here long after the semester ended and she left.
Even though she left we continued to talk through direct messages on Facebook or Instagram. She would message me every so often or I would message her. Sometimes there would be months in between but we would occasionally chat about how we were doing and just random stuff. A year and a half ago, she told me she was doing her master's in the a city in the US. I hadn't seen here in almost 3 years at this point and she told me I should let her know when I wanted to go see her. She said we could hang out and catch up. She would show me around etc. I was super excited about the idea of seeing here but I had to wait some time before I could go. I had never been to the city and had been planning on it for some time so this all seemed to work. This year in August I bought a ticket to go during Thanksgiving and her response was, ""I hope I'm there when you are here"". This was not the response I had expected. Last week before I left to visit, I messaged her to let her know I was coming and it took her 3 days to respond. I had already been there a day by the time she responded. When she replied she told me we should meet up for coffee which I agreed to. We were both happy to see each other. We met chatted for about 3 hours and she was on here way. I suggested a bar after we finished the coffee but she said she was busy. She did tell me she was studying for finals but I had expected to spend a little more time with her. I came back home the next day, and something in me just feels incomplete. I haven't been able get over it. All this time I had been excited to see her again and she seemed pretty indifferent to it. Maybe it's just a stupid crush but I haven't been able to get over it. I can usually get over crushes fairly easy but this is different. Maybe I expected to much out of this meeting but it was only because she had hyped it up so much previously. I just want to stop thinking about her but I can't. I'm trying to figure out what happened here. Maybe I didn't make my clear enough that I thought we were going to hang out or she just really was busy but I was a little hurt. How do I get over this.

Between work, planning a marriage, moving, death in the family among other minor things I'm stressed and tired.
Your run of the mill case of just overwhelmed I guess.
What tipped the scales happened today at work. Let me start by saying I work for a small insurance sales off. Including boss and 2 managers there is maybe 30 employees. I have more exp in the insurance field then at leat 90% the boss 2 managers and one other worker is all I can think of having more.
Found out today I'm literally second from the bottom in enrollments this season. We are a help center for the ACA enrollments.
Not sure why but I was crushed. No one disputes my knowledge, I'm great on the phones, and I'm extremely hard working.
But I seem to just have the worst luck on getting people to answer the phone.
I'm looked up to by the new agents next to me in the office as I'm always the one to get up and help woth there issue calls and give extra training pretty much on the systems we use. But they are doing a good bit better then me as first year agents.

It's put me in a real low spot with the stress of moving into a new place. Only at nights after work. We work 6 days a week. My soon to be wife works with me. So there is little time to do anything after working almost 10 hours a day and feeling completely drained.

We also just had a death in the family. Our nephew committed suicide and we were all very close so it's it everyone hard.

And to top it all off me and my fiance are planning our wedding for May next year. Which is stressful for a number of family issue reasons.

So I'm sorry for the long rant, I'm just getting pretty down. Like I'm the living embodiment of Murphy's law. Especially at work. No matter how good I get and how much I learn I'm never good enough. And I'm looked at as I should be the best....... But I'm not.... ",29Nov2018,1

344,"I feel guilty about this, to be honest. But I really can't help it.

I am very wary of being alone with straight men. I didn't always feel this way, but after having some negative experiences, my perception has changed. 

I'm in a committed relationship; my partner and I have been together for almost three years now, and during this time I have had to drop a couple of 'friends' due to them getting the wrong idea.

It should be noted that I have never hidden the fact that I have a boyfriend. I make it very clear. Despite this, I had an ex-friend who, after some time, decided that he was the perfect man for me, decided that I actually wasn't happy in my relationship with my bf (lol), and promptly declared his undying love for me, demanding that I leave my boyfriend for him.

I told him that I was sorry but I felt incredibly uncomfortable, and to please not contact me again.

There have been similar moments like this one, but none quite so extreme. 

Anyway, to get back to the question: a very nice guy that I met at a party recently has been repeatedly asking to go see a movie or have dinner with him. He insists that it isn't a date, and it's just two friends hanging out, but I have told him that I'm not ok with hanging out alone with individual people, and I prefer group hangouts. This is a lie of course, I don't take issue to being alone with women, or with any of my gay male friends. I just don't know how to tell him that I don't want to be alone with him because he's a straight man without sounding like a lunatic.

Am I unfairly judging him? What do you think would be the best course of action?

Thanks to a tendency to buy a lot from Humble Bundle for one game I have a lot of PC game keys laying around. Some are duplicates, some are games I have no interest in and some are games that I've just never bothered googling to find out what they are about (and I have no intention to. Zero regrets, zero shame).

The few years has been rough. This year was....bad. So I decided to try an end the year on a high note. I've been running a series of giveaways in PC gaming sub with various themes. One I really want to try is an evil santa giveaway.

Problem is, I have no damn Idea how to do that online.

I‚Äôm currently working 2 part time jobs (part time because I‚Äôm in college and can‚Äôt do full time with my schedule) and I‚Äôm considering dropping job A. Allow me to elaborate.
Job A is a lot more work physically, the bosses are total assholes, and strict as hell, but it pays very slightly better than job B (about 40 cents per hour).  They also pay in checks so I get some of my money taken by the government. I also don‚Äôt get to work at the other one much because A takes up all of my free time and they do not work with my schedule that isn‚Äôt school only. This one is only going to last me until early to mid January, as it‚Äôs seasonal work.
Job B is easier, only about 5 miles farther away from my dorm than job A, a great boss, pays in cash only, and I can do schoolwork while I‚Äôm there. B also is very lenient with my schedule and is willing to work around and conflict that I may have. B is also a more permanent job while I‚Äôm in college. 
I should also add that if I drop A, I can be home (a couple hours away) a lot more during the Christmas break, but if I keep it I‚Äôll barely get to be home.
Do y‚Äôall think I should drop job A now or just wait? Thanks for y‚Äôall‚Äôs help!",29Nov2018,1

My grandmother lives with Uncle. She is 77 and recently been in a deteriorating condition.

My Uncle (Mom's real brother) and my other Aunty (Mom's real sister) have been fighting over property and my Grandmother's possession.

These monsters care more about money than their mother's health. My Mom tried to intervene for the sake of Grandmother but instead they insulted and abused her to the extent of making her depressed and hopeless.

My Uncle told my mom to not visit Grandmother since he claims to know what he is doing and doesnt need unwanted people in the house.

To add to this, my Uncle is venting out his frustration on my Grandmother. Basically she's being shouted at for being ill.

My Mom has gone into severe depression and has already accepted the fate that Grandmother will soon die because of all this heartbreak.

My Mom and I cant even visit my own Grandmother to check on her, since we fear that visiting her will only infuriate Uncle more and we fear that after we leave he will vent this anger on Grandmother.

358,"TL;DR at the end.   
  
A bit of backstory, ever since my wife and I (both in our early 20s) got married almost 3 years ago she wanted to get cats. I also love cats so I shared this desire. She has always been much more enthusiastic about getting them though. We didn't get our own place until about a month ago and a few days after we moved in the humane society was doing a deal on cats. We didn't care what kind of cat we got (new, old, color, etc) but we ended up getting 2 calico brother/sister kittens that were 10 weeks old. Ever since we got them we have both loved them equally. They both have very distinct personalities but neither of them are mean or aggressive. So after owning them for about 3 weeks they are definitely fond of me.. I work 7-4 and when I am gone, they sleep/hang out in the spots that I am sure have my scent (my desk chair at home, my side of the bed). They like to cuddle/sleep on me at night and when I leave in the morning, they stay on my side of the bed. When I am home they both love on me and try to jump in my lap. When my wife and I go our separate ways (I go on my computer she watches TV/goes to bed) they BOTH follow me and lay on my lap while I play even though it is colder in the basement.  
  
(One of the cats is at the vet this morning because of some medical issues already so she was not at the house for this story)  
An example of some favoritism is this morning when I left. Our cat was sleeping on my side of the bed near my legs so before I got out of bed, I scooped him up and put him near on my wife's side of the bed so that I wouldn't flip him on the floor when I got out. Before I got up, I stayed in bed a few minutes and gave him some cheek/chin rubs to kind of lull him back to sleep. Then I got up and started getting dressed to which he turned his head and noticed. Then I left the room and he immediately followed me downstairs. After I left he went back upstairs to sleep on my side of the bed. My wife woke up about an hour later and stayed downstairs which he did not follow her when she did. After a while she filled his food bowl so he immediately came downstairs.  
  
Neither of the cats are mean to her directly or are ""out to get her"". They just seem to like me more and I can tell it makes her a little upset since she wanted them so badly.  
  
So what can I do or what can she do to get the cats to like her more? She is not mean to them and only loves them very dearly. She would never hurt them and isn't the ""punisher"" or anything.  
  
TL;DR: The cats like me a lot but are not mean to my wife (shes also not mean to them), which makes her sad because she really really wanted them.",29Nov2018,1

361,"Hi everyone, this is my first time posting to this sub reddit so I apologize if my question is not really relevant. First Ill start with some back story. I own a fairly expensive gaming pc (~1700 CAD) and I recently purchased an ssd that I wanted to install windows onto. Since I didn't really feel like installing it myself and going through the hassle of reinstalling windows I decided to drop it off at a local computer repair shop. The shop has a fairly good reputation in my small town for being reliable and fair, so I didn't have any issues with leaving my pc there for a few days. When I talked to the owner he told me that it would be 24 to 48 hours for him to get to my pc because he had 15 others in the shop and he is the only employee. I dropped my pc off at his shop on the 20th of November (9 days ago) and I have only heard from him once since then, on the monday. I tried driving by the shop, over multiple days, during their hours of opperations, but every time the business was locked and the closed sign was in the window. When he called me on Monday about my pc, he appologized to me for the long wait and said that there was a death in his family and he had to take care of funeral arangements and stuff like that. He also told me, however, that my pc would be ready the next day to pick up and that he would call me to pick it up. After not recieving a call all day, I tried calling him and driving by the store again only to be met with a locked door and closed sign. So I havent heard from him since monday and it seems his store hasnt been open since then either. Im just looking for advice as to how I can get my PC back. I know that the business owner needs time to grieve and that it must be incredibly difficult being a sole proprietor and being closed for so long. I also realize that I am being a little bit selfish for wanting my pc back, given what he is going through, but I also need my pc for school and have been stuck using the computers at my university library to get my school work done. Any advice on how I should deal with this issue would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",29Nov2018,1

364,"I need a piece of advice. I met this guy online about six months ago. It was thru a language learning app. We texted everyday and over time we've become friends, I think. He told me he's single. Just a month ago, he told me his last name so I had the urge to check if he had any social media accounts. He has Instagram. (N.B. I told him I didn't have instagram). He doesn't know it but I checked his instagram. All of his posts are about his dogs. So of course I had to check his followers. And voila, I found this girl who also had a dog and it seemed like their dogs are constantly ""hanging out"" every where. So based on that I realized she's his girlfriend. I really consider him as a friend but this is such a form of betrayal to me. So I told him I was busy with work so I wouldn't be able to talk to him anymore as frequent as before. But really, I just didn't want to talk every day with a guy who was lying to my face. And I don't ever want to be the reason why they would breakup. (N.B. We haven't really talked for weeks now.) Just a while ago I checked his instagram account to check on him (really, to ""stalk"" him üòÑ) and found out he's actually married and his wife just gave birth to their daughter a few days ago. I was shocked and felt disappointed that he had lied to me about his marriage. 

I don't get why he would withhold that information to me. Was he planning on cheating on his wife with me? Should I confront him about this matter? Or just let karma takeover? Coz I am not really the confrontational type. lol. Besides, as I've said before, we don't talk anymore. And what would I do if he suddenly contacted me again?

P.S. He told me he liked me but I thought it was just as friends since I clearly told him I have no interests in dating. I think I am aromantic. And I call him ""dude"" and ""man"" for Pete's sake.

I've noticed that I'm spending a considerable amount of time each day preparing meals.

I think a key way to cut down on meal preparation time is to make meals in bulk and store them for future days.

Soups, sandwiches, salads (three Ss!) are all things I could make in bulk and easily store for at least a few days without being concerned about them going off. I am wary of storing meat for days. What more substantial foods/meals, things which will satisfy hunger more than soups, salads, sandwiches, can I make in bulk and store for days? You can be specific or general.

367,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

Generic post about having no hobbies. I know I need motivation and to force myself to do something new, but I just can't do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory. 

&amp;#x200B;

Christmas is here, people are asking what I want. I've no idea what I want as I have no hobbies. My days consist of getting up, going to work, going home, browsing reddit on my phone, drinking, and sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weekends consist of playing video games to pass time, more drinking and sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried new hobbies, but I'm no good at them. I know the old ""nobody is good at anything from the start"" adage but I can't grasp the concept. 

&amp;#x200B;

Music? I don't know shit about music theory and can't learn it despite trying. 

&amp;#x200B;

Art? I can't draw worth a damn and no matter how I try, I can't draw a cube with straight edges. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not tried a lot else. Writing doesn't interest me. Sitting at a computer tires me and feels uncomfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not really sure what I can do here or what I expect to get out of this. I know the problems, I know the solution is always ""just force yourself to try"" but I still fail after trying and don't get any better. My days are essientally just spent passing time until I die. I just long to lay down and pass time until some pointless job or busy work comes along to fill the time.

She doesn't talk a lot to anyone else in the class and she doesn't seem to have any social media accounts. I also haven't talked to her a lot; the only time was when I saw her reading a book that I've read before and I started talking about it with her. There are 2 more days of class left next week and I would like to approach her and confess. Is it too late?

Also, I'm not sure if I should do it as it might come off as weird since we haven't talked a lot nor do we know each other (I'm not even sure if she already has a boyfriend or not). I would like to know more about her though as she seems like a nice girl. If so, I wouldn't know what to say to start it off without it being awkward. Please help! ",29Nov2018,1
381,"I [M18] am a freshman at college, first semester. I took to the college life fairly quickly, joining clubs, being involved, and most importantly, making friends. Everything was bliss up until last night. I was scheduling my classes for next semester when I remembered I might be in one of my friend's [F18] classes, so I text her, asking about it. She says she can't check, but she has bad news: she can't text me anymore. She says her boyfriend doesn't like me and for my safety, if she doesn't text me for a little while. I tried sending her another message, but her boyfriend [Unknown age, but older than me], starts telling me to fuck off. He adds me on Snapchat and we have a one sided argument (he was the argumentative one, I kept my cool). At one point, he threatened that if I didn't stop, he would find me and cause me physical harm. I guess he thought I was gonna take her away from him, bit I told him I already have a girlfriend. If I could add pictures, I'd post them here, due to the fact that they conflicted completely with what my friend was gelling me. Her boyfriend was telling me that I was a ""Psycho, creeper, stalker."" Anyway, I agree to leave them alone. However, I know this guy doesn't go to my college, so I find my friend and ask her what the fuck is going on. She tells me she's under a lot of stress, that it was gonna be OK, and that she was gonna talk to her guy. I get a call today from campus police asking to come down. I do so and they ask me if I know the girl this story is about, I say yes. They ask what happened and I was only able to talk about what happened before her boyfriend came into the equation. They let me go with a warning, telling me not to contact her, don't talk to her, leave her alone, etc. because that's what SHE (my emphasis, not theirs) wants. So this means one of two things: She wants nothing to do with me and I don't know why, or she wants me to leave her alone til after she sorts everything else with her boyfriend.
What do you all think? I don't know what to make of it.",29Nov2018,1
382,"Hi everyone. I'm looking for advice on how I can communicate with someone else's boss that their employee was unprofessional, without getting the person fired  or some similar severe punishment.

Story: My company rents parking spaces from a parking structure that is narrow and small. People tend to speed, or ride the car in front of them. The person I am talking about in this post was riding my ass almost the entire way up 5-6 floors. Eventually, I slowed down and pumped my breaks to let them know they were too close (not as severe as a break check IMO). He got visibly upset and honked his horn, while I flipped him off. We both parked and got out of our cars, when I (unfortunately) asked ""What the **** is wrong with you?"". This put the other driver in a defensive role and he immediately went into ""You want to fight?"" mode. Having fighting experience (Dutch boxing/Muay Thai), I wasn't afraid and followed suite of taking off my jacket like he was (that was dumb). It was at this point I realized he was scared, and that I had no intention of hurting him whatsoever. I walked over to him and told him ""I'm not going to fight you, I just want to talk about you riding my ass"". Nothing came of it other than him repeating how I ""best not get within his arms reach"". He started calling me names for not wanting to fight and to just talk it out. It was at this point he started pushing me while he was walking. I let things go, only to find him outside of the garage walking towards me again. I asked where he worked, so I could talk to his boss about his behavior. He shoved me towards the door of his office, and we both entered. 

I don't think he knew that I knew his boss/CEO and have rather good terms with him. Unfortunately, he wasn't as his desk so we went to talk with his supervisor. Things were rather hairy at this point, and he was in my face in front of his entire office calling me names and trying to fight me. After telling his supervisor my side of the story, he told his side, to which the supervisor was just giggling. Realizing the supervisor didn't care, I apologized to the other man for getting him so angry, and let the supervisor know I would just communicate with the CEO later. 

That's where you come in Reddit. I've talked to my boss about the situation and we both agree that the CEO of employee should know about the situation, as our companies are neighbors and have been for years. They purchase services from us, and I don't want any of this reflecting negatively on either company. However, I don't want to get this guy fired or something similarly severe for two reasons. 1. My anxious mind starts playing out scenarios like him keying my car, flattening my tire, having a gun, etc. 2. I'm at fault here too, heightening the situation thinking I needed to ""man-up"", and obviously making him feel threatened. My fighting background teaches to never be a bully, and to stand up against injustice. I don't want to cause this guy any harm physically or financially. However, he was very unprofessional in how he handled the situation, considering I was trying to resolve it. I find myself asking ""What's the point of talking to his boss?"" and letting this continue, while also asking myself ""am I really not going to do anything about this?"". 

tl;dr - Got in a verbal altercation with a neighbor companies employee that almost became a fist fight. Instead resulted in me trying to resolve it with his supervisor who giggled at the situation and didn't take it serious. Now waiting to have a meeting with his companies CEO about the problem. Need to know how to communicate with the CEO without getting the guy in too much trouble.",29Nov2018,1
384,"I'm sorry if this is a little long. long time lurker here. A little background I work at a place that fixes computers. now I don't have a degree but I know basic computer knowledge since I'm currently in school for architecture but prior wanted to go into the tech field.  
They hired me because they are all mostly tech nerds who have difficulty just holding normal conversations with customers. they span from being aggressive when a customer doesn't know what they are talking about to being awkwardly quite when a customer is just asking them a simple question. that is where I come in. I answer the phone and call customers for them since I have worked prior with customers in an office setting. and file paperwork and fix computers mostly desktops with simple problems ranging from hardware to software.   
While at work a week before Thanksgiving break I was working on this all in one PC. it simply needed a Windows Reload. I was just about finished when I got up from my desk to turn around I guess a wire was loose and the screen shattered on the keyboard. the computer still works perfectly fine. but instead of ordering the screen part to fix it or I would assume they had some type of insurance for something like this. my coworker even told me to relax (i was freaking out and crying) and told me that it happened to him once and it was fine.   
Instead, (my boss) ordered the computer outright and it was taken out of my paycheck. I work 3 days a week here minimum wage since I am in school but now I'm working the 3 days and getting paid for only 2. he had told me he wouldn't affect my Thanksgiving week pay since I only worked 2 days but instead it did affect it and now I was only paid for one day last week.   
this pay cut is now in its 2nd of the 3 weeks. I'm not a very aggressive or confrontational person but now its affected my way of life. I assuming this cut would not happen this week as my boss promised and still had my normal bills ready to be taken out of my account but now my account is in the negatives because of this hit. I haven't been able to pay my phone bill and thankfully I don't pay rent and have been using the little bit of cash I have to eat. (live with the boyfriend, am gay and of color so you guys know how THAT works out with family so no support outside of him) but its made me so insecure to work on anything because what if something else goes wrong and effects my pay again? as soon as he told me it would be coming out of my paycheck I printed out my resume and started searching for another job and plan to leave as soon as I find a new job and finish paying off the all in one because I don't want to be rude and just walk out. how would any of you handle this situation?",29Nov2018,1
385,"I am unsure whether to press charges or to let this go and continue on with life.. 

&amp;#x200B;

The past year I have been in the process of a pursuing a domestic violence case against my ex boyfriend. Luckily I was granted a protection order of no contact though we went against it. A couple months ago we got into contact, it was my birthday and somehow through manipulation I ended up inviting him over. We drank and had a decent time, mid way through I blacked out. I don't remember ever getting home, or even locking my doors after. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well the case hearing came around and ex started threatening me. That if I am to go and testify or continue to pursue charges he will release videos and photos of that night. To me I thought nothing happened till he sent me a photo of my naked body with the time stamp of my birthday. He claims I took his phone and started taking nude selfies. To him I then forced him to stay and engage in sexual activities, which he says I consented to. He says he recorded consent and continued to record whatever else we engaged in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have absolutely NO memory of this happening. AT ALL. My last memory was us outside my house drinking and suddenly my memory goes blank. I never black out while drinking or drink to the extent of getting too drunk to not remember. He claims I consented though I have no memory of it at all. Is this classified as rape? I did not want to engage in any sort of sexual activity. All I wanted was to have a good night in hopes of him being good to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to pursue this or whether to do anything about it. I don't know if I have any standing since to him he recorded me consenting while intoxicated though to me its all blank memory. I am so lost.. Through the months I stupidly kept little occasional contact but I have finally opened my eyes to the monster he is and would like to move forward from him and his abuse. ",29Nov2018,1

387,"Me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F) just ended our 1 year relationship. We were long distance for the last 2 months because of uni, and she‚Äôs treated me horribly. I love her so much and all I ever did was love her and treat her well. She cheated on me 4 days before I went to visit her, and when I found out (the day I arrived to visit her) she begged for forgiveness and said she loved me and wanted to make us work. She seemed so remorseful and she said she was lonely and depressed, and I was willing to forgive her. We had a good 4 days together during my visit. She then dumped me 4 days later, when I was so drunk. That night was so horrible. That was 2 days ago. We ended on decent terms eventually when she came back in my room and we cuddled and spent the night together. In the morning we talked calmly, but I am so so sad and hurt by what happened. 

She said she doesn‚Äôt love me the same anymore, but it just confuses me because we were fine the day before. We talked about the future. She said she loved me and wanted to be with me for a long time. The next day she dumped me. I can‚Äôt (and don‚Äôt want to) believe that we‚Äôre over. And we said we were gonna spend Christmas together, and then reevaluate after that. I‚Äôm so upset about the time that we lost. If she just wanted to dump me now and not spend Christmas with me, she obviously wants to get rid of me fast. She obviously wants to be with other people right now (confirmed by the very frequent tinder notifications I kept hearing ping from her phone the morning after we broke up).

She was my best friend. I could tell her anything. I was so comfortable around her. I‚Äôve never been so comfortable or open around anyone. I normally find it difficult to talk about feelings and make deep friendships with people. With her it was so easy. I‚Äôve never loved anyone as much. She was my first love. My first sexual experience. My first real serious relationship. 

Now I feel really lonely. I‚Äôve lost that person. I feel like I have no one. That‚Äôs not true, I have my family and I have friends but none of them are to the degree she was. None of them know everything about me, and none of them accept me for everything I am. And none of them I can talk to about absolutely anything. None of them can cuddle me and make me feel happy in their arms. I just feel so so so alone now without her. And that‚Äôs even worse because it‚Äôs making me want to contact her which I know is a bad idea.

It makes me feel even worse because she‚Äôs at uni and has loads of friends. And last night she was out clubbing and spending time with her friends and she seems okay. I asked her whether she would spend a long time getting over me. She said of course she would, she said she still loves me and I was her first too and we had such a good connection she‚Äôll take ages to get over me. But I fucking know that she‚Äôs probably already hooking up with people left right and centre now that I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôm really not okay. I‚Äôm lying in bed and my family is comforting me but I‚Äôm not having any fun at all. She looks completely fine. 

Furthermore, I never had a relationship before her and that was fine. I didn‚Äôt feel lonely. I was happy with my own company, but for the last year I‚Äôve been with her and it‚Äôs opened my eyes to having that. I can‚Äôt go back to how I was. It‚Äôs so difficult. I don‚Äôt know how to live like I used to. I just want her back. I want our relationship just as it was before. I wish this was all a terrible dream.

How can I feel less lonely? I don‚Äôt have any really close friends, and being here in this house with my family, even though they are so supportive and great, just doesn‚Äôt feel the same at all.  I took a gap year before uni and so I have no new friends. I have old friends but they‚Äôre dotted all around at different unis. I still feel alone even with my family comforting me and talking to my friends over the internet,.

Thanks for the help.

tl;dr: Me and my girlfriend of a year just broke up and it wasn‚Äôt nice at all and I‚Äôm so hurt and upset. I feel so lonely because she was my best friend and the person I was closest to in the whole world, and I have friends, but I‚Äôm not at uni so they‚Äôre dotted all around the place at different unis. None of them are super close friends either. ",29Nov2018,1

Full Context: 
I‚Äôm a guy, and I started dating this girl about a year ago. I‚Äôd known her a bit before we started dating so I already knew she was Bisexual before we were dating, and I was fine with it. We were both loyal and committed, so everything was great.

About a month ago she was watching some TV show about lesbians and mentioned she could see herself with a woman if something happened to us. I thought that was odd, didn‚Äôt think about it.

A week later, she said she thought she was gay, because girls are all she could think about. We sat down and talked about it, and she cried at the thought of having to break up with me. She decided to take some time to think things over, because the thought of me breaking up with her was too much.

Fast-forward to yesterday. She talked to me and admitted she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt even like penises anymore‚Äù. She‚Äôs come to the decision that she is really gay. However, she still loves me and wants to continue the relationship. It‚Äôs getting weird for me, as she says she loves me but has begun to shut down any romantic advances I make anymore. She seems like she wants a platonic relationship with me, but continues to mention that she‚Äôs thinking about girls. 

This, combined with the stress of school is currently causing me to lose my mind and I really don‚Äôt know what to do here. I can‚Äôt break up with her outright because she loves me and would be totally devastated if I did, but she refuses to even downgrade to friends with me to go date girls.

(1)My family is guju(west Indian basically) so they expect a lot from me. I'm an only child. I have good grades. I exercise a lot and I'm social enough by most people's standards. I love my parents but they keep demanding that I marry a Gujarati girl or they won't stay with me. I know they don't have the most money to afford retirement in america, but they do for India. I'd be fine having them, but my mom and dad keep bringing it up even though I've told them not to.

(2) This past year I was dealing with a liver disease. It wasn't terrible, but I lost some weight and I wasn't feeling the best. One of the things on my mind was whether or not I was gonna die alone, but that was just me thinking really negatively. Doctor was really good and I'm on medication now. Gained like 25 lbs and I really didn't feel good about myself but my parents were good in saying at least I'm healthy now and that's what matters. Basically I'm stressed about my health.

(3) I'm 20 and in college. I have not had time to socialize because I work part-time, commute to college, and look for internships. I've gotten an offer for a summer internship, but I've got finals coming up and I'm filling in more hours to afford school so my parents don't have to pay for me. I've asked a few girls out, all Indian and been rejected. I've liked other girls but family pressure keeps me from trying to get close.

I know this is a chewed out topic, but I would love some ideas...

One of my best friend's birthday is coming up and she's having a party on the first of December. I have no idea what to get her.

Some info on her: she's in early twenties, working full time in tech world. Very busy and career oriented but also likes to have fun. She's incredibly thoughtful and an overall amazing person. She loooooves makeup and is a huge geek.

Here's some ideas I had but probably won't be using:

- a really fancy makeup palette. I got told yesterday that her cousin is getting her the palette she really wants so this it out of picture. Also I bought her makeup for some other occasion already so I feel like I need something new.

- some geeky thing (?). I don't want to risk that... I am not into geeky stuff at all and honestly have no idea what exactly she's into because computer games and stuff like that make as much sense to me as quantum physics.

- a collage of our pictures in a pretty frame. But she made herself one a while ago.

I was thinking about getting her some cute self care things, some stuff to relax, but not sure what. Can't get her bath bombs because she doesn't have a bath in her apartment, she's very particular with face masks...

So I'm really at loss on what to get her. I feel awful about it. I'm usually good with gifting and yet I can't figure something out for a person I love very much and know a lot about.

Like most students would do, my friend decided he didn't have to study because the likelihood that it was getting dropped was high. He had the great idea of guessing ""A"" for each question as it was a bucket list of his and he ends up with a 28%. The overall average was a 36% because of the majority opting to not study or not take the exam entirely. A few days after the exam, the professor decides to take back the drop and the ""tradeoff"" is that the final exam is no longer cumulative and instead, on the last quarter of the class material. Since it was a verbal agreement and not stated anywhere in the syllabus, the dropped exam policy was never in effect and the professor believes that it was his right to no longer drop the exam.

I want to keep both (assuming I get the second one) because I need the money and it's different experiences. But I'm also a full time university student (albeit my schedule does offer me a good amount of free time). 

Has anyone here done it? If so, what is your experience and how do you best manage it? Should I let the other store know that I currently hold a part time position as a cashier? I don't want overlapping schedules if I make it to another round of interviews, but I'm also worried if they know I'm already working part time elsewhere it'll lower my chances of getting the position.

Thanks in advance!",29Nov2018,1
410,"Some advice I gave to my sister who isn‚Äôt enjoying university. Thought it‚Äôd be worth sharing because this advice applies to pretty much any negative circumstance that you find yourself in.

I can imagine how shite it is for you, not enjoying work then not having a social life to at least look forward to, to make the work worth it. So if it continues like this then it would be completely fair enough to want to drop out. But if you were to drop out you‚Äôd have to have guarantees/certainty about what you‚Äôd do next because if not then you could be in a worse position. However in the ideal situation you‚Äôd stay at uni and start enjoying it. The most important thing would be that when you come home at Christmas you can say without any doubt ‚ÄúI did all I could to have the best time possible‚Äù, because if you can say that then you will have no regrets. But you have to ask yourself now- ‚Äúam I doing everything in my control to try and maximise my happiness/what I‚Äôm getting out of this bad situation?‚Äù e.g. am I maximising my opportunities to make friends. In some ways I think your shite situation is a blessing for you Jess because it will make you a lot stronger if you try and think of ways to improve it, focussing on what you are in control of. If you can just start trying to do little things everyday to go out of your comfort zone then not only can you grow hugely as a person (increased confidence etc)  and get more out of uni but it will also help you to make friends. So start doing little things to go out of your comfort zone, e.g. say hi to people you walk past/starting a conversation with someone who you wouldn‚Äôt normally. In addition, it‚Äôs not a surprise that you are feeling down because on top of your bad situation you are doing 0 exercise. Exercise is pretty much the biggest life hack because it is essentially guaranteed to put you in a better mood every time you do it. (Also if you do exercise through sport then you can start making friends like this). Furthermore, you should make a list of things that you want to get out of uni and then write next to it how you are going to achieve these things. E.g. ‚ÄúI want to increase my social confidence‚Äù. So I will start speaking to more people (as an example). Additionally, you should stop feeling sorry for yourself about your bad situation and start thinking ‚Äúwhat can I learn from this/what is this trying to teach me‚Äù and ‚Äúhow can I make the most of this‚Äù. Also you should start seeing this as a test/challenge that you‚Äôre going to overcome rather than something you‚Äôre stuck with.  If you‚Äôve got nothing on right now then just get a pen and notepad out and try writing down the questions + your answers to what I mentioned above. You need to take action if you want to improve your situation. ",29Nov2018,1
411,"So as the title states, my mom is an anti vaxxer (I‚Äôm 15) and I have tried to discuss this topic with her, but I failed to win the discussion as she is waaaay beyond the point of only being an anti vaxxer. She believes in the illuminati, and she thinks there‚Äôs a secret power (like the FBI) that has created diseases like ebola and smallpox, and then created vaccines to inject people with stuff that weakens them so they could control the people.

412,"This is a long story, but I am going to attempt to summarize it. I do childcare and have watched my friend's kids for 4 years now.   Her husband seemed okay at first, but very quickly he made me uncomfortable. I am a very sensitive person so I figured I was just being ridiculous. Over time, my SO got to know the husband and they started podcasts together. A couple of months into that, SO started questioning the husbands integrity and wondering if he should leave the podcasts. Despite his concerns, he continued on and In the process our 2 families became more and more intertwined. The husbands indiscretions started becoming more and more apparent and my SO became more and more frustrated that he felt like he had to continue his association with this person due to the podcasts and my involvement with their kids. The final straw came when the husband catfished his own wife, posted the fake interactions on Twitter and through some detective work, we figured it out. My SO confronted him about his lie, but it was denied and caused a big fight. Podcasts were ended and I had to decide whether I felt comfortable watching the kids still. I soldiered on despite the husbands efforts to sabotage everything my SO holds dear. Over the next 2 months I found proof of awful things like texts where the husband talked about sexually "" grooming "" his much younger wife, naked pictures of his wife's twin sister that he had sent to a group message that my SO was included in, and conversations where he said sexually charged things about my sister. I already felt the need to end childcare with them, but I truly love the kids. One night, after the husband started texting my sister until she blocked him, his wife started texting me asking why he was blocked. After being pushed ( after telling her I was uncomfortable with being asked about it) I finally got very frank with her and told her everything I knew. She brushed it all off. The next day they came to drop the kids off and the husband told his kids to go outside. He confronted me right there in my own living room. He argued with me for 45 minutes. I told him I dont trust him and nothing he could say would change my mind. They left...without the kids obviously. I have continued to watch the kids after that. It has been a week and my heart pounds so hard every time he comes to get them. I have to stop watching them, but have no idea how to let them go. I love the kids. We need this family out of our lives for the sake of our sanity and safety. How do I let them know I can't do this anymore?",29Nov2018,1

414,"Hello there, I've been looking at Redditnfor a while, but this is a first post 

Long story short, my biological mother, H, has disowned me &amp; my dad and has accused us bith of trying to kill her. We suspect that she may be bipolar, have narcissistic personality disorder abs and lots of other problems, but she refused to ever see a doctor for it, so we'll never know. 

So, as for my question. I do not have kids, but I plan to have them. However, since H has disowned us both and has spread lies about us, my kids will not meet her while I'm raising them. 

But I know that they will inevitably ask about their grandmother, and why they've never met her. So what would you suggest that I say? 

Thanks to all",29Nov2018,1
415,"So it's been 4 months now since my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. I've been seeking a lot of help, including here on Reddit and also through a therapist. To keep it short, the reason behind our breakup was simply a loss of attraction, though she continues to be close to me, enjoys my company, etc. which is confusing to me but is for a different post altogether. With all the advice I've been getting-- both critical and supportive-- I've been able to get motivated to move forward; however, keeping that momentum going has been extremely difficult.

One day I'll have a positive attitude about moving forward (usually after seeing my therapist or receiving words of encouragement).

The next day I might be busy with things and that'll keep me distracted.

Then maybe the next day might be slow, so I'll start thinking about things. And that's usually not a good thing. I'll think about the fact that we got along so incredibly well-- never fought, were intimate with each other, gave our best for each other, and so on. And so I end up with ""why did we have to break up?"".

I drag my feet through the next few days. I don't feel like eating, going out, doing my work. Nothing. People tell me to get over it, shake it off, man up. I just ignore it. I get reassuring words from friends. That helps surprisingly well. Sometimes it's enough to motivate me to get up. So I get back up.

I think about what I could improve about myself. What were the flaws in our relationship that I could learn from and improve for next time? I make several revelations. *Don't smother her. Take care of yourself. Understand her communication style. Don't take her for granted.*

*This is good. I'm improving myself. I know how to be a better partner. If only I had known this earlier! I would have done things like \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_. I wish we didn't have to break up. We were so great together already; this would have made it even better.*

Aaaaaaand we're back to being depressed.

My therapist tells me that I didn't really do anything wrong. I was selfless and always had good intentions, which is extremely positive for a relationship. *So why did we have to break up?!?!*

I realize how we could fix (or at least approach) one of the issues that we had in our relationship. It's a relatively small thing that could have made an enormous difference. We could have saved our relationship. We could start again and turn an already-great relationship into an even better one. *So why did we have to break up?!?!?!?!?!* (this one might be more like *Why won't you give it another chance?!?*)

I think you get the point.

I can't get over our relationship because I always conclude that our problems were so minor (or at least the solutions are minor). We had so many of the things that successful relationships require. She was genuinely happy. I know it's a terrible thing to say, but I think she's making a huge mistake.

Of course, this is only my side of the story. I have to respect her decision and understand that she has her reasons that I don't see. But how do I get over this when there's no denying that we were a great couple? ""Why did we have to break up?"" is going to be the death of me.",29Nov2018,1

417,"This company, Yellowstone neutra contacted me through an ambassador for a sponsorship on instagram. I run a fitness account which is slowly growing, but I didnt think I'd get a sponsorship this early. I cant find anything sketchy online, but I have a strange feeling. The ambassador was a real person. Here is the email transcript:

Hey Ben,¬†It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier. My job is to make you feel as comfortable as possible with us. Let me tell you about myself if you don't mind. I am the Athlete Sponsorship Director at Yellowstone. I graduated in 2012 with a Marketing Degree and a Minor in Kinesiology. I was hired to find Sponsored Athletes for our team, and we currently only have a couple spots left. I noticed you are a leader, have a huge heart for fitness, and would be a great addition to the team.

¬†

This may be a little unprofessional on my part, but I do want to say this - as soon as I saw your profile, I immediately wanted to get in contact with you and hopefully bring you on board our amazing team. You seem very passionate about fitness, intelligent, sociable and very approachable.¬†

¬†

Yellowstone Nutraceuticals is our newly revised supplement line. We just released a whole new selection of products and improved our formulas and flavors. We hired professionals from 3 different countries to help formulate our supplements that are actually backed by science. We wanted to create supplements that work, and taste incredible. On top of that, they‚Äôre FDA Approved and GMP Compliant. The current line includes: Protein, Fat Burners, BCAAs, Creatine, Multi-Vitamins. Follow our Instagram page @YellowstoneNutra

¬†

We also have the best tasting Protein on the market. Our 100% Whey Protein comes in Fruit Loops, Nesquik, Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Toasted Cinnamon Crunch and Cookies &amp; Cream flavours. And if you aren't already drooling, our BCAA's are Skittles flavored. We honestly perfected everything, top to bottom. We are perfectionists here at Yellowstone after all. To top it all off, ALL of our proteins have been tested by a third party company to ensure that our ingredients are legit and actually work. We are beyond proud to say that they have been professionally tested and confirmed that there are NO fillers or amino spiking in ANY of our products. We are the only known company that has done this, strictly because we care about our athletes and customers.

¬†

At this point I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre wondering what all of this has to do with you. The reason you were contacted is because we have an opening to be a Yellowstone Sponsored Athlete and we would love for you to accept it. As an Athlete, you‚Äôd be a representative for our brand. We‚Äôd set you up with a custom discount code. Every time someone uses your coupon code and a sale is made, you‚Äôll earn 25% of the sale (which is the highest amount among ANY fitness brand). It won't be hard to make $200+ per week... But it's not about the money; it‚Äôs about inspiring others to get involved in fitness and becoming a part of (what is on track to be) the biggest supplement company in the world.

¬†

The benefits of becoming a Sponsored Yellowstone Athlete include:

¬†

¬†

1. Sponsorship - Once you accept this position, we will be giving you all kinds opportunities to pursue with us. We will be giving you free supplements (if you can make a few sales/week which won't be difficult at all).

¬†

2. $100 Sales Bonus - You will be getting paid $100 each time you sell 10 supplements, as well as the commission you make off them. We keep track of the amount you sell by seeing how many times your discount code was used. Each time you sell 10, your salary will increase. There is NO set quota you need to make so don't worry about that!

¬†

3. Fitness Expos Team Event ‚Äì The Executives and I are currently planning for our team to appear at the upcoming Mr. Olympia and LA Fit Expos. We‚Äôll have some of our sponsored athletes fly down to represent us at our booth, all expenses paid. We‚Äôd be thrilled to have you, granted you join and things go well!

¬†

4. FREE Supplements for Life - We are going to be giving you free supplements on the ONLY condition that you are able to make around 2-3 sales per week, or about 10 per month. It really isn't too difficult, and of course we are going to help you market yourself.

¬†

5. Social Media Shoutouts ‚Äì Our company and partners run a number of social media accounts with combined followers of over 200,000. One of our Instagram pages and one of our Twitter pages will be the accounts that will shout you out, giving you tons of exposure, increasing your sales, and some added fame in the fitness industry.

¬†

6. Professional Marketing Guide ‚Äì To be a top-earning athlete, it‚Äôs a must to know how to market yourself as a representative of our company. We‚Äôll personally send you a guide we created to help you increase your social media platforms, reach out to people, and sky rocket your earnings.

¬†

7. Cash Giveaways ‚Äì As a sponsored athlete, you‚Äôll automatically be entered into all of our Appreciation Giveaways. This is our way of giving back to you. Every month we choose a random ambassador and send anywhere between $50-$500 as a way to show how much we care and appreciate you.

¬†

8. Free Supplements Giveaways ‚Äì Just like our Money Giveaways, we want to show how much we care by sending out free supplements to you. We‚Äôll be running monthly giveaways and sending supplements to random athlete. In addition, our highest earning Ambassador will also qualify for our Free Supplements For A Year program.

¬†

9. Vacation Giveaways ‚Äì If you cant already tell, we love giving back to our team. As a sponsored athlete, you‚Äôll automatically be entered into our Vacation Giveaway draws. We will be choosing random Ambassadors every other month and offering them an all paid trip for two to anywhere of their choice in North America!

¬†

(PRO TIP: The more sales you make, the more times your name is entered into our giveaways!)¬†

¬†

This all may seem overwhelming, but trust me when I say it's not. It is just a good way to get involved in the fitness world! It is how a lot of big names in the fitness industry got started such as Christian Guzman, Jen Selter &amp; Paige Hathway; the list goes on and on. I will always be here to answer your emails and questions. I don‚Äôt want you to think this will take up a lot of your time. The truth is that if you‚Äôre even slightly active on social and can make a couple posts about us, you can certainly make a difference.

¬†

Of course I know you are thinking, ""what's the catch?!"". Honestly, there isn't a ‚Äúcatch‚Äù. However, since you will be joining our team and representing us, we require you to try one of our supplement stacks. As soon as you do so, you will officially be the newest member of our team and get all of those insane benefits I mentioned earlier. I'll give you a discount code to use for the stack of your choice, so it shouldn't be too big of a deal. The reason we want you to get a stack is because it separates the passionate athletes from the ones who are just in it for the money and status. If it means anything to you, all of our profits go back into the company. Such as paying for flights to get our athletes to the expo's, upgrading our current warehouse, the cash and supplement give-aways and hiring professionals to design/formulate our products. We aren't in this for the money. We are in it to help our members get their fitness career to the next level and motivate as many people as we can along the way. I know you‚Äôre thinking ""if they wanted me on the team, wouldn't they send me free supplements?!"", and honestly we do want you on the team, but we just want you to invest in us only a fraction as much as we will be investing in you. We are going to help you get huge in the fitness world, get a TON of followers and make a lot of money. So again, ordering a stack is nothing to worry about at all in the long run.

¬†

Also, we want you to be able to try our products, post pictures with them and take your fitness goals to the next level. You are going to be buying supplements in the future anyway, so why not get them from the company you are going to be joining and representing. On top of having the most effective/best tasting supplements in the world, you are going to be given an opportunity of a lifetime that other athletes would kill for. We have some sponsored athletes in their 20's making more money than their parents. People are paying $30,000/year for college classes and lots of our ambassadors are making more than them the first 5 years they are out of school. Here is a link to the stacks, and the personal discount code to use is ¬†TB10.¬†http://yellowstonenutra.com/product-category/stacks/

¬†

The last thing I want to address is samples. I know you may be skeptical about representing a supplement line you have never tried but I just want to say this; We truly have perfected the taste and formulas of each individual product. We have got the attention of over 100 retail stores in the USA last month, and some are even carrying Yellowstone based on our formulas and flavor profiles alone. If you do not like the taste or results from our products, we have a 100% Money Back Guarantee. No questions asked. Frankly, sending samples out would take a few weeks, and we were really hoping to have you join our team immediately.¬†

¬†

Let me know if you want to join the team. If money is tight at the moment, let me know your budget and how much you are able to spend and we can work with you. If you are not able to order a stack, simply choose 1 or 2 items instead. We are your friends here don't forget that. I am excited to hear back from you :) Let me know your final thoughts, and as soon as you order your supplement stack of choice, we can get started working together. And to add, we ship international! It's no worries if you are located outside the USA. We really wanted to get this position filled today so let us know ASAP if we can get started. If everything sounds good, to ahead and order any stack of your choice and I will email you back right away with everything you need to get started with us. LAST THING (I promise haha) - don't be overwhelmed by all of this. It won't be time consuming and you won't have to make extra time for it. Just keep doing what you're doing and we will all be successful together!

¬†

Thanks for letting me annoy you for a few minutes

¬†

¬†

Sincerely, ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

418,"By ‚Äúdoing things she doesn‚Äôt like‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean anything horrid‚Äîshe gets after me for little things, like what memes I share, and the fact that I‚Äôm growing out my hair.

419,"I'll provide some background before I ask for advice:

 I began dating a really amazing guy about 7 months ago. The family was really nice and inviting with me at first but then it started to feel hostile. 
I noticed it first with my boyfriend's brother's girlfriend. She continuously gave me the cold shoulder and didn't seem to acknowledge that I was there. 
I shurgged it off, of course, because I really love this guy I'm with. 'All that matters is how he feels about me"" I reminded myself. I know I can't make everyone like me. 

I was over there for Thanksgiving and I was introduced by my boyfriend's mom as ""his friend"" which bothered me more than it should have. 
Did they not see me as his girlfriend? 
I, again, shrugged it off. 
I've noticed whenever I go over there now, I don't get a welcome anymore. It's more like a ""oh she's here...again... Kind of feeling. Yes, I hang out with my boyfriend whenever I can because we work opposite shifts currently, but still, I don't feel as if I'm around the family often enough. 

My boyfriend and I are moving out together and my boyfriend's dad keeps reminding me that ""his son will not support me and my animals"" which I understood the first time he said it. About the 12th time he reminded me this, my brain started thinking, ""do these people know that I am already independent and living on my own, supporting myself and my cats comfortably??"" I have a daunting feeling that his dad doesn't take me seriously when it comes to being successful. Maybe he thinks I'm using his son or something. (We're moving out of state together because he got an amazing job up there. I currently work a terrible job in a factory. My boyfriend asked me to go with him and I said yes.) 

I have an app that's tied to my Instagram and it tells me whenever people follow or unfollow me. 
Today I woke up to seeing that his brother unfollowed me. I was hurt. He was the only one I really got along with. I can't recall a single bad encounter with him. 
I've been trying to shrug it off but even I know you have to piss someone off pretty bad to make them unfollow you. 

I'm really really awkward around his little sister so there's that as well. 

I've never been good around families. My own family life is pretty terrible. I felt like I found a family that was accepting and would treat me like thier own, which it used to feel that way. Not anymore of course. I'm really shy and quiet around them but I occasionally joke around with them. 

That about sums it all up. I haven't been verbal about any of this at all. I don't want to start any drama in the family since we're moving and all and I would like to stay on good terms. I want so desperately for them to like me, or even see me as his girlfriend. 

Should I tell my boyfriend about my feelings towards his family? 
Should I send a message to the family, hell even one of them, and be open and honest with them about how I feel? 
Should I wait until after we move to ensure that I won't cause problems within the family? 
Should I keep it all bottled up and not tell anyone and keep shrugging it off? 
Should I kill them with kindness? 
Should I try to insert myself in more situations where I'm around the family so I can try to bond with them?

Thanks for your advice. All advice is welcomed.",29Nov2018,1
420,"Hey, Reddit. I'm very very new to even this site in general so I'm kinda nervous and wordy, but please bear with me.

I have a strained relationship with my mom. It's gotten worse ever since she started dating this guy a year ago, but on the topic of my mental health, she has always been squirrely.

Anxiety has been the Venom to my Eddie Brock for as long as I can remember. It started having a substantial negative effect on my life around 5th grade. I kind of misrepresented my physical symptoms as something only wrong with my stomach (because I didn't really know better), we went to multiple doctors, and when they wanted to do a lot more invasive tests my mother just stopped trying to get me help. Around 2 years after that I started to realize that I probably, really, definitely had an anxiety disorder. Literally every major symptom in the book: constant feelings of dread, racing heart, intense fear of failure/ridicule when doing anything... you get the picture. I figured, being a dumb middle schooler, that since I had dealt with it that far into my life, I didn't really *need* help. I thought it could figure it out, live with it, and overcome it like the main character in a sappy movie. However, it's gotten to the point in my recent high school years that I legitimately do not go a day without feeling a prolonged period of anxiety or the constant, overpowering feeling. I began to see a free therapist at the beginning of the year via a situation with my dad (who I don't see/talk to anymore) that I don't want to go into. I had begged my mom to see the therapist as things were spiraling extremely quickly, and she was the only person we could afford at the time. Months have gone on and we have gotten in a much better financial situation, but my relationship with my mom has also deteriorated even further because of her narcissist boyfriend. I've tried multiple times to reach out to her more and suggest an official diagnosis/medication for my anxiety. Despite her getting mad that I can't do simple household things because of my debilitating anxiety, she will not take me to anyone that has the power to give me a sense of peace and a more immediate solution. Every single time I bring it up, she brushes it off and changes the subject, usually after arguing with me.

I've also mentioned to her that potentially, ADHD might be making my anxiety worse and making it almost impossible for me to do simple tasks on time (I really believe even if I don't have ADHD, I have anxiety induced executive dysfunction, but the overwhelming symptoms of ADHD are still there). Despite me *never* claiming to absolutely have ADHD and that I only wanted to be tested, she kept telling me to ""stop self-diagnosing"". I dropped the issue for a few months and have only recently started to hint at it again.

I haven't been brave enough to tell her about the overwhelming amount of symptoms of depression I have, and that my therapist strongly believes that I should be diagnosed with it. I'm kinda afraid that she'll treat me like my dad who has it and think I'm weak for wanting to try medication, but I'm mostly afraid that she'll treat me different and like I'm made of glass.

My maternal grandparents who live close take me to my weekly therapy appointments and they know about my anxiety, but they legally can't do anything unless they go to court and argue that my mother is a negligent parent. I really don't want to go that far since that would absolutely shatter the relationship my mom has with her parents, and it's not like she doesn't buy me food and the things I need. I just really want to convince my mom that I know that something is wrong.

I don't know for sure *what* is wrong with me, but I'd really like to rule some things out so that I know how to deal with the real problem. If I can't convince her to help me, I'm going to have to suffer for another year and a half until I'm no longer a minor and I can seek help myself. My condition has gotten so much worse in the past few months that I know I won't be able to live a life worth living if I wait much longer. If I don't stop this spiral now, I'm afraid that my biggest passion, drawing, will continue to evade me until I don't know how to do it anymore. I don't want my family to have to live with an irritable, sensitive, non-functional loser anymore. I just need to make a change but I don't know how to convince my mom to help me do it.

422,"Hello, Reddit! My formatting may be a bit bad but it's readable so deal with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the title states, I spent extra on 2-4 days priority shipping through UPS on Saturday. 

I decided, after years of waiting, to get a Scuf controller as I have a tournament I'm going to this Sunday and I wanted to get acquainted with the controller at least a tad before I use it at something important (to me) such as this.

I paid $39.99 for 2-4 days priority shipping. I understand that business days are a thing and my order wasn't delivered to UPS to start it's journey to my door step until Monday night. I also know that I'm extremely lucky to have even had my Scuf shipped out this early as I've read some pretty bad experiences with their shipping and wait times upwards to almost 2 months but I'm not complaining about the controller.

At the same time that I was ordering my controller, my girlfriend ordered items from CostCo and she paid no shipping whatsoever and was told that it would be 7-10 business days. 

Here's where I start getting upset.

The CostCo items showed up YESTERDAY. I became a bit unsettled after this as I paid EXTRA for the fast shipping of my item while my girlfriend didn't have to pay anything. I noticed that when I check the delivery type on the CostCo order it said ""3-Day Priority"" while my order states ""Ground Shipping"".

Did I get scammed out of $40? Because I feel like I did. How would an order that had no delivery specifications to it get faster shipping than my item that is 2-4 days priority? On top of that, the CostCo items were coming from California and mine was coming from Georgia which Georgia is 11-12 hours CLOSER than California is.

IDK if this is something someone can give me advice on but I'm somewhat venting my frustration with how I got gipped.

Thanks for reading!

tl:dr I really like this girl who im good friends with and we both agree that we get along with really well, and i want to spend more time with her, but she wants things to happen naturally and im left waiting until she's comfortable enough to spend time alone with me.

I found this girl who I get along with really well. Like its weird how well we get on. We like all the same things and just have really good chemistry.

We've been good friends for a couple of months, and i've started to really like her (like the big L-word like her). She knows I feel this way and she herself said that she likes me too and wants to be close, and that she's never gotten on with someone as well as we have, and that shes told me personal things that she hasnt told anyone else here. She says she really cares about me.

i do want a relationship, but for now im fine with just hanging out for now so i keep trying to come up with ideas to hang out together, like going over uni work together or having a movie night.

but she's not sure about doing things like that. she says it takes her a long time to trust people, because she's had things happen to her in past relationships and for now we should just take it slow and let things happen naturally. It's been months of seeing eachother in groups and getting along and texting, but shes really hesitant about doing things with just me. She thinks im trying to rush things along and she only wants a relationship when it comes naturally and lets things happen.

I appreciate that its not the end of the world and things might still happen between us some day, but that could take months or even years. I really like her and want spend time with her, but i can't for now and have to keep waiting for something that could take a long time if ever. It's really hurting me that i can't be with her all the time and be alone together, and just have to settle for talking in groups and texting. If it was just a straight rejection then i'd be really sad but i could at least move on, but now ive just got to hold on waiting for her to feel comfortable enough to spend more time with me.

I have had a hard time coming to terms with the open relationship part and let them know I was not into dating someone of the same sex. Which was no issue. We have mostly moved past that.
We have been seeing eachother for almost two yrs and I found out about six months into the relationship there were other relationship partners for them. I decided I enjoyed their company quite a bit and have made the decision to continue to see them. 
The problem is one of the other SO's. I do not know how to address the issue without sounding bitter. The other SO knows about the other relationships and is actively dating others as well because they are looking for a commitment which does not bother me. It's when the other SO breaks it off with one of the people they are dating. They automatically jump back into the picture and now I am put on the back burnner. This has happened twice already. Both times I was reassured they had a talk about how I am very much a part of my SO's life and she still pushes her way into the time we have together (or at least tries by asking them to hang instead of with me).

439,"Background: I‚Äôm 28F, didn‚Äôt lose my virginity until I was 25 bc I wanted to wait to have sex with someone I cared about. Never really had a boyfriend in HS/college. Have been told I became more attractive after graduating from Hs which I guess is the norm. Always felt indifferent about sex. Never really been boy crazy or promiscuous. Recently I‚Äôve been on a dating spree and been re-involved with two exes, 1 one night stand, and one guy who I actually LIKE and really care about.

Details:
I‚Äôve had unprotected sex three times this year for the first time in my life and I am hating myself so much for it. 

The first time I had unprotected sex was back in july with a guy I met on fucking tinder who I invited over to ‚Äúchill‚Äù which wound up us kissing in my bed, next thing I know he shoves his penis up my vagina without even asking. I told him please ‚Äústop take it out we need to put on a condom‚Äù he replied saying ‚Äúno just take it‚Äù. He continues to fuck me as I‚Äôm squirming repeatedly saying no. Mind you I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2 and he‚Äôs nearly 6‚Äô8.  I realize now that this a violation of my body, he should have stopped. In the same hand I can‚Äôt lie that it did not feel good in the moment so by me saying no but also moaning a bit, I guess he thought it was ok to continue. I‚Äôd never experienced raw sex so it was pleasurable but also felt very wrong.

After this instance I got STD tested and everything came back clean.

Fast forward to September, and I hooked up with my ex boyfriend and had unprotected sex, again got tested and everything came back NEGATIVE.

So here we are now in November and last weekend my other ex boyfriend came back to town and stuck his penis in me with no condom, I told him ‚Äúwait stop let‚Äôs put on a condom‚Äù. We proceeded to fuck for maybe 5 mins and then finally put one on (stupid, I know)..

A few days later I felt a weird feeling down there almost like a faint itchy feeling. At first I just thought it was chaffing itch from shaving but it persisted. So on Monday I finally got a mirror and looked at my vagina and at first glance I saw nothing, I then opened my vaginal lips and pulled opened the clitoris and to my horror I saw tiny cluster of bumps üò£üòì. I immediately went to the doctor and was diagnosed with HPV which causes genital warts..they‚Äôre giving me a painful acid gel treatment I have to go back to get weekly. The doctor said that I could have been exposed to HPV months ago but not had any symptoms until now. They also don‚Äôt test for HPV when you go for standard STD testing bc it‚Äôs one of the most common STIs and there‚Äôs no cure really your body has to fight it off..
There is no test for males for HPV And most people don‚Äôt get symptoms at all.

I am so depressed and feel so disgusted with myself. The worst part is I don‚Äôt know who gave this to me.

I am going to seek therapy but I just want to know has anyone ever felt so hopeless after receiving a diagnosis? 

Im still waiting for the rest of my test results to come in, they‚Äôre testing me for HIV, Herpes, chylamydia, syphillis, also checking if I have certical cancer caused by the HPV, basically the whole nine yards.

I know things could be much worst I could have a life threatening disease but I feel so dirty and empty inside. 

I feel I‚Äôve made the worst mistake in my life. 

And I‚Äôm honestly worried that I may have given this to someone who I actually really cared about. 

I‚Äôve been seeing another guy who is not my ex for the past couple of months and he‚Äôs been acting really weird the past couple of days, being very short with me. 

We always have had protected sex but I‚Äôm worried maybe I gave him HPV a few weeks ago and didn‚Äôt even know. HPV can be passed through oral and even if you use a condom from skin to skin contact.. 

please someone help give me advice .. how do I forgive myself?..how do I get my life back on track? My mental health is so important right now I know that I need to be strong and fight off this infection but I feel so weak.. so defeated. Please help.. thank you..",29Nov2018,1

442,"Hello everyone!   


This is a situation which started a few months ago. Me and my ex-gf  broke up in Mid-June. We walked out of the relationship on good terms and we both understand that our growing experience as a couple ended.   
Anyway, in August i had the opportunity to visit and travel to a new city, Lisbon, with some friends, something which i am really grateful for. While i was there, a girl i had ""met"" on social media in 2016, sent me a message asking if i wanted to go out with her. She has always lived there and i am from other part of the country (around 300km away). 

We went out and i just felt a deep connection with her, i believe she felt the same way. It was great and then we parted ways.

After that moment, i have started to develop a big admirance for her. She is really like me personality wise, in terms of tastes and all that good stuff.   
Later this year, in October, she actually came to my city to take part on a course. I spent a few hours with her in my city: we talked, we walked, i showed her around, had dinner with her, etc.   
It was magical and made me feel great!  She told me she loved her time there and that she would like to come back soon.

Lately, we've been chatting a lil bit almost every day and my admirance and fascination towards her has been developing to stronger and stronger stages! This might sound a bit crazy, but since i met her i always thought she would be some sort of next girlfriend/partner in life.   
Right now, I think I am in a position where if i let myself, I will certainly fall in love with her.

&amp;#x200B;

One question remains though: Even though, I know for certain that she enjoys my company and that we truly enjoy being with eachother, does she feel the same way towards me  as I do towards her?

444,"Hello all. 

So let's call my bfs little sister Sara, and her boyfriend Greg. 

They started dating about six months ago, and Sara's parents are very......lax with rules. My boyfriend and I are 21 and 22 (live in a different state) and we are wondering if we need to step in. 

Greg sometimes comes to Sara's house for days to a week sometimes, and when he does he sleeps in the bed with her. Sara's parents told them not to but don't enforce the rule at all and I am suspicious that they would enjoy having a baby around, as they joke about my bf being an uncle in a cheery cutesy ""Uncle (bf name)! Hehe!"", and Sara's mom is experiencing empty nest syndrome BADLY. 

Here's the thing. They have not had ""the talk"" with her, she is not on bc and I'm not even sure she understands how she could get pregnant. 

I am considering having a serious talk with her and asking if she wants me to take her to planned parenthood or provide condoms. She is pretty mature and reasonable so I don't think she'd shy away from the conversation. 

Should I do this? Should my boyfriend (her brother)? Should we just shut up and hope for the best? Any advice is appreciated.

445,"I became badly depressed when I was a teenager. Asked my parents for therapy and they refused because ""what do I have to be sad about"". 

Had a big decline and fixed it once I got out of the house. Parents took note of how much better I was. I think it improved their opinion of therapy - at least now they believe it has utility for depressed people instead of having no value at all. 

Now my teen sister is telling me she's becoming depressed. I want to help her get therapy, but I know my parents knee jerk reaction will be to deny her depression because ""what does she have to be sad about"". 

I don't want to see her go down the same path I did... Get worse and worse until she's at the point where they think her depression is ""valid."" It took me 5 years of decline before they recognized it and by then I was absurdly mentally unhealthy. Its been 7 years since I started seeking help and I'm still working on getting better. All in all I feel like 1/3 of my life - what were supposed to be some of the best years - has been stolen from me. It's very painful for me to think about this fact and I absolutely don't want it to happen to my sibling.

How can I convince my parents to let her have therapy? I think it's best to phrase it in a way that makes it seem like it's for ""expanding her perspective as a teenager"" or ""learning how to understand and manage her emotions"" or something positive like that instead of ""she feels depressed"" so that they are more open minded to the idea (mentioning mental illness immediately snaps their minds shut).

Hell, I think part of the reason I'm not as smart as some of these other kids is because of an untreated concussion I got in a fight with my dad's ex-girlfriend when I was 13.   


Idk, sometimes I feel like I have no chance at success and I look around me at this safe place where I can just learn and have my own room and unlimited food even if I have to work my ass off for it, and I worry that I'll be totally fucked after graduation. But if I dropped out, I wouldn't even have anywhere to go. My godmother who took me in wouldn't let me stay with her and I'd have to work at some grocery store or something again.

460,"My bachelor's degree (Computer Science) isn't holding me back from getting good jobs. But I still want to get a master's degree for multiple reasons but with a bad GPA (2.6) I struggle to find a Master's program that will accept such a low GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

***Why my GPA is bad:*** My own fault (of course), I was completely overloaded during my college years &amp; had a terrible mindset regarding priorities at the time.

***Difference Now:*** I'm 29, no longer financially strapped, my job is extremely flexible (&amp; willing to pay for my schooling), my home life is way more stable &amp; my mindset is greatly improved. I'm currently finishing up a 1 year Technical Certificate (undergrad level) with a 4.0 (related STEM field, required 8 accredited classes, pretty rigorous &amp; in-depth). Did the technical cert as a way to test myself, stay busy &amp; prove I could get straight A's if I tried.

\-----

**Questions:**

1. **When looking for Master's programs, colleges won't care about the technical certificate I'm finishing up now correct?** I'm assuming it won't hurt to add to the transcript, but it wouldn't have any impact on my 2.6 GPA or really influence their decision, right?
2. **Should I get a 2nd Bachelor's degree (do better &amp; boost GPA) THEN try for a Master's program?** I would aim for something that overlaps with my current bachelors so I could use some credits to help speed it up &amp; finish it sooner than the normal 4 years. I was thinking of Informatics, Biostatistics or perhaps even a Business Administration degree. At least all the general education classes &amp; a handful of the math classes would be taken care of.

461,"Hello, everyone! Need some advice.... As if that wasn't obvious. I've made a few bad choices that have led me to my current situation. Let me elaborate.

I want go into to much detail about where I work, live, etc.

I recently was ""offered"" a new position within my company and have since moved. I'll be in this new position for awhile, so I figured now that my career has offered some stability, why not buy a house? I looked forever in the surrounding areas near my soon to be new job to no avail. Everything available wasn't worth buying and the housing market is garbage in the area anyways. So my wife and I decide to buy a house that's close to 50 miles from where I work. That's one heck of a commute. This alone is not the issue, but it is a factor in my concerns.

I recently financed a new vehicle before the move. All the math checked out and it seemed like we could afford it. Well, turns out I'm bad at math. The vehicle is a bit of a gas guzzler to say the least. 

Now, to the Cherry on top. I recently wrecked the vehicle. Pulled out of a gas station when I shouldn't have and got T-boned. I have insurance, so no worries there. It's a substantial amount of damage. Drivers side quarter panel is destroyed. Left rear wheel got jacked up pretty good along with a few suspension components and ALL of the airbags deployed.

Apparently the body shop I chose are a bunch of miracle workers. Somehow there's not enough damage to total the vehicle even though to replace the quarter panel, the have to completely remove the roof of my car to do so( According to them). The car not being totalled isn't the real issue. The problem is that now the car will have decrease exponentially more in value than it already was. 2018 model and 2019 just released. 

I know I'm extremely upside down as far as the loan goes because of how new the loan is(less than 6 months). I had already planned on trading it for something a little more fuel efficient and eat the rest of the loan, but now I don't know if anyone would even touch it considering the accident history(at least nowhere near what I'd need for it to balance out). 

What are my options? I just can't afford to keep this vehicle and continue to commute. Any advice would be much appreciated.

TL;DR- Bought a car. Can't afford to keep it. Got in an accident before I could trade it for something more efficient. I'm way upside-down on my loan because of the accident and depreciation.",29Nov2018,1

471,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, I can't shake this hit&amp;run OCD about a car I am 100% I did not hit. The reasons I am 100% sure is because I was going 30mph (which 35 was the speed limit, I was not speeding), there was no impact, no damage, no noise, and, here's the fun part that makes how I feel really stupid: I was never anywhere near the car. I made a right turn in front of it (about 20 feet), and for some weird reason my brain is like ""what if you blacked out and you did hit that car?"" I know this is a form of hit&amp;run OCD, and I have had to do behavioral therapy for other types of OCD, but does anyone have any advice on how I can shake this? My brain keeps trying to make up scenarios in which I did hit the car somehow. I can't stop googling ""what if I hit a parked car and didn't realize it?"" or what kind of crime a hit&amp;run of a car is. I have this impending doom feeling that some cop is going to call me and tell me that somehow, I actually did hit the car. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've literally been hit before at like 2 mph in a parking lot and it was a huge impact. I know what it feels like to hit a car. I know what it sounds like to hit a car. Hitting a parked car, even scraping it, at 30mph would make a huge impact.  I KNOW 100% FOR A FACT I DID NOT EVEN COME WITHIN 20 FEET OF THIS CAR. Why is my brain doing this to me? I am not in denial. I do have anxiety and I'm medicated with Valium, and I do see a psychiatrist for the OCD/anxiety/other issues. None of my OCD coping techniques are working. I've always had problems with compulsions and intrusive thoughts, and I've been constantly checking my car for damage that I know is not there. I tried googling for help with hit&amp;run OCD but that is specifically people who think they hit a person, not cars. I haven't been able to find someone else who has anxiety about having hit a car they come anywhere near. I keep thinking to myself that I might as well stop trying because I'm going to get a misdemeanor and I'll never be able to get a good job. EVEN THOUGH I DID NOT HIT THE CAR.

&amp;#x200B;

???? What is happening to my brain? Am I going literally crazy, finally? Please help me. I can't even function, and my psychiatrist isn't helping. OCD coping techniques aren't helping and he is firm that this is what is happening.

Using this chat, many people on there started to talk outside the game, me included and that's when I started to talk to older guys. At the time I was only beginning to learn about sex etc. But I was quite na√Øve. The guys (a mixture of 20/30/40 year olds) I was speaking to started out friendly at first, and then it got a bit pressured -they started becoming more sexual with me and I started to join in. 
However, i began to get stuck in a cycle. I was asked to send explicit photos of myself, if I didn't they'd make me feel guilty about not sending photos, and then it became Skype calls, and sexual messages in which they specified quite abusive stuff they wanted to do to me. I even met up with a 27 year old at the time and did sexual stuff with him, but I felt like I didn't have control of myself or completely understand what was going on. If I didn't send pictures I was sent messages saying I should get raped. It got into a strange cycle and they made me feel so bad about myself that I only started to crave for their attention and to be validated, it was horrible. This led me to have depression and have suicidal thoughts which I had counseling about but this concerned me a lot. I wanted to talk to the counselor about what had happened for the couple of years it was happening but she said that (from what she gathered) that she'd have to report to the school, the police and my parents.

477,"xpost from r/legaladvice, haven't gotten a response there yet

I rented a house a while back with 4 other guys for a few years. Towards the end, I was the only one left on the original lease as my roommates were replaced by others, who I signed rental agreements with. One of my former roommates missed a couple months rent and still owes me $900: ~$700 in rent &amp; utilities and another $200ish of $25 monthly late fees over the last year. I have everything in writing, including a signed document for the balance he currently owes, and he has agreed to the monthly late fees.

‚Äã

He's facing multiple wage garnishments and has failed to pay me anything over the last several months (we agreed to $250 monthly but that hasn't happened). I've considered going to small claims court to get a judgement and then garnish his wages, but I'd like to avoid the hassle and also figure I'd be placed at the back of the line for garnishment plus have associated costs. I've also offered to waive most of the late fees if he pays me back in a lump sum, but he has been unable to do so.

‚Äã

Any thoughts on my best course of action here? My understanding is that Oregon has a 6 year statute of limitations on debts owed. However, ORS 12.125 says ""An action arising under a rental agreement or ORS chapter 90 shall be commenced within one year."" Would I be considered a landlord (we all lived in the house together, but I was the only one ly one on the lease), and this situation fall under a one-year statute of limitations? Am I at risk of forfeiting my claim to the money if I don't take any legal action before the one year mark? Also, would that one year mark take place from the oldest debt he owes?

Hey guys I‚Äôm 24F dating a 28M. Im February, I was broken up with by my boyfriend of 5 years. We had 4 dogs together and 2 cats. I immediately started dating another guy, and we moved in together in June. I was desperate, and didn‚Äôt know how to get a roommate while I had so many animals, and was panicking. He seemed amazing and so eager to help me with everything. 

We moved in together, and things immediately got bad. He yells about everything, throws things, screams when he‚Äôs missing a food item from a fast food restaurant, whines when I don‚Äôt fuck him or want some space.... we are ALWAYS FIGHTING. Well, things just keep escalating. The other day, I saw him kick one of my dogs when they wouldn‚Äôt listen.

482,So I went to school for architecture and graduated with my Bachelor's 2 years ago. My goal when starting school was to be a licensed architect but that soon changed some time after. I am in my current predicament because my degree is not valid toward getting licensed. In order to get licensed a person must get an accredited degree which I do not currently have. An accredited degree requires a 5 year education while I recieved only a 4 year. Most people are not aware of this when they applied to school and I made that mistake.

The reason I hesitate is because I am not sure i want to do architecture anymore. I do not enjoy it as much as I once did and I do not see myself doing this the rest if my life. I'm already behind compared to those who went to a 5 year college. I don't know if I should hold out and pursue my license or just take a risk and try something completely different.

Some of the examples I found was that we know each other‚Äôs passwords for our phones/bank accounts/etc. but recently she downloaded a diary app that has a password that I don‚Äôt know of, I asked her if I could have the password and she said she needs to write stuff down that she wants no one to know about like about how she‚Äôs been dieting and been slacking and she writes it down in her diary so she can motivate herself without have anyone telling her ‚Äú oh it‚Äôs ok, you had a bad week‚Äù and such which she showed me and help relax those thoughts but still won‚Äôt give me the password.

Other examples include on Christmas, she got a gift from her as my wife gave her a gift cuz that‚Äôs what friends do lol.....but it had a letter in it and it talked about how much she loved the fact that they met and how much fun they been having, but at the end of the letter it said I love you. Like idk if females Besties talk like that but I asked her about it but each time I bring up something like that she gets mad and says to knock it off and it‚Äôs all in my head. 

Last is when I was at work, me and my wife had been talking/ texting and things were great, but I had this gut feeling that I dreaded, like a little voice that‚Äôs telling me that something is up. So when I got home my wife was asleep and I went through her phone (yeah I know I should trust her cuz she always tells me she would never do anything to hurt me) but she has all the logs of all my text messages and her other co workers and family.....but her bestie text log is always deleted down to where it says simple messages like how work was and if she is coming in to work. And the last pic I saw last night was a picture of a mug that said ‚Äúall I want for Christmas is you‚Äù and it has penguins on it but her bestie loves penguins so I thought nothing of it and my wife responded with ‚Äúcute.lol‚Äù but the next day when I checked her phone it was deleted.....but all the other logs were there.

Just need some advice so I can sleep

Update: so after a few weeks I let my guard down but my gut feeling kicked again and I used imyfone to track her last deleted text message and she text someone, who I believe is her co-worker, ‚ÄúMiss you too babe‚Äù so it‚Äôs not just me!

The situation is as below:
I haven't seen my dad for years. He was abusive so I cut him out of my life when I was younger. 
He sends sarcastic cards every year for my birthday with often spiteful messages. The last time I had contact with him was many years ago. 

I don't respond to the birthday cards or solicit any contact. 

My mum and him split up when I was a child. My mother is quite the fire cracker. 

I just got a message from him saying that my grandma has had cancer for a number of years and she's just had a stroke and doesn't have long left. He said he didn't have the balls to tell me years ago cause I would say I didn't ever love her anyway, but if I do make contact she probably won't even know anyway. He said he thought I should know.

This has upset me quite a lot.. I have always loved my grandmother and would never say such a thing and don't feel I have given him any reason to suggest I would say such a thing. 

I want to respond but don't want to be emotional and angry. I am aware that he can be quite manipulative but unsure what he has to gain from telling me in such a way. 

As a second question, given my mother's temper, I am hesitant to tell her, as I am worried about her reaction, but feel that she should know.

I don't really have any way of verifying the information without contacting him as I have no contact with the family. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Said roommate also always makes comments about wanting to ‚Äúf*** the shit out of me‚Äù (I‚Äôm a guy btw), has a weird obsession with necks/throats and has made comments about how easy it would be to choke me, and constantly tries to make me feel like a beta when in any social situation. 

One thing that really put me off was what happened about a week ago. I‚Äôm already aware that he goes in my room sometimes when I‚Äôm not there. A couple days ago, I found a bottle of lotion in the bottom of my laundry basket. This basket was completely full of dirty laundry and I‚Äôm 100% sure that this bottle of lotion was in my duffel bag in my closet that I had taken on a recent trip. I don‚Äôt know why it weirded me out so much, but it did. There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that he deliberately placed it there, waiting for me to notice (another example of his alpha complex). 

I‚Äôm having trouble with resolving this issue, as I don‚Äôt want to just move out, since I would still have to work with him. I‚Äôd also not like to get a new job. Me and my two other roommates are all managers so it‚Äôs not an easy out.

489,"I'm 27. Asian male. College professor. Living in Australia. I have a handful of close friends. Engaged .

I feel invisible. I'll elaborate. In life, especially lately, I feel like I don't exist, like people cannot see me. I say hi to people in the office, they literally act like they didn't hear me. Staff talk in groups, they exclude me. If I say something, it's like what I say has no weight. 

I feel like I temporary appear, or come out of phase when I actively try to be seen. I'm like some extra in a movie. When I try to be anything more, it seems people get mad.

I've come to be more accepting of this now. It's good and bad. Sometimes I walk into random office buildings and use their bathroom. No one notices or cares. I swim in hotel swimming pools I'm not staying at . I walk into airport private clubs and enjoy buffet breakfast. I've gatecrashed private functions, and have taken finger food and drink. No one cares or notices. It's kinda cool..

But it's also really lonely. I get a lot of time to observe others. Some people are constantly ""visable"". Some people fight extremely hard to be visible. 

It makes me think. If I killed myself now, would it really affect anything? I'm a logical man. I know on in the grand sense the answer is no. That is both liberating and disturbing at the same time. I feel like I could do anything. I have accomplished a lot in life, and there's more to come.
But does it matter?

I can‚Äôt be around them and I can‚Äôt even be around people that have cat fur on their clothes and when people have cat fur on them and they sit in a house, it spreads everywhere and I get so sick like coughing, itching, sneezing like 5 times every 5 seconds (I‚Äôm not even exaggerating) I know this because it happened at my house. My sister and my niece came to my house some when they had cats living in their house and they would come sit in my house on the couch then I would sit in the same place or use the same blanket and for a whole month or more until the house was cleaned and vaccumed top to bottom, and all the hair was gone, I was sick every time I came in my house.

The scariest lockdown story of mine

One day i was in my computer programming class finishing up an assignment. None of my class knew what was going on. My teacher, Mr. *redacted*  ran to the door and locked it and told us to get under our desks my girlfriend Macy was next to me holding my hand. As the class heard footsteps from a distance as the footsteps got closer Ciara started sobbing softly into her hands. The footsteps stopped in front of the door. it was 5 minutes which felt like an hour to me until the doorknob started staggering it stopped for about 30 seconds. As we thought the man was gone we heard gunshots then i heard the doorknob Ciara was full on crying now. The man was crazy he said to Ciara ‚Äúget up woman‚Äù Ciara stood there froze he said ‚ÄúI said GET UP WOMAN‚Äù as she got up he said come give me a big big hug Ciara took beaby steps. 2 seconds later BOOM! We heard a gunshot He said ‚Äúnot enough enthusiasm woman‚Äù as he picked her up he started scooping parts of her brain out so we all looked away and the man said ‚Äúwatch or i'll kill you too‚Äù so we all looked in disgust except for my girlfriend she looked away. The man said ‚Äúcan't look huh‚Äù he started walking towards us and we got up and ran past him fast enough so he couldn't grab us. We started running towards the exit as we were one inch away i felt Macys run turn into a limp i looked behind us and saw him i said ‚Äúwhy do you choose to fight a school of defenseless kids‚Äù. He picked up macy and started walking down the hall i couldn't seem to keep up with him i only knew where he was from Macys blood trail. As i was follow
Ing the trail i saw an open locker with a bat i whispered to myself ‚Äúyes‚Äù. As he was standing by the principal's office it was the perfect chance to swing the bat with the school alarm covering my footsteps i swung but the bat broke and he didn't even flinch. As he turned around and looked at me and said ‚Äúi would like to play a game‚Äù i said ‚Äúand what game is that‚Äù he gave me a pistol and said ‚Äúi want you to shoot your finger off or Macy dies‚Äù i said no 
Are you crazy if you had the right brain you would take that gun and shove it right up your mouth and pull the trigger. He said did you see the bat would you think a bullet would do any better. He said ‚Äúi will make it easy for you when i get to 3 you shoot your finger off 3 2 BOOM!‚Äù I shot it off are you happy now i said while groaning and my eyes tearing up. He said ‚ÄúI AM GOD and no one can stop me‚Äù

498,"I'm not entirely sure if this is the best place to post this, but here goes.

My vehicle went in the shop 3 days ago for a variety of issues, including rotors, suspension, check engine light, and a tire leak. The shop had to order parts, and then the labor took a couple of days.

I picked it up today, and five minutes down the road, I get an error message on the dash saying the key fob (keyless start) battery is low, and that the car will turn off in 5 minutes. Luckily, I was close to a store and was able to stop to buy a new battery for it.

That said, when that error message popped up, I noticed my gas tank was really low. I had about 3/4 of a tank when I dropped the vehicle off at the shop, and I was down to 1/4. I always jot down my miles before I have a repair done (just to keep track of when things are replaced/fixed), and when I looked at the odometer, I noticed it was about 100 miles higher than it was when I dropped it off!

Now, I am aware that when I bring my car to the shop for repairs, I am giving them permission to drive the car on the main road (the paperwork at the garage says that they are permitted to drive the vehicle off the lot if needed, but this is more of a ""notice"" rather than paperwork we sign). That said, I was under the impression that meant driving it for a few blocks or a couple miles to help diagnose the problem/make sure it's riding smoothly, not take a 100 mile road trip in it! I spoke with my SO about it, and he suspects they used my car to deliver parts. I mentioned possibly complaining or asking the garage about it, and he said he didn't think it was worth it.

Are mechanics allowed to do that?  If not, what can I do about this? That's half a tank of gas, a dead key fob, and 100 miles of wear and tear (I don't care that it was in for a repair, that's still money out of my pocket for gas and a new key battery). I'm a little pissed.

501,"Okay this one is going to be long, at this point it's childhood trauma and it hurts really fucking bad.

My dad lived a very structured lifestyle as a kid, he was in military school when he was young to when he was a teenager and had strict parents.
He's a chemical engineer and a very smart and loving person. But he worries about my sister and I too much.

When i was young up until freshman year of highschool videogames were basically banned from the house. When I came home from school it was homework, or I had to be reading or studying for future topics. He wanted me to make the most of my time but it came across as a dictor-like regime in the household.

I was a smart kid and hated homework already, so the fact that after my homework was done I couldnt do what I wanted caused me to reject the whole thing and my grades started to sink. I wasn't even allowed to stay up late because ""I needed my sleep"". Instead of letting me stay up, be very tired, and then try to fix my sleep schedule myself; i was just yelled at eventually. My grades kept being trash until Senior year of highschool when I was diagnosed with ADD, and had a few semesters of As and Bs.

Well then college came and I failed three semesters of it. I was still living at home.

Ive never had any serious relationships because my room is part of the house, he walks in and talks to me constantly about housework/school and how i should be doing this and doing that. I could never use my space or my time how I wanted to.

When college came around I had failed so many semesters of Junior high, high school, and college that it was basically 'get good grades or youre out of the house'. Well when I failed those semesters of college my parents took me to psychiatrists and stuff to help me with my ADD, and that is part of the problem, 
but i needed to be my own person, i needed to move out and be out of the house.

Well I cant just move out, he wouldnt support me going to college, and the car was technically his so he would just take it back. I was in a horrible catch 22 where I can stay in the same room ive been in my entire childhood, and be driven insane and fail college again and again, or ""move out"" and be homeless.

Well my parents soon divorced. I started smoking a lot of weed as an escape and eventually got caught by police, and moved in with my mom (she understood the problem was mostly him).
So now I am living with my mother doing better in college. I still talk to my Dad but from his point of view until I get good grades, I dont have his respect. 

Well my sister just recently had a fight with him and she moved out. I absolutely love my Dad but he worries so much that he's a fucking asshole. He cares about us so much that he's an absolute asshole. And now he lives in an empty house, his wife left him, his daughter said uncle and moved out, and his son fucked up so hard he has a DUI and other charges on his record.

He doesnt really understand why my Mom broke up with him or why my life has been a fucking trainwreck. He's not self aware at all.

But it's all out of love. He's taken us many places around the world when we were young, and taught us a lot. And he still has valuable things ablut finances and random life problems that I can learn from him. Not to mention I want to spend time with him, but I CANNOT live with him. Its impossible to enjoy myself when I live with him. 

He's going to see my sister moved out when he gets home and be devastated. It would be much easier if we had moved out into our own places but my sister and i dont have the money for that, so our Mom is the only option. He's alone in his house we've all lived in for years, I cant see him like this. His sister (my aunt who lives in another state) is the only one he has left and they recently got in a fight as well.

I have to say something. He's put so much effort and money and time and love into us and we left him alone. I'm debating moving back in because i've had enough time to wrap my head around it and I think I can deal with him for another year or so until I get a job in my field. I want to talk to him but I dont know what to say without it seemingly like i'm talking down on him, and blaming all my academic failures on him. That's not what I think or want. I don't know what to do, he's going to be alone for Christmas if I don't do something and I can't do that to him.",29Nov2018,1

509,"Some background - 8 months ago I moved in with a girl about a year younger than me (I‚Äôm 20, she‚Äôs 19) and we get along very well except for one thing that I never have confronted her about. 

I have 2 fixed male cats that have had their shots and vaccinations. She has one female cat, who is not fixed, and has never had any shots or vaccines. They generally get along very well and play and sleep together, save for the occasional spat. However, my roommate started to leave a lot - she‚Äôs always either at work, her friends house or boyfriends house, or elsewhere. She‚Äôs gone over half the time and then when she‚Äôs here, most of the time it‚Äôs night and she just goes to bed. 

She doesn‚Äôt pay for cat food. The cat eats my cat‚Äôs food (wet and dry) and uses the litter boxes which I clean every day. She hardly ever feeds the cats, changes their water, or cleans the litter box and then has the audacity to complain at me if she comes home and I‚Äôve forgotten to clean it. She hardly ever spends time with her cat which is obviously starved of attention and usually sleeps with me and spends time with me because her owner isn‚Äôt here. She only has like 2-3 toys, the other 20 something toys I have bought for them. Another thing is that her cat also wrecks my stuff and breaks things, makes messes, poops on my rug and scratches my furniture, and I‚Äôm always the one that has to clean up after her. And in addition to that, she goes into heat every so often and my male cat won‚Äôt leave her alone (he‚Äôs neutered, but he still has the hormonal response and tries to mate with her) and roommate doesn‚Äôt get her fixed, says she needs to save up the money, but instead spends it on things like expensive makeup (she actually makes more money than I do) It‚Äôs been like 8 months now. 

TLDR: Basically, I‚Äôm a really shy and anxious person and I don‚Äôt want to ruin my good relationship with my roommate so I don‚Äôt know how to confront her about not caring for her cat and not paying her fair share of litter and expensive cat food, and not cleaning the litter box, and not getting her spayed.

What happened: So my teacher for chorus class tends to get frustrated when we are not singing up to her expectations. I guess X was not focusing while rehearsing one of our songs. The teacher decided to take out this frustration on X. She yells at him ‚Äústop looking over at your ex girlfriend (y) and sing the fucking song.‚Äù The rest of our class immediately fell silent in shock and both X and Y looked embarrassed.  I think this was inappropriate for two main reasons: 
-cussing/yelling at a student 
-using personal details to reprimand a student 
She did apologize to him, but I don‚Äôt know if an apology really makes up for that.

ALSO: this is not the first time she has done something like this. Last year she yelled at another teacher for being a ‚Äúbad‚Äù teacher (I had this teacher, she was fine) because her daughter, who also goes to my school, had a bad grade in her class.

516,"Hey Reddit!

So, to let everybody to be filled in, this girlfriend and I were off and on often. We broke up the first time because she broke up, but she did because she cheated, and she felt bad about it. Then we got back together after a while and she lied to me about a lot of things, and didn‚Äôt stick to her word on some things. Then we waited all summer and then got back together, and everything was good at first but then she started kind of getting mean, and I was stressing about the past repeating itself. It was bogging me down and I was losing myself. I found out she had been talking to an ex that she promised me she wasn‚Äôt talking to and that was the tipping point (please note, I did not break up because of this. So many things were leading up, but all this is was the thing that just tipped me over). I never was mean or rude, I just said I wanted to break up.

So we did, and here we are. I was going to get her a Christmas present a little closer to Christmas so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt buy one yet. However, she got one.

She told me I better take it or else. I told her I was thankful but I didn‚Äôt feel right taking it and I felt awful about it.

Today was the big day though. We sat in my car at the park and we talked some and she gave me the presents and she said she wanted me to open them later, but I told her I‚Äôd rather open them there.

The present was very nice, it was a record player and a record of a band I really love. It was a very nice gift and I am super grateful.

However, I know my relationship was toxic, but I feel bad for leaving now. Like really bad. I feel horrible about not giving her anything. I spent some in the past on her (gave her clothes, necklace, diamond ring, dinner dates, etc.) however, I could care less about that. I don‚Äôt care about how much I spent on her, so I don‚Äôt want to feel like ‚ÄòI basically paid for this‚Äô because it is still a gift and she thought about it and all.

I have no plans to go into further education, and passable (DDD - Physics, Maths, Chemistry at A level) qualifications. That might be irrelevant but it affects my chances of getting a job quickly when I move.

I got ¬£30k (ish) from inheritance, and I don't know what type of account to get to keep it in. Some things say a lifetime ISA, which is kind of scary because I don't want to just lock the money away forever when I might need some of it to start me off in Ireland. Then again I know I have to be careful not to waste it; Then again again, I should at some point use it, or I might as well not have it at all. 

What's a smart place to keep this money so that I don't miss a good opportunity to accumulate more, but I can also use it if I need to?

520,"TL;DR : dad had an affair and had a son, found out year and a half ago and want to contact my half brother but my fam says not to.

So bit of background info - my mum and dad had my brother, then 6 years later had me. I was very young when my dad left, maybe 2 or 3 years old, so unlike my brother I have no real memories of life with both parents. For a few years (maybe until I was 7?) my brother and I would visit my dad though quite irregularly and he would often cancel at the last minute, just all round a bit unreliable and a bit of an angry dickhead. 

During the period from my parents splitting to us completely ceasing contact with him, he had another daughter (my half sister) with a woman he was dating but again left that woman when the daughter he had with her was a couple years old. I have very little interest in making contact with my half sister as of right now, mostly because we found out a few years ago her and her mum got back into contact with my dad and I would like to avoid any situation that would put me near him at all costs. 

Over the years I‚Äôve been slowly drip fed things about my dad, and the general consensus was that he was a pretty shitty person and compulsive liar. I knew the reason that my parents broke up was because he cheated and because he was hiding money troubles from my mum and sold his car (lied and said it was stolen) and other things to try to fake everything being okay. 

Easter 2017, right after I turned 17, my mum accidentally let slip that the reason she found out about his cheating was because she got a letter through the front door claiming child support for a son he‚Äôd had with the coworker he was cheating with. Turned out money troubles were because the coworker had threatened to out him so he left his job as a manager at a large tech company and sold the car for money to keep her quiet. I obviously asked a lot of questions as my family had purposely kept this secret from me for 17 years and I felt quite betrayed by this. 

My mum said she could only remember the woman‚Äôs first name, not her last name or the name of my half brother. I spent hours upon hours for over a year (until August 2018) trawling the internet to try to find my half brother with only the knowledge of the general area he lived in, his mums first name and that he wasn‚Äôt much younger than me. Found one woman on Facebook that seemed like a possibility, but couldn‚Äôt confirm one way or the other with my mum at this point claiming she had forgotten everything so I left it. Then in August my mum told me the name of my half brother and it clicked that it was the name of the son of the woman I had found. Went back on her profile and looked through years of pictures and the similarity between this boy and my brother + dad is actually unbelievable. Very quickly confirmed with my brother and mum and said I would like to contact him. This took a lot of courage as I knew they would be very upset by this and they both made clear that contacting him would most likely end badly for everyone involved. 

So, after all that, I‚Äôd like to know if I should stifle the want I have to reach out to my half brother or not? Since August it‚Äôs been on my mind almost constantly and I hoped I would get over it but at this point it doesn‚Äôt seem very likely. Part of me thinks I should make contact without my family knowing to save their feelings, but I know that in the end if they found out it would hurt them even more so I‚Äôd really rather not lie to them. I doubt my half brother knows I exist, as I can‚Äôt imagine his mum would want to tell him he‚Äôs the byproduct of an affair (she was married at the time too and the affair ended her marriage) and the sister he has lived with his whole life is only really his half sister and he‚Äôs got 3 more half siblings he had no idea about. Even if I did make contact there‚Äôs a chance he wouldn‚Äôt believe me or would just want nothing to do with me, as well as the fact I would have to live with the guilt that it might irreversibly damage the relationships he has with his family.  

I feel as though my mum and brother have had far longer to come to terms with the situation and it‚Äôs much harder for me to just accept it and forget about it after finding out so many years later.

Do I tell my family I‚Äôm going to make contact and hurt them, then face whatever consequences arise from making contact or attempt to finally resolve myself to never being able to know my half brother?",29Nov2018,1

523,"My brother (older than me by 7 years) and I grew up together in the same house, with mom and dad. Mom died when I was 9, he was 16. Dad raised us the rest of the way. 

A few years ago, my grandmother (who is getting old and slipping when she says things) said something she shouldn't have said to my wife. She goes, ""yeah, \[OP's\] dad did such a good thing, taking \[my brother\] in like he was his own...""

I angrily made some calls to my dad and my other grandmother and verified that indeed my brother and I have been lied to our whole lives, and that as a 22 year old man I was finding out that my brother and I are really half-brothers, and that he has a different dad somewhere.

I guess what happened was my mom wanted to tell him eventually, but she passed away and never got the chance. My dad is very non-confrontational and never told him. Everyone else in my family thinks it should be his job, but knowing him it probably won't happen.

When I ask my dad about it, he just says something like, ""it won't change anything.  I'm his dad and always will be..."" which I agree with. He is very much his dad and that's that.  But I think I would want to know the truth if I were in my brother's shoes.  Another difficult part about this is that my brother takes a lot of pride in the name of our family. He wears our last name proudly, and I think it would hurt his pride and his identity to find out that he really has never shared blood with his own last name.

My brother (or his wife) don't know any of this. Every time I see him I think about it, and I wonder if it's just a matter of time until he finds out. I am concerned that he will be angry at me for not telling him when I found out, but I just don't know if it's my place.

I'm looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations.  Should I tell him?

525,"So, i'm 13 and there's girl i kind of liked. She isn't popular but is very pretty and has always been very nice to me. Also about a month ago we were in art class and she came over and told me she liked me. I said okay then so i didn't seem over excited and weird. She seemed serious but later she told me it was a joke. Anyway, today we were in music class and got put in the same group. My mate couldn't be bothered to get his own chair so stole mine. This girl tried to stop him and kept saying it was my chair. Suddenly i thought ""maybe she likes me?"". Then i thought that i should ask her out. The last time i asked someone out at school was 2 years ago and getting rejected knocked my self esteem to an all time low and i have been incredibly socially awkward around girls ever since. Throughout the day i kept going to do it but she would meet up with a friend. I knew she was in my friends English class so i waited for them to finish and then was going to do it. She came out with her friend. I beckoned her over but her friend followed however she wasn't listening. I went ahead and awkwardly said,"" Well you know i asked for your phone number in year 7, well, it was because i liked you and i always have. She said okay and started walking off as i began asking her out but i don't think she heard me. By tomorrow everyone might know and i'll have to stay as far away from everyone as possible. As a incredibly shy, unpopular person with little lady experience i have no idea what to do next. Before this i looked up how to ask a girl out and i said that you should become friends first however 1) i'm very impatient and 2) The activity's it recommended to do together seemed very obvious..

I searched reddit for advice and I found [a post that is somewhat similar to my situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9uj2uq/aita_for_ignoring_the_girl_who_rejected_me/). The long and short is that the user in question wants to know if he's wrong for wanting to ignore/hurt the other person who rejected him.

I have spent the past year improving myself physically and mentally, and while I think I'm in a better place than I was before, I still take rejection hard, arguably worse than before. My self-esteem is admittedly low. This past year, I've practiced telling myself that I'm smart, that I'm a hard worker, and other ""good"" qualities, but rejection tears that thin armor of self-esteem that I've built up down.

When facing rejection, how do I change my mindset from ""This person hurt me and I want them to experience the same pain I'm feeling,"" to a healthier attitude and/or coping mechanism?",29Nov2018,1

531,"My mother has a tendency to spill everything I tell her to pretty much all the family.

She never does this with my elder brother, always protecting him. It really bothers me. I had a bad case of depression a year and a half ago and for some reason, I believe all my family knows. There are \*many\* instances of this. At times, she will even speak of me when I am in the room and can understand what she is saying, often speaking of me in a patronising manner. Is this normal? I feel as if she doesn't at all respect the relationship we have as mother and son. I don't even want to tell her anything anymore with the fear she will just tell everyone. I can't trust her anymore and quite frankly, I am sick of her. All my family knows so much about me and what is going on in my life because she makes such a big deal about me and stresses every wrong decision I've made. I actually kinda fucking hate her for it. 

An example is a few days ago, where I had gotten into an argument with my girlfriend and was down in the dumps. I hadn't told her the reason I was sad. Because of this, I didn't want to go to a family get together so she went with the rest of my family and told everyone I was annoyed.

533,"First of all, my brother is 22 and has Asperger's. Please keep this in mind while I explain.

My brother was having pretty bad swelling in his gums a couple of weeks ago. It has gone away and he's no longer in pain but I took him to a dentist today anyway. 

They found the infection on the x-rays and looked at his teeth, and they recommended that he go to an oral surgeon to discuss the extraction of 4 of his teeth. They said he needed to do it as soon as possible before the infection starts to spread.

He claims that since he's in no pain that it's not that important right now and doesn't want to do the procedure. Despite the fact that the doctor and the nurse took extra time out of their busy day to sit down and explain the seriousness of the infection, he says that he doesn't trust their opinion and that they only want his money (even though they referred him to a completely different practice out of town for the extraction???) 

He's so hard headed and thinks that all people in the medical field are in it for the money and just flat out won't trust them. For even more context, he's going through a phase where he's into alternative medicine and will order weird shit off the Internet to take to do these impossible things.

My mom and I are really worried but he's agreed to take the penicillin that they prescribed and also to go to the oral surgeon for a consultation ""for a second opinion"".

541,"**Before I tell you what happened today,  and why I'm asking this, I just wanna clarify that I have a little low vision. And it plays a big part in what happened.**

So today, around 6pm, I was sitting in a local bus stand. I was returning from a tuition and was going to another tuition and I had like 15 minutes of free time in between that. I was listening to a podcast.

Then a girl came there with her mom. It looked like I knew her, she was probably from my school or a tuition but I wasn't sure (thanks to my awesomely working eyes). Then something unexpected happened. She smiled at me and waved (and probably said something. I had headphones on so I am not sure about that). I looked back immediately to see if she was smiling at someone else (honeslty nobody smiles at me, male or female so I really didn't believe she would be smiling at my ugly ass).

I found no one behind so it was sure she was waving and smiling at me. Then I freaked out. She was not that much close that I could just talk to her. I had to walk up to her. Now, what if I was wrong! It would be so awekward! I have low vision so I wasn't 100% sure that she was from my school (even though she looked like she was). And even if she was from my school, she never talked to me in person, like NEVER!

So I had no idea what was going on. I decided to play it safe and immediately turned away pretending I didn't see her. I started checking something in phone (I mean pretending). Then after a couple of minutes, when I looked again, she wasn't there.

I already have an assholic reputation in my school because I never talk to anyone. I think this will just help everyone to believe in that even more. And that girl would think that I'm just a douchebag/rude/cocky boy which I don't think I am.

I was genuinely fascinated by the subconscious links my mind must have made up (I'm a succulent plant, which is the last of plants I would know about, but there you go) and I'm trying to find more information about this technique, what schools it come from and how it's supposed to work but I can't seem to find much around, maybe I am searching wrong.
could someone point me in the right direction if they ever heard of such technique?",29Nov2018,1
546,I‚Äôm living with my parents currently to save on rent. I‚Äôd love to crash with my boyfriend every once in a while to hang out and after going out. I know I‚Äôm an adult and don‚Äôt need to ask my parents to do things. They are pretty relaxed about most things but we don‚Äôt discuss my sex life whatsoever. My mom is aware of what‚Äôs going on but we don‚Äôt really talk about it. She knows I‚Äôve visited him out of town and we are going on a trip together. I‚Äôm just not sure how to bring up me sleeping at his place?

547,"I love in Ontario, Canada for background.

I just updated my address as I moved with my fianc√©. We moved in with my Mom and Sister temporarily while we‚Äôre having a house built.

The insurance company asked if we had anyone else living at the home and I said we did. They then asked for the names and insurance policy numbers (different insurance companies) of all of them because ‚Äúthey needed them for the case of an emergency since they may have to drive the car‚Äù.

I was under the impression that people are covered for their own collision insurance as a person not on a car and I‚Äôve never been asked this before.

They have since called to follow up so they aren‚Äôt letting it go. Is this something that I have to provide? It seems unusual and I would rather not give out information I don‚Äôt have to.

I have tried 2/3 times to sort it out peacefully as we used to be good friends, yet every time i think we‚Äôre chilled, i hear another person telling me what hes said. He has even gone as far as to bother my girlfriends younger sister while she was on a date ( he is a runner at the restaurant they went to ) and started talking shit about me to them. I recently messaged him warning him to stop but he‚Äôs acting tough over the phone, he refuses to meet me in person now. I told him I‚Äôm going to where he‚Äôs working tomorrow to confront him. I‚Äôm wondering if its best to try and discuss it, or to punch him...i know punching him may not be the best idea, but im infuriated that he has the nerve to turn his back on our friendship after all the good ive done for him and helping him out in times of his depression. I have a few years experience in both MMA and Karate and am confident that i could likely hurt him badly if it resorts to that, he‚Äôs bigger than me but unfit and previously even dislocated his shoulder..im not attempting to blow smoke up my own ass, just saying it might not end well. He‚Äôll have friends and family friends with him at the workplace.

550,"Not sure if correct subreddit. I don't know how to structure this post as my thoughts are all over the place right now so bear with me. 

I am currently a Junior in my college about to enter my senior year. I already have a full-time job in my field and once I graduate, I'll be moving jobs and making good money. I am also in a fraternity (this is an important fact to remember) 

At the start of this semester, I matched with a girl (We'll call her D) on Tinder and we hit it off decently well. Eventually, our communication moved to snapchat and then eventually to text messages. At around this time, I was also recruiting for my fraternity and ran into a reasonably cool dude (lets call him M) who seemed interested in the fraternity. It turns out that M and D knew each other as I saw him in one of her snaps and they were at that point becoming good friends. 

It should be noted that for our fraternity, We don't directly communicate with the new guys unless we are directly responsible for bringing them into the fraternity. I did not have that responsibility and maintained no communication with M up until fairly recently. 

D and I talked on and off throughout the semester with me wanting to set up a date with her. She gave me a host of different excuses that were conveniently timed to where she was always out of town or out of the city. This struck me as suspicious but at the time I had no reason to believe that she was lying as I figured that she was just a busy person as she also created a persona for herself stating that she was a star student and a dancer (both lies). She also sent me pictures of who I assumed to be her (it wasn't) but I thought nothing about it as I couldn't put two and two together as I wasn't communicating with M. Basically, we texted each other for the last couple months without meeting each other. 

Recently, M became a brother of my frat and I have been openly able to talk about his friend D and how it's funny that she's always out of town. M got a weird look on his face and told me that he saw her on campus at around the time she was allegedly out of town but he wrote it off as her messing with me. Up until this point, D and I still haven't met in person and have only been communicating via text.

Today I get a frantic call from M saying that we need to talk. I end up sitting down with M and his two friends and they tell me the story about how one of them (We'll call her K) went to D's place for thanksgiving which is where all of her lies start to fall apart. 

It turns out that D maintained the same lies she did with me with her friends as well and created a persona of herself as someone that was rich with a dad who was an engineer and a mom who was a pharmacist (both lies), D also stated that she lived in a big house and drove a range rover. She actually lived in a roach infested small house and drove a cheap older car. Finally, D introduced K to some of her ""friends"" who also turned out to not be her friends and actually hated her. They ended up telling K that D is actually a pathological liar and is actually crazy with bipolar disorder. They told K about a story about how she once spread rumors about someone she was jealous of and got our whole community (it's a culture) to hate her. Her ""friends"" also told K that whatever personality she puts on is an act and that she's actually mean. They also told her that D regularly steals which got K's attention as she found some of her important things (like car keys and money) go missing throughout the semester. 

They called me down to meet as D maintained a host of lies about me ranging from minor things like calling me her boyfriend (even though we've never physically met) to bigger lies with K stating that D once came into her dorm room crying stating that I drunkenly came to D's room to berate her when I was actually at the library studying for a final. D  then claimed that she ran after me and ran around campus looking for me (this is false). Apparently she came to K and her friends MULTIPLE times with tears in her eyes stating that I did something to her. Keep in mind that we never even physically met at this point. I now have several people I don't know thinking that I am an asshole who likes to berate women. 

Long story short, all of us went around exchanging stories about things D has told us or things that D has done and it turns out that EVERYTHING D has told us about herself up until this point has been an outright lie. 

Both of M's friends signed a lease with D and are now working to cancel it. M and his friends are now cutting and severely limiting their contact with her. I am completely blindsided by this and don't know what to do as D once told me she was roofied by someone and had to be hospitalized (this is false). She has already accused me of being a drunk asshole and could very easily accuse me of much more even though we've never even physically met up until this point. 

I have worked hard to get to where I am at right now and don't want all of my hard work to be flushed down the drain because of a false accusation. The situation with sexual assault and college campus' is tense right now and they will most likely side with her to avoid a PR fire. If she's willing to cry fake tears to her friends about me then I'm convinced she'll do much more if I abruptly leave her. How do I end things smoothly so I don't get potentially accused of something I didn't do? ",29Nov2018,1
551,"My cousin is pretty depressed and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this whole situation. We live together and the last year or so she has been very secluded (stays in her room with her door locked all the time, comes to interact sometimes, but is overall secluded). My family has a history of addiction issues and weed is very much not ok in our house and I am afraid to confront her because she is mentally unstable. I found weed in her bedroom recently and need to know how to address this. As of now the family has tried to get her more involved and get her back into counseling, but what should we do about the weed issue and how can we help her become more mentally stable?

552,"I feel like this is a problem that a lot of people run into but I can't find advice that's specific to my situation.

The main problem is that this dude hasn't done anything particularly wrong that would make me feel justified in telling him to fuck off, I guess. He's just uncomfortably persistent and acts too familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

The full story: This guy went to high school with me several years ago and occasionally texts me to catch up and has asked me to spend time with him on a few occasions. Even asking me to travel 2 hours to do so. I feel like he sees us as friends and I can't understand why because we talk less than once a month and he is ALWAYS the one to message first. If I was in his place, I would have given up on this ""friendship"" a while ago.

I've tried subtly indicating my disinterest by not responding at all but he just texted again. In my experience (things I've read online and heard from friends), most people respond to getting ""ghosted"" by assuming that the person doesn't want to talk anymore. I would just block him on my phone and let him assume whatever, but he has my Instagram as well and I think if you block someone on there it tells you so.

My friends who have seen screenshots of our conversations agree that it's a bit much and are the ones that advised not responding/blocking.

I'm a woman and I'm pretty sure he's straight, that's probably relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have to be explicit with him, but I don't know how when it's his persistence in communicating itself that makes me uncomfortable. Should I just keep up the occasional small talk when he texts or would this be equally unkind if I don't actually want to spend time with him? Should I just block him everywhere with no explanation? Ghost him for real? What is the right thing to do in this situation?

554,"So I‚Äôm in my first semester of university (finals next week!) and I‚Äôm majoring in veterinary science. During this semester, I‚Äôve decided I do not want to pursue becoming a veterinarian because I don‚Äôt want to spend 8 years in school, and vet school itself is incredibly competitive and difficult, just like med school. I just know I will not be happy if I even get in. So I spent a long ass time searching for careers that would interest me. I even broadened my horizons to non-animal related fields, which is something I hadn‚Äôt really considered. The only job out there that appealed to me was a veterinary technician, which is the equivalent of a nurse in the vet field. The problem for me is that 1) they are payed horribly and 2) it requires an associates, not a bachelors. In that case, I would drop out of university and go to a medical institute near my home and get an associates for veterinary technicians (really specific degree). I am just terrified that I will make the wrong decision here and regret dropping out my whole life, but I just cannot imagine myself doing any other career. All I want is to be happy, and I am not right now, and I may never be if I continue on the wrong career path. I am also nervous as to what my peers will think of me. So do you guys think I should drop out and pursue being a vet tech? Thanks.

559,"Little back story, I moved into my moms boyfriends house about 2 years ago. Little did I know he and his buddy would smoke probably about a pack of cigarettes inside the house nearly everyday.

561,"I met her when we were both in middle school.  We started talking in class, and we connected right away. She joked that her friend was moving away and that i could be her best friend. I always thought she was gorgeous and cool and I was just the awkward kid who didn't have a style, I was shy and never really talked to people. She was so bright and cheerful. I didn't even expect for us to hit it off, but we did. I never felt this way about anybody until then, but when I found her I knew she was my person. School ended and I began going over to her house during the summer, all the time. She was dating a girl and she was always there when we hung out, but eventually it was just us. The girl treated her poorly, she was physically and emotionally abusive. When she moved, was when we really became close. 

She showed me so many things, she taught me so much. It was because of her I started wearing makeup. She had taught me how to do it. She showed me her music, which at first sounded like something I was too scared to listen to or admit i liked to because I felt like it was too confident and out there for me, but it became my second nature as she played it whenever I came over. I began liking it then loving it then jamming out to it even when she wasn't there. We did so many fun things together and we always had something to talk about.

Her mom became my mom, and I had become her sister. 

This was until she met her ex boyfriend. I didn't like him from the beggining, but i gave him a chance anyways. She was so happy with him, she seemed happy at least. But something else had been happening in her life. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She had told me she had been having episodes. She always struggled with mental illness, but I knew she was struggling the most during this time. Eventually her boyfriend broke up with her, and this is where our downfall began.

She became angry, sad, broken. Nothing like the person I knew before, but I still loved her. She was getting angry at me and taking her anger out on me. Every little thing I did irritated her. She snapped and ignored me. But then she became friends with my ex boyfriend, and that was the seal of the end. I became scared. Not because I thought she would date him, but because I was scared I would lose her.

He introduced her to many other new people. And other things as well, such as drugs. I suppose I should have seen in coming, as she always wanted to try but never did. She promised it would be one time, and I believed her. Of course it wasn't. But it was only weed, it didn't break her it didn't hurt her physically. But it drew her closer to those people, and farther from me.

 ""You can't control me"", ""I'm just having fun"", ""you're not my mom"", ""i just can't feel sympathy for her[said to one of her friends who later told me]"". I couldn't take it anymore so I threw her out of my life and made it very clear. At first I didn't care that she had lost me, but after months I became vulnerable again. I reached out to her, and she took all the blame. She said she wasn't angry at me she didn't mean to hurt me she changed. She loved me. I was her family. And I believed her. We became friends once again and things were really good for a while, until i noticed that she had quickly replaced me. My ex was now her best friend and the other people too. She didn't want to hang out with me anymore, she never invited me over or texted me first.

She wanted me to join her group, but I dreaded hanging out with them. A furry, an alcoholic who's jokes are all vines and my ex who realized he was gay after being with me. I told her i just wanted to hang out with her and I hated groups. I guess that's what did it. She began taking her anger out on me again, just like old time. ""You always make me the bad guy"", ""you bring me down"". It was like she thought I was emotionless or something, and the things she said to me wouldn't affect me. But they did. They really hurt. She even told me she was glad she didn't have to worry about me hurting myself or trying to kill myself. I told her how I felt, but I guess she didnt get the message. 

I loved her so much. She helped me find myself. I am a completely different person now then I was before I met her. I have improved in everyday, she had taught me my values and my looks as well. I stopped sitting with her at lunch. And at that moment, in that split second decision I knew what that meant. I had lost her then and there. After that, she walked up to me a couple of times to compliment me and she asked me why i didn't sit there anymore. I told her I just wanted to be alone, and she sounded annoyed. That was 2 months ago. I think about her everyday, every single day. I pass her in the halls, not a wave, not a smile, not anything but emptiness. I guess i had hoped she would come back for me. Reach out, show affection. She is very needy with her othet ftirnds, she hangs out eith people ebery single day after school, and all she talks about is them. I guess I was different. She knows I'm always around and never busy. But she hasn't reached out And I'm afraid I've lost her forever. 

I know this is probably a lost cause, but for some reason I just can't seem to accept this. I want her back, I realize that she will never be the same, but I dont care because I know I will love her no matter what. I just wish she loved me too.

What can I do? Should I try to reach out?",29Nov2018,1
562,"I have a history of failing courses and retaking them without my parents knowing. I've switched majors two times, and I finally had one year of a packed schedule needed to graduate on time, and now I've fucked up this semester. This guarantees that I need another full year.

563,"**TL;DR** - Some people are fucking garbage and have zero consideration for others. It's starting to affect my happiness and mental health because I'm a big guy and what I want to do will certainly get me in trouble. 

I will start by stating that I know it's just meaningless noise, but the inconsideration is just endless and seems like there's nothing I can do to move beyond it because it is slapped in my face on a daily basis, multiple times. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. 

This is a few examples from today alone:

Example 1: I just spent nearly $20K on landscaping for my house and noticed my plants were all trampled. I reset my security camera settings and managed to catch the culprits. It's a guy down the road who instead of using the sidewalk, walks directly across my lawn without any care for where he is stepping. I have 4 video's of him trampling my plants today alone. He does the same to my neighbors, so I guess it just seems like the route he decides to take. We even put up a sign recently to stop people, but nothing.

Example 2: I went to a local fast food place at lunch. The meal I ordered was $11.69 on the menu. I paid without really looking, but while waiting for my food I noticed that I was charged nearly $15 for the same thing. I asked the lady if their prices changed, and she said ""no"". So I pointed out how the menu says one price, and my bills says another. Her response ""oh, that price is for a small meal and I gave you a regular meal"". I looked at the tiny cup of pop she put on my tray and asked what size that was. She said ""small"". So then why the fuck did I pay for regular? It's absolutely clear what she was doing.

Example 3: I was standing in a quiet hallway. I was there to make a private call to my friend who is dealing with some serious problems in his marriage. While standing in this long hallway that's more than 100 meters long, a guy comes and stands directly beside me. Not several feet away, but close enough that I wouldn't even have to extend my arm fully to slap him across the face. I understand that I don't own the hallway, but out of the million other options to stand, why stand that close to me. It's not like the area I was standing was any different then the rest of the hallway.

Example 4: On the train to work this morning I was on early enough to get a seat. A lady stood above me and continuously coughed directly on me, even after I asked her to cover her mouth. 

Example 5: While walking down a small hallway in the mall attached to my office, there were a group of 5 ladies walking towards me. They were 3 wide in the front and 2 wide behind them. The hallway was just barely wide enough for 4 people to walk side-by-side, so this should have been okay. Nope, one of the ladies from the back decided right at the exact moment that she wanted to walk with the 3 in front. She looked at me, then looked down at the ground as if to say ""I don't see you, so it's your fault if we bump into each other"". In fairness, I don't know what she wants me to do, maybe jump on the ground and kiss her feet and thank her for letting me breath the same air as her? Instead I just continued walking and she got the worse end of that collision. 

Example 6: While this one didn't happen today, it's just one that has left me seething worse then most others. On my way to the train in the morning I was going up the escalator with about 500 other people. Like most metros, there's a side to stand, and a side to walk. I was walking. Unfortunately, it's common for the person at the top of the escalator on the ""walking"" side to stop short of the edge by about 10 feet, causing everyone behind them to stop as well. In this case, the lady behind me hit my leg. It kind of hurt, but I did stop suddenly because so did the person ahead of me. As we are all stopped, she hits my leg again and it hurts again. I turned and asked her to be careful. She didn't even acknowledge me. She does it again, this time it really hurt, and that is saying a lot for a big guy like me with a pretty decent tolerance for pain. I turned and said ""if you do that again..."" and stopped myself from saying what I wanted to say. By this time we were at the top of the escalator and walking down a short hallway. She did it again, this time it hurt even worse. I turned and realized she was stabbing my leg with her umbrella. Just as I looked at her, I busted her attempt to do it again and grabbed her arm and pushed her. A little adrenaline was going and my push was undoubtedly harder then I planned, but definitely deserved. She fell over. She got up, started screaming that I was attacking her, then proceeded to swing her umbrella at my head. A lady that witnessed everything grabbed her umbrella which caused this crazy fuck to turn and start swinging at her. I had the local transit authority pull tapes that show she attacked me because I didn't want to be traveling with that crazy fuck again. They told me that she would be banned from using the train, yet I see her almost daily and this happened nearly 6 months ago. The train authority keep telling me someone will call me to discuss my complaint when I try to find out why, but they don't. 

I'm just struggling with dealing with this daily occurrence. Some days are better then others, but mostly they are like today. I don't want to hurt someone or get in trouble, but I also can't keep letting people act like this at my expense. What do I do?",29Nov2018,1
565,"I‚Äôm choosing between two different apartments, both in the same complex just different floor plans and prices.  They‚Äôre virtually the same price, the 2nd one is $10 more a month.
