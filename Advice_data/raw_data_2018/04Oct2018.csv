0,"I hate work. I’ve always hated work. I’ve never had a job I liked. I’m 37 years old, on a very good income. Fell into marketing because, like many creatively-inclined people, it’s a natural path to use your skills and earn a living. But it’s also soulless and in many cases completely unrewarding.

I wonder if I have some sort of psychological condition. ADHD or some kind of anxiety disorder. One of the reasons I hate work so much is because I’ve never felt good at it. I always feel like an imposter, always feel like my coworkers hate me, always feel like I’m pulling some kind of con. I’ve been in therapy for years. It doesn’t help attack the core of whatever this is. The stupid thing is that in my previous role, I got perfect performance review scores every year for 5 years. And yet still I feel like a piece of shit at work.

I feel like at some point I’ve gone very wrong, I’ve allowed my career to deviate from who I am so far I can’t even remember who I am, or what my values are, and I have no idea what I want to do. 

I know this is a bit of a whinge. But I feel like I’m in a crisis. I can’t keep doing this. I can’t keep turning up in an office and just hating life. But I feel trapped. Although my income is good, I don’t have a bunch of cash just sitting there to allow me to go experiment. I have a mortgage and a family.

If anyone has dealt with anything like this before, I’d love to hear any advice at all. Thank you very much in advance.

2,"We haven’t dated long but he made all these long term plans. Saying he can’t wait to meet my family, brought me food at work, stays up late to talk to me. Known each other for a month. He hardly makes an effort to reach out to me since I have been on vacation. He made it official before I left so I wouldn’t ghost him and then he barely responds to my message about my trip. He knows this is a dream of mine and he hardly says anything besides cool and haha and does some emojis. 


Hell he even ignored my sexting message for hours while commenting on my Instagram in the meantime. 


I have sent him nudes. I have sexted him. I have called him. He seemed into it at first but his interest waned and so has my effort to communicate. Hell I even said I dunno why I’m so horny for him lately and I couldn’t wait to see him and he said it’s probably because we are still in the honeymoon period and my vagina dried up real quick after that. 


I told him my mom could get me from my early flight so he could sleep and I told him I’m working the next four days when I get back and this was his response

I've never understood but i have confronted one that stated ""I do not care about you i never have"" But i argue you have to care about someone to hate them and try everything in your nature to not be around them or talk behind their back, Personally I don't hold grudges i solve my emotions with reasoning and a conclusion, Some people deserve to be hated i am not delusional to the wrongs I've committed...

10,"I’m a sophomore in HS, and I was going out for football. I was one of the veteran returners on the team after having started all games in varsity last year as a freshman. Over summer camp, I sprained a ligament in my knee, and was out 4 weeks. 

I recovered in time for 2-a-days, and even got my normal varsity reps as a running back. The week of the first game came around, and I was the starter according to the depth chart, I did in fact get to start that game, but in the second half I fumbled the ball when someone grabbed my testicles when they were making a tackle. 

The next series on offense, I was told by my dad, I had to sit out because of the fumble. I was shocked, because he’s never told me this before, and it wasn’t our normal rotation. I tried explaining that it was a dirty tackle, but he didn’t care in the least. My backup is only a short yardage tailback, but he played an entire series. I was pissed about this, I’ve never been so upset with my dad. 

The next series on offense, and my dad comes up to me, and he asks if I’m ready to go back in. I was fuming and didn’t want to talk to him, so I ignored him, I had my helmet strapped up and on, like all players on the sidelines are supposed to do. I took off my helmet, and he just turns to the #2 running back and found the #3 RB who never plays, and he says that they’re both “in rotation now”. 

So the fourth quarter starts, and the score is 14-12, the type of score where the starters play. Not the JV. I still hadn’t been able to play since that situation early in the 3rd. It was 2nd down on our side of the field, and my dad was rotating the RB’s under me on the depth chart. I got fed up and followed my dad up and down the sideline. It got to the point where I would often remark things like “Dad, wtf, I torched this team last year. Put me in!” Or “Dad, I fucking scored the touchdowns, play me!” 

He just kept ignoring me. We ended up winning, but the worst way possible, the third string RB scored the touchdown in the final minute of the game 20-13. In the locker room, I overheard the praise my dad gave this kid. I heard him say that he “found a spot for this kid”. Meaning he’s going to get more Varsity reps. I skipped my shower with the team, and went home, and showered there. 

I waited for my dad to get home, and I casually brought up what happened when he finally came home. He completely evaded my questions, and just said “we can talk about it tomorrow after film” I asked him why it couldn’t wait. He ignored me and said “you had some nice carries and a couple of touchdowns, you’ll like what you see on film!” 

I got impatient and asked if I’m being benched, he again ignored me, and just said “I thought your knee needed a break, we can talk after film”. The next morning, my dad knocks on my door as usual to inform me that the coaches are going to have the meeting, and he wanted me up. I didn’t sleep at all last night, I was cramping, I was wondering if I lost my job. I kept playing 1,000’s of scenarios in my head... 

I decided I wasn’t going to go to film, I went back to sleep. I woke up after film was over to a bunch of missed calls, and texts from my dad, and teammates. I decided to make an excuse before he got home, so I took my calculus book out of my book bag, and my notes, and I played it off like I had a math test that following Monday. He was mad that I didn’t tell him sooner, but he seemed to understand, and I would’ve gotten away with it, had he not inquired the teacher. The exam excuse would’ve worked on Thursday, but he asked the teacher and the teacher says “oh, he took that exam Thursday, he scored the highest in the class!” My Dad was right to be upset, but he didn’t seem to be. 

The second game rolls around, and I haven’t played a single down in the first or second quarter. I kept following my dad up and down the sidelines, and tried to get his attention casually, I kept trying to help coach the RB’s. Nothing worked. Half time rolls around, and I corner my dad asking why I haven’t played, he says to me that I’ll play when I start making mandatory team meetings. I told him I only skipped once. He didn’t care at all. 

We go back to our locker room, and everyone’s waiting for the coaches to finish the short meeting. My dad and the rest of the coaches come out, and my dad tells me I’m going to play the second half. He mentions that he wants my explosive running style on the field. 

I was still pissed about what all happened, and when the second half started, I decided to play special teams in addition to my should be regular roles. I return the kickoff for a touchdown, and saw an opportunity to leave my dad hanging on the celebration. Instead of getting off the field where he was at, I went to the unoccupied portion of the sidelines. 

The next offensive series, I was ready to back out on offense, and my dad grabs me last second and tells me I’m not playing anymore for the night. I contested by reminding him that I gave us the lead back. He tells me that he doesn’t care, and he tells me to sit on the sideline the rest of the game. 

Now rare opportunity for me here, the safety ahead of me on defense gets hurt, and so I have to play. I got in for 3 plays, and managed to get an interception. I tried to use this as leverage for my dad by staying in when the offense comes out. I thought he would be fine with this, but no, he wasn’t. I made him waste a timeout. He pulls me out says that I’m not playing. I told him that I made a big play. He ignored me. We won this game, and after this week it was a blur. 

The third game rolls around, and I’m not playing at all. I tried telling my dad to put me in, but he wouldn’t. At halftime, I decided to quit. I bathed in on the coaches meeting, and I told my dad I’m quitting. I put my street clothes on, and I didn’t bother showering, and I drove home. 

I was at home watching TV, and my dad got home the first thing he says is. “The team doesn’t need you” I figured it was just a loss that’s got him upset (it was), so I didn’t think much of it. The following Monday, and I decided to go to practice, and to my dismay, my locker is cleaned out. 

I went up to my dad’s coaches office, and asked what was going on. He simply says “you quit”. I tried telling him that I only said what I said, and did what I did, because I wanted his attention. He tells me that he’s disappointed in me, and to “find another team”. I asked what he meant, and he tells me that being his son “doesn’t entitle you to shit”. He then says I have to wait for next season to go out for football. 

Ever since then, we haven’t talked, nor made eye contact. I want to to try and break the ice, but don’t know how. The house is just entirely awkward now. I have an exam Friday, and I just feel the awkwardness in the house where I typically study, so I’ve been going to our school’s 24/7 study center. I’m alone in my thoughts, so I just want advice on how I extend an olive branch.

12,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to apologize in advance for the long post.

I have been in a bit of a pickle for a while now and seeking some outside perspective. I am a 24 year old female and I am in nursing school currently, while working as a patient care technician in an emergency room at a local hospital. I am married and my husband and I have had this theoretically great plan for me to finish my nursing degree, move to the mountains (which we are dying to do as soon as possible), and buy a house there, we have 4 dogs and want the best space we can get for them. We want to move just about more than anything. The problem is, I really hate not only just nursing school, which is pretty common, but I really hate working in the hospital as well. Most of the nurses I work with have jokingly said things like ""are you sure you don't want to change your mind?"" and a good bit of them don't really seem to enjoy what they do. I honestly dread going there, and sometimes to the point of being in tears before a shift. It's the job in conjunction with nursing school that makes me feel apprehensive about going into nursing, which is something I feel no passion in. I am a very spiritual and self aware person, and lately I have just felt a great internal struggle and just the feeling of my soul trying to tell me something isn't right. 

However, I have always wanted to be a veterinarian my entire life. I would read 500+ page books on dog breeds with their characteristics and origins when I was just old enough to even read. I would bring home stray dogs who seemed hurt and would always try to fix them up, my parents weren't always happy about it but I would do it anyway, even if it meant sneaking the dog in the house then telling them afterwards so they could call the shelter to come pick them up. I have always known that was what I wanted to do, but I went through some rough times in my teenage years that caused my grades to decline and I was not the best student. I ended up settling, going to a community college then hit more hard times and had to stop going. Took some time off, worked, decided I would go to nursing school since it would be easier to get into than vet school, and I had a lot of self doubt of my intelligence and abilities to perform well in school due to my past experiences. I have done very well in school, on the Dean's List, but I keep coming back to wanting to pursue my passion of veterinary medicine, and the thought of being a nurse makes me miserable, to be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot more belief in myself now that I could make it as a veterinarian, but I am not sure which avenue to take. I could either...

A. finish out nursing school, move out of state soon, work on my pre requisites for vet school while working as a nurse

B. discontinue nursing school and stay where I am currently for a little to finish a degree in biology/pre-vet, work as a vet assistant and wait a little longer to move.

15,"This has been going on for a few years now. I get calls and texts for a man (same name every time) that are usually automated recordings or precanned messages just saying to call a number back. A few weeks ago it was some kind of moving company wanting to make sure this guy was home so they they could drop off a car part. I’ve tried calling back but never got ahold of anyone. I’ve looked up this name in my county’s court system and see he (and his son, Jr.) both have histories of writing bad checks, and several civil lawsuits regarding debt. 

I have a cvs card and a club card for my local grocery store that are both tied to my phone number. I have come to find out that someone else is using my phone number for both as well. I believe this because I can’t get more than one deal in the same day/week/whatever and I don’t use the cards often - at ALL. I usually use a friend’s phone number because it almost always ends up being useless to use my own. 

Another thing that might not be related but that I find strange.. whenever I browse online my phone predetermines my location and it is always a specific city in a state that I’m not in. Always the same place and I’ve never even been there. This has been for years and I don’t understand why.

I’m curious if I should be more concerned. Also curious what exactly I can do? I could change my number, but would it even help? What about my location information? I don’t know. This is super annoying- changing my number will be a giant pain in the ass because of my job.

17,"I couldn't think of a better title, because I don't know what else to say. I am 20 years old and just recently transferred to a four-year college that I've always wanted to go to since I was little and I'm studying mathematics. The classes I'm taking are Calculus II, Computer Programming, Physics, and weight training. Only 12 credit hours, but the three STEM classes are difficult. I recognize that but at the same time, I feel like I should be doing better. I already feel ""behind"" in a sense because almost all the kids in my 200+ classes are all freshman, whereas I'm a junior and 20 years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main fear in life is working a shit job that I loathe and despise and basically branding myself a loser, to myself, my family, and anyone else that knows me. I have never had any sense of direction or purpose in life, no special talents that I can see or think of. Many of my friends and my girlfriend whom I love and adore, have found their purpose, and always have had clear strengths, whereas I have not.

&amp;#x200B;

While at my new college, I've gone to see a therapist since early August and I hated myself for going. I know that's it's okay to seek help, but for me, I shouldn't have to. In my mind I view myself as weak when I ask myself for help. I know that's the wrong view to have, and I've told my therapist this, but I just don't know how to correct my way of thinking. I've also been going to group therapy as well, with a bunch of other people who have a hard time forgiving themselves for their mistakes and viewing themselves as worthy. Neither have worked out. I don't know if I need to give it more time, but it seems I haven't really improved since I've been going. In fact, I think I'm getting much worse. I haven't been truly happy since I've been here and it seems like every time I set up a new plan to get myself to succeed it fails.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my sophomore year of high school, I've had a really negative outlook on myself and my life. I don't know how or why I became like this, but I craved perfection. I had to be perfect in everything I do, not only for myself and my own views about myself but for everyone else as well. I didn't want to show off to people, and I didn't want to ""have power"" over someone, in my mind I wanted to prove that I could hang with someone who was more intelligent or become more intelligent. So, I worked my ass off. Every class that I took I wanted to get an A in and did except for two in junior college. Coming out of high school, I could have gone almost anywhere if I actually applied. But I chose to go to junior college because I had no clue what I wanted to study, so I just went for the cheaper option, even though I wasn't proud of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still didn't feel good about myself despite my success. This continued when I went to college for my first two years. I didn't know what major I wanted to study because nothing interested me as a career. Everything single time I branched out and tried something, I disliked it or wasn't good at it. For example I took a two year internship with my university in the athletic department because I do enjoy sports, even though I'm not talented enough to play at a collegiate level. The internship was basically journalism/statistician for the college that I went to. Some aspects were nice, but the cons definitely outweighed the pros. The pay was below $40,000 and that's what my boss, who was basically an assistant to the athletic director was earning. But, the thing was is he loved his job. I didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also wanted to become a shoe designer. Don't know why it was a pretty random thought, but I took several intro art classes, and found out I have zero talent when it comes to drawing, painting, or graphic design. Which for some reason, I was okay with. I also decided to become a lawyer, so the majority of classes I took were law based, at my previous university. I didn't enjoy any of them and decided that career path wasn't for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, as my second year of junior college was winding down, I was really upset and sad because I still didn't know what I wanted to do. I went to several job fairs, took the tests that tell you ""what you like and what type of person you are."" I eventually made an appointment with a career counselor and we took those same tests and compared them and through several sessions we found that I could succeed in math. I still didn't know what I wanted to do as far as mathematics go, but I eventually settled on an actuary. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was the first time I had any sense of direction. I was happy for a brief moment until I came to my new university. I expected my classes to be way more difficult than I had imagined. I knew coming in to expect a learning curve and to expect my grades to drop. That isn't the issue. I felt prepared for the struggles. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I wasn't prepared for was the feeling of being stuck every waking moment and not knowing what to do with my life. The classes I'm taking and the stress has me more upset, sad, and angry with myself then I have ever been. I've never really had to ask for help from professors or go to office hours or tutoring, but now I have to go every single day. Right now, in my mind, I've never been weaker. My therapist, parents, girlfriend all say that these are difficult classes, and I know they are, but that shouldn't excuse the fact that I'm failing all three of these classes. Other students are passing with ease, so why am I not? I haven't stopped working hard or trying, I'm doing double triple the work everyone else is but I'm still getting 50's and 40's on exams. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now recently, my motivation and work ethic are gone. I no longer have the desire to work on homework or do anything really. I don't even want to watch television or go out anymore. If I leave my college, I know I'll look back at this and think of it as a colossal failure because it is. And I guarantee I will absolutely despise myself for the rest of my life for it. I no longer want anything to do with math or programming but at the same time I want to do it, so I can prove to myself that I'm smart enough to do it and I'm better than it and can overcome its challenges. If I leave I don't know where I would go or what I would do, I can't go back home because I won't allow myself to do that. I can't be a bum still living with my parents working some shit job. I'd rather live on my own and do that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also feel like I'm pushing my girlfriend and family away and that I'm failing them, I've also told them this. They all told me the love me and just want what's best for me and that they'll always be there for me. I don't want to drop out of college, but at the same time I want to leave and never come back. I'd honestly rather live in the desert surrounded by nothing than to be anywhere else right now. Now, I'm back to having no passion, or direction in life, at a time where I need to have it. I don't know what else to do.

22,"So this guy is quite a mixed bag. He often insults people, calls them r*tarded and gay, and is quite judgemental. Then he cries and whines that everyone hates him and he'll never get a girlfriend. We're both sophomores in high school. I realized a while back that he is an asshole. I once told the girl he liked about his feelings for her. They eventually started dating, but she dumped him (good riddance). He is obsessed with finding and girlfriend. He's obsessed with sex.

So today I was joking around with a girl I know. It was just an inside joke. However, he started to claim that we're dating. Now, I have no feelings for her and she doesn't have any for me. He keeps insisting that we like each other. Why do you like he does this? How should I crush he delusions? How should I stop his rude and disrespectful behavior? I really don't understand how a person could get fucked up like that.

I know that this stuff is petty and it's below me. ""Why should you confront him if you know he's wrong?"" Well, inaction isn't an option anymore. I need to do something about this, and I need help.

I'm still living at home, I wake up every day at 7:30, drink a cup of coffee, watch tv, go for a run, write, watch Netflix or YouTube, look and apply for a job, eat dinner, sleep, repeat. Every. Day. I'm going crazy. I want to leave. I just want to go anywhere and be anywhere but here. Start over or just learn what kind of life I want to live. I need to go. But I can't. All I have in my bank account is $47 (just spent it all on a new PC) and I have a car with a full tank. I have nowhere to go and no one to see. I feel the longer I’m at home the more strain it will put on my already fragile relationship with my parents. So I want to go not just for me, but for them. 

All I'm asking is should I go.

28,"I don’t know exactly why. I’m just dreading my birthday so much and I’m having actual anxiety over it.

I’m gonna be 21. 

Now when I was 16, if you had told me I’d live to see this day, I’d have said you were fucking crazy. I wasn’t in a good place from like 15 until, realistically, now. It’s crazy to see that I’ve overcome and lived through so much trauma and survived every attempt I made on my life (and there were a lot).

But that’s the thing I don’t understand. I feel like I should be happy about living to this age. But I’m really not. 

Maybe it’s because I know I’m an adult now. Yet I didn’t have much of a childhood and my teenage years were chaotic and, well, I explained that.  So yeah I’ve been thrust into adulthood stumbling to catch up with my peers and I feel like Bambi. 

Everything’s so overwhelming. Boyfriend wants to get married in a few years (not officially engaged), I’ve lost my grandad (the father figure to me when my sperm donor left), I’m losing my nan to dementia, I’m off to university next year, I’m always on the go with no rest in between, my sleep is fucked and the list goes on. It’s so hectic and now my birthday is coming up and now I’m going to be an Official Adult? Fucking hell. Take me back to when I was but a humble gamete pls 

Plans are causing me stress too. Not knowing what to do. Can’t have my friends round my house, it’s too small and they’re scattered everywhere. Don’t wanna take them to dinner because I’m not sure I can afford to pay for it all and don’t want to ask them to pay for stuff. Don’t wanna go to clubs because, well, for starters, I hate them and I’d feel uncomfortable and I’d have to glue myself to my boyfriend to make sure no guy tries anything (was nearly sexually assaulted at a nightclub once — never again). 

I feel like I should just let it pass by and tell it to eat a dick. But it’s my 21st and I have actual friends for the first time in my life. And I’ve overcome so much to get here that I feel like I should celebrate but everything is so overwhelming. 

I don’t know where exactly I’m going with this, I’m sorry. It’s late and I’m very depressed right now for some reason but I’d appreciate any kind of help, advice or something. Anything. I just need to talk through this and I have no one at the moment. 

note: I can’t get help from the doctors with my mental health. I’ve tried. They said I’m too crazy for CBT but not crazy enough to access the high level therapy stuff. NHS for ya. Also they won’t trust me with medication but I didn’t want that in the first place. Practicing mindfulness and meditation when possible but shits just getting on top of me and I’m neglecting it. I still listen to the sleep stories on Calm though and use aromatherapy stuff. It does help a little bit. ",04Oct2018,1

30,"I'm not sure if anything can really be done, but...

I have to park on the street for a while.  One time I was parked and I went to my phone to read/respond to some texts.  I heard a car door slam in front of me, it startled me a bit so my head snapped up to see who it was.  I recognized it as the teenage girl that lives across the street getting dropped off, and started looking back at my phone.  While I was looking back down, I saw her look at me, make her eyes wide and roll them.

I've never never conversed with her dad before, it's been one of those ""live and let live"" neighbor setups.  Shortly after the previously described, I came home and he was outside in his driveway.  When I got out of my vehicle, he was giving me a hard stare.  I looked back and smiled and wave to ping him, he kept staring.

Not long after this, I came home late at night.  I got out of my vehicle and I had one of those sensations where I could see feel someone staring at me.  I didn't look but in my peripheral I see the teenage daughter walking on the sidewalk, but as she got closer to my vehicle she moved up the driveway of someone else's house to be near their garage, crossed over a couple lawns to stay by garages, and then when she got to her house, went inside.

When I was walking out to my vehicle the other day, she was in her driveway with someone else (I think it was her brother), and when I got near the end of my driveway, she made big eyes at me, looked at her brother, then looked down and walked inside her house.  There was a vehicle coming from the opposite direction that saw all this, it was a female driver, she did a slow headturn to look at me and gave me a real crappy look.

I'm sure you can see the problem - the longer she acts like this, the more people will see and assume something rotten about me.  I'm a middle-aged white guy, I'm also aware there will be some people that see and maybe don't care one way or another but will use it to paint me as something because sometimes people just scratching someone else's life, even if erroneously, because it makes them feel powerful.

I will also mention I've been out a couple times and the dad has been out, but he's simply ignored my presence (which is fine, as that's how it used to be, it's just that since that hard stare after the first response from his daughter I've been a bit paranoid of something happening).  I'm not sure if that means he's got a decent enough read on me through the non-verbal to know I'm not actually a threat, or if he just isn't trying to indicate anything in either direction because he's waiting to see what happens before going further.  So whether or not anything comes of this, I'm mostly still annoyed that there are apparently still women/young ladies out there that like taking nothing-situations and trying to turn them into something repulsive, my guess for the reason as to why is wanting attention.

Beyond that, any advice for defusing the situation or situations like this in the future?  Obviously the ""best result"" is to simply never be out in a position where someone can take a harmless response and try turning it into something repulsive, but life happens (in this case it's construction and needing the space of the garage/driveway for other things) and sometimes you're out there for a while.",04Oct2018,1

35,"Although this isn’t technically advice, I do need ideas thrown out on how I can get votes. 

But to begin a brief summary I’d like to start off my saying that there are actually 2 girls I don’t want to win but the other girl, carrot, we’ll call her, is the worser one of the two. (Of course there are other people going- there has to be 10 seniors, boys and girls, at least nominated). But I’d rather have the other one (G) win over her if I’m being honest. 

But, Carrot thinks she’ll win because she has a big head and assumes everyone thinks she’s funny and cute and nice. It’s not even close to the truth. She and G have been harassing my close friend in our sports team for a while now that people aren’t starting to like them too much but of course they still have a following. Carrot knowing lots of people not only from our school but from a neighbor school in our district. G is actually the VP of our class but it’s been said she’s also gotten a little of a big head since winning. Again, they still have a following and people know them. 

Although this might seem like I have an advantage since it’s a kind of a popularity contest , I’m not sure how many people know me versus them. Everyone I’ve asked has pointed out that I’ll get votes and maybe win but they may be biased. 

how votes work: each class votes for their year only and the seniors. It’s online and is sent to everyone via their district given email. 

I’m planning on walking around and offering people candy or some type of small snack if they show me/prove to me they have voted for me. I have my friends who are helping me out but would like maybe some more advice or a more efficient way of winning this election.

She has lived alone for over 30 years and was a hoarder, albeit and neat and cleanly one, but it has been a heck of an ordeal getting her to go through things and get rid of things.  In this process, she has actively lied and gone out of her way to move things around beyond what was previously agreed upon to get more of her things in the house.  She has moved many of my things during times that I am not home to make more room for hers and then ""forgets"" where she puts them.  I have found some of these things stuffed in a box in the garage and she acts as if she has no idea how they have gotten there.  She has voiced her unhappiness numerous times about how much room my things are taking up in certain closets even though those same closets are over 90% her belongings.  I am a minimalist and had already agreed that she could have certain spaces that as a whole has resulted in my house being mostly her belongings, but it's still not enough.  I have never known her in all of my 33 years of life to be a liar or manipulative or selfish or anything like that and I don't know how to react as she is now constantly embodying all of those characteristics.

A few months ago my parents asked me I was fine with going to a different school, without thinking of the consequences, I said yes. I've been in my new school for more than a month and I can't stand it, my classmates are absurdly full of shit, I can't handle the academic pressure and the more I think about it, the more I hate myself for not thinking about the consequences of my decision.

This is easily the biggest mistake I've ever made, I know that hearing a 15 year old saying this seems stupid but I can't handle it anymore.

I've been thinking of talking to my parents about it but I don't know how they'll react; they say that this is better for me because is a good school and on the other hand my sister is very happy in there.

40,"This is my first time posting I think ever so please forgive me for any formatting issues. I don't like to over annoy my friends with asking for advice so I thought that I would annoy you guys. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met this guy during the beginning of the summer through work (we both work together) and almost immediately knew he had a thing for me. Everyone would tell me how ""giddy"" he would get around me or whatever. At that time, I wasn't really feeling it but we would flirt every once in a while. Later in the summer, we ended up hanging out more just because all our friends would hangout together. Eventually everyone was rooting for us to get together. So maybe toward August he asks me out on a date, and still, even then I remember not being all that into it. So we continue to hangout and I start to warm up to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I date guys, I don't have sex right away. I really have never had sex before, I've just always been that way. We end up just fooling around a little bit  and never got anywhere past that. At this point we are talking and he starts telling people we are and I hear from his friends that he ""could see himself in a long term relationship"" with me. At this point,  I am nervous because relationships have never ever ever worked out for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, maybe a week later, I feel him pull away and I'm really confused because he was really into it. So I ask around and I hear his ex (who he and her had broken up I heard around this time last year) was trying to get him to meet up with her for a while but he kept refusing. I realize the problem at this point, he probably gave in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then confront him about pulling away, and he tells me that ""My friend came up from out of town and he is going through a lot, we'll do something soon"". Whatever. He continues being weird throughout that week. Anyway we finally hangout that following Monday and I tell him that if he doesn't have good intentions with me, that it's fine just tell me so we can move on and basically not have things be weird. He then tells me that yes he has good intentions with me but wants to take it slow (which I was the one to tell him I wanted to take it slow weeks ago) because the relationship he got out of a year ago (same girl). He tells me how he jumped into this horrible relationship he then had to run away from and this time, wanted to do it right. I ask him, are you sure, because I really don't want to waste my time and he says yes. We don't do anything else but kiss goodnight and I leave. He texts me throughout the next day and then it's nothing again after that. At this point it's obvious his ex got to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I end up going out that Friday and I see him out at the bar (where we work) and making stupid drunk decisions, I pull him into our kitchen and tell him he needs to tell me what is going on because I thought we had already had this conversation. He finally tells me he has been talking to his ex. Duh. I think I end up crying at this point (I'm pretty hammered) and I don't even remember how the conversation ended or when he left the kitchen. All I remember is my friend and the bouncer comforting me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, in my own pettiness, I block and delete him off snapchat and text for 1 day, realize it's stupid and unblock him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, after that long post, my question isn't how to get back at him or win him back. I just want general advice. What do I do? Should I apologize? Was I out of line? Was I being crazy? Or what? I never really talk to guys because I really never know how to act or what to really do. Obviously it's over but I just want to know if I should say anything or not. I have to see him at work and we socialize with the same people. This sucks. Sorry this question is so stupid and high school, I just hate bothering my friends and I want genuine unbiased advice. Thanks.

I've written a couple walls of texts and deleted them entirely because I can't get this to sound right with so many things having happened. So I guess I'll just try to make it as simple as I can.

I'm 17. My Dad is a heroin addict and I have known this for a long time because my Mom told me years ago. He did a lot of terrible things to get money for it, and those things have broken family ties I didn't really ever think could be broken. 

My Mom has always been addicted to pain meds. I never thought much of it. She was always one of the most amazing, loving people I know. Even after my Dad became an addict she tried so hard to get him help. Recently she's changed in a very similar manner to how he did when I was young. She is very secretive, hides away much like my Dad does, and accompanies him into town some nights. They are both very tired and lazy now and hardly do anything around the house. My Dad hardly works and my Mom calls in very regylarly. We can't afford to pay all of our bills some months, and when we do don't have much at all for things like groceries. 

This realization that has hurt and scared me more than my father's problem ever has. I've always been very, very close to my Mom. She seems like a considerably different person now. I don't see her as often as I used to. 

I graduated high school early this year. I stay with my Grandparents most of the time now, and I'll be going to a local community college starting in early 2019. My sister moved out a while back when she became tired of our family's problems. 

Within the last week or so my parents decided to pursue a treatment program together. I thought this sounded promising. A few hours ago, while I was alone at my grandparents' house, they showed up. They don't look well. For a minute I thought this was a good thing because it meant they must be in withdrawal and deciding to stick to treatment. The first thing my Mom did, however, was ask me for money. All I had readily available was $9 I made in tips from my job today. My Dad said he was going to use the bathroom but went straight to my grandparents' bedroom to frantically look around. I asked my Mom what he was doing and walked back there to watch him. My Mom reluctantly asked him to get out. My Dad stormed out angrily. I gave my Mom the $9 and she hugged me and cried. She just kept saying ""We have to get over this."" 

I've told my Mom for a long time that I'd live at home through college to save money, but I've been considering moving here with my grandparents full-time. My sister moved out a while back and it devastated my Mom. I am terrified that losing both children to this will destroy her and result in things getting even worse. I am so scared of putting myself first and hurting her. 

For a long time I denied and argued the things people said about the two of them. I defended them as great people who provided a good home for me. I even criticized my sister when she decided to leave. The realization these past few weeks that everyone has been right has been humiliating. 

I feel completely alone. I am scared for my parents' lives. I want the family I had back more than anything, but I can't stand being around them anymore. I don't know who to talk to about this or even who I'd want to talk to so I thought I'd write it out anonymously in the first place I could find.

50,"I am a single father of two kids and have resided in my parents’ home for about 2 years. At the end of last year a lot of things happened, my wife left me which reset my whole life and my parents decided they were going to sell this house and split the proceeds among their children. I was attending college full time and decided to quit to help her fix up the house and sell it. Something that was suppose to take about a month or two has dragged out all this year. She got really sick and left back to her home state to get medical attention. Which put the house sale on hold. I tried to get help from the state but was informed I could not get help with daycare if I did not have a job and I can’t have a job if I don’t have daycare. I seriously don’t have a single person that can watch my kids for me.

In that time one of my brothers and his wife came back to live in this house after he was kicked out of his apartment. And then decided he wanted to purchase this house, in those months he has been paying everything here. But he got denied the loan already and he is trying a different avenue, but in that time tensions in this house have gotten pretty high. Because since my parents were no longer here and he wished to purchase the house it started to feel more like “their” house then my “parents” house and I started to feel like I wasn’t welcomed here anymore. And today suddenly everything erupted. I was told that if it wasn’t for my children I would have been kicked out of here ages ago. Because it is true, I have not contributed financially in those months. It’s not like I haven’t tried, I paid one of the bills for the beginning of the year until basically everything I had saved dried up. Small bill, the internet but it really was all I could contribute at the time. I have been paying my own food for me and my kids and wash some of the laundry and throw the trash. Basically, what I can do here. I didn’t know that it was a problem until today because they never told me anything, until everything erupted today and I was told I wasn’t welcomed here.

Next week I have a court date that the state set up. My ex-wife hasn’t paid child support in years or insurance and is breaking court orders. I had talked to my mother about moving to where she is so she could watch my children while I got employment. EVEN though I am not allowed to leave the state with them. I didn’t know what else to do since I can’t get someone to watch my children here long enough to get employment and the state won’t help me until I have employment. But after today I don’t feel comfortable staying here, I was told repeatedly that I was not welcomed here. And I want to leave, I don’t really feel comfortable staying here anymore. I would have left months ago if it wasn’t for that court date that is coming up. I was a CASA volunteer for some time and remember there was like emergency housing. But I couldn’t find the number, I have looked online and haven’t found that information. So I am turning to Reddit. Who do I call? What do I do? I still want to move states after my court date but that isn’t until next week. And I feel like I am stuck here, I live in Texas. Any numbers you guys can give me about who to call or advice on what I should do would be really helpful. This year has already been brutal for me, my mother getting sick and having to go through being left by my wife, quitting college, and then being told I am not welcomed here by my younger brothers was just the icing on the cake. So any information you guys can give me on what to do I would just really appreciate it, because I seriously have nobody I can ask but strangers on the internet. ",04Oct2018,1
51,"I was an undergraduate student who graduated last May with a degree in biology. Like a lot of my peers, I struggled with what I wanted to do with life post graduation. I spent the first three years as a pre-med student and during my senior year I decided that the pre-med track wasn't for me anymore. I found that I was more interested in plants and research than the human body.

I picked up an internship with my school's extension office and I found a professor at my university (let's call them Dr. A) who had a research project with plants. I loved the experience, and some of the secondary research that we did was somewhat related to a job that I had throughout high school (I worked as a farm hand and cashier).

To make a long story short, I expressed my interest in graduate school and, for four months, Dr. A led me to believe that they were interested in being my faculty advisor/mentor if I was looking to stay with the same school (which I was). They always checked up with me on the status of my application, GRE scores, etc. 

Then it came time for me to write my letter of intent...

I included my interests in biology and research, reasons why I wanted to study under Dr. A (shared research interests and my new interest in plants) I included coursework, my experience with the internship, and even my high school job. 

Dr. A told me that they wanted to proof read the letter, so I emailed it to them. A day later, Dr. A asked me to meet them in the lab, so I went. It was like the flip of a switch. They told me that my letter of intent was full of BS, that my writing was not on the level of a graduate student, and that I had no idea that this is what I wanted to do because I lacked experience. 

I was silent during the entire monologue and just went home when Dr. A was finished. I finished up my obligations to Dr A's lab as my last year came to a close and we did not speak of that meeting, my letter, or the potential for grad school again. 

At this point, I'm afraid to ask Dr. A for a letter of reference to another school or program because of the things that they said about my letter during this interaction. I worked in that lab for a year. For a few months, I spent close to 20 hrs per week in the lab and sometimes I feel like it was all for nothing.

Now I'm taking a year off so that I can try to get experience that I apparently lacked. But I can't help but feel lost and like I don't know what I'm doing now. Any advice?

52,Hi! I have never posted on reddit before but I’m looking for advice. I have had the same best friend for years and can’t seem to make anymore lasting friendships. I had a few friends and they are now friends with my best friend and don’t talk to me. It makes me feel really left out. I’m at a loss of what to do. I put myself out there but the only time I really got along with other women was when I was going out to parties and drinking. It’s starting to affect my confidence and has me questioning if something is wrong with me. ,04Oct2018,1
53,"Hello r/advice, like the title says I am afraid that the way I act is sometimes interpreted as rudeness. An important piece of 
information about me is that I am very shy and quiet; I am also a male high school senior, so not the optimal situation to be in. Well in school today, I was walking through the hall to the cafeteria for lunch; on the way a guy I'm kinda friends with asked me how I was doing on a project for one of the classes we are in together. I told him it was going well, he then told me how he is having an issue getting everything he needs. Then for some reason I just didn't say anything and let the conversation die, even though we were still walking in the same direction. I feel really bad about this, I should have continued the conversation. Earlier the same day a girl said bye to me as I left a class, when I said bye back to her I know I sounded surprised, because I was; but I am afraid I might have sounded, I don't know ""unappreciative"" or something.   So I guess what I'm asking is, am I rude and how do I act less stupid in my interactions with people.",04Oct2018,1
55,"I love my brother, but he constantly abuses my mom, step dad, and pets. He argues with them every night, and he literally poops all over his room. What was once the kids restroom, has now transformed to a feces covered wasteland. Everything in the house smells, he doesn't wash his hands, and he refuses to clean it or talk about it EVEN THOUGH HE CONTINUES TO POOP EVERYWHERE. 

What's worse is that my mom and I both have anxiety and depression. I'm currently in the process of being institutionalized, and while I'm waiting for a room to open up, I have to put up with him verbally abusing my parents and physically hurting my dog. He doesn't do it often, but when he does, he kicks and hits the dog pretty hard. 

He contributes to my anxiety and suicidal thoughts greatly, but I can't do anything about it, which makes me even more hopeless.

Is this going to come back to bite me? Is my landlord unknowingly paying my utilities, or is it the previous tenant, or did the large energy provider forget about me? I’ve been enjoying not paying utilities (yeah, duh) and would love to somehow fly under the radar but I’m just confused.

These episodes have happened both when going to sleep and when coming out of sleep. I know all the typical tricks like wiggling your toes or focusing on breathing, and never sleeping on my back, but no matter what I still end up panicking because I know I’m going to see or hear something terrifying.

My skin color is also a mix of theirs, though my skin color can vary depending on the season.

If I go swimming or running outside, I can get reallyy tan.

I have only known this student for a few months, though I was a bit unsettled by her question. Not only because I have unfortunately received negative comments about my tan in the past, but because she so often critiques peoples' appearances (She spent one lesson with me looking at all the other instructors' pictures and commenting on ""non ideal"" features like noses, hairlines, etc).This student is also 100% white. I suppose I am also a bit sensitive to the question because I have receieved blatantly racist comments when I have been tan in the summer. What do you guys think? Is this question inappropriate?

77,"Three years ago I started at my local community college as a nursing student. After my first semester (and an anatomy course and lab) I decided that I didn't have the stomach to be a nurse and changed my major to liberal arts in the hopes to enroll in an education program once I transferred to a 4-year school.  I  completed 2 semesters of liberal arts credits (including some summer classes) and at the end of my second year of fall classes decided I wanted to get into the sciences, completing my associates in general science last winter. I took the spring semester off, technically graduating in spring 2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

I transferred to a 4-year university that holds all classes at the same community college campus as I graduated (only available for certain majors). Over the spring I had off I had decided to go to school for a double major in English and education in the hopes to be a teacher instead of continuing my science degree (in my state it is required to double major to become a teacher). I am currently enrolled in this program (technically my 4th college year) and after meeting with my adviser to go over everything again found out that with all the credits required for my degree I have about 2 more years left (if I continue to take 5 classes a semester and thrown in some summer ones). I do not enjoy school at all and especially do not want to be in it for 2 more years just to get a bachelors degree in a major that is oversaturated with not many jobs in my area.  In my class this morning I had the sudden realization and now just feel a sense of dread at the thought of being in this same path for 2 more years for a job I do not want for the right reasons.

100,"So last year I spent the entire year on Adderall  except for weekends and holidays. I found Adderall to be to intense for me and I stopped taking it after many complaints of me being irritable while on it. Over the Summer I didn’t take any ADHD medication and I decided to try Vyvanse. After taking it for a few weeks at the start of the school year I’ve found myself in a moral dilemma over whether or not it’s right to use drugs, even though they are prescribed, to get ahead in school. In today’s academic field, it seems almost mandatory for someone like me to have to take some sort of medication to get ahead academically. Health wise it is scary as My heart rate and blood pressure get ridiculously high on the medications.

Another issue I’ve had with Vyvanse specifically: My sister had also taken Vyvanse when she was in high school and she asked me yesterday if I ever felt any “long lasting effect” as she said she felt like she had some sort of long term effect from it. This was a month after not taking it. I realized since I’ve stopped taking it I’ve felt less motivated, less emotion, and less passionate. I’ve always been known as a person who has had their plans together but this past month I’ve lost all motivation to do anything. Is there any research on people who take ADHD medication and their mental state after? Or is this just teenage hormone stuff, as I am 14 and just entered High School.

Sorry if there is any sequencing, logical or grammatical errors, I rushed typing this. As a note I am prescribed both medications and I took both in the prescribed amounts, I never took more or less.",04Oct2018,1

102,"Ok I'm at my wit's end with one of my in-laws.

To preface, I am a survivor of violent sexual assault and I am pretty sure said in-law has been made aware of the entirety of the situation I dealt with so long ago and continue to deal with the emotional and psychological ramifications of to this day.

Because of my status as a survivor, whenever rape culture is discussed as a part of the national topic of conversation, I spend a great deal of effort on my conversations regarding awareness, sensitivity, and overall improvement of our culture. 

During the last few months, my parent in law has taken up the torch on the opposite spectrum and apparently has a history of trying to shut up female family members when they speak of their experiences as sexual assault victims. Something to the extent of ""don't ruin his life"" or some other awful bullshit.

Last week, after I posted on my personal Facebook page a general statement about how we could change rape culture to consent culture, this parent in law started personally attacking me. They sent me links to unsubstantiated websites ""proving"" their point, and sending me disturbing images supposedly taken from Dr. Blasey Ford's personal Facebook page ""from before it was scrubbed."" My in-laws typed with all the vitriol their fingers could muster ""here is your angelic victim 😡"" as if I had somehow provoked this response by saying something about the current media circus - which I explicitly and purposefully have not. I also have not done any fact checking to the nature of the ""proof"" nor do I intend to.

I forwarded this to my partner but we are both at an absolute loss as to how to handle the situation. We can't alienate this parent any time this year for some personal reasons but I'm having increasingly bad anxiety and flashbacks which I haven't had to deal with for several years now. 

I just don't know what to do and I can't ignore it. What do I do? What can my partner do? ",04Oct2018,1
103,"First, a little background. I am a sophomore in high school (10th grade). Physically I am maybe a 7/10. I generally like to think I have a good personality, however I have slight social issues talking to those I do not know very well. 

She is a Junior in high school (11th grade). 9.5/10 at least. Wonderful personality and tons of friends. As far as I can tell she doesn't have issues with talking to people she doesnt know very well.

We are both smart, towards the top of our respective classes. We are both in track and field, however we run different distances and therefore don't practice together. Overall we are both athletic. I tend to see her a lot at school social events as well. Our school is small (600 students in 9-12th, but I have heard rumors that multiple other people are also interested in her.

I have been told by many friends that she is out of my league, and I don't doubt that, but even just getting to know her more than I do would be great. My problem is that I can't seem to find a good enough reason to talk to her. I realize that I am probably overthinking it but I dont know. I want to have a reason to approach her instead of just talking to her out of the blue. I think she might feel weird if I do that, especially since friends may have already dropped hints that I am into her. I don't need pickup lines or anything, just would like some advice on how to go about starting a conversation that will eventually lead to a relationship, of any kind, as long as it is not just ""that guy that goes to my school that I see occasionally"". 

Any help is appreciated

105,"I'm sorry for the wall of text, but it's something I need to get off my chest 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior in high school, and I am having trouble getting emotionally invested in a relationship. I think the reason for this was due to a horrible situation that occurrred in my sophomore year. Basically, I met this girl (lets call her C) and fell HARD for her. I'm talking butterflies in my stomach, trip up on my words, always thinking about her. We ended up talking for a bit, and to make a long story short, I learned later on that she was talking to multiple guys at once. 

She continually led me on and made me feel like I was doing everything wrong. I never even got to KISS C, and I thought it was all my fault, that I just wasn't doing well enough. She would reject my advances in person, but later on text me, apologizing and talking about how much she wanted to have sex with me and never let me go. 

The summer before Junior year, I cried every night for 4 weeks straight.

Yes, at this point, you are probably wondering why I didn't get out of that situation, but I felt like I was in love with her. 

The point that broke me was my junior year at prom. We hadn't been speaking very much since I had attempted a relationship with another girl to see if I was truly as incompetent as I felt, and I ultimately ended things between the girl and I. Not two weeks later C is trying to get with me, and I fall for it again. We talk about prom, and I end up asking her by buying chinese takeout and replacing the fortune inside a fortune cookie with my own promposal. C is so happy that she has tears in her eyes.

Prom comes, and I felt like the happiest man alive. My mom's friend let me borrow his Charger so I could show up in style, I had a nice suit, everything felt perfect. When I saw her in her dress, my stomach did backflips. We meet up with our friends to take pictures, and the first flag of the night is that she is barely speaking to me. When its time to take our pictures, C apparently doesn't like my smile, and tells me through her teeth to ""fucking smile"".

&amp;#x200B;

Dinner is relatively fine, and it seems like she was just stressed before (rationalizing in my clouded mind). As we are leaving the restaurant with our friends, it starts to rain. I have an umbrella and try to shield us both, but C acts like i'm not even there, and asks my friend, right in front of me, to get under the umbrella. My friend looks distraught, asks ""why don't you ask astrophysical?"" 

She responds with ""why?"".

We get to the dance, she doesn't even acknowledge me the entire time. I try to get close to her and she just shuffles away. Five minutes in, my other friend, G, had a concussion and the music was hurting her head, so she asked if I could take her to buy some earplugs. While we are at Target, I go to the bathroom and cry. I confided in G that I didn't want to go back, but I eventually did. For the rest of the night, I ignored C and tried to enjoy my prom with my buddies. 

After the dance, we are driving back to our friends house so the girls can change, and she's practically all over me. I'm stone cold and unresponsive. While I'm waiting in the car for everyone to get ready to go back out, I break down. G gets into the car and sees me, and she stays with me. 

We all end up driving to a donut shop, but I take G instead of C with me. C is once again all over me, but i barely even acknowledge her. I just tell her i'm tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- a girl broke my heart continually for a year and a half, fucked up my ability to connect emotionally with other girls I am interested in, and I don't know what to do. The past three girls i've tried to date I just have felt little to nothing in terms of romance i guess. I don't even know what i'm supposed to feel.

118,"Ever since I can remember, I've had issues with anxiety. Constantly worrying if I'd done the right thing that one moment, if that offhanded comment meant something much more...a constant whirl wind of paranoia. It got so bad that during my freshman year, sleepless nights began to get more and more prevalent. I could never, ever shut my mind off from nasty and terrible thoughts: ranging from insignificant choices I had done that day, to decisions I had made long ago in elementary school. Stupid thoughts about close friends, family, teachers...strangers looking down on me- judging me. A never ending surge of self hate would keep me up for hours on end. That until I'd finally be able to latch onto one positive thought and shut my eyes from sheer exhaustion. 

This, of course, effected my grades. 
My accumulative gpa from freshman year to junior year has been...a 3.1. Nothing to cry about, I know. But I can't help but feel this burning regret- like I could have done so much more with my time during my three high school years. As a senior who finally managed to get their shit together, I _should_ feel proud. But all I feel is absolute loss- I fucked up. I'm able to sleep better now, calm my thoughts down and not let inaccurate paranoia rile me up ...but for what? I wanted to make not just my brother, (who had gotten into a great college) but my Dad proud. He'd gotten into Cornell; as long as I could remember, he'd talked about how great his time there was...I always sort of assumed I'd follow in his footsteps.

Im talking like vomiting sick. So we open all our windows and doors to let it air out, and weve actually had to call the emergency maintence # to gwt them to open windows in the apartments theyre painting.

The most recent package was a box of hygiene products delivered by USPS. The box had been cut open and the contents looked like the had been shuffled around. Not sure if anything is missing yet.

The first box was the worrisome one. It was a large, expensive, and extremely confidential order. 
We had been tracking it's progress across the country and were expecting it later that day. A few hours later a FedEx truck pulls up, sits there for a few seconds, and begins to pull away. We caught the guy's attention and asked him what was up. He said that he thought he had an order for us but was mistaken. He leaves and the package is shortly marked ""delivered."" 
We call FedEx and are like ""WTF?"" They give us a bunch of excuses and say that they'll look into it. Waited a few days and nothing happened. Called them back and they gave us the same excuses. We threatened legal action (no idea what we could have actually done) and they found our package within six hours. Received the box but it was cut open and the contents had been disturbed. We try not to use FedEx for anything confidential now.

After the first time we thought it was a fluke but now we're just frustrated. Is there anything we can do to guarantee our packages are not opened in transit? Should we be worried that our packages are being opened?

Not to go into specifics, but looking back I realize there may have been things I did that made him not want to associate with me at the time— nothing even that bad, but maybe stuff that just didn’t sit well with him.

I’ve been friends with a guy for 15 years now. I’d consider him to be one of, if not my best, closest friends. I’ve known about him having depression for the past two years but it wasn’t until this summer when it really started getting out of control. He was in a relationship with a girl that I was friends with and they would often get in bad  fights and since I was friends with both of them I was always caught right in the middle of it. Eventually his depression got really bad and whenever they fought he would start threatening to kill himself. This went on for quite some time, at least a few months and I made sure his parents knew about all of it (I’m 19) and that he got professional help. About two months ago his girlfriend had enough of him using suicide as a way to keep her around and she left him. This also happened to be right around the time we started college.This is when his depression got really bad. He started posting stuff on social media almost every day saying how nobody cares about him and other stuff about suicide etc. Then he started telling me probably about every week or so that he couldn’t do it anymore and that “tonight I’m killing myself” etc. I pleaded with his parents to get him help and they assured me he’s seeing somebody for it. But this is a re occurring thing and when he tells me he’s going to kill himself I almost feel completely desensitized to it because it happens so often. I don’t know if he’s doing it for attention or what but its getting really mentally draining and combined with college I don’t know how much longer I can keep going with this. I’m  not depressed and I love my life for the most part. I’ve tried to say all I can to him but it seems like he doesn’t care what I have to say at all. I visited my doctor recently for a chest pain I was having and after ruling out anything wrong with me medically he gave me a stress test and found that I’m getting way too stressed out. I want to continue being friends with this guy but I can’t keep doing this. Not once has he ever asked me how I’m doing and I feel like I’m being taken for granted considering he always says nobody cares about him and other things like that that make me feel like shit.

I let her convince me that it was okay for her to date someone else while still being with me as long as she wouldn’t be with any other girls.

After that she slept with multiple other girls and allowed and encouraged her boyfriend to rape me twice. Once because she thought a threesome would be hot and once because she wanted to “be there for my first time” but then she immediately left the room. She also tried to get me into a lot of drugs and would use them to let guys do things to me.

She manipulated me and made me think the people that cared about me didn’t and that they were the toxic ones, making me isolate myself until she was all I had left. She would constantly say how pretty and smart I was but then critique me on what to wear and do and how to act.

It took me almost a year and half to realize how toxic the relationship was... it’s been almost two years since I managed to get away, I have a lot of tramas now because of it but I’m scared to go to the cops because drugs were involved and I genuinely think she would hurt me or someone I love if she found out I reported her.

She cheated on me and let her boyfriend rape me.

I'm a sarcastic asshole. Yep. I feel like it's the way I speak, think, express myself. 

I should note beforehand I also have social anxiety and don't have much experience with people. Mostly I like analyzing people acting at a distance, to make sense of why people act the way they do for certain things/stimuli.

Anyway, my friend has trouble with a few things, not going to say what those things are. I feel like using sarcasm, wordplay and comedic timing is why they still hang around. I'm normally the one that turns normal conversations into bits. (I don't want to sound narcacistic, but honesty I feel like I don't have any other qualities).

But the teasing and banter that I sometimes like dishing out drops dead when this person goes quiet. Conversation turns to silence, because he's annoyed. Never seen this happen for other people, I don't know how to act, I choke. No one else seems to notice.

What I usually do is keep going, but a bit lighter, or ignore him because I don't want others to feel the same way, or ruin anyone else's day.

beware: spoilers















for the past few months my classmates have been referring to me as Bernard. 

I eventually caught on, and i've attempted to play along, but the problem is that I don't know what season we're on. 

for example,
-- They started off by declaring they got the ball thingy thing already.
-- some people are telling me they want me to find the maze 
-- others are directing me build the maze
-- my closest classmate is clearly role playing teddy but I'm not sure what his programming is set to.


Thats all i got to go off, even though the info is scant, first and foremost:

which fucking Bernard am I? 
am I human Bernard or fucking robot Bernards?


follow ups:

if robot Bernard: 

which fucking robot Bernard?

am I supposed to prove Fidelity? 
       I already tried showing various levels of emotional response. still don't know what they want. should I be depressed? angry? dismissive? resilient? 

am I supposed to find the maze? 

am I supposed to leave the island?

am I looking for the maze?

do I know I'm a robot yet?

should i blindly trust contradictory statements and actions?




if human Bernard:

which flashback?
are me and Anthony Hopkins on good terms or nah?



if both Bernards:

can we at least agree on which season we're on?


personally I'd just like to be robot  Bernard. 

im pretty sure you guys already got the ball thingy thing.
if there's anything else you need like can we just hook me up to a machine so people can find out what they want to know?

137,"So I've been talking to this amazing girl I met on tinder and things were going great. She said she just got out of a controlling relationship and was more so looking for people to talk too which is fine with me. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, she's a busy person so her replies through out the days are kinda stretched out but I get it. She's started to be pretty flirty and sent me a pic of herself just out of the shower (covered with a towel still) so I don't think I'm wrong in assuming that even though she initially just wanted to talk now shes started to be kinda interested in me and so I plan on asking her out within a day or two. The next day completely leaves me on read and is still pretty active online.

I don't even know what to think now. Is she interested? Is she not? I kinda like her but I can't tell at all what the hell is going through her head and now I just feel like she's playing with my emotions intentionally or not.

I’ve told him about them before and he just rejected me because he doesn’t want a relationship and it’s “complicated”. But he always wants to kiss and cuddle and hold hands. I really don’t know how to feel anymore.

Instead, when no one was around he would tell me to pull down my pants and would touch my vagina. He also made me touch him and tried to have sex with me, but it was very painful so he never actually got it in all the way. I was young and didn’t know any better, so I didn’t stop him or tell anyone about it. This went on for years until we moved.

Then when I was maybe 11 or 12 as my body was changing and my hormones were haywire, I did the same thing to three different young boys. I touched them innapropriately and dry-humped with one boy that was maybe only 6 years old at the time. Now as a 27 year old, the guilt is killing me. I feel like I robbed these boys of their innocence like my molester robbed me of mine. I haven’t been able to move on with my life because of the guilt that I carry. 

I’ve never ever told anyone about this. I don’t know what to do. What is done is unfortunately done, and as much as I wish I could go in the past and prevent me from molesting these boys, it’s just never going to happen. How can I cope with this pain and guilt? ",04Oct2018,1

148,"Hi all. 
In May 2018 I moved to New Jersey for a few months for an internship type deal. I had to take a plane there (so I live a long ways from NJ, but still in the US.) I was scheduled to fly home around August 11th, but early/mid July I started getting so homesick that I was having mini meltdowns several times a week. By the time I went home it had escalated to several a day. 

What really made me ‘break’ was when I was alone in the staff house and I called my parents, who were in the car with my older brother driving to go get food together. They had me on speakerphone and were laughing and having fun together. I started crying and said that I couldn’t stand being in NJ when they were in (home state) and that I wanted to be in the car with them. That night, my parents managed to change my flight and I came home about two weeks early. (I still start crying when I think about how I felt while I was separated from them and am tearing up right now)

I thought I was fine, but the other day my parents went to run errands and grocery shop and I walked to my local library to use their WiFi. About 2 hours into this I started freaking out and I called my parents and was crying from how lonely I was, which is... really weird for me. It’s not like they were a plane ride away this time, they were just in the town over getting milk... 

As the title says, I had previously been excited to get some independence and start being a young adult. For the first month and a half, I was like “Yes! This is amazing!” before starting to get really depressed. It’s been several months but I’m still really clingy with my parents and I don’t like them leaving for long periods of time. The other day my dad even asked if I would be okay if he went to the office to work for a bit. Like... yes? it’s your job, please feel free?? but then I know I’ve probably been freaking them out with the 180 I pulled. 

Does my brain think that the time I spent in NJ was traumatic? (not the first half when I was fine but the second half.) I don’t feel like it should be, but I was really really sad pretty constantly. Whenever I wasn’t with any of the other staff I’d start having a meltdown, like I couldn’t handle being alone. I’ve never been like that before and I actually used to really value and enjoy my alone time. Did it give me separation anxiety? How do I not have that? 

I know it’s a good thing to love/ be attached to one’s parents but I’d like to be able to be alone and not have a meltdown. ",04Oct2018,1

When she got the job we went out for lunch and hang out a few times. A lot of people at work know the backstory that we were friends from way back.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, so I work a standard 9-5 corporate job, am a senior staff member, and have been at the company for over a decade. She came in a few ranks higher than me - upper management - and our roles/teams don't really work together so we don't have any interaction on the job. But still, just due to the fact that I know a lot of people at work, news reached me that apparently, some people who she does interact with at work don't really like her attitude and work style. They feel it's too aggressive and bossy/pushy wheras our company culture and atmosphere is relatively relaxed and less toxic than your typical corporate setup. When this news reached me, it came with sort of a joking plea to maybe tell my friend to take it easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I mediate this? Do I tell her something? Because my kneejerk reaction is that how she approaches her job is her strategy and that she know's what she's doing and I don't want to mess with her mojo. I don't want the lines between our personal relationship and professional relationship to overlap like that. Yet on the other hand, I'm thinking that me being an ""old timer"" in this company, maybe the advice on how to go about and carry yourself in the company might help and be appreciated.

Well she wouldnt let it go i have lost could how many times shes told me what i wrote was the funniest thing, like dead ass serious too. Side note she often looks me like dead in the eyes and is smiling all the time when i talk to her? And often complements me on what im wearing. Just the other day in class i made a subtle joke in class when the teacher asked a question (i mostly just wanted to cheer the teacher up mostly cus nobody wanted to say anything) BUT this girl laughed like it was the best thing shes heard all week not a single other people even chuckled. Later that day she constantly reminded me how funny it was. Truth is i forgot what the joke was. Than again a lot of people think im funny and i get great joy from making people laugh.

In the end of things weve mostly only talked inclass maybe went for coffee a few times. Shes really peppy like always wanting to talk

Our relationship was good, we never fought, we had similar interests and we talked to each other very frequently, and that has made me doubt that she wanted to end our relationship due to the distance.

During our last week of dating, my closest friend ignored me out of the blue which made me experience apathy/depression and I think she was just tired of dealing with me, and I think that’s why she wanted to end things but disguised it as a different reason so my feelings wouldn’t be hurt.

We decided to stay friends but I feel like she’s ignoring my texts and just avoiding any contact with me. I haven’t talked to her about how I’ve felt yet either.

I don’t have many friends irl due to all my current ones went to separate colleges so I can’t just take my mind off things with them, and I get lonely very easily.

161,"[WARNING : BREIF GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF A WOUND]

I previously worked at a uniform clothing store and the owner screwed me and my friend out of pay. He left on a two week vacations to Hong Kong and took me off the schedule so he could afford it. Told me to call him when he got back. I didn’t want to but I did and he never got back to me and now this. 

I work with a family owned business laying hardwood flooring, I’ve been working there for 5 weeks now and it was a really cool and chill environment. The company is ran by the father and his two sons. For now let’s just say son #1 and son #2. 
Just earlier today we were at a job site with a crew of 4 our lead was son # 1. Son #1 was showing me and my coworker “James” how to fix a certain issue with the flooring meanwhile “rick” was cutting a board. 
“Rick ended up cutting his hand on the table saw, it pretty much cut through his pinky joint and I guess his finger was hanging on by what was left of the tissue and skin on the back of her hand. He came running in shouting, “I need to go to the hospital, I can’t feel my fingers help, I don’t have insurance” he was freaking out bleeding all over the floor. 

Son #1 jumped up we made him put pressure on the wound and they took off to the ER. Later the owner “the father” and Son #2 showed up. The blood had soaked into the wood so I had to sand it out while they cleaned up other messes. After we packed up they told us that OSHA was coming to investigate tomorrow and the father told us “if we don’t know what happened, say you didn’t see what happened. And if they ask if there was protective guards, say yes” but there aren’t protective guards. He asked us to lie. “James” rode back to the yard with the father and talked more with him while I just drove home, he told me that he asked what he should say when they ask about the guards and he now said “say what you want”. 

I don’t want this to turn into legal issues and I’m definitely not going to lie about it. I’m just worried about the situation and it’s given me anxiety. I don’t think it was cool of him to put me and my coworker in this position.

162," Hey y'all. I'm a new community college student, and as title states, I'm conflicted about it.

I've had major depression and anxiety for most of my life, and it's sucked away a lot of my intelligence and soul. I have a very hard time focusing  on studying and getting up in the morning is a real struggle for me. A lot has gone downhill in the past few years, and after all the therapy possible I've just accepted that I'm like this now.

So that brings us to college - I've been doing 5 classes for a little over a month now, and I'm already burned out. I don't think I can do this  for 2 years, and my parents expect me to transfer to a 4 year too, which I already know is impossible (though they won't accept it). I know that getting a degree is important because money and jobs but I don't have any big dreams and aspirations. If I could live off a minimum wage job I would gladly. I'm not even confident in my major - I just picked the most interesting one so my parents thought I was going somewhere in life. It was fun at first, sure, but depression always wins in the end.  I've started skipping class and based on high school experience, it only gets worse.

So one option is dropping out. This semester was free because of grants, and I paid for my books myself, so I don't owe my parents anything - but I'd probably still have to go behind their backs. And then getting a job with my anxiety will be tough, but I have literally a huge folder full of resources for  getting a job and resume building and everything. I feel that actually getting money from a job would help motivate me more in getting out of  bed. Depending on that money would sure help. It might sound crazy, but I  wish I was fully dependent on needing a job so I actually had compelling reasons to live my life other than ""My parents want you to do this"" and ""think of the long term"". How can I think about the future  when I want to cut my life short? It won't matter if I really end up offing myself.

So am I just being lazy?  Should I tough out this whole college thing? Or try to move forward: learning how to drive (a big stressor for me), getting a job, all of that. Working on some personal goals too. I can only do one at a time without exploding with stress, and I can feel it: I'm starting to reach the edge with college.",04Oct2018,1

When I am in one state of mind, I have trouble remebering things I did while in another state. Not full amnesia, just like the memories are harder to access and it feels like I am recalling something that happened to another person.

This quirk of my personality causes some wierd effects. I have totally bombed academic tests I shouldnt have becuase I was in C instead of A. 

I have had things happen where I flirt with someone I like in one state, get their number and then discard it when I enter into another state of mind.

I married who I thought was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I’m 19 fucking years old. I’m the stupidest ever. 

Awhile after being married I just... stopped loving him. He wasn’t the person for me. He didn’t have a job and can’t drive, he was doing very little to support me. He would claim he would do anything to help me succeed but when I tried helping him with school or whatever he said he needed help with, he never did anything about it. He is my best friend and I love him in that sense, but he’s not the person. We argue almost every time we hang out and we drive each other nuts and that’s not what either of us want. 

It’s been months since we stopped “being together” but we stayed married because I’m too ashamed to tell anyone. The only other reason is to help me get through school. My family makes too much for financial aid but not enough to provide me any money for school. My dad should have retired almost 10 year ago and my youngest sibling is only 11. 

I have a job and I’m saving money for school, but if we divorce the only way I’ll afford it is taking out loans and I don’t even know if it’s worth it at that point. 

He doesn’t care if we stayed married but I know he does. I don’t want to be a douche and stay married for my own benefit since he doesn’t plan on going to school himself, but I won’t be able to afford it if we divorce. 

On top of it there’s this stupid guy I like and he likes me but I’m too afraid to do anything because I’m married. 

I made such a stupid mistake getting married. My mom had asked about a month before the wedding if I had any second thoughts and I said no because I was too embarrassed. I thought I was too deep. I didn’t want to disappoint anyone. I wish I hadn’t been stupid and told her I wasn’t sure.

178,"Ok. This is going to be long. Hear me out, if you can bear it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was hired at this place a couple months ago. It's a third party medical billing company. I'm a medical biller and coder, went to school for it and am certified. The job i had before was good, but it was low pay. I was there for over a year. I interviewed for the place I'm currently at a couple months ago and was hired with a good wage increase so I took it. However, since starting there, there have been some huge red flags and I'm thinking of walking off the job. I'll list them out

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Training was for two weeks at four hours a day. I was doing half days. I was also hired on with another girl. Training was fine, I was having no problems and wasn't nervous or thinking about ""how tough training was"" when I would leave for the day. For those two weeks things were going pretty smoothly and the people who were training me did not give me any negative feedback about the things I was learning for the first time when I did them. On the last day of training, I was in a room alone, working on training materials when the owner of the company ( this place is small, only has about 30 employees) and my manager walk in, shut the door, and sit down at the table I was at. This was unexpected and I told my manager about what I had been doing so she could review my work. She interrupted me and said "" \[Owners name\] has something to talk to you about."" Well that really set me on an anxiety trip. He basically said that I was not up to their expectations and they were worried about the client I would be billing, would be billed/worked wrong and everything would get screwed up. I was caught off guard by this and politely spoke that they should let me work the client for a week or so and if they still felt I wasn't good enough then I could stay in training. They didn't like this idea, and after me basically fighting for my job and a chance to prove to them that I was capable, they said they were keeping me in training part time until they felt I was able to work a client confidently. I was at a loss by this decision. They weren't willing to even give me a chance. So they put me part time for a month doing menial work, (answering phones, going through mail, etc.) NOTHING that pertained to the position I was hired as ( medical biller). This lasted for about a month.

2. After about a month of this the manager pulls me into her office. She tells me they are finally making me full time. But as a collection caller... not as a medical biller. And also, the collection calls I would be making are for patients who owe big time on their accounts, I'm talking like $12k and over. I told her I was certified in medical billing and coding and that is what I was hired originally as at this company. She said ""eventually we will let you do some medical billing, probably around December."" This was a slap in the face to me. So now my eight hour shifts are all day calling people asking them to make a payment or set up a payment plan. Usually these people argue or yell and it's just headache after headache. I do not enjoy it one bit.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The girl I got hired with has been going through a lot personally lately. Because of this and other personal reasons she put in her two weeks notice last Monday because she felt she couldn't give the job the right attention. About 30 minutes she gave her notice to management she gets an email from them. It said (I'm paraphrasing) that they no longer needed her there and that they were terminating her that same day, to pack up her belongings from her desk and leave. This shocked her understandably and she left crying. I think she just left because she was going through so much and management was not treating her well at all ( more on that later). It really shook me to, and I took a small break soon after to call her and see if she was alright and talk about what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

4. After my friend gets fired basically, the owner calls her asking her to come back. This doesn't make sense to me or her, as my friend found out the owner told management to send the email terminating her. She also said she texted the assistant manager asking why she was just let go, and why she couldn't work two more weeks, and the assistant manager texted her a snarky reply back along the lines of "" you weren't fired, you put in your notice via email this morning."" The professional way to handle these things is to usually let the employee work the last two weeks. This was a huge red flag when it happened a couple days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

5. About a week before the above event, an older woman who works as a medical biller there and had been for a while was told by management that she wasn't going to be a medical biller anymore. Management told her they were switching her to collection calls. She asked why and stated she had been doing medical billing there for a while, and that she didn't want to be a collection caller, why change positions? Management then said (paraphrasing), "" well if you don't like it, you can go ahead and give your notice."" She then went to the owner to fight for her medical billing position. I hear her do collection calls now, but I know she doesn't do it all day like I have to. This was a red flag to me.

&amp;#x200B;

6. They hired a woman about 4 weeks after I started my ""part time training"" position, who lives two hours away and works at home. This is confusing, as I was told when I began after two years of working there you would be eligible to work at home. Come to find out this woman is working the client I was suppose to work. If they were so worried about the client being worked correctly, why are they having a new hire work it at home with no supervision?

&amp;#x200B;

7. The place is in an old building, in an industrial part of town. There is one other office in this building, I'm not sure what the other office provides services for, and the rest of the building is a car garage where old cars are worked on. There is even an old shipping dock attached to the building, so one can figure out that obviously this building was once used for something else. I know this doesn't make much of a difference, but this is a medical billing office. Why isn't this located at least in a more ""local business"" part of town, or better yet in a medical office business park? The place doesn't even have a sign out front.

&amp;#x200B;

8. For me, it's a 45 minute drive to work, on a good day if traffic runs smooth with no accidents or so many cars piling on the freeway. It's about an hour back facing traffic. 

&amp;#x200B;

9. Management is all women. Which is fine. But there is a click there. I stay out of clicks and actually prefer to be alone. If I have a couple good people to talk to at work about questions or to joke around with, that's fine enough for me. But this place seems to have a click, and  if you are not in that click, well good luck. And the click is management and the other young girls who want to be in management. 

&amp;#x200B;

10. This one is the most disturbing. The other day I was asking one of the few people I trust there to watch me credit back a patient who paid to much on what they owed, as I was checking to see if I needed to call them for a payment. That's when I saw that they had overpaid. Obviously we need to refund them if they over paid. So I asked my colleague to watch me issue a refund and to make sure I was doing it correctly since this part of the system I didn't work to much. She looked at me and told me not to even bother. Confused I asked why, and she said, ""we don't do that here."" I looked at her puzzled, "" We don't issue refunds?"" I asked. She shook her head 'no'. I was perplexed to say the least, "" But that's illegal."" I said. She shook her head 'yes'. This... appalled me. So I then and got another colleague that does collections over to my desk and the both of them were now at my desk. I asked the other colleague, "" Look, this patient overpaid, we owe them this amount... we need to issue a refund, right?"" She looked at me and said, "" Unless the patient knows they overpaid, and calls in and asks for a refund, we don't touch those credits."" This was getting absurd. I said, "" So the money just sits there until the company can collect it? And no one notifies the patient?"" She didn't say anything but, "" Sorry to ruin your day."" I mean.... this was just crazy to learn. Even now I am disturbed by this unethical practice. I am thinking of going to the state anonymously and reporting it, because that is not right at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the reasons I can think of right now. If anymore come to mind I will add them, but those are the ones that stick out the most. I am pretty much miserable here and think of the day when I can just walk off. I had an interview for an actual doctors office a few days ago that went well and another interview at the same place today that also went well. I am expecting to hear back from them. My question is.... should I walk off this job? Is this place really worth the drive, the drama, the poor treatment, the unethical practices??? I know most people will say wait until you officially have something lined up, but given the experiences I have listed above in the 2 months I have worked there, what would you do? ",04Oct2018,1
179,"So my best friend who is in a relationship with this guy who straight up just emotionally abuses her wants to have a baby with him, he too wants a baby.

So basically she’s extremely in love with him to the point that it’s blinded her, there’s absolutely nothing her sister or I can do to make her see sense. there are my concerns 

-He will drain her emotionally and financially

-They’re both addicted to weed (I don’t have an issue with smoking weed here and there but her addiction has caused her to put the weed before her family/friends). 

-They’re getting into other drugs such as LSD and shrooms

-She is in a bad place mentally and has a mental health issue preventing her from getting work and is currently stuck trying to get financial assistance

-He is working a job that pays shit and when he’s spent most of his money on drugs he will use the little money she has

-Her family are not helping at all, they’re a detriment to her mental health and are sharks for drama

-The Guy is the fucking devil, he knows exactly how to pull her in before chewing her up and spitting her out, then rinse and repeat, she’s even admitted on multiple occasions how shitty he is but as soon as he shows her slight affection she will forget everything. I’m worried that he will either start treating the child like shit or just leave her after he gets her pregnant. 

I know what I have to do legally if they do actually have a child, but she’s my best friend, a sister to me and I just want this asshole out of her life before something dangerous happens. I’m in a corner though because of her “I can fix him” mentality.

180,"I was on track to graduate last spring and took an amazing job that started this summer. I moved halfway across the U.S. for it and then found out I failed two required classes.

I obviously didn't plan on failing these classes, and didn't know how bad my grades were until they were posted after graduation.

I am feeling very confused because, while I genuinely care for her, I constantly feel like I want to be talking to other people, meeting new woman, and exploring new things.

I find it very difficult to stop myself (and I don't do this, I won't, it's just an urge) from getting Tinder/Bumble etc so that I can meet new people.

I guess I am just confused, because one moment I feel like I'm in love with her, and the next I feel like I need to end it because it's just not working for me anymore. Then sometimes I also wonder if open relationships are what I need. I get myself into this rabbit hole and it gives me terrible anxiety.

184,"I’m moving to another state in less than 2 weeks with my boyfriend.. it’s very exciting and I’m happy he’s willing to pay for rent as I look for a job, and I get to bring my dog with me..


For one, I haven’t found one. I focus mainly on customer service and sales since that’s really my only background. Currently employed and I have recruiting experience but it turns out it’s not even recruiting, it’s more of sales and advertising. I’ve had several recruiters call me for a recruiter position I applied for and I’m just not the good fit due to my experience.

I have a bachelors degree, I have 3 years of extensive customer service and 1 year of project management experience... how the hell is it so hard for me to find one? I figured me being physically up there works? But I’m so lost and I’m going to another state with no job lined up. Many have told me it’s easy to find one up there till I get a stable job, but it’s just customer service.. usually with that the pay isn’t great regardless ;( 

I just feel so lost and alone in all this. It’s exciting to be with my boyfriend and not have to worry about rent, but I do have my own bills to pay and what if I still can’t find anything by then? I have $3500 right now which would go down to $2800 due to my stupid car payment and that can hold me for about 2 months of my bills paid. I’m just afraid I won’t find anything by then and might come back home to my parents... not that it’s a bad thing but I’ll just feel like a failure.

Me and this girl, have met last February and quickly became quite close. We hanged out a lot and quickly after that we started dating. Things seemed to be going great but she didn't seem to share the same opinion and she broke up with me after a short while. After that we just agreed to be friends.

I kept pushing her, constantly kept being near her, still talked to her everyday and really just tried to fix things and get us back together. I was making her uncomfortable but I haven't seen that clearly since my head was still wrapped around trying to get us to be back together. Then we skip to June, where things start to get a bit shaky, She just simply stops responding to my messages, but still keeps talking to me around uni and when we hang out. I ask her what's up and she says that she just wants me to start hoping that we will be back together and that her ignoring me was an attempt to ""push me away"".

199,"So real quick few things about me. I am incredibly introverted, secretive, and overall dont open up to people, bottling up emotions, being as quiet as possible, etc. I've been like this for 7+ years (I am a 20 year old male). The one exception was my dog. I initially got him around age 9 to be a service dog (I have minor autism). I am guessing he ended up being more of a therapy dog with anxiety/depression. He was the best thing to ever happen to me. This dog ended up being my best friend. You have probably heard the whole mans best friend stuff. I legitimately mean that I trusted this dog more than my mother, more than family, more than any other human being ever. A lot of my emotions to other people feel empty now compared to my love for this dog. The thing is he died a year ago today. More and more recently I have been having episodes of extreme sadness. A picture, or a comment that leads my thoughts in his direction makes me miss him all over again. It is starting to happen every other week or so. It is bad enough that I need to find somewhere to be alone so I can just cry until i get it under controll again.

I don't really know where to post this, but just about 12 hours ago I asked my crush out. who I'll call Cassie. My 14th birthday is coming up and I was going to go to Dave and Busters for the occasion. I told she was invited to come if she wanted to. To my surprise, she said she did. Now, I was being awfully pessimistic the rest of the day, just waiting for something to bring it all crashing down, because nothing good like that happens without a bad thing to even it out.

**Several** things didn't go to plan now that I'm thinking about it. For one, I said that I'd also invite her best friend Ashley over. I'm friends with my crush and Ashley, but she doesn't go to my school anymore so the chance either of us see her is pretty low. I think I only told Cassie that Ashley was also going to convince her to go well (Yes I'm a terrible person). I did this for several reasons; for one, I didn't have a crush on Ashley, even though I used to, now I liked her best friend Cassie. And two, they would probably spend all of their time talking to each other. Call me starved for attention, but if I'm inviting my crush to my birthday I want to spend some time with her.

I also said that I would E-Mail Cassie the invitation and say I'd pay for her. Dave and Busters is really expensive and I know her family has money issues, so I'd be willing to basically give it to her for free if she'd go. Not to mention **her parents are probably going to go as well, which I'll meet for the first time**. I also said I'd E-Mail Ashley one as well, I have both of their addresses for Gmail but as I said, I only told Cassie I'd invite Ashley to convince her to go. I don't want to invite Ashley, I don't like her anymore, I like Cassie.

The main thing I fucked up though, is I forgot to tell her something. My grandparents will be there. My grandma is alright, but it's my grandfather I am worried about. I'm not exaggerating when I say he's 400 pounds. It's nearly impossible for him to get up, he can't move around, he has trouble getting in and out of car doors and restaurant seats. And he has aspergers, so since Cassie would've never met him before, I'm sure the way he tries to talk would creep her out. I'm used to it myself, but I'm worried about my crush not liking him because of his weight and mental disability. Overall, it would be quite embarrassing to have my grandfather there, honestly. I don't want Cassie, the girl I absolutely love, to see my family and dislike anyone because of it. So now I'm stuck in the dilemma - should I convince Cassie to not go (since revoking the invitation isn't really an option), or manage to get my grandparents to not go. I don't want to be a dick to either of them, but it seems like I'll have to.

Can someone help me out?

**Tl;dr** - I invited my crush Cassie to my Birthday party at Dave and Busters, asking her out went okay and she said yes. But I screwed up more than one part - I straight up lied to her, **saying her best friend Ashley would be there as well**. I wont invite Ashley, I just told Cassie that to convince her to go. **I forgot to E-mail her the invitation** or tell her the address. Mainly, **I forgot to tell her my grandparents would be there.** I'm most worried about her meeting my grandpa, as he's disabled and cannot take care of himself. He's 400 pounds, has aspergers, and lacks the ability to shave so he has a good 10+ years of neckbeard on him. I love him but I don't want him to scare Cassie away (he can't help it). So not only did I never tell her my grandparents would be there in the first place, I also never told her that my grandpa was super fat and disabled.

204,"I am stuck on my choice between two study abroad programs. This is incredibly long, but if you have the time, please read and give me your opinion. If you're going to be annoyed by the length and my indecisiveness just don't read lol.The two most important things to me while studying abroad: will I get to have fun at a reasonable price? (nightlife and partying), will I be able to find others to travel around Europe with and will it be easy and affordable to do so?

1. CIEE Open CampusThis program is a third party instead of direct enrollment. I get to design my experience. I am planning on spending 12 weeks in London, but I am not sure what to do with the other 6 weeks! I dont know if I'd stay in London or go to Italy, France, or south Africa. This program is really appealing because it's in London! Also there is more support with this program, I won't have to worry about too much and I am a pretty nervous person. This seems great but I'm afraid I'm not pushing myself. I'm going to list out the pros and cons.Pros: London!, support, I'm going to be with other Americans who will most likely be more willing to travel, overall program cost would be cheaper, traveling is easy and cheaper from London, I can complete an internship,Cons: London is expensive!, not pushing myself out of my comfort zone, will only get to befriend Americans, due to the block set up it won't feel as homey as an exchange, missing out on a uni experienceWill not studying at a university be less appealing in the professional sense?My biggest pro is it's in London, a city I have always dreamed of living in and I feel there is so much less worry associated with this optionMy biggest con is that I might be missing out by not going to a University (can I still get the same authentic student experience (social scene wise?)

I honestly really want to party and have amazing nights out during my time abroad. Will I do be able to do that in London? Especially if I'm not attending a university?

This seems like the smarter choice in a lot of ways because it eliminates a chunk of stress and also there are more scholarships available through CIEE.

2. University of ManchesterMy second program choice is spending 4 months at the Uni of Manchester. At first, i was hesitant because I really wanted to live in London, but through research it seems that Manchester is really amazing too. There seems to be so much life and it seems as good as London in most ways. I am going to list the pros and consPros: a true university experience, great city, more affordable cost of living, prestigious school, nightlife is amazingCons: I think it will be hard to find people to travel around Europe with since they will mostly be locals who aren't always down for a weekend trip, program cost is more expensive, have to do a lot of things on my own, weather is so different from the west coastMy biggest pro is that I would be getting a true university experience. Manchester, from what I've heard, is amazing for partygoers.My biggest con is that I think it might be more difficult for me to find others to travel around Europe with and it's more expensive to fly out of Manchester

I would really like to go to Manchester (for the nightlife and true college atmosphere) but I just don't know. It seems like the dumber choice because I would probably have to take out loans to attend.

I don't know and it's really stressing me out. I will likely only be able to do this once, so i have to make the right choice. There is no wrong choice, but there is a better choice. What would you do?",04Oct2018,1
206,"Hey Reddit

  My “highschool sweetheart” and I reconnected when I was 21. We had been friends but had both been in +3yr long relationships, so we didn’t speak often before this time. When u tuned 21 we began dating seriously, seeing each other most of the week and sharing certain finances. 

He began having some issues with his personal life (I had before we got together so I was sympathetic.. I personally got help &amp; I am general O.K. most days.. no crazy issues) and this started to effect him significantly. There were 2 family crises in the span of about 3 days that he had to deal with, and he began treating the aftershock of these with anti anxiety pills. He began abusing them &amp; our relationship ended. 

While high on pills he calls my parents and asks for money (to pay back my half of the bills he had paid that month), then insulted them when told he can’t get any. My father ended up going to his mothers house (she lived close by) and left $100 there. He came home and told me never to speak to him again. 

I have been absolutely distraught the past almost year since. This week I finally decided to speak with him (he had messaged me a few times over the months...) I hadn’t heard from him in a bit so I wondered what was going on. He is off of the drugs and really trying to get his life straight. Things seem normal.

I know this is crazy sounding, but he is the honest love of my life! I have never met someone who compliments me so well and makes me feel so confident. I can tell he really feels bad about what happened and he was NOT himself while on the drugs. If he proves to me he can stay clean (and I would like to attend joint therapy) I really would like to be back together with him again.... but I don’t know how to even begin the “forgiveness” process with my parents. 
Maybe someone can make some suggestions?! ",04Oct2018,1
207,"This is kind of an extreme thing to say. I've been at my current job a year now. I work in an office setting where we work with community partners once a month or so. I basically have to work with the 2 partners (different organizations) the most due to it being one of my job duties which is fine. I have no problems working with 1 partner, but the other is a nightmare (let's call her Mary). I feel like she is deliberately try to mess things up at work for me and I 100% have no idea why. It has been like this since the day she met me which was only for a few minutes. The only thing I could think of is that it's because I'm white. She is a POC and is cool with everyone else who is a POC(I'm the only white one in my office...yes I know odd). Mary avoids as much interaction with me as she can, even through emails. 

Off hand here have been some situations (that I can remember):
1. first meeting-basic introduced myself, looking forward to working with you...already acted like she hated me

2. My boss told me that I need to go over this binder with verification things that Mary needs to do to help us improve our numbers. I went over it with her (completely in a non threatening, sensitive, mindful way). One of my coworkers who had worked with her in the past watched our interactions. She was surprised I had to go over the binder with her because had worked with it already for months. 

3. My boss called me and 2 coworkers in and said that our numbers were lacking with this assignment. It largely is supposed to be a reflection off of me. My boss was well aware that Mary has been no shows on days that she is supposed to come in. I told her I've been emailing Mary to keep in contact with her. My coworker (the one from earlier) helped me out when she saw that it looked like my boss was pinning this all on me, by saying ""I was there when DarkParadise explained it to Mary. Mary acted like she had never seen the binder before and like this was all new to her"". My boss didn't really say anything. 

4. When Mary would come, she would come in without checking in with me (which she is supposed to do) but somehow still be at work extremely late. I wouldn't even know she was there until she returns the binder. 

5. (weeks later) Mary dropped by to talk to my boss who apparently she really likes. When I saw her, I was polite and friendly but she wasn't having it. 

6. Shortly after that, my boss told me I need to email Mary to see a schedule up with her for the next 6 months. I asked Mary her availability and she gave me a number of days...she didn't indicate times. I emailed her days and times to confirm that those days would still be available and if those times work for her. I didn't hear anything for maybe 4 or 5 days...

7. My boss got angry at me for not having a schedule lined up. I emailed Mary again saying that we really need to confirm asap. She emails me saying that there was no attachment(there was...I saw my sent box, and my boss was cc'ed on it and saw it herself). I email it to her again and copy and paste the attachment within the body of the email as well so there would be no ""confusion"". Again don't hear anything back and boss is getting frustrated with me. As we speak, I have to go through an evaluation process (we have to do this every other year) so I'm walking on eggshells and this doesn't look good. I told my boss that I could use advice with working with Mary and that I have made various attempts to get confirmation from her. My boss (who Mary likes) called her and left a message for her as I was in her office saying that we need dates and times confirmed asap and that she needs to contact me. 

8. Mary immediately calls....Not me, but my boss. My boss told her that she needs to call me. Mary tells my boss that she cannot call me and that I need to call her (????). 

9. I call her. Mary backtracks everything. She said she didn't receive an attachment. I told her that I sent it to her again along with including the dates within the email. Her answer was she confirmed already with my boss... She backtracks again then saying something like  "" You and I already confirmed the dates and times when I told you my availability"". I played stupid and said why don't we verify the dates and times and she agreed. Out of the 10 dates and times, she then tells me that 3 have already been filled (the one she ""confirmed"" with me awhile ago....). I told her that I will email her replacement dates/times. She says to text her instead (in which I'm uncomfortable with but did). 

10. Along with this, one of her coworkers comes to do the same thing she does but on opposite days. Awhile ago I asked her if she could give me their contact information and she said they didn't have anyone for it. She later texts me really specific odd dates/and times and that she needs to know within the hour (which I know was just to be an asshole). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've kept documentation of everything, but is there anything else I can do? I cc my boss on every email since my boss was aware that Mary was difficult. Again my boss is well aware of how Mary is and appears to believe me that Mary is playing games with me. I cannot help, but believe that the more Mary fucks this up though, that my boss will put the blame on me for this. My boss is an asshole herself, but doesn't sabotage me and at times is supportive. 

I'm very close to telling my boss that I think she avoids me due to my race, but obviously I have no proof of this. If I knew Mary's boss I think speaking to them might help, but I don't and I know my boss would be pissed if I went over her to contact Mary's boss.

208,"So imma try keep this short. I don’t like my school, it’s a Christian school and I know I should feel grateful for being in a private school but I’m so unhappy I don’t know what to do. I get bullied there and if I even think about going there another year I want to cry. And the education is around the same as my local public high school so I don’t know why my dad won’t let me leave. 

He was in a bad mood today and he asked me about saber night(this was an event I went to with my friends at the school I want to go to) he got mad because I didn’t invite him and called me stupid and ungrateful. Then he asked me why I didn’t want to keep going to my school and I said because people are just so mean there and I just don’t know how to deal with it anymore. In response he said I was weak and I deserve to be bullied because it’s probably my fault anyway for being “fresh” which I don’t think I am, I try and treat everyone with respect because I know how it feels to have people hurt you for the fun of it. He then threatened to go and “talk” to my mom, this scared the shit out of me because he was abusive to her and the last thing I want is for her to suffer.

213,"Hey guys, please be light on me. Even if there seems to be an “obvious” answer, which is, “who cares, fuck them all, you’ll make new friends, etc.” I’m really stumped. I don’t want to lose a bunch of friends because me and this person just don’t see eye to eye, and I personally find them very... narcissistic. 

I have these friends. I’ve known them for 4+ years. They introduced me to a friend that they’ve known for like 10 years. I recently found I had a lot in common (hobby wise mostly) with this person and we decided to try and play games together. We got pretty close at first. I started realizing this person is very very much a downer. I don’t mind talking to people, having people vent to me, etc. but this person is CONSTANTLY being extremely negative and brings me down with her constant negativity. Like, to the point where I will talk about something pleasant that’ll happen to me, like “I had a good day today, I went out and did something fun after being holed up in my house for a few months because depression,” etc. and instead of just being like cool good for you! She’ll say something kind of backhanded and escalate it like I’m trying to rub it in her face like “wow at least you CAN do that, I’m so fucking depressed I want to kill myself.” and make me feel terrible about bringing up small accomplishments in my life that I’d like to talk about with a friend. 

Let’s call her Lola. a (different) friend, let’s call him Peter, posted a web article in my discord server about a “male e-sports player that was caught pretending to be a woman and joining an “all women’s e-sports team.” Lola was telling me to tell Peter off and called him transphobic for posting that article. (Lola is transgender male to female) and I didn’t really want to do that, because I don’t really find it insensitive. My friend isn’t the kind of person that would post that meaning to be offensive, he just found it funny? It was vague but she chose to get EXTREMELY offended by it. I told her i’d talk to him and tell him not to post stuff that hurts her feelings. Lola got extremely pissed off at me and told me to tell him he was fucked up and make him feel terrible for posting the article in the first place, and not to “make her look like a drama queen” by asking him not to post it because she’s sensitive about stuff like that. It was really strange, where is it my business to police the way someone views identity politics over this? It was embarrassing, and definitely not really my place to be offended for someone, and she got mad at me for it. 

After that, it seemed like things were only getting worse. I invited my best friend of 16 years to play games with us let’s call him Rob. Rob is on the spectrum and has no other friends but me. Lola does not like Rob, because he rages a little bit when we play games. And it’s never AT anyone, he just rages in general and gets mad about losing and stuff, and he never blames anyone. Lola kept telling me she feels left out whenever we play since we’ve known each other too long, basically asks me to stop talking to him and talk to her more. I can’t abandon my friend who already has crippling mental illnesses because my other friend doesn’t like that we’ve known each other longer. When I kindly explained my situation, it seemed like she no longer wanted to talk to me anymore. I invited her to play with us, she says “yeah sure in a bit!” Quickly logs on and plays without me and doesn’t tell me, and the moment I acknowledge it she says, “I’ll play in a bit, taking a break” and never replies. When I see her online she says “ohhhh we’re getting off now sorry.” And then logs off immediately. I can take a hint, but just because it’s an obvious hint, doesn’t mean it hurts any less. It’s obvious she probably doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, I don’t know why, I don’t know what to do. Thinking about it stresses me out because I know Lola is the type to run her mouth and tell everyone EVERYTHING and also over exaggerate and twist stories in her favor. She’s done it to her other “closest friends” that she’s known much much longer, I have no doubt that she does it to me too. I’m not really comfortable with the thought that she’s telling the friends mentioned in the beginning that I’m a terrible, horrible person. That really sucks. Am I making any sense? Any help? Please.

She followed me on insta and I just ignored it. Days passed and 2 days ago she asked if it was okay to follow me on Insta and why did I just ignore her. Again I told her thats its not right and stuff, She just nods her head. Yesterday she saw me smoking and asked for a lighter, She smokes too. Gave her and then she started asking me if im in a relationship or have  any crushes, then started showing me videos of her sister and her dancing and some weird videos of people moaning in puplic in a funny way I just laugh and try to act not concerned, She then tried to hug me and played with my hair. WTF right? HAHA.. I just acted normal and didn't hug her back and it was cringe. Well this friend of mine knows that we go to tutor together so I tell him every single thing happened between me and his Ex everyday cause I don't want him to know from someone else and think that im into her. So this friend told me yesterday to tell her that what shes doing is wrong and that she should stop and we shouldn't talk to each other again. I find it childish to say that to a girl .. Thats what I told him. Then he followed by saying ""Make out with her next time then its okay""

Not sure what to do. I'm not into the girl and don't want her to really think that there's a chance that we date or anything, Cause I value my friendship and think thats never right to date a friend's ex. Yet i don't want to be a dick or rude to her. Looking for advice from you people here :)

223,"Over the summer I began seeing a girl. We’re both in our early 30s and we’ve really hit it off. We share many of the same interests. Music, movies, video games. We enjoy many of the same foods (I know this seems weird but I’ve had several relationships that neither of us ate the same things so making dinner/ picking a restaurant could be really difficult). Everything was going great until last week. 

Last week she brought me home to meet her parents. She had told me that her parents were super excited to meet me because I made her so happy and that she talked about me so much. That made me happy, but I was still nervous about meeting them. I always get nervous to meet a girl’s family. 

When I got there she introduced me and the family had a good laugh and asked where her bf really was. I was confused and she said that I really am her new bf.  She seemed annoyed and just as shocked as I was. Her parents gave each other a weird/annoyed look. Then her dad said in a very disapproving voice “you’re dating a white boy?”  That stung. 

I guess I should point out my gf is black and I’m white.  I never thought this would be an issue. I figured at worst maybe her dad would be over protective of his daughter. I’ve dealt with that in the past. I’ve never dealt with my skin color being a problem (this isn’t the first girl I have dated that wasn’t white, heck she’s not even the first black girl). 

The rest of the time there was awkward. We sat in silence eating the dinner her mother made. I had a hard time eating but I made sure to anyway to be polite. At the end of the night she walked me out to my car and apologized. It was a bad night. 

When I got home we texted for a while. She apologized a lot. She also complained that her older brother is married to a white woman, but her parents aren’t okay with her dating a white man.

I don’t know what to do. I really like her and I really want to be with her, but I don’t want to be the cause of any problems between her and her family. ",04Oct2018,1

227,"Me and my ex were together for 1.5 years when we were 13/14 years old. During this time we had sex a lot, sometimes without proper protection. **She told me she was pregnant on two occasions.** Both pregnancies ‘ended’ in some way. She told me later (when I was about 14/15) that one was fake and was a ‘phantom pregnancy’. I was left thinking that the other pregnancy was real.

Now I’m 21 and I realise that I don’t know for sure if her stories of pregnancy were completely fake or not. She was mentally unhealthy and lied to draw in attention and keep me with her. If one of these pregnancies was actually true, and she self aborted like she claimed, I kinda want to know for sure now.

**I’d like to know if I once had an actual baby forming**. It would have just been the ‘bundle of cells’ stage but still. It’s surreal to think about and I’m not sure why I haven’t seriously thought about it before.

We had a rough breakup but we’re good now. She’s engaged and has two kids. I’m in a relationship.

**Would it be ok for me to randomly bring this up with her?** Basically “Hi, just wondering. Were you pregnant during our relationship 0, 1 or 2 times? If one or two, how were the pregnancies terminated?”. Obviously more gently than that, but that’s basically what I want to know. I’d word it in the best way I could.

What do you reckon? Best left to rest? Something that I have the right to know?

233,"So some context, I've worked at the same place for 6 and a bit years now, initially as a receptionist then a kennels assistant and now as a student veterinary nurse (or tech, for you oversees friends), a course I'm 2.5 years into out of 3. I've always had issues in the past with anxiety with occasional panic attacks over some things etc.

The problems:
1. I'm completely miserable at the place I work, have been for over a year, 16 other employees have left in that time - most of the 'good' people &amp; a few closer friends. I find it hard to enjoy work there, understatement probably. The work itself is great, but who doesn't love treating pets? But the rest is pure stress, long hours, massively understaffed &amp; constant CCTV monitoring by management who like to ring the phone you're stood next to &amp; ask why you're not 'doing anything' etc. Pretty toxic.

2. My course is also pretty horrific since I've lost almost all motivation with it, I'm relatively new to the college as my last one shut. Last college was a lot like a school environment but with very small class size, by the time it shut it was just me &amp; another girl in my class, they were very attentive which suited me well as I get easily overwhelmed with assignments and things despite being (maybe) quite good with exams &amp; generally absorbing information.
 New college is the complete opposite where it's very hands off, only get if you ask, and there's no real help given as standard - just lectures &amp; then all self perpetuated re: assignments etc. Naturally I fall at the first hurdle as I'm very timid in new situations, since then it's just been a massive struggle to keep up with new expectations, I fell behind with everything. I know it's solely my error but it just makes me feel even more like this whole thing doesn't suit me. I've talked to one staff member there about how I felt alone with it &amp; that I'm struggling but their answer was to be more proactive in asking for help, which I also struggle to do - haha.

3. Headspace status: the worst it's ever been. I'm in a constant state of stress, working all the time &amp; I feel like I'm being pulled apart by every component of my life running in opposite directions. I've seen doctors before about anxiety, they recommend meds - I've never taken them up on the offer, only therapy sessions. Now I'm thinking 'oh god just make it stop', I've been meaning to make an appointment to ask for some but honestly haven't had any time to, I don't drive &amp; the surgery isn't local, any time away from work I do have I usually spend staring at the wall like I'm just unable to do anything.


I feel like I'm fighting to keep my head above water with the demands of life just making greater currents around me, I know that something has to change for me or I will just wreck everything one way or another very soon. But do I give up on this? I feel like I've given such a giant chunk of my life for the past 6 years to make this goal real &amp; I'm so close, it would be so destructive to just stop. Then I think about how my daydreams are things like breaking my arm or getting hit by a bus to just have some time off from it all, some get out of jail free card to allow some time to calm down from the nightmare...

Anyway, should I quit or not? Any other advice is also very welcome. It's my first time posting in a long while so sorry if I've done it wrong.",04Oct2018,1
235,"I feel really dumb and immature for posting this but I kind of just need to vent. 

We met in high school and were best friends until college. I have never felt a connection with someone outside of my family the way I did with her and I really did think we would be best friends forever, cheesy as it sounds.

She has sort of always been better than me in most ways (prettier, more sociable, stable background/upbringing, etc.) College came, she met new friends who I guess she felt she could identify with more. These girls were pretty similar to her in terms of social status. She tried getting me to hang out with her and them for nights out, but I couldn’t help feeling resentful towards them because I felt like they were taking her away from me and I couldn’t relate to the “frat party-going valley-girl” types that I could see her becoming and idolizing in the form of her new friendships.

Eventually we drifted apart and stopped speaking but still had each other on social media. It’s literally been years since we last talked, but I still creep her once or twice a week. I updated my Facebook so I wouldn’t have to see her posts, I would have to go to her page to see any updates. She is still best friends with the college girls (about 8 years later). We don’t have each other added on Instagram but ive checked out her page on there too - I watched her ‘stories’ not realizing she would get notifications that I watched (super awkward and cringey since she knows I still think about and creep her without having spoken for years).

I really don’t like this bitter feeling I’ve been hanging onto, but I honestly just want to cut her out of my life for good so that I can move on without the constant reminder that she is still doing far better than me. But I am hesitant to do this because 

a) it’d make me look even more butt-hurt blocking and deleting her out of nowhere, especially after she knows I have continued to creep her on social media, and

 b) I feel like this is a life lesson of sorts that I am always going to have to deal with people “better” than me, and attempting to turn a blind eye to them doesn’t necessarily seem realistic or conducive to building good character. 

Losing her friendship has been worse than any breakup I’ve ever endured. Seeing her doing so well without me hurts. It’s literally been YEARS. I need to let it go, but I can’t. ",04Oct2018,1

I just finished my bachelors in psychology. I specialize in research. I graduated with honors after maintaining a decent (3.5 gpa). I wrote a thesis and worked as an undergraduate TA (volunteer) in a neuroscience research lab for 2-3 years. That is what I wrote my thesis on. I worked closely with TA’s and my mentor. 

Psychology is easy, so my gpa is nothing impressive. I was very ill in college, and misses a lot of classes. Had to withdraw a couple times and retake some classes. 

Anyway, despite graduating well...I don’t remember shit. I’m terrified. My memory has always been bad, but I worked in a neuroscience lab and did research. I can’t remember any stats (even after running them for my thesis), parts of the brain, or research methods.  Its depression brain, and genetics. I’ve gone to the doctor, tried various methods and supplements. Nothing helps. 

It comes back quickly with study, but isn’t stored and readily available. 

I still have to find a job as a research assistant and in a couple years apply for a graduate research program. 

I’m really really scared. I don’t think I can even survive even an interview for a research position.

238,"I'm thinking it could be because getting better means getting more socially active and back to work, both of which are the ideal outcomes of treatment obviously.  But since I've been mostly failing most of my adult life due to how bad my back pain was, it's like maybe I'm mentally unsure how to go about reintegrating myself?  The thing is I'm feeling most of the recovery in my neck right now, low back and thoracic are going to take a lot more work, this is also assuming this isn't just my brain having a painkiller response finally making me think I'm getting better (because new treatment) when I'm actually not.  Like I did some bending and that made me get a lot of pain as it has been, the ways I'm feeling better are from some minor things going away I never thought would, and my neck pain for some reason being mostly gone already.

239,"So I adopted a persian kitten in April of this year. I wanted to adopt one for a very, very long time and I had finally persuaded my parents to let me adopt one. At first she was very shy like any other kitten when she goes to a new home, she hid beneath the couch, only come out for food and that kind of stuff. At that time, she was okay with me petting her and picking her up, it did not seem to amuse her one bit but she did not show any signs of retaliation either (assuming because she was not used to me or the house). I would open up the balcony for her and she would go out and watch birds every day, she seemed to be very engrossed in that. I brushed (or combed?) her fur regularly. I'd play with her twice a day, after I got home from school and about an hour before my usual sleep time so that she'd not disturb me at night. I made sure to give her sufficient food and fresh water on time and whenever I didn't, my parents had my back. But now after about 5 months of living here she has started acting up. Now she does not take any interest in watching birds or playing with me. She does not let me pet her and usually retaliates with biting my hand, same with picking her up. She even bites me out of no where, just randomly. I tried everything, giving her more playtime, changing her cat food and back but none of it seems to work. I thought maybe she was fed up of being picked up randomly so I slowed down the interaction, giving her some lone time but that did not help either.

So i go to this tutor that my friends Ex goes to. She talks to me in a friendly way and of course im not going to be a dick just because shes my friends ex. I replay in a friendly way too but i don't start convos. Well some days ago she asked to take a pic with me: i refused and told her that its not right and I respect my friend and He'd not like it. She followed me on insta and I just ignored it. Days passed and 2 days ago she asked if it was okay to follow me on Insta and why did I just ignore her. Again I told her thats its not right and stuff, She just nods her head. Yesterday she saw me smoking and asked for a lighter, She smokes too. Gave her and then she started asking me if im in a relationship or have any crushes, then started showing me videos of her sister and her dancing and some weird videos of people moaning in puplic in a funny way I just laugh and try to act not concerned, She then tried to hug me and played with my hair. WTF right? HAHA.. I just acted normal and didn't hug her back and it was cringe. Well this friend of mine knows that we go to tutor together so I tell him every single thing happened between me and his Ex everyday cause I don't want him to know from someone else and think that im into her. So this friend told me yesterday to tell her that what shes doing is wrong and that she should stop and we shouldn't talk to each other again. I find it childish to say that to a girl .. Thats what I told him. Then he followed by saying ""Make out with her next time then its okay""

Not sure what to do. I'm not into the girl and don't want her to really think that there's a chance that we date or anything, Cause I value my friendship and think thats never right to date a friend's ex.

247,"Hello. newish redditer here. Everyone seems to give decent advice and I don't really have anywhere else to turn. 
A little background. My husband and I are both in our early 30s. We have three happy kids together. We live in a great neighborhood.  We have a good sex life and surprising chemistry there. From the surface we look like your normal average couple. Probably middle class. My husband makes most of the money. I have a part time job and am the primary for the kids (2 are school aged)
My husband and I have always had sort of a tumultuous relationship. We married young (I 20) and had kids right away. I was just coming out of the fog that my dad left me in after he destroyed our family with infidelity. I grew up pretty wealthy and privileged. It was only until it all went away that I realized how my parents used it to control me. Today my attitude towards money is laissez faire. Its a core value of mine to never let money control me. I also have this overall knowledge that I will always be taken care of. (I have a trust from my grandparents). More on that later........ I further muddied the waters of my mind by getting into an extremely abusive (mental and physical) fast paced 2 year relationship with this horrible guy.  I've had to unpack through counseling that I am not always good at seeing when someone is being abusive to me. I tend to justify things a lot or blame myself. Being left and abandoned has been fear of mine ever since these experiences and I think it is part of what keeps me in bad situations. 
In our early years of marriage my issues reared its ugly head in the form of jealousy and extreme insecurity. It was a lot on my husband but he stuck it out...although angrily...and I ended up getting help. Turns out I had severe PTSD and anxiety/Depression. I have come so far and I am actually really proud of where I am at today.
My husband grew up very poor with a overly critical father and a depressed alcoholic mother. He would be described as having a ""chip on his shoulder"". He is still close with his family today and I truly love them, although they aren't perfect. They are all hard working down to earth people but substance abuse is normal to them. My husband has some issues. Number one being anger. He has never ever been physical towards me but he turns in a switch and can get really nasty and say really nasty things. He also has no problem lying to anyone, including me. And he has a trigger with money. He never wanted to share a bank account with me and we still don't to this day. The idea of money consumes him and I believe is part of the equation that has gotten us into this mess.
We also both have struggled with Pot addiction. I wouldn't call us addicts but we smoke weed every night after the kids go to bed, much like having a cocktail or something. Its our thing, it's legal where we live....but I think it is becoming part of the problem.

We are both good parents. I say that humbly because my insecurities still lead me to discover truths about myself and give a hard look at the job we are doing and I really feel like we are doing right by our kids. We aren't perfect but we are loving, encouraging, and involved. We manage to maintain decent structure and dependable lives. Seeing my husband in Dad mode makes me love him even more. Making my decision making process all the more confusing. It seems to be the glue for us though. The one area where we agree.

Before we were married my husband bought a house while we were dating. I wasn't on the loan but I ended up moving in and helped pay a portion of ""rent"" on my own. When he was purchasing the house in the 11th hour something went wrong with the lending. They ended up figuring it out and the sale went through but in the meantime he came to me and asked me to ask my grandparents for 30k!! I told him they said no, but I actually never asked them because where I come from, that is appalling. This has come up multiple times ever since. Anytime the going gets tough he says ""lets ask your family"". I have told him this is off limits and I am starting to conspire that he only married me because he thought I was loaded. Anyways, fast forward to marriage. Our wedding was beautiful, paid for totally by my family. We were in bliss for awhile. Straight through to our first born son who arrived a year later. Everything was going good, he was an easy baby, all was well. The first account of my husband rearing his ugly head is my sons first birthday party. I went big because I have a big family but did all the proper things to meet budget (like have it at my grandparents) make the cake myself and decorations. He criticized every little thing I did before then and never even told me good job. It crushed me. I accused him of stealing my joy for celebrating my first born.
I got pregnant again shortly after that. We had my second son 22 months after my first and shit got real. He was much more needy and anxious. Having a toddler and needy infant is no joke and looking back I may have had PPD. I was sleeping a lot and not taking care of the house as much because I was truly in survival mode. My husband reacted by pulling away from me. He is an expert at the cold shoulder and short responses. I was grasping for support and it all came too much for him one night and we had it out. He told me that he didn't even want our second son and that my baby was ugly. It's a big dirty secret I keep close to my chest because today, he is very close with both our boys and does not think he is ugly but he said it..... He said it. I have deeeeeeeeeeeep disgust and anger for him from that. Im older and wiser now and looking back on myself, a new mother, struggling with adjusting and the one person I felt I could trust said that to me? I'm shaking with anger now thinking about it.
I feel like that was a big turning point for us. I started caring way less about money and just spent what I wanted. I would dip into the credit card (something he despises) then pay it all off with my commissions. I admit I have deviated from the ""save money"" plan but it was in a way how I coped with deep seated hurt. This behavior I am sure has built up how he feels towards me today.

Around that same time he went on a business trip. He called me to say goodnight and that he was going to bed, only he didnt. He went out to a college bar and somehow got makeup all over his shirt. He came home and showed me the shirt, making up this big stupid story about how he was playing pool in the lobby and a dude was dressed up like a clown (it was really close to Halloween) and they did a bro hug and it got on his shirt. I searched phone records and found a much different story. He basically hung up with me and called a cab. Then he called a cab again at 2 am. I think he cheated on me that night but he wont admit it. After I caught him it all came out that he was unhappy in life. He legit said he thought he was going to be a millionaire by 30 and he realized that dream was fading away. I feel like he overcame that little quarter life crisis but I have never forgotten it.
My middle son has asthma and it has landed him in the hospital multiple times in his 5 years of life. The most terrifying was when he had RSV at 18 months and was in the PICU! The hospital trips kind of became routine until we were finally able to get his asthma diagnoses and manage it properly. One of the hospital visits came over the top of this bowling tournament that my husband had planned for us. I did't even think about going because I refused to leave my sons side, but he sure wasn't going to miss it. I agreed reluctantly even though I couldn't believe he was choosing that. It was a day thing so I asked him to come back in the evening and stay with our son for a bit so I could go home and change and take a shower. Well he came back, late and drunk. When he walked in the room the whole hospital room smelled like alcohol. I asked him kindly to leave and he caused a bit of a scene, leaving on foot. Where did he go? The bar.....I called his sister and she went and tried to knock some sense into him for me. The next day he strolled in with starbucks acting as if he didn't do anything wrong. I put on a good face but when we got home I couldn't even look at him. Another area I will NEVER forget. Sorry but only pieces of SHIT act that way. 
We decided we needed a change so we ended up moving three miles away from where we currently lived and where my husband grew up. I feel like he has never let me forget this and has some sort of resentment for it. The move was good for us in my opinion. We stayed within our means but upgraded the neighborhood. We have great neighbors with lots of kids to play with and we are close to my childrens school. He can tell himself this but the fact is, he doesn't like change. I thrive on it.

Since we moved to this house I feel like there is this low level hatred towards each other. He critiques my spending habits. Calls my career as a real estate agent a joke because of how much I make each year. He has perfected the cold shoulder and the distance...always on his phone. Ends conversations short. Etc. It's not always this way but it goes in waves. Last night took the cake. He was angry at me because I didn't answer his calls within an hour. I had texted him asking if he could help me with pick up for the kids, then got wrapped up in a chore and didnt noticed that he had immediately called in response to my text. That can be annoying when someone does that but it was innocent and his reaction was unfounded. He accused me of being ""shady"". I refused to accept this and defended myself and stuck to my guns. Well this only escalated things and the final blow was when he said over mac and cheese ""maybe we should separate"". I've already been fantasizing about this so I said ""ok"" and he said ""it's going to get messy because you aren't taking the kids from me! and I said in a sweet cherry pie voice ""I would never do that to you, but I am primary for them"". And he says ""You can't take care of them on your own, you can't even manage a bank account""

There it was........After all these years he still will deduce my worth down to those words. Im floored. Im disgusted. I cried all night. Actually leaving is so huge though. I think of the outside world. ""everyone will know"". My family, his family. My kids school. Our neighbors. It's embarassing to me. I feel like a failure.  I dont want to upset my kids and disrupt their lives but I can't even look at their dad. I don't know what to do. I don't even want to go to counseling with him. 
I really am a fragile person. I have done so much work to better myself and work on my self esteem and I feel like I can't fully heal with him. He plays on my fragility and to me that is an evil person. I just dont want to believe it.

A few months ago my ex killed our relationship because after almost 15 months, she realized that she had some personal issues that she needed to take care of and that the ""passion"" and ""spark"" died. 

These conclusions were only for her and her friends. I found out the hard way when she left. I also found out additional reasons from her friends rather than from her.

In the first weeks, I tried to mend what was left of our relationship. Of course it made no difference besides validating her  need of ""doing things on her own"". 

In the next few weeks, we might schedule a meeting and I dont know what to say. I never managed to tell my part of the story and I still somewhat miss her, even though she did and said a lot of nasty things. 

As I see it, she;s either a very immature and confused person living in La La land or she's completely over it even though she keeps asking me weekly about my life  and asks common friends about how I am.

What should I say during this meeting? How should I conduct it? What would you do if you were me and had a lot of unsaid things, but also wanted to restart the relationship?

251,"Where do i start this ? Let's start with some backstory that you will need.  I'm a high school studen. Recently i've been really out going/confident. I was really bad with girls and decided i should improve. Started improving with baby steps, but managed to get quite good at it. Now before i wasn't confident and i didn't have much... well female friends I tried to hit on a girl, I know, dumb right ? xD. But I couldn't resist I really liked her. It was pretty good, she show affection and so did I. My mistake was I think that i used too much pull instead of push that's why we kinda stopped talking it honestly doesn't sound as bad as it was. Now a year later, fortunetly lots of things changed in me, I started making a lot of female friends and started to be outgoing and confident I crack jokes in class things are looking great. Now there's where she finds out that there is a girl i've been texting online and some how managed to find out that i chat with her, which was really weird, I haven't talked to her in real life nor had i told anyone that we are friends, i have a feeling that she found out that through the webiste. We tag each other on memes. So when she saw it she literally couldn't stop asking questions about it and keeps teasing me about it. So I troll her back. It was like Deja vu for me honestly. Because i could see old me in her, like she is starting to like me. Any idea what the fuck is happening, am I wrong ? Should I keep trolling her ? xD",04Oct2018,1
252,"I've been a misanthrope for a long time, not sure exactly how long. I'm not interested in most people's lives, I get annoyed when people try to strike up conversations with me, and I just generally don't think very highly of most people. Nor am I willing to stick my neck out for most people. But I've been doing some thinking recently, and I think I'd probably be happier if, well, I wasn't like this. Not that I want to be a super social person or anything, but disgust and annoyance aren't positive emotions, and it might be nice to feel them less often.

Except I have absolutely no idea how to do this. Has anyone had any success with becoming less misanthropic? ",04Oct2018,1

Last year I went from jobless clinically depressed guy with pill abuse to having a job in web dev and studying CS with perfect grades until now. 

It maybe sounds a bit crazy, but I cannot deal with getting my grade down just because my depression went back.

How can I distance myself from being perfectionist and start having normal life. It seems like I just went from one addiction to another. 

Any advice would mean a lot to me because I am a loner and don't have anyone else to talk to really.

254,"I recently found out that one of my friends were the reason for one of my deepest secrets getting out.

I felt s so betrayed. I started to think about all the times shes been a bad friend, selfish and how shes never really put as much effort into our relationship. I realised how one-sided our conversations are and when I do finally manage to talk about my life, it always comes back to her. 

But then I remember how we've been friends for so long and even though she wasn't the best person, we had some good times. And it makes me want to keep her as a friend. I'm too scared to say goodbye and part of me wants to see her grow and become more mature. And I also feel guilty because ending our friendship might mean causing tension within our group.

258,"So, some time ago I met this girl, and I fell in love with her hardly, and for a brief time it looked like she was feeling the same, but in the end things didn't work. She moved along, but I kind of didn't. I accept the fact that she will never correspond me and I'm okay with it, that's how free will works, but the heart doesn't care about that. I still have feelings for her, but all this time i've managed them pretty naturally.
Some time passed and destiny made us live together in a shared flat. Tells me she's on a relationship and this makes me feel... bad. 
Living with her makes me remember lots of things I thought were gone.
Now, I don't want to talk with her about what I feel, because it would be unfair for her. I don't want her to feel awkward around me, or break our friendship for good, so I've decided to leave the house and find another room. 
To run away, I guess.
The thing is... there is a friend of mine in that house. And he needs my comphany because he doesn't get along with the idea of him living with strangers. 
Right now I endure this situation for him, but it's too painful and I don't know how much I'll be able to do that. I just want to move along. To bury those feelings and move on. But staying there doesn't allow me to do that. 
What should I do? Be selfish and abandon my friend or just keep staying, even if it's an unpleasant situation for me?

Background: I've been working out of town for about 6 months. My wife is at home with the animals and the kids. Her mother also stays with us to help out.

My youngest cat (Sonny, 3yrs old, male) has been acting up, probably because he misses me, or isn't getting enough attention due to me not being there. He's been peeing on the floor and clawing up the carpet.

Wife is fed up and wants to put him in a crate until I get back. I'm worried that crating him would piss him off bad enough that his behavior would never return to normal. Wife is tired of always cleaning up after him, and replacing the things he ruins.

So i asked one of the store managers aswell to remind him. This saturday I plan on speaking with the acutal new store director we got because our shifts match up so i actually see him for once. i can’t stop thinking that everything i say goes into one ear and out the other/ it won’t happen they will keep forgetting.

second thing involves a girl. I actually think I like her, like definitely haven’t felt like this towards someone before, nor have I dated before. I lost a lot of weight and am fit now and people tell me that i am pretty attractive, but i can seem to understand that. I am always thinking, “does she like me?, maybe, wait i think she does, oh never mind she’s knows a lot of guys why would she pay attention to me”. that thought flies through my head every day and it making me feel down.

I don’t fit in with them. They smoke weed and drink, which is something that makes me VERY uncomfortable for multiple reasons. I know for a fact they will smoke weed on his birthday.

As they did not have the product in my city and i had to wait a day for them to deliver it from their main storage i had to wait a day for the drums to be delivered.I paid 15% of the price up front as a deposit and the guy working the store told me he'll call me when i can come over and pick up my drums.

The next day i got a phone call from the guy and he said they just had a customer return their drums,offering me to buy those ""used"" drums for cheaper price  as they were not in original package,to which i agreed.
Later that day i came to the store, bought the drums and took them home.

As soon as i started putting the kit together i noticed that was not the drum kit i ordered,but i continued to assemble the kit in order to provide a photo of them as i was intending to return them.
Once the kit was put together i googled a bit and realised the drum kit i got has more than double retail price than the one i ordered and paid for.

I paid total of 1050 € ,and the price of the drums i got is 2200 €.It's obvious there was a mistake at the store and they sold me the more expensive drum kit for the price of a cheaper one.

What should i do in this situation?
Am i obliged to return them or should i just be happy that i got lucky and keep them?

The problem is that one of my ex best friends really pushes me to be in a room with him. This is something I don't want, because although I consider him a friend, I believe he's rather toxic and would be a bad influence to me.Being in a room with him would be super depressing to me, because most of his friends also are really negative which I can't stand.I honestly would feel that all the progress I've done through the years, after stopping to hang out with him, that made me who I am would be gone.

The thing is that he really really pushes me to be in a room with him, he wants that I and him travel to the university tomorrow and pick our rooms. What I am asking you for is an idea on how to get out of the situation by using a good excuse.

1) I tried telling him that I'd prefer to wait to see what room they give me (because he wants us to move in the one they gave him, because he went today and I still haven't gone) But he told me that most of the rooms are already gone, so I'll be in the same block as him 100% which is true, but I'd much rather be in the same block, but In different room with a random new person I'd love to become friends with that with him.

What excuse can I give so that I wait until he's already moved in with another person so I can apply and get a room for myself with another person as well?

It would be a total crush of confidence for me to become a roommate with him. 

I know some of you would advise me to just be honest with him, but that wouldn't work and would be extremely rude of me. 

I realize the post isn't well written or formulated, but I'm feeling extremely anxious and would really appreciate it if you could help me.

290,"I've been married less than 3 months and I don't know if it is worth sticking it out at this point. My husband and I were so enamored with each other the first couple of years we were dating. We are from very different backgrounds but that wasn't an issue before.

For a little of my background, I was in a very bad relationship from age 15 to 25, almost 26. He was 21 when we started dating and controlled pretty much every aspect of my life. He moved in to my house with me when I was 16, literally told me ""no"" at one point when I tried to break it off, got me to stop hanging out with my friends, refused any sort of intimacy when I'd try to initiate but guilt me into it whenever he wanted to have sex and I didn't, among other things. It was bad. I finally got up the courage to leave and was single and lost for about 2 1/2 years. In that time, I had an unhealthy obsession with someone I was in college with, tried some dating websites, and was raped by someone I met on a dating site. Things were not great. Then I ran into my husband. We had gone to high school together but were never close then, just distant acquaintances. He made me feel safe and loved. We were constantly texting, spending all the time together we could. We were so happy. 

A couple of years into our relationship, I got pregnant. I had been told I'd have trouble getting pregnant but we were able to without help. The pregnancy went well, although things in our relationship started to decline. I hadn't been cleaning as much and our house was disgustingly and embarrassingly filthy. After I had my son, I think I had PPD. At the same time, he became very distant and was angry often.

After our son turned one, he tried to leave me. I was completely blindsided, I knew we had issues but I didn't think it was that bad. We were engaged at this point. We talked and decided to try to work it out. A few months later, I got an anonymous message that he had been cheating on me with someone from work. I confronted him about it and he admitted he was, vowed to stop. About four months later, and four months before our wedding, I found out he was cheating again with the same woman. I'd been off of work for a month following an ectopic pregnancy and emergency surgery and he was going in late to work to sleep with her. This time, he begged me to stay. I did because I still loved him and wanted to try for our family (he has a daughter I've been helping take care of since we've been together). 

Recently, he has been distant again. I confronted him about it and he says that he doesn't feel a connection with me anymore and married me because he was listening to his family's advice. He says he still loves me and cares about me but he hasn't felt a connection for a long time. He told me that as long as I don't tell him to leave, he'll stay and that he sometimes does feel close to me. 

I don't know what to do now. I took our vows seriously, I intend to stick it out. But is that just stupid stubbornness? I am at my wits end. I don't want my son to grow up in a broken home and, despite everything, I do still love my husband. ",04Oct2018,1
291,"I don't even know how to begin this post, because this has been going on for years now, so I apologize in advance if this is a little hard to follow.

My mom is getting older. She's in her late 60s. I've always been very close to her, been able to vent and share secrets with her, and we used to be very much on the same page.

Since I left for college (10 years ago now, I've graduated, and I now live and work not too far from her), she's changed. A lot. And not for the better.

First off, she got really hardcore into conspiracy theories and some fucked up New Age-esque spirituality, and this completely changed her lifestyle. I'm all for people believing what they want, but she went WAY off the map on this. She:

* Started seeing a ""psychic"" on a regular basis
* Moved out of the house we used to rent without telling the landlord
* Bounced around to a couple of other places within the first 6 months of me being gone
* Eventually moved into a foreclosed house with no heat as a ""caretaker""
* Started hoarding (despite constantly preaching about ""letting go of the material world""). She goes through cycles where she'll give her family/friends junk from her house for Christmas/birthdays to get rid of it, but then will go right back to Goodwill to buy more.
* Eventually moved into a doomsday prepper commune in the woods for a few months
* Became homeless and lived in a church for several months
* Has now kept a roof over her head by ""caretaking"" two other places (I put that in quotes, because all she does is fill these places floor to ceiling with junk, completely trash the outside of it, and let mold/mildew grow. She won't even do anything about having bug problems... she says ""They aren't bothering me, we share the space."")
* Will not let me, my siblings, or any of her friends/family members into her house, because she complains that it's too messy. So we end up using the bathroom in the bushes and eating outside. Yet she begs us to come over and spend time with her, and wonders why we decline.
* Getting in shouting matches with family members about not taking shots at the doctors because ""they're putting tracking chips inside you""
* Is against vaccines and GMOs
* And more.

She is over the top into ""The Secret,"" and the law of attraction. I'm not against this sort of practice, but as a result, she refuses to let anyone to be negative. Like, ever. It's annoying as hell, and it makes it impossible to be around her. Sometimes, people just need to be angry, or sad, or frustrated, or stressed, but she makes it sound like their mood is hurting her. I've gotten into arguments with her a lot about policing everyone's emotions. If she calls me, and I'm having a bad day, she'll say shit like ""Call me back when you're in a better mood,"" and hang up, or if I'm even REMOTELY stressed out about something, she'll ask, ""Where are you at in your menstrual cycle?"" as if that sort of statement/question will make things better. I can't talk to her at all now about personal issues or vent at all, because she will lecture me on ""feeding my negativity.""

She has a pretty twisted double standard on how we should help each other out as family members. For example, she expects me to drive the 45 minutes to her house to pick her up and take her grocery shopping (which is fine, we sometimes make a day of it), but refuses to come out even to the end of her street to meet me. She throws passive aggressive tantrums when someone tells her they can't hang out with her certain days, but then refuses to put in any effort to otherwise spend time with anyone; there's no meeting anyone halfway in anything. I helped her set up a prepaid phone, and refilled the minutes for her one time because she couldn't get to the store to buy a card (and she doesn't have internet), and now, she just forwards me the reminder text every month, no ""please"" or any other message with it, and expects me to buy her minutes for her (she does pay me back, but it's a pain in the ass, and kind of inconsiderate). Essentially, she expects everyone to bend over backward for her, but rarely if ever does the same for others.

She claims to follow this divine path of ""sending everyone love and light"" but doesn't hesitate to gossip, complain, and spew hatred about her coworkers and other acquaintances. She's a hypocrite.

The biggest pain: She has an unlisted number, one that she refuses to even give out to certain family members. I've respected this and always took down other people's numbers who need to reach her, so she can call them instead if desired. However, she has no qualms about giving my phone number out to people... particularly people who need to talk to HER, but she doesn't want to give them her number, so she gives them mine, and expects me to take a message and forward it to her. WTF?? I've changed my number three times recently to prevent this, and I told her to stop doing that.

There are tons of other things too, such as a general lack of understanding of social cues, not knowing when a conversation is over, making no effort to hurry when she knows we are on a time crunch, and having a sense of humor that makes no sense (meaning, she makes jokes/comments that are so far-fetched and have nothing to do with a conversation, and then gets mad when no one gets it). I know a lot of these things may just seem like little odd quirks or traits, but she is not who she used to be, and all of it together is utterly overwhelming. 

To be clear: I do not thing my mother has demetia/Alzheimers/any sort of personality disorder. She's just... different, and not in a good way. She is oblivous to a lot of the world around her, has become inconsiderate of others, and has no sense of how to compromise. And she's become EXTREMELY passive aggressive. She never used to be this way, and it's making it impossible to spend time with her.

I don't know what to do. I love my mother, and I would be very sad if she was not in my life, but she's completely nuts, and I am really struggling to connect with her anymore. 

Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated.",04Oct2018,1

293,"I will put it out there that I’m noise sensitive and not made for apartment living. That being said, I moved somewhere quiet in the woods near a big city where it was mostly working professionals and 30s+ in apartments that were originally built to be condos with concrete floors. I even picked my unit on the top floor with the main living room wall being shared with friends I already knew who are super quiet and had a problem with the previous occupants blasting techno every evening. I’ve never once heard my friends. The rest of the unit is angled in such a way I can probably never hear the unit on the other side of me because most walls are utility/closets. I chose this place hoping that this was enough protection for me.

It’s the guy below me. He’s usually fine but I admit I have a tendency to distrust and dislike him (as a neighbor) for a few reasons, but I also think he is just clueless. When I first moved in he was grilling on his balcony, which is not allowed here, but I wouldn’t say anything as my friends next door have one too but never use it. I mostly don’t care if they’re careful with it, but the smoke took over my whole balcony and I had to go inside. Thankfully he stopped cooking after a month but probably out of laziness. Next he and I think his girlfriend stomp. I kind of don’t care because it’s not *super* often but it’s ridiculous how oblivious they are that I can hear it and it shakes my picture frames *above* them. But it’s just not common enough that I would ever say anything, just shocking because again, concrete. All it does is make me less tolerant of everything else. The occupants below moved them on the ground floor moved out and no one has replaced them in 2 months but I have no idea how they felt. Couldn’t haven’t been good. 

The kicker is when he had adopted a dog that he left on his balcony often and who had terrible anxiety and he would let poop out there. One day he left it alone outside for 13+ hours. I know this because the dog was barking from around 1pm on a Saturday to 3am the next morning and paused once because the poor thing was hoarse. On the apartment forums people on the other side of the complex (not close at all) complained because the sound carried. He got rid of that dog and apologized on the forums which I thought was nice, but a few months later got two more, who would bark and fight at all hours. I think he’s trained them now, 4 months later, so they only bark if they hear me on my balcony so it’s gotten better, but they freak my cat out when we’re enjoying the patio.  The other thing is I can look down there and they are always outside and there is poop and pee... multiple spots. He doesn’t even walk them and supposedly he works from home. As do I, 2-3 days a week. 

A while back he and some friends were playing music and singing along loudly at 11pm. I was super anxious because of bad experiences with polite confrontation with roommates (and just in general hate it) but thankfully my boyfriend leaned over the fence and nicely asked if they could take it inside. The sound was echoing off of the trees and made it sound like they were on my balcony and it came through the glass doors easily. They were good natured and went in, but blasted out another song or two inside which we could hear.  I am so shocked that they haven’t been asked to stop by the neighbors who share their wall. At least one of them is a nurse who works weird hours but not really sure if they did say anything or not. 

Ok so here is my actual point. In the last two months I started hearing a bass and it’s usually around 10am-1pm, weekdays or weekends. It used to be only every so often so I’d just be annoyed but forget about it. I don’t turn up my music or tv very loud because I don’t want to disturb my neighbors, so I can hear the bass through it even though it sounds kind of distant but also all around me. When I’ve gone down to his door I hear nothing. However there are AC units blasting ambient noise so it’s tough to hear anything. Sometimes my boyfriend is right outside of mine and I basically scream “it’s open!!” but he can’t hear me. It’s only when I put my ear to my floor that I can hear the bass sound more clearly. Not any of my walls. Yesterday and today he started it at 7am which is new to me. I am so terrified of confronting him and I’m still not 100% sure it’s him. My next door neighbors can’t hear it but they don’t share the floor. On top of the dog business, I’m not sure if there’s anything I should say. The dog thing is not at all bothering me personally but I feel really bad for the dogs. He just yells “hush” at them when they bark at me and I’ve heard him yelling at them for an accident in the apartment and he just ushered them outside. Do I go to him about anything? The dogs? The music? Or should I mention any of this to the apartment management? I honestly don’t know and am afraid of being a huge asshole but also hate feeling like a jerk and asking others to change their behavior for me, even in situations where I know I have a right to. Any thoughts appreciated. I work from home often and need to concentrate (never mind just relax in the morning and evening) but it’s not like blaring loud, just ambient and relentlessly constant.",04Oct2018,1
294,"I've considered myself a stay at home mom since my son was born three years ago. (I worked as a babysitter for 2 children for the first year of his life. After that, I became a nanny for a little more than two years. Those kids grew up and went to school. I was no longer needed. But I never considered myself a working parent since I was always able to take my son with me. 

(After the nannying job ended, I got a job, and my son went to daycare, it was a disaster. He had to be sent home (due to illness) three times in two weeks. I had just started my job, so I couldn't take off, which meant that my husband had to. He wound up taking off a total of 5 days in those two weeks to stay home with our son.

(My husband makes exponentially more than I was, and we lost nearly $1,500 between doctor bills, and missed hours for my husband. It became obvious that the best option for us was for me to stay home, rather than risk my husband's job.)

Now I just stay home, and it seems like it works out well for my son. I coordinate playdates with other kids around his age so he won't miss out on any socialization. We plan group trips to the park, the zoo, and the museum, it's really great for him. 

We've been working on learning the sounds of the alphabet, and he has started being able to sound out words. He knows some sight words, and can write most of his alphabet. Now we've started working on math, and using the number line.

On top of this, we've taken in my husband's sibling. They aren't much help, and they don't work, but we're working on their self esteem, and I have no doubt they'll flourish into a productive person soon enough. (So, for the time being, we're supporting them.)

Anyway, being a stay at home mom has made me feel...rather useless. Not in the sense of being a parent, (I'm well aware that my son is leagues ahead of other children his age because I'm able to devote so much time to him.) but as a spouse, I feel useless.

I have the house cleaned and dinner made when my husband gets off work. I do all the chores, no exceptions, so my husband doesn't have to do them. I pack his lunch every night before I go to bed. And I'm 100% responsible for all of our son's needs. (Meal times, bath times, bedtime routine, the works). Same with animal care.

My husband comes home, plays with our son, reads with him, and we usually take a trip to the park or take a walk every evening after dinner.

Then my husband and I get some time together after our son goes to bed. At the end of the night, I pack his lunch, and the two of us head to bed.

My husband insists that he likes having me home. When I was working, it seemed like we fought more. He was working 40 hours a week, and going to school. I was working 40 hours a week, and between trying to make sure our son got the attention he needed, and the animals got the attention they needed, neither of us had the time for chores. So, eventually, we would argue over it, we would both be exhausted, grumpy, and have no time for each other. 

It's not as if there was a constant argument over it. But it did happen on occasion.

Anyway...I guess I just don't feel like I do enough. 

My husband says I feel that way because my dad (the only parent present in my life) was so vocal about having no respect for anyone who just ""stayed home"" instead of earning an income to support their family. And I think he's right. I feel guilty for not working, and bringing in an income.

I've considered going back to babysitting, but that was always such a fucking mess. Half the time I didn't get paid, or the parents would short me, and we almost always made no profit. Between me being responsible for feeding the kids, and having to buy all the supplies for art and all our other activities, and having to report the income and getting taxed, we almost never made a profit. 

I would go back to nannying in a second, but only if I could find a family like the one I nannied for before. They paid a very fair wage, and were very nice people. However, all I have found advertised lately are those offering about $5/hr.

I know this is a short term problem, in a year, our son will be starting 4k. I'm staying home for that year, and then going back to work when he begins kindergarten. So, realistically, it's only a problem for about another 1.5 years. 

But how can I cope with feeling so useless in the meantime?",04Oct2018,1
295,"20, male (virgin) living in a university student area.

Title says it all really. She was super hot and my (non-virgin) friends are already roasting me because I turned her down and I'm regretting it now slightly. 

We hadnt even talked about anything prior to her messaging me besides her saying ""Hey"" then me replying with ""how are ya"".

It was likely that she was tipsy and I was completely sober. I felt like it would have been awkward since I was/am sober and a virgin. Was I right or wrong here? She has unmatched me now so there's no redeeming it for another time which sucks.

P.S. I'm not waiting for 'the one' to lose my V-card to, I kind of just want to get it out of the way, but didn't know how a tinder hookup would pan out.

Hi guys,

I'm currently a student studying engineering in my penultimate year (still have a semester left).

I'm currently in a part-time student role in a larger council (started in mid-July with 6 other recruits), but I just got offered an internship position full-time over Nov to Feb at a much larger firm (tier 1 multi-national firm).

This firm is bigger, and I would think that I would be exposed to more different work (and maybe interesting) work in a private consultancy environment.

I would like to take the offer, but I do not know how to bring it up to my manager or HR system.

I was thinking of just being straightforward, saying that I scored an internship in where I would want to take the opportunity in, while still thanking their time in giving me some experience in the current role.

But in doing so, when would be the best time? Should I just bring it forward in my next shift ? I also hope they don't take it as a slight, especially if they had hoped I would be staying longer. My direct manager that I report to, seems quite nice and understanding so i hope he will get the message.

My contract with the council would only last 1 year and they wouldn't take any graduates too.

Thanks!",04Oct2018,1
297,"I am absolutely beyond irritated at this one because normally I can come up for some sort of excuse on her behalf, but this just comes off as malicious. 

Every other night from 5-9 my boyfriend chills out in my dorm room while I’m at work. He does this because he drives me to my internship the next day and we normally go back to his place because it is **way** closer than my commute and I don’t have a car. Last night I worked at my location that’s still on campus but really and truly off campus. In order to walk home, I have to walk through some pretty dark/could be dangerous patches. This isn’t even truly the part that irritates me because if I had to walk it, its only like a 10 minute walk so... I might be scared, but my lovely boyfriend absolutely refuses to allow me to walk that path in the dark. 

So last night he was chilling with my roommates  walking campus. Once 8:45 rolls around, they’re nearing the campus cafeteria and they state that they want to wait for me to get out of work (sometimes I work the cafeteria, today I was not) and my boyfriend says ‘Oh! No, she’s at the other kitchen today. I’m going to go pick her up soon’ this is sort of how the conversation went.

Bf: Yeah, I’m going to pick her up. :)

Best friend: She has two legs, she can walk!

Bf: uh... no, I’m sure her feet hurt from standing all day, I know that sucks. I’m going to pick her up.

Best friend: She hasn’t been standing all day! 

**What the fuck do you think I do at work all day??**

Best friend: She could get some exercise from walking! She has her friend with her, she can walk.

(Backstory: My coworker has severe anxiety much worse than my own. If we were to walk home, she wouldn’t go without calling UPD and having them escort us. She’s sweet for staying with me at all, she got off at 8 but wanted to stay with me til 9 so she knew I got out safe.)
Bf: ....okay bye guys I’m leaving to go get [me lol]

Sometimes my friends like to have conversations about our sex lives, which doesn’t bother me and still doesn’t. But summarizing a conversation they had, he said she acted like she was upset that he wasn’t complaining about his and my sex life. It’s like she’s looking for problems in my relationship and I don’t understand why you’d **want** your best friend to have problems. 

On top of that, my best friend **knows** I’m terrified of the dark. I mean hell, I’ll do it if I have to. I’m capable. But I don’t want to. And I can’t help but think that she’s doing this because she hasn’t seen her boyfriend in a while. She always gets this way: taking her shit out on me when I have nothing to do with it. **and she was still pouty when I got there!** 

Here’s the thing: I’m almost never home. She’s pretty much made it clear with passive aggressive moves that that makes her upset. And I get it. But I have a lot of responsibilities that make it impossible to be around 24/7. We used to share everything, and I’ve started to pull back and distance myself because, quite frankly, I’m getting tired of this shit. I’m working like hell on my spine, and I’m becoming a stronger person.

Anyway. There’s several reasons why she may have tried to pull this shit and they’re all **really** petty. I don’t get it. I haven’t done anything to deserve her taking her anger at whatever else is going on in her life out on me.

300,"I graduated about two years ago, and I am seriously considering my options for entering either graduate school for clinical psychology or law school.  

First, I want to list my extensive worries about this process. I don't even know which path I should go down and application deadlines are quickly approaching. Moreover, I am worried I will have a hard time gathering the letters of recommendation needed to go forward with the applications. The only potential letter I have is coming from a Professor that I spoke to last year asking me to have more research experience (right now I have none) before applying. She did mention that she will do one for me though, as I mentioned that I consistently participated in her classes, scored well, and asked thoughtful questions. This reference would have been for clinical psychology, and now asking for a reference for law would seem like I don't know what I want (I need 2 academic ones for sure). I love both fields, but if I was completely honest, having my own clinical psychology practice would be my ideal career. However, I am far behind in the sense that I do not have relevant research experience nor a thesis course. In addition, gathering this experience has been very difficult and no professor so far has given me a chance to work in their lab. I hate my current job and because of that, I'm now thinking whether I should be more practical and just write the LSAT a bit late and move forward with that route. I would be writing the LSAT in January which would definitely not be ideal timing for the application. The only actions I have taken are towards law school, but that might be because I have the material for preparation, and I am too scared to be apply to grad school. I am looking for some guidance because I am scared and lost. Can anyone give me some advice on this?

Key notes: I will be applying to Canadian schools, specifically schools in Ontario.  My GPA is very strong and I have received a 4.0 in every psychology course I have ever taken, including two 100 percent courses. My CGPA is a little more weak (3.61/4). I know I can go either route and be very successful, but it just seems both are very daunting right now.

So, the United States government has a Work and Travel program for college students outside the US.

https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/summer-work-travel/
(You can also make research about it if you have doubts)

Us, as students can choose where to work. They are usually high traffic areas during that season. For example, since I will be traveling in winter, most options are Ski Resorts and winter related tourist areas. When we choose, the test our English level and the employer makes an interview with us. He then decided if they will gives the job and what position. They are usually pretty simple jobs, regulated by the government program.

Anyway, so I managed to narrow it down to 2 potential options. Either the Ober resort in Gatlinburg or Squeaky B's restaurant in Grand Lake Colorado. Both will give me housing, Ober in Gatlinburg's downtown and Squaky says it will be ""onsite"", so that's no problem. 

Both are GORGEOUS towns and I just can't decide. How is life in this towns? Which town will give me a more rich cultural experience? At the end... What do you guys think is a more interesting town to visit and live in for a couple of months?

Tl;dr: I subscribed to the Work and Travel program of the US to college students from aboard. I can choose where to work and live, either Ober Resort in Gatlinburg or Squeaky B's restaurant in Grand Lake Colorado, but I don't know what to choose.

302,"Hello everyone, I moved around schools a lot as a kid and I remember back in 5th grade I had a crush on this one girl. We talked and were okay friends (mainly since I tried to talk to her as much as I could.)

Anyhow, after 5th grade I moved schools (I only saw her for one year) and fast forward to 12th grade I dm'ed her on Instagram. I pretty much asked how everything was and it was a very short conversation. We're following each other on IG still, but we never really talked anymore.

Today I saw her in the hallways at the college I go to. It was brief, and I almost didn't recognize her but I did. I was wondering if you guys think I should try to talk to her.

309,"To give a little context, I was always a bad student, never studied a lot, never was the best in class. Consequently I got in a basic university and started studying Advertising. 

But suddenly I found myself in a class of philosophy, and it changed everything. My interest was so big in philosophy that all my motivations changed and I started reading entire books in days. 

By the end of the university time I was already working at a big agency, but my mind never left philosophy, I arrived 1 hour before to read, I eat lunch in 15min to have more time to read, and I drove fast home to continue my studies. It got to a point where I created a huge graph of all the important books and thinkers and was finishing each thinker chronologically in weeks, with the exception of Plato who took me 2 years to finish studying all his dialogues, and I guess Aristotle will take something like that too...

But the thing is that I live in Brazil, a dangerous county with very little quality of life (for what I seek). So now that I finished my university I was planing a master degree in Europe (since I have a Swiss citizenship it should have been easier) I was trying for a marketing masters or a consumer behavior, things that I have some interest on and that I think would have some career prospect. I prepared myself, got a good Ielts grade and a descent GMAT score. I received many recommendations letters from teachers and professionals. And I applied for 4 universities, and all declined... 

It doesn’t matter what I have achieved, it doesn’t matter if I have changed, is my past that count, my university that I got the diploma is decent and is stoping me of growing outside of Brazil. 

You guys have no idea how disappointed I am, I just got the news that the 4th university rejected me... I have so much to give, so much motivation to prove that I am not that stupid kid that I was years ago, but the ghost of that kid still haunts my dreams...

I have bought my tickets already, and I am leaving Brazil... I have no idea what to do... I see two options:

1- dedicated myself to find a small job and try to grow in it, or try to do a pre masters in marketing to try to enter in a masters programme...

2- This one is hard... The second choice would be to assume that I am going to follow an academic future. I really would love to study Psychology or Philosophy. But I am so alone and lost in this world of academics, no one to talk (family full of lawyers and business people), every time I show them hundreds of pages of notes I take, or deep logic problems that I love to reflect in dialogues they stare at me and say that they are happy I found a good hobby, and that I should prepare for my marketing career... This choice is so hard because I would need to start over... I am almost 23 years old, I have no idea how hard it is to get in a new university in Europe, I have no ideia what should I show them... And there is no one to talk. I just know one thing, I am never going to stop studying, I am so deep in this process. I wanted to show you guys just a little pics of my passion so here it goes: [this ](https://imgur.com/gallery/o0o8e9j) are all the books I organized by topic chronological. [this ](https://imgur.com/gallery/w91C8OW) is the map of philosophical influence I created and am following for the last 4 years. [those ](https://imgur.com/gallery/6B4HgnV) are my notes books and [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/8HYDIKd) was my room, but now I cleaned everything because tomorrow I am leaving...

I know it’s easy to say follow your passion, but there is a lot to consider, my last university is garbage and where, how and what should I do to enter this academic world of psychology or philosophy? I am starting it all over again so 4 more years of studying and my parents paying. Paying for something they think is a hobby... On the other hand they could just put me on a pre- masters programme and let the marketing flow put me in a job where I could sustain myself and continue my studies independently... 

I am so lost on what to do, I just know that tomorrow I am leaving Brazil, and i have no idea what to do next year... I am confused and lost... ",04Oct2018,1
310,"At the start of the year I stopped taking the pill (progesterone only) and anxiety medication.
So my weight seems to just keep going up even though I haven’t changed my diet at all. 
I know coming off the meds’ will have caused my weight to change but it’s been nearly a year surely my weight would of stabilised by now? 
The thing is even though my weight is increasing the shape of my body especially my waist line changes week to week. I can fluctuate between a tight size 12 and a small size 10.
If anything I’m eating less at the moment because I’ve gone back to uni. 
Could the medication still be effecting me?

313,"I need some advice. So I changed schools after the summer, and in my new class there's a guy I really like. He's repeating the grade (lazy, not stupid), so we got seated next to each other. At first we didn't talk at all, not even ""good morning"" and stuff, until he wasn't in school for a day and I kept his homework. We don't see each other after school, so I panicked quite a bit, but it turned out well, and got us talking.
Fast forward a few days, we start talking on the phone. I have a lot of anxiety regarding phone calls, however I forced myself to pick up, because I like listening to him. He calls me whenever he's drunk or high. This week, he didn't, and it's scaring me, that I actually hope he calls me. I got used to it so quickly...
He told me he would date me if he wasn't emotionally hung up on his ex. However, I believe it's fairly obvious I like him (I share my lunch in school, I help him with school work, I make sure he gets the materials if he's sick), so he might just feel sorry for me, because I continously fail to make friends.

316,"Hi fellow readers.

I'm in my mid twenties and from the UK. I work a full time job as an assistant doing a ""trainee ship"", I've been working here for the past 5 months and i like it. I live alone, have been in this property for over 4 years, single, don't really have any family to rely on except my brother or my friend but i'm an independent person and have always have been since i was 17. I truly only have myself to depend on. It has it's pro's and cons. I'm a type of person who is creative, adventurous and focused but i find myself asking for help here so here goes.

I've found myself having the odd moments of depression, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Which I've dealt with this for the past few years and have developed my own coping strategies and today was a bad day due to last night of having palpitations, panic attack out of nowhere caused by anxiety throughout the night and was left feeling exhausted the moment the morning come. It's like a switch it comes and goes, it's not the easiest thing to describe on how difficulties and overwhelming it is. Sometime i feel i like i'm drowning with my conditions. I guess i've learnt to live with them from experience but as mentioned it's tricky at times. Please exuse me if i repeated myself i'm not really with it.

I have tried to take a nap in the afternoon today and did by having an hour or two but it doesn't always happen and i'm just pulling through as i wasn't in the right state of mind to be in a working environment for today and it's not often i take sick days so i had to call in sick and all is fine, it's not like me to do so unless it's necessary  but today it was. I've recently been to see my gp and have mentioned this, i have put in a referral for counselling therapy but it could take a while until i hear from them. I keep a goal's list where i i write stuff like poems and a checklist ect.

There are times where i can feel isolated around people, dissociated and i hide it, only a few have i disclosed to and they are understanding.  I'm always trying my best to improve with my job and my hobbies, persevering is key. I know this post  may be a bit all over the place but i'm not sure where to start. I guess there's a level of trying to articulate what's on my mind and how shit I've been feeling onto a post can be something, part of that is because i'm dyslexic but i do try to put effort into things. In general i have a good understanding of my mental health and i really am trying but more recently i feel stuck where i'm living, i've been bidding for properties via the council for over 1 year and a half. I've come close to getting a property when i checked recently as it's a bidding system but no luck as of yet. I don't mind to say but ever since i started my job i've been budgeting smart and have put away any money into my savings and do have over £1000 currently saved. I have this initially for when it comes to that time when i do become successful at getting a different property or for emergencies. 

I'm always thinking ahead but sometimes that can make me a little anxious. There's another part of me that just wants to move to another country, start somewhere new and take my hobby of dj'ing, music producing to the next level it's been a while since i've played out but have yet to go under my alias and do my first live show, i don't have a manager. That being said i'm actively working on new music. I just want to fill my soul with adventures i get this feeling alot when i go for a walk. I truly don't have anything else to stay for here. I just feel stuck where i live as it's not the best place but it's better than having no roof as i do see things in a positive &amp; humble way, but i'm left feeling constantly uncertain on what to do other than what i am doing currently.  I could say i feel lost. This world is beautiful but it's truly short i just don't know what to do anymore. :(

What advice could somebody give me here as this is my last resort approach?

317,"Honestly, not even sure they're decisions. I don't even know. 

I'm a college student (free college) second year,  

my major is Public Relations.
I was accepted into college as a ""Human Section"" student.  

No idea if this is what it's called in English countries, but anyways, my major decisions are limited. I could choose from a few majors and two of them were: Public Relations, or psychology.   


Back then i didn't have anything in mind, but i knew as a fact i was not interested at all in the list i was given. Anyways, i chose Public Relations. 

Moving on my second year, i found out i love working with computers, programming, and surprisingly, math.   

I say surprisingly because i was extremely bad and lazy @ math in high school and basically.. all the time.  

Until i saw how important it was with computers, and how it was even more important with the stuff i wanted to do in the end with programming. And back then i was one of these kids that has the attitude of ""Why learn math, other than basic operations, the rest is meaningless - this is so stupid.."" I regret that so much, but i can fix it now before it's too late.   

something to note is, Public Relations is so much easier compared to the major i want which is, Computer Science.  

So i'm not changing majors to have an easier time.  

The problem is, it might be impossible for me to change majors. Because i was accepted into the ""human"" section in my college, and computer science is in the ""science"" section. Based on the administration's words it was ""impossible"".   


Unless i move to another college (highly unlikely, was BARELY accepted here) or go to a paid college which are extremely expensive in my country, me &amp; my family can't afford it. 

Good to note:   

I have a 4.35 GPA out of 5 in PR so far.   

But now, i have completely and utterly lost the will to study in ANYTHING related to this major, every single subject is extremely boring. 

I'm not talking trash about this major, PR, but for me it's not that i don't like it, i can live with that, but i HATE it. so much. All subjects in it are extremely annoying for me and more.   

But, leaving college is not an option because my family won't accept it. And i won't as well, but i know if i keep going, i'll graduate, with a shit - shit - shit - GPA. I lost every single ounce of motivation, will, even power to go through with this.   

While it's so simple, very little hours every week, i can't get myself to do it. I don't know what to do. 


I half-decided to finish in this major and graduate, if i get a chance to change majors soon i WILL instantly take it. Unless it's too late, then i'll just grit my teeth and move on while repeatedly saying ""fuck you luck, fuck you luck"". 

The thing is, i plan to keep studying computer science related subjects out of college, math and all subjects. Get into programming and basically fill almost all my time outside of college with things related to programming and learning. 

This will obviously fuck my GPA at my current major/college. I'm not sure what to do, i know i won't let myself forget about programming/computer science or in 10 years i will regret it so hard i'll probably commit suicide.  

Honestly, i don't know what to do. Every day i go to college now and mindlessly go through classes, every day, i HATE it. And no offense to anyone in this major, for me, i find it so STUPID. The whole major and what it's about it is so fucking stupid. ESPECIALLY in my country.  


- I hope i don't offend anyone, and i know the major itself is not stupid. But for me to study it, and basically have it decide my life, forcefully, it's stupid. That's what i mean and like i said, i do hate every single subject/class in it except maybe video/photo editing.

- note: My country is arabic. Which makes the PR major even dumber, cause barely ANYONE gives a SHIT about it here. It's where people that don't really have dreams, or any wants for a good job/knowledge/passion go to. in terms of college.    

Naturally there's people that are actually interested and good at the major, but very very little here. (They do exist though)",04Oct2018,1
319,"A little backstory. My father has some anger issues that he refuses to resolve and as a result of seeing and experiencing this rage my whole life, I vowed to myself early in my life that I would never let anger get the best of me, and I was doing a good job of doing so up until the last few months. 

Recently, I’ve noticed that I’ve been getting angrier and more annoyed by the people around me. I reflected on this today, only to come to the conclusion that this isn’t the person I want to be. I thought about what might be causing this shift in mood, and I think it might be stemming from deep, deep insecurities in my head that gnaw away at my soul every waking moment of my existence. Could I be projecting these feelings? Is it the result of my feelings of failure and frustration? Seasonal depression? Stress? Could this all go away with a therapist and a prescription?

I want to stop. I don’t have an aggressive personality, and I don’t enjoy being angry or forcing my anger on to others. I’m afraid that if I don’t get it under control soon, I’ll strain the relationships I have with the people I hold close to me. I don’t have the financial resources for a therapist, and almost anything I can do to try and control it has either only delayed it and/or hasn’t work for me personally. What should I do? Am I a lost cause?",04Oct2018,1
320,"I was having dinner last week at university in catered halls with some people. These two girls sat down and I didn’t know them. This one girl kept glancing at me and smiling and so I waved at her( while talking to someone else)then smiled back. I asked her name etc and she told me but then everyone I was eating with finished and I had to go with them. I could of stayed though and sat next to her but I didn’t. There was something special about this girl she was beautiful and very quiet, introverted and just gave off a friendly vibe. 

Fast forward to today and I saw her leaving my accommodation block on her own with earphones in( don’t know if it was one or two). I tried to say ‘hey’ but the words wouldn’t come out my mouth. This has never happened to me at uni. I’ve always been able to speak to girls at nightclubs,dance with random girls and don’t have any anxiety speaking to a girl I don’t know.
Fast forward an hour after this incident. I somehow passed her again when going down the different floors but this time she was talking to this girl and again I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. I just couldn’t speak. 

But I’m so anxious about talking to this girl I don’t know why. There’s something innocent about her like she doesn’t know she’s so beautiful and I don’t want to say the wrong thing. Another thing to note is that there was a table full of guys I was eating with last week that she didn’t know and I was talking to this other girl( who’s just a friend on my floor) but she was only looking and smiling at me. It probably doesn’t mean anything girls give off mixed signals as I’ve learned. 

I’m not the most good looking guy at all I’ve got lots of flaws and a 10/10 looks wise girl even said to me last week that I wasn’t ugly but not hot either after we made out. 

What should I do about this girl? I’m fairly certain she doesn’t use Facebook so haven’t been able to find her through mutual friends. I may see her at dinner again but she will be with a group of people that I don’t know. I fucked it up didn’t I? I may not see her for weeks or months ",04Oct2018,1
321,"Been working at a small (tiny) company for a little while now. Good vibes. Good stuff. 

I'm the company's purchaser, but I also handle some accounting and I'm a direct assistant to four managers. 

About six months ago, I discovered unusual accounting conflicts. Brought it up to my accounting manager, the problems disappeared and life continued. Until I found them again. And again. This time, when I brought it up, I was then locked out of the software and my 'job description' changed. 

My executive manager knows about this and asked me to keep tabs / record things. It's been six months and nothing has been done. Turns out, the owner (92) doesn't know or want to deal with this problem.

Turns out the accounting manager has exclusive access to all the accounts, the passwords, admin on the accounting software, manages all HR related items and has been for years (!!!)

I'm worried about my job security, as well as the company's safety. I really enjoy my job and don't want someone ruining a company through these kinds of actions. 

Is there anything I should be doing, beyond keeping the other managers informed? What if the owner doesn't want to deal with it because he's 92 and just doesn't have the energy to fight that kind of battle? 

Fuck. I'm so pissed. Each week I identify a new issue or new red flag. Hell, the other day we discovered that her employee file is blank with no physical address or info beyond name and phone number. 

""That should be the biggest red flag in life! Why did no one check this?! She could disappear tomorrow and we would have NO idea where she even lives!""

A few weeks ago I asked out this girl at my university. We’re in one of the school’s smaller clubs together, and we got to know each other a bit before I eventually asked her. We ended up hanging out and having a good time, but when I pursued her for an actual date she said she wanted to stay friends.

I was pretty upset at first, but I kind of got over it. She’s a really cool person, and I see her a lot, so I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea to stay friends. We haven’t really talked much since the rejection, but she’s still been pretty friendly to me, and we interact sometimes on our group’s group chat. I feel like I’m the one making things awkward.

We’re going to both be at some new club’s meeting soon, and some people from our main club are going to a concert soon, and we’re both going. Although I felt like I was more over her the other week, feeling have been creeping up again. It’s stupid, since I know it’s really not a huge deal.

326,"So. This will be a phat paragraph. All comments will be read, all opinions will be considered.
I just want to feel sane.

My life is directionless. I feel ungrounded from the reality most people desire. I feel that I'm where I am because I've been so, indecisive.. I've moved forward just following the paths of least resistance. I am constantly observing. I have Aspergers. I am bipolar. I live on an edge perpetuated by hectic thoughts and unnecessary evaluation. Please humor me..    This is about education, love, and normalcy.

I graduated in 2016 from a private school. That place was my prison from elementary until graduation. 
I found I was an outcast early on because of my questioning attitude and defiance of authority. Religion and I clash deeply. My parents pushed me to stay there, either because I was the first child or what, they thought it would be a good place to be. ""The importance of Ethics and all"" During my entire high school career my mother wasn't at home often, as she was in graduate school (medical) for four years, if she was home she was heavily stressed. My father was left to be essentially our main parent, and only income. Let's just say we didn't make a lot.. He became an alcoholic during this period and hasn't ever recovered. 
I found myself not interested in school work, and having no interest in life. The school literally injected religion into every aspect of learning: forced chapel every week, no forward thinking in science/math classes, no evolution, skewed history classes, forced bible class. I don't know how it's legal. I was questioned constantly by peers because they were equally religious and judgmental. I had no friends simply because I couldn't get along with their pettiness and simplicity. I felt myself growing harsher and cold. I didn't ever drop out; but nevertheless, my GPA slacked, I did what I needed to get by, and I spent most of my time alone playing video games. My last two years in HS I spent my free time studying subjects my school never touched, such as WW2, the Cold War, space exploration, and even microbiology. I realized how much I enjoyed knowledge and understanding.

I graduated. I found myself pushing towards college for the light of success from a legitimate education with still, no path. I knew I loved science, but I made no choice. I just wanted to make my family happy. I knew they never meant but the best. They were the only people I had known besides my nonexistent friends from high school. 

I started college. My first year I spent alone, living out of home just taking classes and working. My GPA slowly rose, and I had to retake some classes. I realized I had never properly been taught how to learn and hence never had a desire. I had to relearn. I considered a few different fields but never settled on a degree I thought sounded appealing. I couldn't drop out though. Despite the money, which I've never been great with, I'd spent years in school. 
Time mattered more to me.. 
I wanted a fresh start. I transferred to a different city, picked engineering and kept taking math classes. I had a girlfriend of over 6 months at this point and I had every intention of living my life with her. I moved into an apartment with my only lasting HS friend. 

Everything was fantastic and I felt like I was making progress. I had stopped smoking regularly, and was making a few real connections. My big heartbreak was when she decided we were over, but didn't tell me until she had grown distant. She disguised it as something other than cheating on me for two months.. We lasted 8, almost 9. She came to me after a week of barely seeing me or talking to me and asked to just be friends with benefits. She liked the sex with me more than anything, she didn't like my personality or ideas.. We had discussed marriage and our future. She changed and turned on me over the course of a month. I couldn't just have sex. I dated for a reason. I had spent years alone just fine. Without love the feelings were hollow and cold. It was February, a day after Valentine's Day.

I returned to my classes. The same day she left I started my new job. I started work at the only place in town I could find. My schedule turned into waking up, Classes, lifting at the gym, and work. Home about midnight. Stay up until 2 playing games then passing out until classes. I began to smoke as much as before, but I never partied. I didn't make more friends. The people in classes didn't want to talk to me. The people that came to where I worked had no interest in me. I realized what type of city I was in. It was a college town filled with partying fools. I worked around people that had graduated from that very college with real degrees who only landed in the same city in an unrelated, entry level field. No one is happy. Everyone is complaining. Everyone has a problem. No one cares about you.

I remember little from this point until moving home because it was such a downward spiral. My drug intake increased rapidly. I began to sell drugs late at night to make more money. My interactions with people became template cards. 
Say what you need to get what you want. Manipulate. Just don't let them know. Don't let them know you understand. Don't make anyone uncomfortable, you might not get what you need. Don't seem intelligent, you will accidentally intimidate. Don't give your opinion. Act collected, get respected. 
As I lost my mind during the last couple weeks of that semester, spring 2018, my roommate decided to dip out. Despite our plans we had made to stay for multiple semesters, he had never got a job. I was left with utilities and rent at the end of classes. I packed, paid off the apartment and moved home. I deleted my few contacts. I dropped out of that school. I re-enrolled online at my original college for general studies. 

I returned home with no motivation. It was basically June. My friends were not my friends. My girlfriend had turned into a whore. I started shifts at my old job to keep myself busy. My 21st birthday came around and I didn't hear anything from even the 4 people I had kept up with, not even my roommate. They were all hanging out though, drinking and cruising in a convertible. I deleted my social media and unfriended them all. 

I didn't really talk to anyone but my brothers and parents. After not long, I found myself on a date with a girl that, I admit contacted me as I didn't initiate. I wasn't in the place or mindset to reach out to anyone. Despite this, I'm a sucker for someone that cares, She immediately became attached and we've been dating since, it's been 4 months. She understands me more than most. At least I'd like to think so.. She talks about marriage and kids, something I do eventually want. She wants me to trust her, but she's a handful in herself. She doesn't really want to train or do my hobbies with me. She talks about the big city and she wants to be a model. She has a wealthy family so it's not even unrealistic. We even argued quite a few times but we have always come out on top feeling better about ourselves and together. I just don't know that she'll stick around. I want to trust her but she is younger than me, she is 18. I keep having flashbacks to my ex. Who was at one time 18, who also changed her mind on a dime. I could have seen that breakup coming if I hadn't been naive. If I hadn't listened to her words I would have been better off. People are predictable, but they don't want to realize it. We're simple, but we all want to seem complex. We're all selfish but we all want to appear communal. A slight jab at the relationship ending in an argument is likely a bigger problem underneath.. A desire to be free. 

I read into things so intensely my daily life feels like a drama. I fear myself, and how most people aren't like me. I've talked to my grandmother about addictive personalities and she's told me how damaged people usually pick the same type of personality in a partner. She's been divorced from two different alcoholics and herself is addicted to pills. She lives alone. 

I don't know who I am or what I'm supposed to be. I'm a guy that can't stop thinking; just not in the ways that make you a genius. 

I don't know if I'm happy. or if anyone is 

Thank you,

The problem is, I already have plans to have a friend over my place, and I hate canceling on people because I've been flaky in the past due to personal issues. This friend also needs me right now because her family is fighting and she can't stay at her house tonight. She (the introvert) said she doesn’t think she’s up for meeting a new person right now but I really need to be there for her, as I’m one of her only friends in the area. If she agrees to come over and meet her, how can I make this situation more comfortable for her? If she ends up deciding no, how can I help from a distance? I know it's ultimately up to her, and I'm not gonna push it on her, but I'd really like to get her out of her shell so I can be there for her! I also understand she's in a very vulnerable state right now, so I want to be careful with how I try to ""convince"" her.

My name is Alireza. 23 Years old, male,from Iran, living in a normal city called Urmia. As you may know English in not my main language, so i apologies for my bad English.

i'm not kinda religious ( 10% Muslim 80% Atheist 10% unknown ) . i don't drink alcohol or doing drugs. i don't have job, i'm in university. 

&amp;#x200B;

6 years ago i once did a suicide by eating an Aluminium phosphide but after that because i was afraid of the pain of the death so after 5-7 minutes i went and find a butter ( i don't know the exact world for it ) to eat .then i went to hospital with my family for safety. but the weird thing there was that i didn't felt any pain after eating that even after 20 minutes which was very very weird then it was that i didn't died !!!! the doctor said that the thing that i ate could anyone if they just smell and i was keeping it in my hand for 10 minutes, some of the doctors even said that i was lying that i had eat any of that. and i felt nothing from eating that. 

after 2 years from that attempt till now i wanted to kill myself again but first i could't do that thing again because i don't want my death take 20 mins, and cant afford a gun because first its illegal, second it's expensive and i cant find anyone that can give me a gun to end this. so the third option here is  jumping from the apartment that i live in. BUT our ROOFs edge is not that kind that we can STAND on it. it's not FLAT it's Round and i dont want die we my face smash to the ground and i want back of head HIT the ground. SO IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF ROOF OR GUN OR ANY OTHER QUICK WAY SO THAT I CAN END MY LIFE PLEASE HELP ME. 

&amp;#x200B;

i like everyone. i don't talk so much. i just cant accept living because if we live, we will just hurt others and not just only humans or animal everything. that how we make and NO ONE CAN CHANGE THAT ( i'm sorry but this what i believe and is not a fact ).

&amp;#x200B;

and please guys can please try to give me the way of death rather than a advise of not killing myself ? you can give me an advise but please let must of the answers be about the way.

330,"I'm getting the new iPhone and I am extremely excited but this is really one of the only ways I receive joy. I don't have many friends as I am self-conscious of many things and I deal with anxiety.

Now that I'm getting the new iPhone, I feel more confident and actually feel I can achieve my fitness/appearance goals. Getting the phone was one of them. I dreaded using my old Android for the past half of the year.

How do I fix this?",04Oct2018,1
331," 

Hey all,

Here's  my short educational background. Graduated Uni (Kinesiology) in 2012,  worked for 4 years (in my field), travelled, decided I wanted to  specialize on something that would get me a  high paying job. Went back  to Uni in 2017 studying a medical profession, now returned into my 2nd  year and I have lost ALL interest and focus. My true interests are in  Nature Photography, Climatology and Technology (Programming, Developer etc.). Last  year while I was in school I applied to a masters in Project Management  in Wind Energy Sustainability in Sweden and was accepted, but I turned  it down thinking I should finish this program I started. Now I've  entered the 2nd year and I feel I have made a mistake and should have  done the masters.

My girlfriend even quit  her job and moved to the other side of the country to live with me  while I finish my schooling, but I am so negative and depressed with the  thought of continuing in this program I can foresee it putting a stress  on our relationship. I hate going to lecture, attending labs and trying  to perform well. I have no desire to study or learn or listen in  lecture. I feel so trapped, mainly because all my saved up money is  practically gone due to tuition and living costs, and the only reason I  am trying to remain in the program is because it will lead to a stable  job/career with stable income to make up for the money I've spent and  the money I now don't have. But I have a strong feeling this isn't what I want to do. First year I got straight A's with a high  GPA, it's not that I'm incapable of performing, I am one of the top  students in the class, I just have no interest or desire anymore.

My interests in life are not with healthcare anymore. I feel like this isn't the right path for me, but I am **not sure If I am saying this as an excuse because I don't want to do the work, or I actually don't want to do this.**  I got through a whole 4 years undergraduate with no problems, but that  was more because I ""had to get an education"", whereas this  was more of my own thought and decision making. Everyone tells me to stick it out and finish it even if you don't want to work in that  profession as its a good fall back career to have. But I can't imagine  putting myself through this for another year in the classroom and then a  year in the hospital if I'm not enjoying it. I feel its affecting my  relationship as I am not the positive person I have always been before.  My mind is constantly focused on school and whether I should drop out or  not. In the past i've worked jobs that portions of them involved patient care or seeing patients and I hated it. I don't know why I thought I would enjoy going to school for this, it was more because I was at home working part time with my dad for almost two years and was like ""I need to do something"". If I was offered the Masters AND entrance into the program at the same time, I would've 100% chosen the masters.

I feel so conflicted, stuck, and  depressed. I don't know what to do. My girlfriend said it's ok if I want  to drop out, she won't be upset as she just wants me to be happy, and  shes recognized that I am not happy. I wake up every morning sad, crying and my chest feels so tight. I feel better when I get home, but more because ""yes, im home, no more school, i got through the day"", but it's so unhealthy. If I drop out I would plan on  getting  a part time job of course to pay rent and bills while my  girlfriend works in her career. But I know I won't do that forever, just  until I figure the next thing out. Im scared of that alternative, but at the same time I'm scared to force myself through this program.  


I've seen a counselor and she helped me find out WHY I am crying every morning etc., obviously they cant give you an ansewr or tell you what to do, but after that meeting I said to myself ""I need to withdraw from this program"". But ince then ive said ""no i can do this"" ... but its a struggle every day physically and mentally, my heart isn't in this, but I don't know what my heart is in.",04Oct2018,1

So I'm going to a liberal arts college, and I have mixed to medium conservative values. I know that I signed up for this by going to a liberal arts college in Chicago, but I didn't think I'd be attacked. Don't get me wrong if you disagree with me, I can still get along with you, but I see so many things around the campus and the people say things that make me feel personally attacked for my views. I haven't shared my views with anyone, I've just don't say anything. Even the teachers attack conservative values, calling all of us racist, sexist, homophobic, Nazis. I feel like I'm being attacked just for thinking differently than most of the people at this school. They all call themselves progressive, yet anytime they hear views other than there own they act so aggressive and hateful. Does anyone have any advice? Even if you don't agree with my values I hope we can have a civil conversation. One last thing I am okay with a lot of things, like the LGBTQ community, and I'm not racist, I just have some medium conservative values. Thanks

334,"I called ~10 minutes ago in response to a job opening at a local restaurant. I submitted my resume ~16 days ago. I submitted the resume in-person. When I had submitted the resume, I inquired with another staff employee about the job details- as the sign outside of the business was generally vague with only a ""help wanted"" advert. She told me the job consisted of just general work around the restaurant- bussing tables, doing dishes, serving, etc. - which is fine as my resume consisted of mainly transferable job skills anyway- with volunteer work at a homeless shelter and food bank. The owners were on vacation for ~a week, so I was told they'd be back Wednesday- decided to call this morning because wasn't sure how busy they'd be when they got back. Which leads up to this morning where I called feeling flustered and bed-headed and was passed along to a few people before speaking with the owner of whom the restaurant is named with. He told me that they were looking for cooks, and I passively agreed and didn't really say anything else at that point. He asked for my name and said that if I submitted my resume, he had it. I said thank you and hung up. Would it be okay if I called again (not immediately obviously) to try again? I wasn't sure of my communication when speaking to him was virtually clear and I feel like I didn't say what I ideally would have wanted to. Would this be too much? I applied to a few other places, but would really like a job. It's been about 2 weeks for all the places I applied to and have not yet had any scheduled interviews or anything in response.

I probably would’ve made it work if I could see in the near future that we would be together physically. I am not afraid to say that I need that physical relationship. Not like sex but the person physically being present. Texts, calls, and video chat only go so far. I just feel like an ass because I was her first everything. Boyfriend, love etc. and me breaking up with her made her feel like she wasn’t worth it. I just didn’t wanna go through long distance for it to just not work out. We still talk frequently so it’s not like she hates me and she has said she would take me back if I have a change of heart. So the question is: Should I?

Business isn’t my #1 passion but I’m good at it and the job market is always high and available. 

Zoology and Marine Biology has been my passion since childhood but the job market really sucks, which is why I didn’t go for that when I first started college. 

Psychology has interested me from very early on. I read psychology books for fun and research into topics/experiments just to pass time. I know that sounds nerdy. 

Medicine has started to interest me as well. I’ve been told for years to go into medicine because of my knowledge about the subject and I’m starting to want to do something that will better the world and people. But I don’t want to go to school for 14yrs to do that.

339,"So, this is a throwaway account made to ask some really embarrassing questions while I try and improve my life, especially because I recognize some of these questions are going to make me sound like a creep.




I grew up in a really fundamentalist christian cult. I was a hardcore true believer (like if they told me the earth was flat I would've plugged my ears and tried to make myself believe that). I only got out a little over two years ago, and basically don't believe in -any- of it anymore.



Because my whole life, I honestly felt like god would -give- me a woman (its a pretty standard bit of ""folk-lore"" that the more faithful you are the hotter your wife will be) I didn't bother trying to pursue women. **I have ZERO experience with women. I am 29 years old.**



I'm doing the ""usual"" self-improvement stuff (working out, meditating, etc. why bother working on yourself when god will fix you was my old mindset pretty much) but that's not what this is about.



I'm trying my hand at online dating, and running into two weirdo issues. 1. I find it extremely difficult to tell a woman's age by looking at her, which can lead to awkwardness trying to talk to women irl, and 2. I'm a little....scared of women my own age.


Scared might not be the best term but the idea of dating a woman my own age, or even a year or two older worries me. My lack of experience with women at my age is one thing, and then there's my general lack of -life- experience (see previous cult lifestyle). Women -my- age, have their shit together, simultaneously, I don't want to be a creep hitting on women way younger than me, even if I feel we might have more in common. And then there's the fact that the idea of dating a woman my age makes me feel...old (I know, the prospect of dating a woman my own age makes me feel old? I know, Hypocrite).

I met Jeff at a mutual friend's 10th birthday party. We were both fairly athletic, and immediately connected over sports and video games. Over the next few years, Jeff became one of my closest friends. Throughout high school, he was the quintessential cool kid. Jeff was tall, athletic, good looking, smarter than average, and very funny. He took part in extra curricular activities. All the girls in our school loved him. Part of what hurts so much about this post is remembering how amazingly great he once was.  


Our junior year of highschool, Jeff went through a bad breakup (I know it was high school, and those relationships don't really mean much in the long run, but this is about how it affected his psyche at the time). Jeff was devastated. This was the first time I saw what, in my amateur opinion, was a serious sign of anxiety or depression. Jeff told us he could not face the humiliation of going to school where everyone knew he had just been dumped. He dropped out of school that year.  


The next year, Jeff's parents convinced him to resume high school. I was a senior and he was a junior. He made it through the year, seemingly without incident, and we all thought his dropping out was just a poor decision during a difficult time, and that he had gotten through it.  


After my class graduated (his original class) he again began to show signs of anxiety. He could not bring himself to attend his senior year. He told us that he knew no one after we had graduated, and did not fit in. Again, Jeff dropped out of high school. His parents gave him an ultimatum: get his GED or go to work full time with his uncle's construction company. Jeff chose the GED. After getting his GED, he would occasionally find a job, which would result in his firing after a few months. All of the stories of his firings, even through his biased point of view, were very clearly self-inflicted and brought on by his own actions.  


In our mid twenties, Jeff inherited a house. At this point, he had not worked in a year or two (and still has not to this day, almost ten years later). In order to pay the property taxes and cover his living expenses, Jeff opted to find a roommate. A low-earning but stable friend rented his extra bedroom, allowing Jeff to continue his current lifestyle without earning any income. Jeff's diet immediately declined upon moving into his own house. He began ordering pizza for dinner nightly. He is now at a point where he has not eaten anything besides pizza (or sugary snacks) in about five years.  


The rest of our friend group has moved forward with life. Most of us are married, and the majority have children. I myself recently became engaged. Because my fiancée is a doctorate student, we are putting off starting a family until she finishes her education in the next couple years. This results in me taking part in more ""young person"" activities than some of our friends. Most of our group have become weekend warriors, but I'm still available to hang out on weeknights, especially with my fiancée working nights after school. I did not realize until someone recently pointed it out, but I am the only friend who still sees Jeff outside of parties/weddings/events.  


Jeff's roommate moved out a few months ago. He is running out of money, and has no motivation to find a job. His past 5-7 years have consisted of nothing but cigarettes, weed, pizza and MMORPGs (nothing wrong with these in moderation, heck I still play WoW after 15 years).  


About a month ago, Jeff told me he did not have any money to eat. I went to his house and ordered a pizza, hoping to sit down with him and address the situation. Jeff had no desire to do so. I believe his words were ""I really just want to eat dinner and relax, I'm too stressed to get into this.""  


A few days later, Jeff called me while I was out to dinner with my fiancée. Eight times in two hours. Along with text messages. When I got out of dinner and checked my phone, I saw this and called him back, thinking it may be an emergency, or that he may have reached a personal breaking point. I was wrong. He just wanted to know if I was down to hang out and get some pizza. This trend of repeat calling if I don't answer (while I'm at work, out to dinner, etc) has continued and occurs once or twice a week.  


I've slowly come to the realization that our entire group has bailed on his friendship. I do not have it in me to abandon my oldest friend, but I also cannot consume myself with the stress I have been feeling lately over his situation. He needs to pull himself together before he loses his free house over unpaid taxes, or has a  heart attack/stroke from his atrociously poor diet and smoking habit. I also worry about his depression spiraling into self harm. At this point, it has been almost a decade since he has worked and had a healthy diet.   


Please, I need advice. I would love to know what you think in regards to both getting Jeff on track, and for myself to deal with the stress of the situation. If he does not change, I don't think I can go on with the friendship. It is killing me to see a close friend of 25 years live his life this way. I want more than anything to help him move forward.

362,"Largely, I find it difficult to be happy for people. As much as I want to be supportive, I just get horribly jealous when I see people presented with opportunities I don't have. Many times this jealously will manifest as anger and disgust towards those I love. 

In some ways, I also feel manipulative due to my bitterness. I'll bring up something horrible from past just to prove a point and end up making everyone feel like shit in the process.

363,"To make it short, I have an old friend I haven't seen in years who is dying of cancer, and suddenly showed back up in my area and is asking me to hang out with him at every free moment.  

&amp;#x200B;

I love and care for him though I haven't had contact with him in so long, and he's weak and in a lot of pain and feels alone a lot of the time, which I understand.  At the same time he's calling me frequently and wants me to spend hours at a time with him and spend the night as well, and even wants me to ""move in"".   He's living out of a trailer with his family and hasn't done anything to get treatment and is resigned.  Haven't been there all the time but at least 2-3 times a week for multiple hours and spent the night multiple times, more than anyone except his family.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I should set a boundary, but him obviously being a very dark place he wants to spend as many moments as possible with me, and constantly asks me to just ""hang out"" though it consists of me lying in his bed next to him for hours.  It has come to a head the past couple times where I expressed my frustration to him and he maybe feels I want him gone completely but it's only that it's become a big stress/burden for me, selfish as that sounds.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many other friends or family at all and mostly work, but I feel I do need my own space and have my own life and I'm trying as much as seems reasonable to be with him.

367,"just for clarification, i am a guy.

So there's a guy at my uni (i'll call him A) who is known to sleep around a lot. One of my female friends confided in me a year or so ago that he had raped her. She came back to his room while drunk and said she wasn't willing to go further than oral when he asked but he pressured her into it. I gently tried to encourage her to do something about it but she didn't want to and that's fair enough. He's a very popular guy and all the embarassing details would come out for her while she was still trying to make friends at uni - she just wanted to move on. Also, it was a situation where he pressured her into it which would be much harder to prove. He didn't hold her down while she said no but he clearly didn't understand consent - he managed to get an ""i'm not sure"" out of her after she had said no and took that as consent. 

I recently found out that another friend of mine was raped by the same guy. I don't know the full details of this. Given the guys reputation and these two instances, I think it is very likely that is is a regular occurrence. girls can't come forward because all attention would be on them and the guy is very popular.

Obviously i am in no position to take action on behalf of the girls. if they don't want to, that's their choice and it would be horrible to expose them like that. But i've thought that maybe he just doesn't understand consent and he's convinced himself what he's doing is ok and that pressuring girls into sex is fine. This doesn't excuse him but it does pose a potential solution to the problem. I could get his university e-mail address and could anonymously email him with some advice that lets him know that a few of the girls he slept with consider his actions to be rape and that maybe he should be more careful.

Idk, maybe it would just give him a little reality check. But on the other hand i would hate for it to get out of hand and for everything to come out because the girls don't want that.

wtf do i do. I'm leaning towards doing nothing but it makes me sick to see him round campus and know that he's probably going to do it again

368,"Hey guys! I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, let me know! 

I currently do web development for a living. The pay is good and the people/company are amazing, I am just not as enthusiastic with my actual role. I can't imagine myself doing this kind of career for the rest of my life. I like the fact I get to design stuff sometimes, it's my favourite part actually! It's just all the backend work that I am not really good at/do not enjoy doing. I am a computer science graduate. I had a really hard time when getting my degree but I wanted to finish it so I struggled through. So I know this isn't what I should be doing, problem is I have no idea what I SHOULD be doing.  

I have thought about going back to school for HCI (to hopefully do UI UX afterwords) or Graphic Design (because I like the design stuff and am not confident enough to have a career in illustration). I want to do something that has value to people(brings them joy in a shitty time, etc), and think maybe one of these might help get me there. But I am open to suggestions. 

SO here's the question. How do you figure out what the right path for your career is? How do you find something you love/can see yourself doing for the rest of your life. Is there any resources for this kind of thing? Should I go to therapy? I pretty much open to any suggestion if you think it will help

I am just not sure what the next step is. But thanks for reading! Sorry if that did not make a lot of sense.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a MA degree, yet I had trouble finding a suitable job and didn't want to continue in academia, so I went abroad and started my career in a call center. One year later I am now a level 2 agent in the call center, but I feel completely stuck. I have no idea what kind of job I would like to do, I only know the kinds of jobs I don't want or am not suitable for. My current job is not extremely challenging, it is quite repetitive, I deal a lot with negative pissed off customers and I don't feel like I make a very good shot at progressing further than level 2 here in this company. I do not see myself as a manager at all, and as a level 2 I've kind of reached the ceiling here in this call center. I kind of want to stay another year but only for the experience/my CV, not because I am truly passionate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like the city I live in (in europe), it's always raining and the rent is super expensive. But I feel like if I move abroad again I'll just end up in another shitty callcenter, except maybe it's slightly sunnier outside and that's it. I won't be progressing forward at all. Same if I go for another job in another company here, I'll just be in another shitty callcenter and have to start all over again, at least now I'm level 2.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had a relationship and have barely come even close to it. Since a couple weeks of dating beginning of this year with someone who turned out to be an asshole I have hardly made any effort at meeting new people at all.

I don't really have super exciting hobbies even outside of work. I play some games, I recently started to learn Chinese because I want to travel to china but other than that it's mostly drinking and smoking weed. When I'm not drinking with friends (my only social interactions outside of work really) I'm drinking at home. It is not that I am addicted to the substance, I am mostly using it out of boredom and not having much more useful stuff to do.

I just feel like I'm stuck and that I won't make significant changes for the better by changing things up. I know people who have been in this loop of customer support job + drinking at nights for years and years and I don't want to end up like this.

What I meant about  hard jealousy is; I always felt sad afterwards, often for longer periods and the sad feeling would just come back every time I reminded myself.

In the start of my second term first year one of my classmates asked me out, which I  declined. We were in the same friend circle and it just felt weird for me, so naturally I shouldn't feel jealous if she hit on other guys. But I still did, and it just caused me to become more and more sad. However I found myself getting over it like a month later. Still it was a hard time for me and I don't even know why I got jealous. So why am I writing this post?

384,"So I have struggled with two things: dating and finances. Both of them have been problems I’ve been trying to flip since my early 20’s, but have made only minimal progress in. I’m working on the dating part, but I still feel stuck with my career life, and feel like I HAVE to make a change now before I get any older.

I’m 31 years old, having worked retail most of my life, with some other menial jobs here and there. I’ve never made more than maybe 15k in a year’s time, I’ve only technically had a full time job for a couple of years, and I have no degrees or any trade certifications other than a personal training cert. I went to community college off and on, but the work was too difficult while juggling one or two jobs and I would never finish. I always had trouble with the math/accounting side of the curriculums I was studying. 

Up until June, I had been working in grocery stores (produce), which I generally liked the work and liked working with people, but it never paid enough or gave me enough hours. I had gotten a job at a plant but I couldn’t handle the fast paced work environment (plus no lunch breaks and long shifts), so I had to let it go. It paid decent, but it was killing me physically and mentally and I would’ve gotten fired even if I didn’t quit. I kept forgetting how to do stuff, and quite frankly I hated every second of it. 

So now I got a full time job working security. It’s pretty cozy and stress free, but it doesn’t pay well and it isn’t challenging at all. It pays the bills, but I’m left with little money to save for anything significant like a savings account, stocks and bonds, emergency fund, etc. and I damn sure don’t make enough that I can move out of my parents house, which I think is part of what hurts my dating life, among other things. 
Also no health insurance; I can’t even afford the barebones policy offered by my company. 

I’m also a personal trainer at my local YMCA, which is a job I love doing and enjoy greatly, but I can’t get enough clients in my small little town to make even regular side-hustle money. I’ve tried marketing myself through word of mouth, social media, and business cards, but nothing seems to work to build my clientele and possibly make a living off of something I actually LIKE to do. 

I live about an hour away from my closest “big” city (Columbia, SC), and I made it a mission to move there so I can experience more of well...everything. More things to do, new people to meet, and more women I can date. I’ve tried applying for jobs there, at least something close to what I’ve done in retail but in management, but haven’t had any luck. 

I’ve been doing a lot of reading and research on investing in the stock market, and it’s something I really want to do but lack the funds at my current level of income to do so. I just really want a job that pays enough, close to the $1000 per week mark, that I can move out, make a decent living, and begin investing and make a lot more money so that I can retire fairly early and make a passive income. 

So hopefully someone can provide me some guidance and advice. I’m willing to bust my ass and work hard to get to where I need to be, I’m just honestly lost on what to do, and I’m starting to feel like there isn’t much hope. I’ve been having occasional thoughts of suicide and wanting to die, because I’m still stuck in this rut - stuck in dead end jobs, only having had one girlfriend and a very minimal sex life, and still living at home. I just want to turn my life around.

So when I was a kid, I followed piano lessons every week and my mother would always come with me. I was good at it and my parents were so proud of me when I played their favorite songs. I even played background music in a small performance at school, so basically it was what made me unique.

Except I was a dumb kid, and when I got into my anime phase at a young age, I requested my teacher to teach me ""This is halloween"" by Marilyn Manson. She accepted and gave me a difficult sheet to play. When I discovered it was too hard, I wanted to give up on this song and continue the usual pretty music. But my dumb ass brain could not bring me to tell her, so I just straight up quit the lessons and abandoned my precious and expensive piano. My parents were saddened by my decision but I acted like I didn't care. 

Five or six years later, right now, I suddenly feel the urge to continue playing the piano. It is actually my biggest regret ever, because nothing makes me unique or interesting to others anymore.

We are open with how we feel about each other, but don't talk about our feelings as they apply to the world and how we see ourselves. I don't think he realizes how much of my day is consumed by fears of betrayal and rejection. Not just by him, but by everyone I come into contact with.

So I just had a child (2 weeks ago) and currently live with my mom. The father of my child has since moved into my moms house. We share the same bed (queen) and room where I have the crib and everything set up. I stopped working to have this child, I’m a server so it is unpaid, and spend all day and night with her. He took a week off and has been back at work now for over a week. He works construction and is in the sun all day long (we live in Arizona) from about 5:30-2ish. He also goes to school twice a week in the evenings. Already he had a lot on his plate, so during week I let him sleep from 10pm on as I know how physically demanding the job can be. However, this is making me resentful as I am lacking sleep and have never been a napper. I also allow him to do things during the evening (he’ll run it by me to make sure I’m okay with it) and he has good communication making sure everything is alright with baby and myself, but sometimes he’ll come home spend maybe an hour with her and have to go to sleep for work where I’m left to take care of everything. My problem is I feel this set up is making me slowly resent him more and more and all of his freedom as I feel like a human feeding machine. Even if I wanted to take a day off I couldn’t as I would have to pump throughout the day to keep producing milk for our child. Also, as selfish as it may sound, I’m  not benefiting at all from him working as I’m not collecting child support (since he’s involved in her life) and we are not together. I’m on the verge of kicking him out during the week as I feel there is no reason for him to sleep here if I’m not getting any help at night.

396,"Hello, 

I'm looking for some advice here. I'm 31 and recently made the decision to go back to school after leaving a job I was very unhappy with that I held for almost 5 years. Before that I worked two years as a teacher (after doing an accelerated teaching cert program). Although I did well on evaluations as a teacher and generally had good rapport with my principals, I found the job to be too stressful for the money. I also live in Arizona which is literally ranked as number 50 out of 51 for teachers. Needless to say, it's a career with a high turnover. It's hard for me to say if I would have stuck with it had I been in a state with a better education system. So, I took a job in a lab as a tech that I stuck with for 5ish years. Although it worked well for a year or two I eventually hit a point where I wasn't learning anything new, there was not career development, and I couldn't move up, so I felt stagnated. This feeling eventually became overwhelming and decided I needed to move on. I made the decision to go back to school full time for engineering. I'm 1/3 of the way through the semester. I'm doing fine in my classes but am starting to feel like this may not be for me. I enjoy the building and math, but am hating the physics part for whatever reason. On top of that before I started the program I was debt free (I have a very small amount of debt from the program so far and could easily pay it back). Now, I'm starting to have doubts and worrying I am putting myself back into debt for something I'm just not sure about. 

My SO is very supportive and just wants me to get into something I find fulfilling. He only recently started his ""adult"" career as a programmer and seems to love it. He keeps suggesting maybe I just take a step back, work part time at a low responsibility job (like a coffee shop or as a clerk or even just substitute teach as I still have a cert to sub) and give myself some time to really think about what I'm doing. I'm concerned that I am 31 without a real career and don't want to become overly dependent on someone else but also feel like I have a very strong and supportive relationship. I've never really had a lot of family support so I've always thought about career with my head rather than my heart mostly due to fear of falling into poverty. I should also mention we are both musicians and play gigs from time to time. I've always struggled with the desire to have a creative career while being a practical minded person. It's just never been clear decision for me. 

So, I guess I feel like I am at a crossroad. I'm not sure if I should stick out the rest of the semester or just give myself some space to really find out what may be a better fit. Sometimes I think I'm not at all cut out for a career. My workload in school, at the moment, does not allow me much time out of school for any extra exploring. I think it's possible I'm burnt out.

397,"Hi there, r/advice.

I've been at my current job for three years. I've been overlooked for a promotion three times, I have never gotten a raise while here, and my motivation to succeed here is dwindling. I was recently given a pay bump due to my union (appearing in my check within the next few weeks), and I'm putting in a raise request now. But I'm not happy. 

My job is stressful. I work with students, and I work a lot of non-traditional hours. There is an on-call component to my job. I have a lot of hats to wear in this position, and it's wearing me thin. Especially because I've been made promises about advancement that never came to fruition. 

I have an opportunity to take a new job. I got a callback today, and things are looking promising. The idea of leaving this area (one I left my family behind to move to) is riddling me with anxiety. I love the town I live in. I love the students I work with. I like the routine I have here. I like the apartment I'm in (provided by my job).

This new job would be close to home, but me moving 3 hours away from my boyfriend (moving in together isn't going to be possible right away). I would start paying rent. I would be leaving behind the life I created here in this new town, at my first post-grad job. But I would be making a hell of a lot more money, and be able to live comfortably.

I'm so anxiety ridden about this. I'm heartbroken I have to make this decision, because I really saw this job as a long-term opportunity for me. I guess I'm just wracked by sadness that this didn't work out, but optomistic that I can be somewhere where I'm supported, make good money, and be able to get the professional advancement I've wanted for the past two and a half years.

Help please.",04Oct2018,1

Most of my colleagues have been treating me nicely, but one of them keeps acting as if I were really, and I mean REALLY dumb. Obviously, I‘m very insecure and striving to do my very best, meaning I‘m asking a lot of questions. I get that for people who are experienced on the field, this might be exhausting. However, I‘m just trying to do well. I never had to meter blood pressure before, so I needed instructions and help. She was hella annoyed. As there isn‘t much for me to do, she wanted me to do handicrafts with patients. Wasn‘t happy with the way things turned out, kept being incredibily rude about how ugly and weird it was looking...in front of the patients. I then started asking for her opinion on things as she kept complaining - she then told me she had better things to do than trying to find something for me to do and stormed off getting lunch.
When I’m not keeping patients busy with basically anything, she‘s bitchy towards me - however, I‘m just trying to adjust to patients wants, and most of them don‘t want to be entertained all the time but prefer having some time to relax.
I might be a bit sensitive due to the lack of sleep but we really are not getting along well. As I‘ll be working there for assumably the next 6 months, I‘d like to ask for advice on the subject. What could I do to make her and the rest of my colleagues to think a little higher of me?",04Oct2018,1

408,"So for a bit of background. 

26F, just graduated college and am working my first ""real"" job, I put myself through school so I'm a couple years behind. Been at my job about a year and a half. My mom is a single parent and I'm an only child. I've been working in San Francisco, after attending school in the Bay Area but cost of living is forcing me out. I've not been able to save anything. My salary is around 65k and my employer is allowing me to work remotely on a trial basis (I already work remotely in SF, our team has folks from NYC, Florida, SoCal and now I'll be in the Pacific Northwest). 

I'm moving home to save money to buy my grandparent's property. It would cost me about 75k (I want to save around 20k this year) and pay off my credit card debt (5k) as well as start paying down my student loans (\~22k). In comparison to SF cost of living, the amount I'll have to help out with bills at home is very minimal. My mom makes about 25k a year, in a rural area. 

The last few weeks my mom has been hinting that I should help her pay off her car, and other debt but I'm balking at that. She doesn't pay any rent or have a mortgage, as it is my grandparent's guest house that she's living in, and I'm more than happy to split bills and food costs 50/50 and help out around the house (you know... like a normal human). I don't have a car myself but will need to buy one because we live in a rural area.

We've also gotten into a couple minor fights about the state of the house. I want to spend some money to make repairs, as the house is in really bad shape (front door has a hole in it, the ceiling is falling in because of a water leak in one room, the kitchen light fixture is broken so there is no light in the kitchen, etc etc etc) but she gets offended and starts saying that I'm judging her. It usually ends in a screaming match. She's very insecure that I make significantly more than her, and when I try to do nice things it upsets her because she can't do the same for me. I don't want her to spend money on me... but she sees it as a failing that she's not the breadwinner. 

I love my mom dearly, and really want to make this work. I don't know how to handle telling her no, I won't help her with her car payment until I'm settled in and have a car of my own, and that I'm not trying to be judgmental but that these are things that HAVE to be done. Not having a light in the kitchen is crazy, having a hole in the front door where the wind and snow can blow through is not okay... the ceiling is going to fall in if I don't fix the dry wall... and I could do it all for less than one month's rent in SF. 

**TLDR:** Basically any advice from folks who've moved back in with family, or currently live with family as adults about setting boundaries and communication would be super helpful. I'm moving home to save money, and I have to dig myself out of my own financial hole and get stable before I can help my mom, how can I explain this in a gentle way? My worst fear is that we're going to constantly fight and she's going to be resentful because I'm making ""so much"" and she's struggling with debt. ",04Oct2018,1

411,"Little background here. Been working for the big, well-known retail chain for almost 2 years. I’m almost 18, and already had a pay raise after the 1-year mark of $1. Now, with this new opportunity, I get another $1 raise with opportunities for raises after each year of being there. The position is less than an assistant manager, but more-so the manager of a specific group. A team leader, if you will. 

So here’s my dilemma. Being only 17 and getting this pay is really nice in the long run- especially with trying to save and prepare for college. My managers have spoken with me for months now about this position with me, but it always seemed to end with, “Well, when the position become available you’re our first pick!” and that was it. Now, as the position is available I was spoken to about taking it. It seems like a no-brainer to just take it, but I feel like I’d be jumping the gun almost? I’d be in charge of people much older than myself, and although it’s nice to be told I was first pick, a friend of mine kinda made me realize that this is just retail- the turnover rate is high and I just happened to fall into this position. It’s also significantly more stressful, and there’s a slight chance I might get less hours than I currently do. The person’s place I’m taking is also the only person who really steps up and takes charge out of the 2 other people who share this position. They spoke to me last night and warned me about taking it. Not sure if that was out of spite of me replacing them or genuine concern.

430,"Hi! So this probably sounds weird unless you ~get it~ but I’m new-ish to Reddit and figured this might be worth a shot.

I’m that friend in my group that always takes the pictures. Just with my phone and stuff, not my camera. But I take candids of everyone and videos and usually splice them all up or edit them really nicely, and everyone enjoys having photos of themselves and videos of themselves. It’s a small pleasure humans have, to see what they look like when they don’t know anyone is photographing them, or to have it when they’re older.

Problem is, there aren’t any of me! That might sound conceited, but it isn’t meant to—it’s just usually that all of the pictures I’m in, I’ve asked them to take it, and we look posed. Sometimes I just want photos of myself doing the things I love with the people I love, since I’m 19, for me to look at when I’m old.

How do I ask my friends to take more pictures and not make it weird? Lol",04Oct2018,1
431,"28 at the time and my first wasp sting. My bicep/triceps area swelled and it ached for a couple hours after but the pain was localized and subsided overtime.

HOWEVER

Since then, roughly every 4 months (it has happened three times since), the spot where I was stung will redden, swell, and itch a bit. 

I can’t find the spot if I’m looking at it now, but there will come a time in a few months when i will feel an itch and find what looks to be a small insect bite in that same area. It takes a couple days to go away, but otherwise it’s harmless.

It doesn’t seem to be an allergy or an infection, so has anyone experience similar lingering “phantom” stings?",04Oct2018,1
432,"Throwaway account.

I’ve been working a great job the last 6 years, we have a great team and a lot of support from our immediate managers (I am mid-level, reporting to the VP).  Senior leadership is “meh”. 

Recently I found out from one of my co-workers that they have accepted a job at a company out of state.  This person is currently on a 2-week vacation and plans on giving their 2 week notice when they return.  This was planned purposefully.  While this person is a great employee, they have been badmouthing the company for a while now behind their backs to anyone who will listen - and it’s been poisoning the well for a lot of us.

Normally this would not be a big deal - I keep my mouth shut, let this employee give their notice and move on.  Unfortunately, by this particular employee leaving, it really leaves a huge gap to be filled.  This person had taken on a lot of roles that are specific and I’m worried that 2 weeks is not going to be anywhere close to the time needed to backfill the position properly.  This person leaving also seriously affects my job.

But here is my biggest concern:  The last person who put in their 2 week notice a while back was walked out the same day.  Not a result of my supervisor, but by out-of-touch senior leadership.  I’m worried that her “2 week notice” will be closer to a 2 hour notice.

So the question is:

Do I reveal my knowledge of this employee so we can get a jump on backfilling the position?  My immediate supervisor is someone that I trust.  The result may end up being the same, but at least we can get a head start.  Start head hunting in secret or something.

OR

STFU?  This is the direction that I’m leaning.  If leadership walks the employee on the day they gives her notice, that’s on them and they should deal with the consequences.",04Oct2018,1

439,"Alright it's story time i hope you enjoy this as much as it hurt me to write it and i'm going in full details here i'll try to make it entertaining for you.

Not trying to sound cocky but this is vital for the story i'm a 8.5/10 she is a 9.5/10 we are both white skinny she works at a beauty salon so she looks like a painting.

Co worker introduced me to this woman i saw her in a photo and made a joke ""Damn she is gorgeous"" honestly didn't even get a good look at the picture, Couple days later she hits me with a txt it says ""I showed her a couple pictures of you to her and she thinks your cute"" Alright bet give her my number, She txt me and she is super nice like to nice the kind of nice your grandma would be.. Anyways we do this for a couple days and dialog about some bs we set up a date with her friend that introduced us, I'm thinking alright maybe she is shyer than i anticipated i do my research find out she just got out of a toxic relationship that lasted 4-8 months per usual with these disastrous beautiful women I've been through this before at least that's what i thought lol. 

Date Day (yes i spent an entire day with this woman like 10am to 10pm) 

I know how to dress we both do and we were both impressed we started at a local coffee shop jokes were thrown around nothing awkward we brought up some of past with her friend and i then started laughing over some of my old facebook photos lol cool not cool, Next up we go to a store it was a hole in the wall like a nice store just off the normal had alot of antiques and what not, We talk a little bit at a time finding out little information about each other typical stuff like playing Tag we buy some stuff and hit the road for the city.

After almost being killed by our friends driving we make it and start walking along the boardwalk browsing stores we start getting closer and really talking about misc. stuff people were looking at us weirdly because they could obviously tell her and I were a thing so using my wits and charm we end up holding hands and it was nice we walked past people and overheard compliments like ""They are cute together"" or smiles and pointing i even had alot of glances from women that our friend would love to point out to her :o 

So we get on this boat ride a tour of sorts and we hold each other in an embracing and loving way it's like she has been my gf for a long time and I've known her for years, The ride ends and we get back in the car and go to a restaurant she falls asleep in my arms and i'm just thinking is this normal? Do i deserve this woman? Am i lucky? I fall asleep holding her we wake up and before the restaurant we shop for clothes another good moment together then we pick up our friends bf and have a double date it goes well there was a moment a kid dropped her ipad so i came to the rescue for her and i could tell i got some points for that.

We say goodbye to our friends and i drive her to her car we made out for 20 min at least i didn't press her for sex or anything because at this point i'm thinking i care about this woman and i want this night to be remembered so we say goodbye and goodnight, I said i don't want to press you and i want to go out and do this again she agrees but i feel liek she was a little disappointed. 

So i texted her she wasn't giving me much back and this point i was thinking we were a thing but in her eyes it was just a date she said she wasn't ready for a relationship but to stay in her life and she would be grateful basically signaling in time she would be ready, I find out she is talking to other guys of course she is she is a 9.5/10 she gets to choose but i'm not the guy to be a number growing up i never chased women they would chase me so i ended it maybe it was pride.

Do some women just want the sensations of being with a guy and not the actual relationship?

Do some women just want new experiences and hate the build up of all the bullshit?

I can understand it but i'd say make your intentions clear so at least we could have had a complete experience and have a closure for both of us.

440,"So, today has been god-awful. I would call this performance anxiety if it weren't for that I don't care about actually performing in front of people - it's what happens when I mess up. I make a mistake or a lot of them, then I try and fail to get back in line with everyone. My mistakes pile up on each other. I panic and can't tear my head away from that I'm the only person making my mistakes, and then that I'm the only person trying not to cry, and then I AM crying - inconsolably. My whole world crashes down on me, and all it takes is a little setback. I thought I grew out of this, but I haven't, and it's \*wonderful\* knowing that I have the emotional control of a child. There is not escape. There is no ""Don't focus on anyone else and you'll be fine!"" , no ""Take a deep breath"", no ""Don't beat yourself up so much."" Nothing. 

I have. Nothing.

My meltdown today was after being filmed in my beginner's ballet class for a midterm. The music was hard to count to, I can't separate what I should be doing from what the person in front of me is doing, the teacher isn't counting - it started as a disaster and kept getting worse. I keep messing up horribly despite doing fine in a normal class, and it's all I can do to fight back the tears. Every time it was my turn to work and be recorded, all I did was fuck up, and that was all I could think about. Eventually we do some more or less simple stuff, and I throw my hands in the air and have to walk away from the rest of the group. I spent some time in the bathroom after class bawling my eyes out.

I did something similar on a bigger scale when I was 15. I tried out for the school musical, messed up the audition, and was spiraling. I had to croak Happy Birthday and then leave crying. I rather dramatically quit the musical one practice after many nights of being the only person fucking up while learning choreography and songs too quickly. I ran out crying. I never came back.

I used to do this all the time in class, just without running out. A problem would be too hard, too much, and then I would look around the room and see everyone else doing perfectly fine while I drowned. I'm incompetent and embarrassing, and I can't NOT be incompetent and embarrassing. I hate myself for this so much.

449,"Long context story short: I got into my 1st relationship at 16, was with her for 2.5 years, she broke up with me a few months ago. Time has passed, wish no ill on her, and ready to move on. Joined a dating website for the first time in my life and have had to take selfies and shit which I've never really done before.

I won't get into the specifics of the dating website itself, mainly as it's based on a preference and/or fetish depending on who you ask on there and I don't want to send trolls over to it as it's rampant with them rn. But the basic idea is that there's a main timeline for anyone to post on it, along with a timeline that's local to people in your area (idk if this a common format or not) and you can like posts &amp; follow people. Some people use it for chatting, others for dating, and a few others use it to sell their own 'content'; at the moment I'm chatting to people along with making general posts you'd likely see on Twitter or Facebook, and I've followed a few people I think are cute that aren't too far from where I'm based.

There has been at least one small moment where I made a post about seeing a cute girl on a train where we exchanged glances and smiled a few times and someone commented below jokingly implying it was them and I should have said hello, which I played along with the same sort of manner, but that is currently the extent of my flirtatiousness in the past 6 months.

I wasn't confident around girls for probably 12-13 years, and once I got to that point I still was quite shy, but not as much to an extent. Years have gone by and while my mates all went through their own experiences of getting with girls, asking them out and the sort, I stayed in the back and just didn't do much as I didn't think anyone would find me remotely attractive. And even when I got a girlfriend, it was only because she made a move on me and not vice-versa, which was great and all and I don't regret anything, but I'm almost 20 and I basically have no knowledge on how to start a conversation with a girl or appear appealing.

There are some decent people on this website that I'd like to at least try starting a conversation with, but something just tells me that I won't be able to do a decent icebreaker or appear interesting enough for someone to want to reply back and hold a back-and-forth conversation with me. I imagine it'd come with practice, but I don't really want to speak to people and use them as stepping stones, you know? I don't know if there's any sort of technique I can do that'll help improve my confidence in all of his that doesn't use other people and potentially their emotions, but it's getting to the point know where if I don't tackle the fact I'm not able to speak to anyone, it'll last for decades beyond this and I'll end up alone from other people.

450,"Hi Reddit, I’ve been having this problem for a while and I’ve decided that I’ve had enough and want to ask the wonderful people on the internet because this is my last resort. 

I am 16 years old and a senior in high school. I’ve never had the best grades in school, and as a result my home life has been kind of a mess. Well now that I am a senior I have really turned things around. I got my license over the summer, and I have followed all of her very strict rules, told her everything, been home on time, and never went anywhere if she didn’t give me permission. As well as this school year so far I have kept a B average, and even at teacher conferences the teachers told my parents nothing negative. So you would expect everything to stop right? For them to see that I’ve stepped up and can be trusted? Well apparently not.

At the beginning of the summer I went on an important retreat called a kairos retreat. I go to a catholic all boys school and this retreat is for seniors and generally viewed as life changing. Well on that retreat there’s a notebook we write in about everything that’s conflicting and just generally anything. So I happened to write in there that my friend tried smoking weed once, and about how I might try it. That was something bothering me at the time. When I came home I left my notebook in my bag not thinking I should be worried, as the parents know and are informed to try and leave the people alone after they’ve came back. Well the next two days later, I got into a huge argument with my parents and slept over a friends house. While I was away, my mom went and read my notebook. This is what alerted her. Now she shouldn’t have read that, and still does not care in the slightest bit that she destroyed our relationship. Every time I put my trust in her she takes it and tries to control me and ruins it.

So now I’ve tried smoking for the first time. Well guess what. She’s obviously onto me and I have absolutely no idea why the fuck she keeps questioning me and harassing me and interrogating me. So then I get my drivers license a week later. I follow all of her rules and claims over time I will get more freedoms as I keep following her rules. However she gets even more strict, questioning me about who I hang out with, spying on me, trashing through my room to try and find anything to say I am doing something wrong. 

Now comes the school year. It starts up great and is still going great, I’m doing good in all my classes, something I have not done before. The past years they’ve always said do good in school and we will let you go out with your friends and do stuff that we haven’t before. So at this point I’m just really stressed because they will not give up on me, they keep pushing me harder and harder, questioning me more and more, then when I get mad, using my anger against me and saying I’m being aggressive, and I have absolutely no idea why. So at one point during an argument my mom reveals that she read my very personal notebook. She knows that it’s personal, and she knows the meaning and importance of it. (For all of you who may not understand, this kairos retreat is like a three day event where the people involved talk about their problems and grow very close and also pray a lot, it was something that lifted up my spirits for a little while and gave me some hope) 

I met so many new friends during the summer and tried to go out, and even after following the rules I got absolutely nowhere. So if you can’t guess, I started smoking quite a bit more. Now the problem in the story isn’t weed. It was something I did on weekends with friends and honestly was great for stress, I’ve stopped now for a while until I get on a better foot with this whole situation. But the harassment continued. So when she told me she read the notebook I was very mad and it hit me why they kept questioning me. I was following all the rules and the whole time they kept trying to bust me at the cost of their energy and my sanity. 

Well, one day recently at a doctor appointment, my mom pulled a surprise drug test on me. And on top of that, the week before that, they made a fake Snapchat account posing as one of my friends and got me to send a picture of some weed. 

Reddit, I really need some advice. I’m trapped in a really bad corner right now, and I’m going down the mental health decline really bad. I’m still trying hard in school and following my parents rules and I’m getting nowhere. I’m going insane. Please give me some advice on what to say or do. ",04Oct2018,1

In my early twenties I had a bit more clarity as to what I wanted to be doing, but as the days go one I become less sure. It used to be film production, but I never really had time to build a portfolio, I was pretty much constantly working retail to make ends meet. Now I slave as a retail manager and don’t even have time to spend being creative at all. All I know is what I want is a job that has reasonable hours and pays at least $40,000 a year. I’ve found that I cannot even get through the pass/fail at most places and haven’t even been able to secure an interview pretty much any place I apply.

Right now I’m on a slippery slope into retail purgatory and I don’t want it, but feel overwhelmed and burnt out from spending so much of my time working here, sometimes I work multiple 12-14 hour shifts in a week and the challenge of moving to something else feels insurmountable.

I spend a lot of time working my resume for each job, but no matter what I just get rejected constantly, even for jobs labeled as “entry level”.

I always told myself it was easier to do things on my own, because I would have control of the situation and it is less stressful that way, but I never realized how boring or lonely it was I guess. Everything that I used to love doing just seems dull to me now, like the enjoyment of it was sapped away and when I try to get back into it, there's no joy-juice there for me to \*want\* to do it, and I feel like it's because I have been isolating myself on purpose because I've been telling myself that's what I like, but maybe it's not what I like anymore?

I don't live alone, I talk to people every day, nothing about my life has really changed to make me feel this way)

456,"22/M. Final year of uni. 

A number of things seem to be going horribly wrong and they are all my fault: 

1) Damn near unbearable regret over not - cultivated potential romance: Last year there was a girl in two of my classes; obviously I liked her (still do). If I could paint a picture of my ideal, it would be her; not only her physical qualities, but her personality/demeanor as well. She's a bit of a loner. Very quiet, a bit shy, but still obviously will not be swayed by other people's crap. Blah blah blah long story short I really like(d) her. 

It became obvious to me towards the last half of the semester that the feeling was mutual, but my anxiety got in the way and I failed to ask her out when I should have. I am certain of very few things, but I am certain of this: she would have said ""yes."" 

This is nearly 10 months ago and it's *still* gnawing at me every day since. I have tried to observe it; I have tried writing about it (extensively) in my journal; I have taking on other interests and responsibilities to get my away from it; I have tried to feel it as deeply and as painfully as possible and it still will not dissipate. It bleeds into everything I do. 

Why was it my fault? Because I had an opportunity which I didn't take. 

What could my life be like now if I had taken it? Shit keeps me up at night. 

2) I lack a stable friend group: 

All throughout grade school, high school, and the first year or so of university I had a stable friend group. These were guys I had been friends with since I was five years old. They were my best friends. 

We don't hang out anymore. I found myself separating from them around the end of high school/beginning of first year uni. Everything became so *routine*. Like, every Friday/Saturday it was the same shit: drink and smoke shitty weed until 3 a.m. Every. Single. Time. Even the conversations became routine: video games, girls, and shit talking endlessly. Yes it was fun, and I miss the bantz, but it was not fulfilling and it was getting old. 

I also started noticing around this time a bit of my social anxiety worsening. For some reason, I became quite anxious of hanging out with them. So I would often decline going out. 

Haven't spoken to them in years. I find myself really depressed lately over this. I have very few friends now, and none I would even consider *good* friends. The whole thing has left me lost and lonely. 

3) I lack direction: 

When I was in high school everything I did was goal directed and I was oriented towards something. I haven't felt that way in three years, and it is slowly killing me from the inside. I feel like a completely different *me""; like right now I am the worst version of myself that I have ever been. 

I don't have any clear plans for the future. I don't know what I want. I don't see any hope for fulfilling relationships. I haven't done anything with any real intensity and *heart* for years. 

What's worse is that the only thing I ever heard from teachers in high school was about how ""smart"" I was. Shit I even had one tell me I was ""brilliant,"" and that I would ""change the world."" Well I don't see that happening at all. It's like any potential I once had has just evaporated. In some sense I feel like those years was just one big lie. I mean I lost all my uni scholarships for fuck sake. 

There's more I'm not getting at here because I can't seem to bring it up out of my brain right now. 

Any advice? Anything to say? Just feeling... low. ",04Oct2018,1

Then that person I was talking too finds it awkward too talk to me. 

Like on moday we did this school thing and I was getting along great with a guy I had previously had a crush on (but that was long ago i was over it) and i think she knew. So we talked and got along great and then she comes in takes me by the arm and goes three steps back. 

And says the things she usually does during situations like this. She laughed and he looked at me really weirdly. I tried too talk too him for the rest of the day but he didn't wanna talk after that.

462,"He has been kind of distant lately. We are 29/m and 30/f. I’preventative started dating and I went on a two week vacation and he made us official before I left because he didn’t want me to ghost him or anything.

Well he was going to get me from the airport super early and I told him my mom agreed to get me becaus that is super early and I always make him miss sleep and I felt bad because he had work. He replied and said thanks for letting him sleep. I’ve been busy in my trip doing stuff and he texted me again asking about my day later and I didn’t respond because I was pretty busy. 

He then asked me this morning: Hey is everything alright? Seems like like message you sent was for me to not get you from the airport and then have been quiet? 

I said: Yeah! I just knew you had work and I always keep you from sleeping. I went to a big mountain on a long ass tour yesterday and this morning I went snorkeling early af

Of course he didn’t respond like he usually does. Is this a lame response? I like to marinade over things that upset me for a few days to make sure I am not over reacting. My ex told me I always over reacted and should not share my feelings until I have mulled over things for a while. 

I mean I just feel like he doesn’t seem to care that much and only reaches out when I go quiet. I hate this game.

465,"I was told to repost my post from r/letsnotmeet here, because I’m asking for advice on a creepy neighbor situation! Do you guys think I should be worried? What should I do about all of this?

—-
Hi all, this is my first time posting to this sub. This just happened last night/this morning (around 2:30 AM). I definitely don’t want to meet or ever see who I heard last night, but am also looking for advice on if I should actually be as freaked out as I am. Let’s get to it! 

I’ll start off by saying I don’t live in the nicest area. It’s not crime ridden, but I don’t feel comfortable around any of the people (including my building’s security guards, who spend a lot of time sleeping) in my town or apartment building. 

So last night I was getting ready to go to bed. I turned off my TV, AC, etc and it was completely silent in my living room. I’m sitting on the couch and I hear people talking from what sounds like the back balcony next to us (I live on a higher floor). Nothing unusual there, sound permeates our windows easily I guess. But I had never heard anyone speaking so clearly before. 

I keep playing around on my phone and I just get weirded out by the tone the more talkative man was speaking in (from what I could tell, there were two men. One older and one younger). I hear the word “ransom” and my ears perk up. Here’s some of what I caught after I began heavily eavesdropping:

“She won’t be looking for me, she knows you”

“The ransom was supposed to happen tonight. It still can” (this point was reiterated a few times) 

“Come 5am, this place is like The Walking Dead. People start checking their doors and shut. There’s no security in any of the buildings at that time”

And snippets of them talking about a neighbor they had who would walk around naked after she showered, and of Older Man telling Younger Man something along the lines of, “I’d invite her over while you’re gone next week, but her a bottle of wine, get her drunk. But she’s yours so I won’t do that.” This I thought was particularly weird. If he was referring to a woman that Younger Man was into, why would he mention getting her drunk alone? My initial, paranoid thought was that she is Younger Man’s “to take,” if that makes sense. 

It all ended bizarrely, when Older Man (who I learned lives a floor below me) came up to my floor and started banging on my neighbor’s door. I called security who came up and I heard Older Man mention it was about my neighbor’s dog... who I didn’t hear bark at all, so I’m not sure why he would have needed to bang on his door at 3AM. 

Anyway, now I’m terrified to leave the apartment since I leave so early! Creepy neighbors who might be planning something involving a ransom, please lets never, ever meet.  What do you guys think, do I have a reason to be worried?

466,"That may not be the best place to ask but i have nowhere else to turn to. And sorry it will be bit long. 
Somebody close to me lost his best friend 4 weeks ago in tragic circumstances. To add to that around 2 months prior to that he lost his beloved dog. When his dog was dying he said that ‘he cant live without her (dog)’ and that he will kill himself if something happens to her. So we basically can say within few weeks he lost his 2 best friends. 
After his dog died he wasnt really doing well, withdrawing himself, he actually had to move back to parents as couldnt stand living at his place without his dog. 
Now back to his friends death. 
After that happened he completely cut himself off. Like he stopped responding to my messages, didnt even tell me what happened until week after. I simply thought at first that he ghosted me. I was angry, sad, bitter, heartbroken etc. Then he told me what happened. Since then we only exchanged few messages. Last time he responded was 2 weeks ago. 
When he explained me what happened he said that he feels nothing matters, loving and caring doesnt matter anymore, that he sees future as blank space. And when his dog died he told me that after what happened he was afraid of getting attached to me (because of pain of losing) So im guessing he’s cutting me off as defensive mechanism kind of? Because of anxiety? 
I really dont know what to do, how to behave? I write him every 2-3 days basically just telling him im here for him, i care about him, im not going anywhere. But i just dont know, maybe I should leave him alone for a while? But then wont it cause him more depression as in his head it will confirm his anxiety about losing me? 
We live bit far away so its only messages for now ( cannot really go and visit him etc)
Can someone shed some light please what shall i do? I just spend days overthinking this whole thing, thinking of ways to get him talk to me, but i know at the end of the day i cannot make him talk if hes not ready. Im just heartbroken i cannot help him, that hes not letting me help him in those moments. Trying to not take it personal though. 
Thank you. ",04Oct2018,1
467,"I’ve been having issues where I’m perpetually exhausted: sleepy, physically drained, and dull. Seems like something that happens to most 21st century people, but I don’t feel like it consumes others to the same extent.

I’m a college student. On MWF my first class is at 10 but on TR my classes start at 8am. So to have a reasonable sleeping schedule I try to get up 6:30 M-F. I’ve always had trouble getting to sleep. Whether I go to bed 8pm, 10pm, or 1am it takes me over 2 hours to fall asleep. Which has always been an issue. But per night (according to my fit bit, which is often consistent with my sleep apps) I get around 6 hours of sleep on average.

The issue is, I can go to bed 8pm and get up 6:30am on Tuesday, go to my classes eat lunch, come home and sleep from 5-8. I could then go to bed at 10 and even though I’m supposed to get up at 6:30, I’ll sleep all the way through my Wednesday classes like till 1pm. But I still have no energy and I feel compelled to sleep all the time.

And the consequences of this is that I have no time to do any work. And when I try to stay awake to do it I just can barely keep my eyes open.

Today in one of my labs, we had a guest speaker come to talk about her project and before the lab we were meant to read over one of her scientific papers and then complete a 24 question homework assignment on it. Well, long story short, I feel asleep while reading the article and was 30 minutes late to class, where I wasn’t engaged at all.

I said I always have trouble going to sleep, but I always have an equally difficult time getting up. It’s no surprise to me if I’m supposed to get up 8am on Saturday if I actually sleep till 1pm. I am not a heavy sleeper. I’m a very very light sleeper...yet, I have several alarms. I “silent alarm” on my fit bit, my alarm clock, a daily alarm on my phone, and then an analog alarm on my phone. I wake up for each alarm, but whether it’s due to exhaustion or pure laziness on my part I just don’t get up.

My mom always says to listen to your body and if you need to sleep, sleep. But I don’t have time to sleep 14 hours a day.

Let me know if y’all think this is normal, a condition of some sort, or if you have ideas to improve the situation.",04Oct2018,1

I honestly don’t expect anyone to reply, but I’m too broke for a therapist so I’m hoping this helps me at least collect my thoughts. 

I want to say that my biggest issue right now is my “best friend” (air quote because she was) but if I’m being honest, it’s myself. I live in a shitty apartment in a shitty town. I’m constantly cleaning up after “bf”, with little to no help and no recognition or thanks when I clean. I have no car for transportation, so I take lyft to work but that gets pricy and leaves very little to save. I have the same school schedule as my “bf” so we drive together in her car. I’m broke, (roughly) 400 in CC debt. I eat well but boring to save money, protein shake for breakfast, rice and chicken for lunch and usually no dinner. I have no friends. I’m 21 and hate going out. 

I’m constantly, and I mean constantly, stuck at home. In my shitty apartment, spending my time stressing over everything. 

I have depression (and I’m sure something else non-diagnosed). So sitting in my room day in and day out is taking a toll on me. I used to hangout with “bf” often, until she got her boyfriend so now I never see her. When she is home, she’s in her room with the door shut. 

I also can’t afford a car yet, am constantly saving from paychecks. Very close to applying for a loan of some sort.

1. Dated him for the past 6 months

Problem:

1. Exchanged probably 20 seconds of verbage in total with her in all these 6 months. 

2. I asked her about what gift idea to get him for his birthday through Instagram multiple times and all spanning 7-8 days within each other so to not be annoying. No answer. Added her on Snapchat. Nothing. 

3. She told him “she’s holding off judgement about me” when he asked her about me. 

4. I saw her once at a family member’s birthday party and she avoided crossing paths with me or looking at me the whole time (there was only about 10 people in total and everyone stayed in the living room so paths would’ve, yknow, crossed )

5. Yes I’ve talked to him about it but he refuses to believe me.

It doesn’t hurt. I just really think it’s all unfair bc honestly we never had a real conversation and the first time she saw me, I immediately knew she didn’t like me with the way her body language was. I just don’t understand why she doesn’t like me or at least be courteous enough to communicate at a bare minimum.

Alright so, on one side I don’t want anything from them. But at the same time.. imma be leaving, the car was bought for 6k and yesterday I checked and it’s actually worth around 10k.. so that would be an additional 10k for me 

But ya. I kinda have the feeling dad is trying to use that to get me to stay and obviously that’s not happening but if he’s just using that as a motive to get me to stay and I do leave (which I am) then wouldn’t that be a little fucked up on my part?

In the past, his parents have strained close family relationships by expecting handouts without making sacrifices in order to try and make their own ends meet.  Their family has provided help in the past but have since cut them off because they would take the generous help (example: new hot water tank that they couldn't afford), then they would turn around and buy a new house and vehicle.

There is one surviving grandparent in the picture (whom was previously the main generous provider but has since cut them off) and he has major anxiety and stress about the aforementioned situations because he wants to ensure his 3 grandkids have what they need, but doesn't want to enable his daughter to be a mooch.

We are not trying to conceive bc we don’t want to have a child naturally that runs a high risk for example autism. Reason for us going the In Vitro route. Our doctors were pulling for us but it was out of their hands. 

We were told it was a Arkansas law established in 1990 stating that a couple had to be trying to conceive for at least 2 years and if un successful insurance would step in and cover up to 80%. Our coverage is with Blue Cross and Blue shield.

Anyway, I am currently in my sophomore year of high school, I have been going to the same school for 5 years now (starting at 6th) and I enjoyed my time there with some really great friends. However, last year 2 of my best friends left the school for reasons I can understand, mainly that there was too many people and there was a fair bit violence (especially in 9th grade). Recently I have started to look into a boarding school that my mother works at (cleaning/house keeping) and so far it looks pretty good and my mother has really been wanting me to go since its quite a prestigious school.  If I were to go to this school I would need to live at the school which is not an issue for me since the school is still within a couple of miles of my house. Now, the reasons I am conflicted with this decision are that I would be leaving behind old friends (not as big of a deal since I talk to my friends constantly on discord) and I would have to make new friends which is my biggest concern, as I am not the most social person ever and to make matters worse, from what I know, a large majority of students are white and asian while i am a mexican. Along with these social issues, I have also heard that for most schools, the jump from sophomore to junior is pretty substantial and that it would be best to stay in the same school when transitioning from sophomore to junior. Currently my grades have been great for all my time at my current schools (nothing below an 81 for all 5 years), but i'm not sure about the difficulty of this new boarding school besides the fact that it WILL be harder.

But he had a condom ready, and we carry on with our business. It didn’t last very long (it was probably about a 3-5 minutes) when we heard a snap/pop. He pulled out in a heart beat. He told me he didn’t finish (ejaculate or pre ejaculate) and that the condom only broke on the side. Now, I get crazy anxiety over the smallest things and now that this happened, I’m freaking out. Everyone that I talked to said that I’ll be fine and that I have nothing to worry about. But I still feel like something is wrong. Like last night I saw some spotting (droplets of blood) in my underwear even though I got off my period 8 days ago, but this is some what normal because I spot in between periods sometimes. I start to feel like I have cramps, the kind of cramp a girl gets when her period is showing up soon even though I’m scheduled to be on my period in about 3 weeks from now. But I will be out on birth control pills in about 2 weeks probably, so that somewhat comforts me about the future.
I’m very scared and anxious, I don’t know if what I’m feeling is normal after the first time, or if I’m just scaring myself up to the point where the stress is messing with my head and body, or if I should be worried.

520,"So at my university's library, I had a hefty fine as well as a couple of books outstanding. I decided to pay the entire thing off as well as hand in all my books; settle the score as it were. To my knowledge everything went as it should have. I shot a sheepish glance to the librarian on duty as he erased my fine from the system. And that was supposed to be that....

Except it wasn't.

The next day, one of the other librarians contacted me and said I still had a book outstanding. I found this very upsetting as I had made sure that I had handed everything in. I went to the library and insisted that I had given the book back. They insisted that I hadn't. I started to become very panicked at this point and frantically paced around the main floor, gesturing wildly at the counter that I had brought everything back. They showed me their latest returns and sure enough, the book wasn't there. By this point I was inconsolable and had drawn some attention to myself.

However, they DID later find the book in one of their offices (it had been misplaced and not checked back in) and apologised. But by that point I had probably caused them so much embarassment with my tantrum. I apologised too but I feel that mere words might not be enough.

This has been gnawing at me for the past few days. They did make a mistake, true, but I could have handled it so much better. What should I do? I've been thinking of chocolates and card, but that seems so...trite.

524,"We're both adults, and we're both a little off in our perceptions. Mine is in how I see myself; but he has *no* concept (I feel) of other peoples' boundaries. At least in conversation, but in general of his expectations of other people.

To put it simply, he won't *shut up* about a subject until he's satisfied with your response somehow, you 'get it' or something. Will say the same, inane reference or (I guess?) joke to you for *weeks*. Takes it *super* personally if you don't get him or respond enthusiastically enough to his social attempts.

Frankly, I'm not surprised he can't handle a normal job, or get a girlfriend. I don't begrudge those things, or the reasons they happen, I *get* being sick in the head. But man, am I freaking tired of him *not getting it* when I tell him, indirectly or indirectly, that I'm done with a conversation; or that no, his demands/expectations of me are not something I'll honor.

He has his 'business ideas' about stuff he doesn't know shit about, and then bemoans for weeks about how ""The world just hates innovation"" when it turns out, as a complete surprise, that nobody gives a shit what he thinks until he's demonstrated it through results, action, or *some* kind of personal connection at least.

To put it frankly, he's been schizophrenic in the past. Not to bad, except when it's 3 in the morning and he's giggling creepily in the bathroom. But I at least get that.

But when he's obsessed that I'll ""clog the toilet"" because I'm moving downstairs for a project and spending more time there? Or the time a few years ago, he wouldn't go on a camping trip because he got it in his head I had murderous intentions towards him? Like, literally. I didn't hear about it until my parents told me, of course, because he knows it's wrong enough he won't tell me about it.

I can't hint to end a conversation, a stupid joke I'm not getting he's repeated for the 50'th day in a row, a topic that's too close to home, or whatever. He will not get it. If he does somehow notice, he'll weasel his way around until he can find a way to 'convince' you to see his way. Again, and again, and again.

If I address it directly, (and I really don't know how) he ignores me or tells me why I'm wrong and just keeps going. If I end up snapping, telling him he doesn't know when to stop and I'm done with the conversation, he'll snap in return to the tune that ""I'm always defensive"". It's not even big, weighty topics, either. It's stupid, inane things like ""Does your friend John like talking about D&amp;D? You should ask him about your game design stuff."". 

And then he keeps going and going until he can convince me to acquiesce and agree with him, despite the fact that I *already established* that (a) he actually runs his own game for family members, but he doesn't like playing that much; (b) Yes, in fact, I have talked to him about it, and (c) no, he's not that interested in the mechanical stuff, just the story building, but we still have chats once in a while. Also, and I had to point it out eventually, (d) I was in the middle of watching a freaking movie, and I want to *keep* watching the movie. At which point he kept going. His response, despite my response? ""Maybe you just didn't ask the right way."" What the hell?? Seriously. Stop. Why do you even care.

The worst are the constant 'reminders' that I should stop being depressed because as he explained it so magnanimously a while ago, he just decided to not be sick any more, and it's selfish of me to not do the same. That I'm being selfish by living at home, or relying on my Mom to help figure out my treatment. (She knows a lot about nutrition and alternate medicine and such. I'm very much my own advocate in other matters.) Despite the fact that he is in the exact same situation, except 7 years ahead.

The little ""Maybe you should get a job here."" or ""Maybe you should do [Insert X stupid, silly joke job like 'be a rapper named J-dog']"" (And then proceed to ""rap"". Did I mention he's been repeating this stupid joke for months? It was sorta funny the first time, if he didn't ruin it by going at it too long.) I don't like his job suggestion? He keeps pushing it. I tell him to stop talking about it? He starts criticizing.

We've gotten through *some* past issues, I've got depression and he just has no concept of how that goes. ...Or at least how it is gotten over. He's convinced he cured himself, but anyone outside (at least from conversations from anyone else in my life) can see he isn't 'cured' in the least. I did, at one point, get a semi-helpful admission out of him that I couldn't just not be sick any more. Things have been better, since, but slowly going back to before.

I'd LOVE to move out again, but due to school and stuff I've gotta stay home. That was a godsend.

I'm not worried about his mental issues. Those are his deal, I want none of the responsibility. I know the hard way about codependency, but sometimes I get hung up on peoples' behaviors. And of course, I've got a *lot* of latent anger at him I'm sure is coloring my perceptions. I just don't know what to do. I'm pissed off right now, I'm sure that's changing my perceptions.

And that's the issue, as well. I am aware that his perceptions are locked the way they are. My amateur diagnosis, at least, is that he is fixated on certain things; in the same way an Obsessive Compulsive might be. And that just overrides his entire perception of reality, let alone the ability to pick up social cues, like ""I'm done with this conversation."" or ""I get the joke, let's move on.""

He's really an empathetic guy, but this backfires when he becomes fixated on what he perceives as somebody else's feelings, and starts acting on it.

I'm pretty broken myself, to be honest. A lot of helplessness. But I *am* making big strides, and I *am* seeking treatment and improvement, and I don't for a minute pretend I'm in a better position than I am. I'm just so damn tired of this interaction, and I want it to stop. I want to learn how to send the ""Stop"" signal. Maybe I am just defensive? That's probably true. But that doesn't excuse his behavior, or lack of self-restraint.

What am I missing here?

527,"So growing up in elementary, I was constantly getting signs for being too loud in the hall ways, or the cafeteria, and it got to the point to where I got detention in 5th grade because I was being too loud and was too excited at the Zoo.

I would say I guess I understand why I'd get in trouble, I did have an obnoxiously high voice during that time, and I was probably a walking torture device for teachers. It's in the past. 

I'd say about 3 years ago during my freshmen year, my voice got significantly deeper. It's hard because when I try to speak at my normal voice, it is too choppy to really understand because it's too deep(???) So I either have to resort to whispering which feels really weird and creepy or forcing myself to go an octave up which leaves me with sore throats at the end of the day, and I think makes my voice way louder.

Today I was kind of talking to myself after my teacher passed out a worksheet, and asked myself, what I thought was very quietly and was basically a whisper, ""what the hell is this?"" (I was super zoned out... Classic ADHD) the teacher on THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLASSROOM, answered, with an understandably pissed off tone, ""it's what we just went over""(or something along those lines). 

I near jumped out of my seat, and quickly muttered an apology. I've had this happen before and it's not super uncommon, but I feel like I have 0 depth of hearing. Have I been walking around my whole life yelling? Would this explain why when talking about sensitive subjects, everyone always says quiet down?

*ohmygosh* **Have I been walking around sounding like my grandpa when he loses his hearing aids???**

Anyways if anyone has some advice, some technique, a common experience, just anything I'd appreciate it!!!

We decided to renew the lease, of which I am now on, and she has decided to move out two months into the new lease. She wants me to pay her back for the deposit that she paid in full to our leasing office and that I signed away my rights to. I told her that the deposit is between her and the leasing office. Am I responsible for paying her back for the entire deposit? 

I am fine with paying half of the deposit with my new roommate (once we find a replacement), but I think that this transaction should between us and the leasing office and not my roommate who is moving out. Especially because her name is on the check paid to the leasing office since she paid it in full, I don't want to pay her for the full deposit and then have our deposit at the end of the year sent to her. Do you guys think that I should pay her for the deposit, or that this issue is a problem between her and the leasing office?

If she pushes the issue, how should I respond? ",04Oct2018,1
530,"I've lucky never needed to diet, but over the past few months I've piled on weight and it doesn't look good on me at all. 

I used to regularly go to the gym and ate fairly healthy, but then got into a relationship with someone who fed me a lot (no longer together) and I also developed emotional eating. I suffer depression, I also have a very emotionally difficult job, plus a breakup...I ended-up using food to deal with low moods and suicidal ideation. Eating is basically a form of self-harm: it's not really enjoyable as I end up feeling physically ill after binging, as well as guilty and anxious. 

It's far too easy to grab an unhealthy option...to see a new product to try, something on offer, something cheap, something reduced...today I didn't even think about grabbing a cake that had been reduced to 10% its original price, a cake that serves 20 (one of those pinta cakes full of candy) and I've had 1/4 already. 

I am in therapy for depression, but it won't help overnight and may not be able to address the eating during that time.

I have no willpower, I need other ways to deal with this and lose weight/change eating habits other than just 'dont eat sweets'. It needs to be a change in mindset and not just temporary depriving myself. 

Anyone any ideas other than just telling me to reduce calories/increase activity? ",04Oct2018,1
531,"As the title states I am really not happy in my relationship. We’ve been dating since April and honestly I think we went way too fast with things now I feel like I made a commitment to someone who I don’t really click with.

I feel as though we are really good friends, but we just don’t seem to have the natural chemistry that can keep a relationship sustainable. Honestly I feel very bored in the relationship and since I’m young I really just wanna explore more options and figure out what I want because it’s not this guy (he’s male, I’m female both college age).

The hard part is that I feel like I can’t get super close and comfortable with him because he tries way to hard to make me happy and to keep me with him. Whenever I do something that bothers him he doesn’t tell me and it drives me up a wall because I can’t fix anything if I don’t know what’s broken. I know if this keeps up he’ll just end up resenting me in the future for things that he enabled me to do and I think that’s very unhealthy. I also honestly find it unattractive, you know? He’s not allowing himself to open up to me because he’s too busy trying waaay to hard to sit on his knees and bow down to me. Like I love a guy who treats me like a princess, but not when it feels like he’s just trying to kiss my ass all the time...... it feels super unnatural and artificial.

Honestly I really feel like this has been dragging on for a long time. Spending time with him feels almost like a chore nowadays like it’s an obligation to hang out with my boyfriend just because he’s my boyfriend! But what I’m so scared of is this is going to be a one-sided breakup and I’m so scared it’s going to break his heart because of all the effort he put into trying to be “perfect”. I’m afraid he’s going to feel as if it was HIM because if he tried to be the “perfect boyfriend” and it didn’t work out for him, then he can’t win by being himself. When that’s all I really ever wanted. Not only this but I just don’t feel the spark anymore. When I do get to spend casual time with him it’s awesome and I have a great time! He’s awesome in that way but romantically it’s not working out.

We’ve had discussions like this and it just goes on in circles.

Me: “It feels like you never tell me what I’m doing that bothers you. I feel like you try to hard to make me happy that It makes you uncomfortable when I wanna be comfortable with you.”
Him: “You’re 100% correct it’s all my fault I’ll fix this about myself.”
Me: “You’re doing it right now!!”
Him: “I just agree with you!”

It’s so frustrating because I don’t think he’s self-aware and I don’t feel like I’m improving as a person and I don’t feel the motivation to be a better person like I should. He makes it seem like I can do no wrong and won’t acknowledge when I screw up.

This is only my side of the story, but I feel like we’re just burdens to each other at this point and I wanna lift the weight of this relationship off my shoulders. But it’s so HARD to break up with someone seemingly out of the blue. We’re just not right for each other and I need to grow and be humbled and I need to just fuck up once in a while so I can learn how to deal with and fix problems!! Is there any advice anyone can give me on how to break up with someone without it feeling like I just sucker punched him out of nowhere?",04Oct2018,1
532,"I moved into a new apartment over the summer. The place is set up like a duplex and there 6 or 7 renters in the complex. When we viewed the space it was somewhat dirty but nothing that couldn't be cleaned up before we moved in. When we did move in, nothing had been cleaned and they hired a ""professional"" painter who didn't come to paint until the day before we moved in, and was still ""painting"" by the time we were supposed to move in. We had been given the keys on the day we were supposed to move in so we stopped in while the painter was still here and found him drinking on the job. Once he was finished, we moved in and found that nothing was painted and there were still holes in the walls and attempts to fix them were half-assed. We ended up painting ourselves and demanded some rent be taken off for the first month (which was only about $100). This also happened to our neighbours who moved in at the same time, however they said they did not get rent taken off. The place was also extremely dirty and had not been cleaned at all. There were also cupboards missing doors and general maintenance that needed to be done. 

A few months into living here, the tenants a few places down moved out. My roommate ended up painting the place for the landlords and found that it was infested with cock roaches. They had pest control come in to deal with it. 

Now, about 4 months after moving in, we start seeing mice and some cock roaches.  Then just this week we find out we have bed bugs, and that other tenants also have bed bugs. We now know that there were bed bugs here before we moved in and to get rid of them they ripped up the carpet and sprayed once, which is not sufficient for dealing with them. 

Is there any obligations for landlords to disclose that there has been a recent bed bug infestation? Are they obligated to replace any furniture that needs to be thrown away? Who should I report this to to hold these people accountable and prevent them from putting others in these situations? 

Tldr; moved into a place that regular cleaning and maintenance is not done on. Now we're infested with bed bugs and possibly cockroaches. How do I deal with the situation  and hold the landlord accountable?  ",04Oct2018,1
533,"One of my closest friends from high school and his wife recently lost their daughter to what I presume was SIDS at just a month old.😭 I haven't spoken with him in a while, but I expressed my condolences to him in a Facebook message. We're not friends on there, and he's in a very conservative local church that I believe is a cult, as he's not allowed to really interact with anyone who is not a member of his church (like me), among other reasons which really aren't relevant to this post. This (former) friend isn't outwardly communicative with me unless we see each other in public, which is rare. Would it be too much for me to send a sympathy card to his church addressed to he and his wife, or should I just leave it at the Facebook message? I don't want to seem stalkerish, as I don't have any other contact details such as an address for this friend, but I feel devastated for he and his wife and feel like I should do more than send a sympathetic message on Facebook.",04Oct2018,1

535,So i started school 2 days ago &amp; (grade 9) &amp; there was this girl who was very attractive. So I went and sat 3 rows across her &amp; I looked at her &amp; caught her staring at me then she looked away. Then I kept staring at her every now &amp; then to check if she looks at me again &amp; she didn’t then after a while I looked at her and she was staring at me and then I looked away &amp; when she looks at me she looks away. I’m just confused is she creeped out by me? Does she like me? She sits alone in class 1 empty desk beside her &amp; doesn't talk to anyone. What should I do? Not like I can go sit with her cause that would be weird I already have a seat assigned &amp; I’m not that sure if she likes me or not. (We have class 2nd period together for 75min) should I just walk up to her after class ends and introduce my self? Or be straight forward like? Hi I like you and stuff...

536,"Hi I know this might be a stupid question but I was wondering if anyone had any practical advice to deal with this.

I have just started playing American Football, and went into contact incorrectly and hit the top of my head. I got seen by the physio on the pitch who said I had a concussion, which was confirmed by my doctor, and both said to give it time to heal. I described my symptoms to them but no one seems to be bothered and it feels like a bigger deal than people are saying it is.

After the couple of days since the confusion wore off I have been feeling exceedingly weird. I couldn't remember the days following the hit at all, but that is starting to clear up, and I feel that's more normal concussion symptoms. The only way I can describe my feelings are as ""Off"". I feel out of place, but I can't even come up with an example of how it properly feels. It feels like my entire world has been recreated to a near exact replica of the way it should be, but it's just not quite right. Also I've noticed my paranoia absolutely shoot through the roof. I think people are talking about me, that rooms go silent when I walk into them. I've had issues with anxiety in the past but this just feels like an intense feeling of that. I honestly feel like I am losing my mind.

I've read over this stuff and I know it sounds completely crazy. I've never felt this way before and it's really unpleasant feeling paranoid and ""off"" all the time. I can't find anything on this on the internet (about the paranoia), and all the medical professionals say i am fine, but I don't feel fine at all.

Does anyone have advice or experiences like this that they could share? I feel like no one is listening to me and it's driving me crazy.",04Oct2018,1

539,"Recently my high school has been threatened with messages engraved on the backs of desks. These include a message with the date of yesterday 8/3. Another one with the message, “School Shooting 8/4” found by a student. Under this an engraving a gun could be found with it. An email was sent out to all staff and students regarding these threats.

Nothing serious has happened so far. A fire alarm went off but this was not because of any student rather an accident that happened in the school. We were outside for over an hour and a half but soon went back inside. After that, at around eleven, many students (including myself) left the school as they didn’t feel safe.

Our school has gone extra lengths to check our bags and to make sure we don’t have any weapons on us. Although I’ve noticed that whilst some thoroughly check through our bags some quickly take a look. This allows a gun to easily be brought into the school.

We have no information pertaining to who did it. No other messages have been found and school will resume tomorrow. As a student of this school I don’t know how comfortable I feel being in school. With the warnings that were left it makes me feel as nothing will happen because a shooter would most likely want the element of surprise.

I feel like I’m left in a situation where I’m trapped. I go to school and I risk my life even though there is a small chance anything happens. On the other hand I miss school having to make up work, adding on to all the work I missed today.

I don’t know what to do. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",04Oct2018,1
540,"I'm 15 and can't decide what to major in. I will be speaking to a career guidance counselor in several weeks but wanted to try r/advice first.

&amp;#x200B;

For some perspective, I come from an incredibly competitive area and go to such a toxic and difficult high school that well known news organizations have written about us. I'm not kidding when I say some kids were literally studying calculus and doing SAT prep since 5th grade. (fortunately my parents are not like this and don't treat me like a trophy.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why but I am naturally good at math without having to do the 10 hour per day math camps some other kids do. I placed into the fastest math path in middle and high school and pre calc at college without studying, but find just pure math boring as hell. I am very good at logic based things - for example, debate, math, physics, etc. I'm currently in physics and am finding it fun (and am pretty heavily interested in aerodynamics but don't know what taking a course in it and majoring in it would be like).

&amp;#x200B;

I am interested in a few different things:

&amp;#x200B;

History is my favorite subject ever, specifically 20th century political history. I could read about it for hours without getting bored. It's like watching a movie in real life that has so many details that never end and have major effects on modern life.

&amp;#x200B;

Physics to me is interesting because it can be applied to everything and is just kinda cool. I'm taking it at high school and Im good at it and have fun, but I feel like if I want to major in it the more advanced versions of it it'll just be spiced up math. I would hate myself if that happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Politics is also fascinating to me (like history) but if I ever want to get into politics my entire life basically becomes a super stressful open book where if tiny mistakes are made, they're blown out of proportion into giant problems. At least this is what I think it would be like.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoy debate a lot. I'm extremely good at it too, which makes me enjoy it a lot more. The feeling of coming up with a really good response and having the other person struggle to react to it is amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really love aerodynamics but don't know to much of what it would be like or what I would do.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom who knows me really well says she thinks philosophy would be a good subject for me but I still am not 100% sure of what a person would do in a philosophy path.

&amp;#x200B;

My main idea is to maybe major in history (or philosophy after I learn more about what it actually does besides the basic philosophy) and minor in physics as a backup and then go to law school. I've heard things about law school and most of them are negative, but I really like forming arguments and debating, and politics/law is interesting to me.

542,"I am asking because of a shirt I have been wearing by the artist HIECUE out of New Orelans, LA. The shirt depicts the face of Martin Luther King Jr. in a pointillist style with a sprayed on crown over his head. I bought the shirt directly from the artist at the Atlanta Jazz Festival one year and it is one of my favorites to wear, though as a white dude, I have gotten pretty much every type of reaction for wearing it, from all different types of people. 

Some people love the shirt and are pleased to see me wearing it, while others I can tell are somewhat taken aback, and perhaps even offended. If I am offending people then I don’t want to wear the shirt. In my view the shirt’s message is the same as MLK’s, which is one of peace and that all people are created equal and deserve the same treatment regardless of skin color, religion, etc, and that we need this message now more than ever. 

What does everyone else think?

543,So we've been together for quite some time now. Recently he reluctantly got a good job that his father wanted him to have to get us both better prepared for our future with 401k insurance etc.. he hates the job but doing it for us and unfortunately it's in another state. His parents helped him buy a house for getting the job. We're going to keep the house we're currently living in for our roommate and because we want to try and move back after a year when he can transfer. So I'm here and he's there and I'm suppose to move next week. I love animals and horses and grew up riding. I found a thing in our local magazine for riding and I signed up. As far as my working goes I graduated with a degree that I'm not so fond of. And I believe I am extremely under qualified with the zero experience and only the bachelors. Anyways haven't had much luck. So at the horse place I have been sticking around helping and yesterday I helped with some lessons. Im very experienced and get along great with the other girls that work there. Every time I go I'm so happy and loving every second of it. So after helping yesterday the main girl says casually that they are looking for someone to help with experience to pay. Now if this was 2 years ago I would be like sign me up now lady! But I'm supposed to move. I'm heart broken. My boyfriend really needs me and I hate the idea of being away from him. This is a dream of mine to work with people and horses. I would tell him but I mentioned volunteering a while back and he kind of got upset with me like why are you saying that when you're moving. I didn't tell the lady I couldnt. I couldn't say anything really. I was so surprised that after all this time I finally get an opportunity and I can't take it.. some advice? Some support? I'm feel terrible.,04Oct2018,1
544,"So I'm currently in the midst of a career reboot, my first time through college didn't prove to be that useful and though I made a handful of friends none of them were useful career connections which made finding a job that first time around nearly impossible.

Fast forward several years and I'm back at square one on a more career focused path. Two year program at a community college with a pretty promising future position. This program touts excellent job placement rates for its graduates, mostly through placement in the clinics that we intern in during our stay in the program. And of course, the program heads have been very insistent that we interact between ourselves and with our senior class to form a network of sorts so that we can help eachother get/stay employed, pushing extracurricular activities (mandating attendance actually), etc.

The thing is that though I actually am an extroverted guy I am really picky about -who- I spend my time with, especially because to actually get to know me and to have fun with me is to see a very unprofessional side of me, one I'm not comfortable revealing to people I could be working with. (Also debating about whether to remain closeted in a workplace is still very much a thing for me.) When it comes to business or the classroom I clam up and put on a very fake customer service personae, but I can't actually connect with people like that. Big fan of keeping my worlds separate.

Also I have to commute 2 hours each way just to get to this school, whole other issue with my living situation. But, with just how much energy these courses demand and how much time I spend commuting I don't have any to spare on faking being nice to people who I just don't have anything in common with besides my career path. And I can definitely feel it already in the classroom, it's been maybe 2 weeks and I am definitely an outsider with these people already.

How am I supposed to suck up to 60+ people and lie through my teeth about who I am just to eventually go ""hey buddy, got a job for me?"" and have them actually decide to do that favor for me with nothing in it for them? I honestly don't get it. I would never do the same for them in the opposite case, who the hell actually does that? A lot of people I guess, but I really can't empathize with it.",04Oct2018,1
