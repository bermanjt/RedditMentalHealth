0,So my mom ordered a package off of Walmart for Christmas and it came in today. The problem is we didn‚Äôt get what we ordered. The package came in and has a shipping label with all of our information on it. We opened the package and it‚Äôs not what she ordered but it has the receipt of what we did order.

3,"At first I thought he was reading his notes out loud or rehearsing for projects but he's in my major and we don't do projects. I know now after 4 months of living with him he's not reading notes because the things he says are not related to school.

He will sometimes go into the washroom and turn the shower on and start talking if he doesnt want me to hear him. 

At night he turns to the wall smiles and chuckles at his own talking. Is this a normal thing people do?",13Dec2018,1

6,"When asking for a raise in salary, what are the best ways to present/phrase your request?

A little background: I work for a large corporation. The department I work in typically works with shared accounts to evenly distribute the work load; however, our management team put me in charge of a separate account that I am in charge of running independently 6 months ago. The person who had this account before me got hired for a position within a different department and when they were running the account, it was a complete mess. Since taking it over, I have received multiple compliments from management about how efficiently I‚Äôve been operating in comparison.

Well, I guess because of how I was managing the first account I was given, our management has recently given me an additional account to run independently. This is a way larger work load than any of my colleagues and while I‚Äôm still able to manage the volume - consistently completing my work by COB - I‚Äôm definitely beginning to feel the strain from the demand. 

I definitely feel like I need a pay increase that is comparable to my production and performance, so I would like to know how to ask for one without appearing like I cannot handle the volume of work, or without being perceived as entitled. 

All help is appreciated!",13Dec2018,1

But is it just bad to feel this way? And I feel really fake being friends with her but I've tried to end the friendship many times but she doesn't let it end..?

It's happening a third time right now, but I want to do something about it. I don't want to see these people get bullied anymore.

15," I  betrayed the trust of one of my best friends. What I did does not  matter to him as much as the fact I did it, and I did this completely on  impulse. I‚Äôll explain more later in the post, note that it has just  happened very recently too, and I have been very upset about this. 

So, what I did was: I messed with one of his accounts in an online  game. He had trusted me to pilot the account for him on multiple  occasions (and the game does allow this), and I had often taken care of  his account without him asking before. I had logged on to help him, but I  was also feeling upset about something at the time and I just ended up  impulsively deleting some of his items and his freinds list. His account  is not ruined, but set back a bit, over time everything can be regained  but it‚Äôs still time. This is on a free-to-play MMORPG. It was a petty  impulsive action. I may have had some reasons to be upset but it was no  justification, and it was the fact that I betrayed him that hurt him as I  said, not the amount of damage. I wish I could simply undo it, and I  was in disblief that I even did it considering how much he trusted me  and helped me and such... 

This guy has been one of my best friends, as I‚Äôve said, and we were  very close. I would confide in him and he told me a lot too. We had our  fights before but I never betrayed him like this before. We‚Äôve had a lot  of fun times, we met on the same game I messed with his account on. We  would play games together or just talk almost every day. He does have a  bit of a temperament, and I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll forgive me or if I can  really move on from this mistake I made. I don‚Äôt make friends very  easily, and believe me, I valued him a lot and I still do... I just wish  I had thought things through, not acted on impulse. I hope I get a  second chance, but I know it‚Äôs his decision and I know I‚Äôm going to miss  him terribly over time. 

When we talked about it, he didn‚Äôt seem angry at first but as we  talked and he thought about it more, he got angrier. I don‚Äôt think I  handled it as well as I should have. I plan on giving him time and  trying to talk to him again but again I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll forgive me  or give me a second chance. I don‚Äôt know if I deserve a second chance  anyways.

16,"Myself and my friends run an online community in a video-game. One player who we don't know in real-life, has always been a huge asset to us, as well as a **real** online friend. He was a valuable member of the community, and a bit of a leader in the roles (the game is World of Warcraft, but I don't want to go into heavy detail, because all I need is advice on the ghosting).   


Well anyway one day this guy just ghosted. He stopped logging in and has been offline for almost 2 months. He was always an in-touch person with open communication, always at our events, discussing our management and the game: an active member. Now he's MIA. I don't even remember our last communication, or if there was some kind of argument or thing that upset him.  


 I'm the leader of this community, the guild master, and although it seems to be a trivial thing, I care about members of that group. I'm used to someone who wants to leave, or short-term players taking a break or leaving altogether. But when a long-term asset who was a good friend &amp; decent human being just totally disappears without explanation, it kind of bleeds into my real life, worrying/wondering what happened.   


One thing that I noticed, probably the thing that ticked me off the edge the most, and made me sit down and write this post is this: In the Discord (which is a chat community) I always see him online, just sitting there, idle. But today for the first time I noticed he changed his profile picture. So that made me a little mad. I think its a little rude what he's doing, and I'd love to sort if out. I don't *NEED* to know, and if I have to, I can just **let it go**. I was just wondering if anyone had experience with this, if I should send him an email, or just screw it. We're online. These things can happen.

17,"I graduated a year ago with no luck finding a job in my field...brief jobs at Home Depot, Starbucks, Wells Fargo under a temp contract that ended 2.5 months early, and now Costco as a seasonal. 

My mom moved to a bad area with no public transportation or job opportunities (outside of Home Depot) shortly before i graduated.  I stuck around there and applied to the only 2 banks close by. I got offered a job (after leaving my resume off the teller application) as a relationship banker but it was simply too far away. I don't have a car and there was no bus that went in that area.

In June i moved down to NC hopeful. No luck here either. I think i'm overqualified for jobs like a bank teller and the temp staffing agencies have just given me a run around. I got a job at Costco as seasonal but after Christmas i'm leaving to move to ATL with my Dad. 

I'd probably have better luck in MD, where my school is located, but i simply *can not* live with my mom. I have to wait until i have a job and apartment/room secured until i go back.

I've slowly lost interest in most things finance related. I was interested in personal finance, but most of those jobs, as i see it, are either sales based (selling a financial product for commission to a client) or dreadfully boring, bleeding my eyes out at a desk staring at a computer screen. Both of those options suck. I was ready to die in the time i spent at Wells Fargo's office.

I considered studying for the CAPM Exam to work my way into Project Management field but i simply can't grasp some of the most important topics and its almost like i'm switching to an *entirely* new field with little understanding outside of one class i took as a sophomore.

The only advice i've gotten, from my mom, has been to simply get my master's. Her main reason seems to be that this would defer my student loans. The problem with this is that i'll just end up with more student loans if i go to anywhere reputable. 

The only thing i can think of is getting certifications but nothing seems to entice me enough to want to go for it, especially in finance. A lot of certifications either require work experience before you can even get them...which is kinda hard to get when nobody will hire me.

The only thing i can think of is getting certified in something. A Master's is off the table (i have no interest in going back to school formally for a while) and if not that then i might as well just move to CA and be homeless out there.

Life Story Short (At present: 26 years old)

 \- Parents divorced when 7 years old, mother blamed me saying I was born to save a dying marriage (and failed)

 \- Was isolated as a kid by two babysitters among eight other kids (my brother was one of them).  Kids would make up things to make it look like I lied all the time, and as a result, the babysitter went out of her way to make sure I had nothing to do with them.  I lacked social skills all the way up into my second job at 21 

 \- Brother doesn't remember this, but he made me suck his dick back in hometown when I was six

 \- after my mom married my stepdad, they pulled me from soccer (of which I had been doing for eight years, 4-12) and gave me video games (single player stuff, no human interaction) while my step dad verbally abused me from 10 to 16.  I wasn't allowed to join clubs or sports because I was an irresponsible child despite not being taught proper responsibility

 \- When I finally moved to my Dad's place at the age of 16, my step mom left my dad and I.  Before walking out the door, she said she was leaving because I didn't love her enough.

 \- I've been in two relationships.  First one I left because my ex cheated on me with an intern at a police station.  Second one raped me (prefer not to go into the details).  I also worked at a job where I was sexually harassed for seven hours by a gay assistant manager.  Only reason I couldn't leave was he was the only manager on shift, and I was working in a position that didn't permit me to leave my spot except for lunch breaks or bathroom (basically, I didn't want to look suspicious, and didn't know what to do, so I sat through the shift the best I could).  I no longer work for him, but he donates to the maintenance of the very street I live on.  I see his name every time I drive to and from my current job.

 \- Brother has five kids with current wife, wife has gone out of her way not to say or include me in anything for the entirety of her being in the family, except christmas and thanksgiving (which considering the above, I'd understand completely)

 \- Living back with my dad, and work as a security officer for a local city.  I love the work, and despite the obvious treatment officers in and out of the law get, I'm used to it and love helping people regardless.  If not for jujitsu, my cat, and some friends from overseas, I wouldn't be here.

I'm at a point where I want to finish my education, move overseas, and leave all of them behind. But my dad, after three years of me having nothing to do with my mom and stepmom, still presses on me the importance of family, despite the fact that my biological family has largely nothing to do with me.  I feel a responsibility as an uncle to be there for the kids when im actually invited and what not, and yet I hardly even know them.  My dad's also backed me through some other situations, and helped me deal with and resolve them, but he largely lacked any presence in my life.  I'd only visit him every other weekend when growing up, and when I did visit, all he did was raid on MMOs while my stepmom taught me normal people skills (cooking, cleaning, general responsibility, etc.)

21,"Hey you guys, I'm a 25 male and I feel I'm at a stage in life where there are lots of sociocultural norms shifting and I'm not sure how to manage them.

Recently (relatively) got out of a relationship and I'm no longer in a position/at the age where school provides easy access to meeting new people and finding new potential partners.

I often read statements online from women about being asked out at the gym etc., and how annoying or encroaching into personal space it is. Except I see this complaint (although I'm sure a real one) extended to almost any setting. Don't ask someone out: at the gym, at work, in the library, etc. as they're there for: exercise, work, reading/research, etc. and not to be asked out.

It often seems that women are trying to convey something other than ""location"" and ""context"", as any context could be seen as the above mentioned.

   I'll start with the basics. I am:

* 13 years old
* I identify as an apache helicopter
* Chinese
* A ""nerd""

The problem I've been experiencing recently is total loss of motivation or interest in life. Combined with the fact that my parents have recently put harsher monitoring on my computer (well, yes, I DO have many ways around that, but most of them have a catch - they would notice that I'm getting around them if they bothered to look), which means that the amount of social interaction I get outside of school is basically zero. All of those factors combined makes me wonder - what IS the point of getting up every day? Yes, you could say that right now I'm preparing for my future - if that's the meaning at this point, then I would say I'm doing a decent job. I've gotten most of single variable calculus under my belt (past AP Calculus BC level), linear algebra, discrete mathematics, etc. In physics I'm about AP level, biology, beyond AP level (verified with past tests). I've become interested in machine learning and programming. However, I'm afraid to advance too far or spend too much time in any of them - after all, my future is \*\*very\*\* uncertain at this point. Which brings me to my next point - if I AM successful, so what? Get a good paying job, have a good family, etc. It's not like I'm ever going to make any significant impact on humanity. So what's the point of living? (note - I'm not suicidal. I guess I'm too much of a wimp to ever do it).",13Dec2018,1

31,"To set the scene, my boyfriend (m/25) and I (m/27) were a Christmas party. A Christmas party that he was co-hosting. I had been a little tense for most of the night, mostly due to the social anxieties of not knowing many faces in attendance. As one does, I treated those anxieties with a healthy dose of alcohol and sharp comments that came out as a feigned attempt at humor. As I'm sure you can tell, the night did not end well. The final hours of the party were spent locked in a bedroom doing that drunk kind of arguing where you forget in seconds the iron-clad points that just spilled out of your mouth with inebriated confidence. I then hastily left the party and made the sub-freezing walk back to my apartment. In all honesty, he had done nothing wrong. As I have been known to do, I got drunk attached some pent up feelings to a completely unrelated situation. But that was that, I had successfully ruined his night.

Over the time that we have been together, we've gotten pretty good at making up. The next day was filled with apologies and open conversations about what went wrong to lead the night down such a dismal path. I couldn't make an excuse because it was so abundantly clear what happened; I got drunk and made an ass of myself. He was understandably hurt, and I was beyond embarrassed for how I had acted. The conversations didn't end exactly well, though. Despite the apologies and attempts to make up for things, the damage had been done and nothing could change how the night went. There's been this solemn cloud hanging between us ever since that I can't seem to get through.

That being said, things have gotten progressively weird. As a typical rough patch would go, I don't get many texts throughout the day. When I do, they're just bland one-word responses. Then out of nowhere, I'll get a stream of funny and light hearted texts that make things seem like they're okay. However, by the time he gets home it's back to one-word answers and a cold shoulder. BUT THEN, by the end of the night he's being playful making casual conversation over Netflix. We go to be okay, but by the next morning it's back to silence.

I'm a little lost on how to feel. I know that I fucked up and I can't think of any more ways to apologize. I know how to live life in the doghouse, but this back and forth is so confusing that I can't tell where we're currently standing. I can't tell how long this is going to on, nor can I tell how long I can take the emotional rollercoaster.

Any thoughts or advice would help.

Classic cars( I'm thinking along the lines of manual transmission+ combustion engine) were, and still are my passion.
From games to simulation to working as a mechanic when younger and now am currently studying mechanical engineering in college.
So with all that said, with the way that things are going towards (hybrid/electric) I no longer care about those cars or more like I don't feel anything about them in my eyes they are just modes of transportation now.
With all that said, considering that that's the way things are going I've started to think about changing career paths(either something else in M.E or something different) 
Have anyone here passed through something similar? Like realizing that the style of work you wanted to make is no longer a possibility, if so what you did about it?

35,"So I just got my first job (yay) and I am still in school we are just on school holidays now. So essentially I need to know a few things.

1. Is it normal for your employer/supervisor to consistently ask you to stay back. I stayed back 20 mins putting donuts on trays and hated it but she justified it with ""If you start something you gotta finish it"" (which is fine I agree) so she tried to make me stay back a further 30mins a different time to START the donut trays and I had to make an excuse, it feels like they dont understand the term ""clock on clock off"" like we're almost expected to stay later ( which is understandable if someone may be by themselves but a majority of the time its just because she would rather not do the jobs we do.)

2. Kinda like 1 but, how often are people supposed to be called in? I have been called in 4-5 times to come in earlier and pick up shifts( Ive worked there for &gt;Two weeks). She asked me to do a 7.5 hour shift with no warning or time to think about it. It wouldve been closer to a 10 hour shift if I hadnt of said I needed to have a shower and such.

37,"My roommate in college likes to belittle everyone in our dorm for any mistake they make or any thing they say that  he assumes is ‚Äúdumb‚Äù.

Let me give you an example, the other day my roommate I‚Äôll call him Kevin (the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù one‚Äù )and my other roommate Kyle went to go play basketball. Usually I prefer my shoes to be slim, low to the ground, a low toe box and narrow cut. Kevin on the other hand normally wear bulky shoes with thicker soles, not as narrow, and a high tie box. For those who know about basketball shoes I have Kobe‚Äôs and he has lebrons. However, this time I wore a shoe similar to the cut of Kevin and kyles shoe (bulky) and I said ‚Äúwow look we finally are all wearing shoes of the same cut‚Äù just to pass the time in between games. 

Kevin then leads with this ‚Äú well of course all basketball shoes are the same they‚Äôre made for basketball. You just look too into things. It‚Äôs so dumb‚Äù. I responded with ‚ÄúKevin there is no way you think all shoes are cut the same way‚Äù and he just chose to ignore me and walk away as if what I was saying made no sense.

42,"I am so stressed out that even after my recent hospitalization and stabilization, I want to kill myself. I'm hoping there are obvious answers or ideas I am not seeing through my stress... But I really feel like I'm at a dead end. I regret going to the ER for my attempt.

Background: 
Due to financial stress and severe mental illness (bipolar/eating disorder) I had a suicide attempt in late October. I was in ICU a few days (heart/liver was not doing well) and then in psych until early November. 
I haven't been working due to mental health/panic attacks as well as lupus and a pituitary tumor that has caused secondary adrenal insufficiency. Basically, physically I am also not doing well. I have just been referred to the hematologist/oncologist at the local cancer institute so I can receive infusions there as treatment for my lupus/connective tissue disease.
Financially, my car payment that is only $165 a month is late, I don't have groceries or gas covered, and I am constantly worried. Groceries worry me the least since I have an eating disorder, but my car, gas, and meds stress me to no end. I had an interview last week that I thought went okay, but I never heard back. My mom, who is not supportive, has custody of my 7 year old daughter and I feel shitty for not being able to get her a little something for Christmas even though she wants for nothing and has many presents. I still want to give her something...
I want desperately to just be able to go get a job as a waitress tomorrow so I can have one less thing on my plate, but with my panic attacks it truly seems impossible and that makes me feel worthless... The idea of working with the public terrifies me.
I'm hardly out as trans, with one FB status being made and only close friends calling me by my new name. I told my mom but she basically pretends I didn't. Self image is a huge issue for me (I need top surgery, another goal that will never happen), which leads to my panic attacks in public. I don't like to be seen. 
I fucked up college already over a year ago. 

Any ideas are appreciated... I can only think of one myself. :/",13Dec2018,1
43,"I'm in AP Spanish this year. I've taken Spanish 1-4 and done pretty well but now I have no clue what the hell is going on. When we have speaking activities where we're supposed to speak for two minutes, I usually mumble through for about twenty seconds, panic, forget everything I was supposed to say and then sit there feelings useless and awful about myself. I already know I'm not going to be taking the AP Spanish test, and I'm really tempted to switch into a different class next semester.  We get new schedules at that point anyway because certain classes are only one semester instead of all year. And currently my schedule next semester is supposed to be 

&gt; 1A: Robotics, 2A: H English, 3A: H Word History, 4A: AP Spanish

&gt; 1B: H Civil Engineering, 2B: H Digital Electronics, 3B: H Precalc, 4B: AP Physics 1

 Which is going to be absolutely brutal because there's no balance at all in those schedules. Both days are going to suck. And it's junior year so it's already stressful enough. But Spanish is the cause of at least a third of my stress at school. If I dropped it, A days would be manageable. And I'd have so much less anxiety overall. 

But I've been told switching out of a class looks really bad when you're applying for colleges. And any 1 semester class is going to be a standard level class, which will hurt my GPA. If I stick it out through Spanish, I'll get an A in the class because, for the most part I just have to bullshit my way through the work. So maybe it's better to just get through the rest of the year. 

On the other hand, this class is legitimately making me hate school.

She said that he friend zoned her at first. She seems to like him a lot and this is potentially motivation for her to fake pregnancy in order to date him.

For complicated reasons, my family isn't supporting me at all both emotionally or financially.

A super kind Redditor loaned me some money (Ileaving out the name for various reasons), but I'm still 4100 short. The deadline to register for next semester is mid January. 

I'm still trying to get a job on campus. But without being register for next semester it's almost impossible that I'd be offered a job.

The community college I go to gives student 12 hours per week max, around 15/h. In the ideal situation, it still doesn't cover my living expenses. I'm using credit card to pay living expenses right now. (I live in NY, moving to a cheaper place is not an option, because I don't have the funds to transfer school) 

Most scholarships are for US citizens. The ones that international students are eligible for, allow only first time college students. I already have another degree, so I can't apply. 

I'm on 3 expensive medications, that my student insurance right now covers at no cost. If I fail to register for next semester, I lose my student visa status, and lose my insurance too. 

I'm in a relationship with an extremely loving and supportive guy. He can't help me financially, but he's the one reason that I haven't given up on myself.  I can't bear the thought of not having him in my life. It would crush both of us. He is American, but we can't get married, one of the reasons is that it's super suspicious if we do that now and I might end up getting deported.

This friend of mine missed three classes. She actually does this a lot, and then ""talks"" with professors and it's all fine. I saw her trying to do that with our supervisor (it was still April and she had already surpassed that limit). She prided herself in how our professor ""broke the rules"" for her. Suddenly, in June, this supervisor told her she failed because of it, and had to redo this semester next year. 

She ghosted me and I was lost. I confronted her and she said *""I knew what I did""*. Months later I found out... Apparently, she thinks I convinced our supervisor to fail her. For two reasons: I was the only one who knew about it; this professor (59F) has a sweet spot for me, so I suppose she (and her friends) thought I could ""sweet talk"" her into anything... we also had a closer relationship than usual, but nothing unethical ever happened.

And most importantly, I had nothing to do with it. And I found out this girl has been telling people I'm ""manipulative"" and a betrayer.

now he moved with us here and at first like 6 months ago he was just really really quiet and would just watch tv all day but since the past month he just stands and stares at a wall all day and night, he doesnt eat, and he  thinks people are trying to kill him and he refuses to take any meds (which he needs for his mental illness and especially for his diabetes so he doesnt die)

i dont want him to die i just want him to go to a mental hospital and be forced to take his meds so he can get better and be happy and fun like he was 3 years ago, i dont even remember the last time he told me he loved me. i told him i loved him and he mumbled that he couldnt say it back because it would hurt since its ""too cold""

Can he be forced to stay in a mental hospital until he gets better? cause he doesnt wanna get better he jsut wants to die but he would never actually kill himself he just wants it to happen naturally already

I called the company and asked them why the dividing strips weren‚Äôt installed and the receptionist told me that the workers had to leave quickly because one of them cut their hand with his razor, but someone would be by tomorrow to finish the job.

Sometimes I'll start to think that I'm making progress but then the long term effects of my bad habits will start to show up and throw me back to square one. 

One recent example is my sugar addiction and lack of self care. This is very embarrassing to talk about but for years I have neglected my oral hygiene and only occasionally brushed my teeth when I really needed to, while also heavily consuming sugary foods and energy drinks. Now at 25 my teeth are ruined and the pain is excruciating that it's making me so miserable I just want to give up on it all. 

I have never seriously considered suicide but I feel like the progress I make the harder the fall is and it's making me feel like suicide is inevitable. 

I have some good days but they are few and far in between. Then I'm back to ""taking it one day at a time"" when my peers are out there chasing their dreams, I'm just lying in bed convincing myself to get up and take a shower, brush my teeth and eat some food to survive. But I'm so tired of surviving, I want to thrive, I want to accomplish something with my life. 

I know it's my own bad habits that have gotten me into this mess but I don't know how to stop.

The other night we texted on and off for a few hours and today was when I followed up with lunch.

I just don't know how often I should text her or what I should text her about. Don't want to come off as needy/annoying but I do like talking to her even though she isn't in any of my classes.

72,"To make this super simple let's say I own a deli / gourmet grocery store. We have a station at one end of my business to make sandwiches. Staff works behind glass display counters that come together to make an L shape. One part of the L is about eight feet long while the second section is about fifteen feet long. 

To service a customer you usually need stuff from all over that ""L"" of glass counters. It's super tight behind the longest portion of the L shape. We also have equipment that is frequently needed during a transaction a few feet behind the shorter section of the L. One register is where the two counters meet at 90 degrees and another is at the furthest end of the L. 

Staff often bump into each other and have to wait for each other to move out of the way to get what they want. The busier we get, the more staff needed. The more staff working at this station the tighter it gets. Nothing is in a central location and you end up moving around a ton during a shift. 

Because we don't have a set place to order at that station a really disorganized line of customers forms. Staff and customers are often confused who is and isn't being helped and if parties are ordering and paying together. You could be taking orders anywhere on that L due to the way the ""line"" forms. 

You run into a multitude of issues due to this layout. For good diligent staff they are hustling around moving from end to end of the counter grabbing shit they need to service customers and they also have to contend with a super disorganized line and customers not knowing what is going on. Half your job is trying to figure out who they need to help and corralling customers. For shitty staff, because the counter is rather long and the customer line is ambiguous, they can exploit these factors and avoid helping customers. They can stand around do bullshit and pretend like they are doing work and it's hard for managers to recognize that.

As someone who manages staff I often have to monitor that counter to make sure staff is actually helping customers and they know who to help. If I'm working on that counter new staff often have to be guided to help customers because it's so confusing for them. So if I'm working back there not only am I servicing customers but I also have to be aware of the ""line"" and coach staff who have issues helping customers. 

What I'd like to do is consolidate that L shape to one eight foot counter in a straight line. I can get a lot of the products into that one counter. I might cut out a few of the non popular ones and the ones not visible would have good signage listing them. 

What I hope happens is there is one eight foot counter facing customers and because of that a very organized line forms because there is one ""window"" to order. Staff would stand behind that single eight foot counter and take orders and service customers. We would double the space behind that single counter to make it easier for staff to move around. Everything a staff member need to service a customer would be within arms reach or a couple of steps. I think staff would be a heck of a lot more efficient because they aren't moving big distances to service customers. 

For ""bad"" staff trying to avoid work I don't think it would be possible for them to do the same thing they did with the ""L"" layout. It would be glaringly obvious they weren't servicing customers feeding off a single well defined line. ""Bad"" staff would have no place to go to hide. 

I'm just worried because a good portion of my business comes from that sandwich counter. As a money maker it ""works"" but it's got to be such a hassle and draining to me I want to make it work better. A good portion of my labor costs are associated with that station. Other stations run easily with one employee and this one sucks up a ton of the staff on duty during a shift. ",13Dec2018,1

77,"I will soon be out of high school (17) and I have a strong urge to join the U.S military. I come from a large military family and the service has been around me since I was born. I've had (and currently have) relatives in almost every branch. I've looked into all of them, but narrowed it down to three, the Air Force, Navy, or Army.

From what I've been told, the Air Force has the ""comfiest"" lifestyle and is almost corporate-like, with a common stereotype being that ""it's for smart people"". Although the PT test is the easiest, and I'm currently working on getting physically fit, I don't want to be in a environment that's so much like the civilian world. This is actually a large reason why I am joining, I'm tired of 'regular' life at a desk.

The Navy has its positives, such as traveling, although I cannot swim. A good amount of my relatives served in the Navy, so I am the most familiar with it. 

The Army, although rather difficult physically, offers more jobs. The Army actively needs recruits, while I've read that the Air Force has an influx of people. I don't want to miss out on getting a job just because I'm intimidated by the PT. Naturally, my parents are anxious about me joining the Army out of all the branches due to their combative nature. Despite this, it could give me the best opportunity for a job.

I'm really very torn on which to join. Each has their advantages and disadvantages and I just cannot narrow it down to one.

85,"So let me start this off by saying I suffer from depression and anxiety and it has reeked havoc on my past careers but finally for the first time in 2 years I have a handle on things and have felt pretty great. 

I have been unemployed for about 5 months now(and losing my mind) and have 2 opportunities on my plate. My last job was sales and I lost it because my performance slipped due to a terrible time in my mental state and it all fell apart. I have been in sales all of my professional life and am good at them but when not properly motivated I seem to lose interest at times. Right now being in my late 20s without a stable career IS my motivation. The last 2 years I have been writing fantasy foootball articles for my own website and have gotten a liking to it so I‚Äôve been feeling sports writing jobs as well. 

Job 1:  New sports betting company in a city that I could drive to when I wanted but traffic would be horrendous. Decent pay and ability to write content for the company(plus wear many other hats since it‚Äôs a start up). I would have to work odd hours and weekends though and would have to work holidays. Also I would be starting part time due to them seeing how their soft opening goes. The biggest thing turning me onto this job is the career change. 

Job 2: Very nice base salary and in the sports publication industry. Easy commute to the city and solid schedule mon-fri no holidays. But it is a sales job and according to Glassdoor it is a college grad destination type job. Although when I went for my interview and bunch of the people there seemed my age. 

I cannot have another job for 6 months then get laid off anymore. My work ethic will absolutely be there but those in sales know that it is a very competitive environment and your job is never guaranteed. 

I need a job ASAP as I am drowning in bills and debt at the moment. I had to recently move back home due to my position and some very poor decisions in my life which led me to losing a lot of my friends. 

I am mentally ready for the first time in years and would love some advice on which path to go.

I have a few things going on, but the worst is undiagnosed. I'm constantly nauseous. I throw up and I pass out. Some days I'm okay, others I'm not; this makes it so hard to live day to day life, not knowing if I'm going to randomly hit the ground. It's terrifying because I've hit my head before. 

I tried college a second time, closer to home, but the absence policies were too must. With my health, there was no way I would only miss 3 classes a semester (more than 3 and you fail the class). So, I left again. I got a job but then my situation got even worse and I was getting sick every day. 

I want to work. I need to work. I have no idea what my future looks like and everyone around me (except my wonderful mother, who has SEEN me go through the vomitting a fainting since I was a child) judges me for basically doing fuck all and ""lounging"" all day. And I judge myself too.

94,"Two years ago, I was in the fall semester of my junior year. I was taking a fairly heavy course load. I had done just fine until this point in college. My GPA was a little under 3.0. However, I had started losing interest in my major (neuroscience) and was generally not motivated. Long story short, my semester ended catastrophically with two F's. This was devastating since I had never failed like this in my entire life. I decided to take a year off to re-evaluate my life.

During my time off, I picked up interest in computers. I was always interested in technology and would consider myself above average in math. I decided to do a major in computer science when I came back to school last spring. I did well with a 3.6 GPA for that semester. I registered for three math courses and a computer science course this fall. My adviser warned me that it wouldn't be an easy semester but I went on with it since I love math and was prepared to put in whatever it took. It's now coming towards the end of the semester and things are simply not looking so good. I started off my semester making sure I was on top of everything. Whenever I started to fall back on material, I would get flashbacks of my nightmarish semester from 2 years ago and stay up late finishing any work that was due. My anxiety often keeps me up all night to make sure I don't fail any exams or quizzes (and believe me my courses have tons of quizzes). However, the chronic sleep deprivation made even less efficient since my brain was cloudy without adequate sleep. At this point, I would estimate that I haven't slept a third of the nights during this semester. Needless to say, I've been running on fumes for weeks now. I'm on the edge of getting a D in two my courses and would have to do well in my my finals to make sure I pass. My finals start tomorrow and you can imagine my anxiety about it.

I'm starting to have doubts about continuing with college. I'm afraid of losing my passion for the things I study due to anxiety. On the other hand, I don't know that I can make much of myself without a degree.

To be honest, I'm not expecting to get much help here, but I wanted to share and see if others had a similar experience and what they did about it.",13Dec2018,1

My sister is married with two daughters. She has always been extremely self-centered, but it has gotten much worse in the past year or two. When we decided to stop having a relationship with our parents, she assured me I would be fine because she and her husband and kids would be my family.

Grandpa died less than a month after I was laid off. Then my Dad was diagnosed with cancer as well, but due to other health stuff he will not be able to fight it with anything but surgery. Then they found a mass in my kiddo's brain.

I'm worried going back to work will be detrimental to those around me, and on the other hand I don't know how much longer I can continue to do this.

108,"So I'm 21 and I have never even kissed a girl. It's not that I dont like girls, I definetly do, I've only had 1 girlfriend and and it was relatively short lived due to her stepdad being crazy which is a whole crazy side story of it's own. There is a girl I've known for about 3 years and we talk a lot, (probably about 2-3 hours of uninterrupted conversation each (it's more sporadic but grouped together would be about 2 to 3 hours total) and I've had a crush on her for the longest time but never really went for it because I'm super insecure due to not thinking I'm very attractive even tho I'm in shape. About a month ago we talked and I found out while I was crushing on her she actually used to have a crush on me as well but due to my insecurity i didn't notice any of the in hindsight obvious clues she sent me. Fast forward to today and she's currently in a super complicated off again on again relationship with a guy whose probably not right for her, regardless hes proposed to her and she said yes because hes like a drug to her and when they were apart for like a week she was super depressed and everything so she said yes to try and never have that happen again. 

My problem is I cant stop loving her and I genuinely want nothing but the best for her, even if it's not me. But I know hes not what's best for her. I realize I'm preatty much obsessed with a girl that is not available and she will need to leave me when she moves in with the fiance and I should just cut her put of my life and let her live her life but everyday none stop I cant help but think of her and how awesome she is and how depressed it makes me to know I cant have her. I dont know what I should do about her.... i want advice as to whether i should make a move for her or to leave her alone. (She doesn't want me to leave her alone cause we are best friends, but it hurts me soo much to be with her knowing we can never be more than friends) and if I should leave her alone what can I do to help me get over her or even forget her if that's possible

I cant live my life being depressed about 1 girl this much and I know that but I just cant ever get her out of my mind.... i just dont know what to do...",13Dec2018,1

110,"I work for a printing press company in Alabama. 
I have never worked for a worse company. The management are all the ""I'm right, you're wrong"" type of people. I am treated like garbage on a daily basis and I have to put up with it because I have 2 children and I pay mine, my moms, and my fiance's bills. I cannot afford to go even 1 week without a paycheck. I have worked for them for going on 2 years. Before you say ""get a better job"", let me tell you what jobs are like in my area of Alabama. 

I make 13.50 an hour after two $1 raises. It's one of the lowest paying printing presses in the country. I have only a high school diploma. I am unable to go to college at this time due to the life I  currently have. 90% of jobs in my area start at or below $10/hr. The other 10% require that you go through a temp service company, which means your job is most likely not garunteed, and you start at a much lower wage than you would if hired through the company directly. I can't take that type of risk. I'm stuck in a rut and I don't know what I can do to get out of it. 

I'm 23 and about to turn in a work injury after January 1st ( I just recently was able to enroll for aflac benefits, was waiting for that ). It's my upper back. A couple of my spine bones give me extreme pain after about 6 hrs of standing and even more so when I lift things, which I do constantly.  Btw I work 12 hr shifts mon-fri with four 10 min breaks a day. Should have mentioned that earlier.

Unfortunately it renewed yesterday. I also have some other stuff that will auto draft from my account in January, that I cannot cover. I'm freaking out right now. I called and they do not offer refunds. 
 What are my options to deal with this? Would a credit card company possibly postpone my due date or is there a way that I could quickly make some money.
 Would one late payment ruin my credit or get sent to collections?
 If I pay a minimum payment will that hurt my credit?

114,"Before anyone says this is a phase, this has been going on for three years. 

My brother 13M is a spiteful person. He hates things just because I like them, such as music and everything else I like. He hates my friends and calls them nerds, rejects, and weirdos, even though they aren‚Äôt at all. 

He is openly critical to everyone and spiteful whenever he can be. He mutters under his breath and has to have the last word.

He goes through my things without asking and then will not admit he is wrong, and usually says something along the lines of, ‚ÄúShut the fuck up.‚Äù If a valid point is made he talks over people and tries to cut them off. 

He is manipulative and will lie about anything to get what he wants, he gets angry if he doesn‚Äôt get it, even with things like where he sits in the car, but when he gets in trouble he bawls or gets angry. 

He is lazy and never does his stuff he is supposed to do around the house, and is always napping as soon as he gets home, and he pisses on the toilet seat, and leaves clothes in the bathroom. He also refuses to do school work sometimes because he doesn‚Äôt feel like it. 

He will be an asshole to anyone but if someone makes a joke back he blocks them on everything and refuses to speak to them. 

The worst part is when he gets yelled at he threatens to call Child Protective Services, even though it‚Äôs no reason to call CPS.

Basically I‚Äôm clumsy, extremely. And mostly out of nervousness... when I work with others I get viscerally stressed &amp; panicked.

I have no idea where all of this came from, but it disturbs me deeply. His life, and our family, aren‚Äôt pieces of trivia.

I am normally really shy and this is the only class I talk in. Never once have I not hated math. The material and the way he teaches it just don't interest me.

128,"So I'm a slightly grumpy, middle-aged (well, 33) dude who has somewhat recently started working as a stylist apprentice in a dog grooming salon. I've had dogs my entire life and know quite a bit about them (which is why I choose the job) but I'm still learning the grooming side of things. I've finally reached a point where I'm confident in my work though. It may have bearing to note, before I begin, that I'm the only guy in the salon? Not sure.  

Anyway, recently one of my coworkers (a professional dog bather) has started to drive me crazy and I could use a bit of advice on how to handle it.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Here are a few examples of her recent behavior:  
&amp;nbsp;  

Any time I try to say anything regarding dogs she will try to correct me. The problem is that she is almost always wrong. One example was in a monster of a German Shepherd (my fav breed) that came in the other day. He must have weighed 120-140 pounds with thick layers of muscle and fat covering an already huge frame.  
""Wow! He's huge for a German Shepherd!"" I said when I saw him.  
""No, not really. They're all like that."" She replied in her dismissive, I know more than you voice.  
This sort of thing happens every single day, no matter what dog or even what subject I'm talking about. It can be anything.  
&amp;nbsp;  

We share a few tools in the salon and one of them is a set of clippers. We use them to shave paw pads and do sanitary trims (literally shaving buttholes and genitals). I finished with them yesterday and asked her, ""Hey, I know you're going to need these in a moment. Want them over there or...?""  
""No. I never use them anyway."" She responded in that same, dismissive tone.  
Now at this point I should point out that using those clippers is maybe 15-20% of her job so...  
&amp;nbsp;  

Lastly for now is her encouraging bad behavior in dogs. She always likes to talk about how big, male dogs are protective of her and she claims she's the only one who can work with them (which is weird enough on it's own). The fact of the matter is that she outright encourages them to behave badly though. She will encourage them to act aggressively then praise tbem for ""defending"" her and such. It's bizarre.  
She also constantly sweeps in like an excited tornado and gets otherwise calm dogs all worked up, especially those I'm working with, and then claims they're all worked up because they want her to work with them and aren't happy with me doing it.  
&amp;nbsp;  

This girl has also displayed some really worrying behavior such as mentioning casually how her boyfriend's dogs had shredded her cat one morning...

129,"Hey everyone, 
I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as I can but it needs to get off my chest and all advice is greatly appreciated! 
I recently moved into a new apartment with a friend (whom I shall refer to as Randy) and a random person (whom I shall refer to as Scott). Now while this wasn‚Äôt fairly obvious before we became housemates, I soon noticed that Randy is not really careful with his spending habits and charges us constantly for ‚Äúcommon household‚Äù items and for unnecessary luxuries/items on our money tracking group. Now over time, Randy has been taking a lot more care of the house since I‚Äôve been having a hectic semester at graduate school, and he‚Äôs been taking the initiative in buying household stuff. This includes plants, cooking oil, extra cat food dispensers etc. Now the problem is that there is MORE than adequate amount of stuff in the house, to live comfortably. For example, there are THREE cooking oil bottles so there‚Äôs really no need for one more. Another one would be that he buys eggs etc. when I‚Äôve got my own and didn‚Äôt ask for them and charges us again =&gt; total cost/3. I‚Äôve noticed that this keeps happening every other day, and I‚Äôve been so busy this semester that I have not paid any attention to it. Lo and behold I owe him about $200+ with me barely living at my place and using anything or seeing any of this stuff myself.

Now here‚Äôs the problem, I want to go through all these bills as Scott has been getting tired of this as well. But for some reason, Scott has an inferiority complex for some reason ( as he is an undergrad) and I‚Äôm older while Randy is the eldest..
So it feels like he runs the place in a way- mainly cause I have not been at home much. 
How do I deal with a friend who has turned out to be someone who spends way too much on unnecessary stuff. And work back against charges he‚Äôs charging us for when we neither asked for any of it or want to pay for it. There are so many charges to go through I just don‚Äôt know where to start or how to confront this issue without our friendship getting hurt along the process? 

Please advice! Thanks so much for reading guys. 

TLDR: Friend I‚Äôve moved in with charges me bills on common household stuff that I neither require nor asked for: how do I confront all these charges that have piled up without him thinking that I think he‚Äôs ripping me off? (Which could potentially ruin our friendship)

I have one parent and an older sibling. When I became disabled last year, I lost my job and my ability to work. Around this time my family denied my health issues and told me I had to keep on working or find a new job. They would not compromise with me in the type of care or doctor I needed, and told me I was stressing them out. They also told me I could not move back home. 

I‚Äôm not proud of this next part.... but because of all the arguments and my mom lashing out at me... Eventually I blocked them on email and on my phone for months and but they continue to wire me money every month to buy food and gas. I have been hopping from place to place since, and have been on my own trying to live. 

I have struggled to get along with my family for years because I‚Äôve always felt emotionally abused, validated, and manipulated by my mother. My sister often sides with my mom because they are closer. 

A friend of mine urged me to ask my sister for help one more time before I end up on the street this month. I really didn‚Äôt want to do it but I emailed her. Now she‚Äôs demanding to know my phone number and to speak to me. I keep telling her I can‚Äôt talk and I‚Äôm not comfortable giving my details to them right now but they keep asking.

I feel like a piece of shit for asking for their help. But I also know going back to them is going to hurt because people don‚Äôt change easily and I know I‚Äôll be blamed for having become chronically ill. I want to stop taking any money from them even if it means I end up on the street.

I've got a decent life, good grades in Community College for my CS major, I go to the gym 3 days a week, work 3 days a week, nothing really bothers me. 

I thought it was maybe the fact my family and I made a temporary move for the past few months, which made my commute about 40mins during traffic, but I got used to it.

The end of my semester is coming up (Sophomore in College) and I think its time to figure out why I feel this way. I smoke weed but usually only before I sleep, and its just a hit off my pen. I'm usually at home chilling on my computer if im not working or at school, but when friends come back from college I go hang out with them a few times a week and thats soon so its something to look forward too.  I've got long time friends on discord I talk to when I'm home.

The thing is, I sat at my computer most of my life, going from when I was about 5 till Junior year of highschool, I finally decided I wanted to start making friends and it was successful I think, but I still spend alot of time on it cause I like being at home, something about being alone while I'm out can mess with my head I think.

 I've got a few friends I see here and there during the semester so I'm not all too lonely, its not like I'm always in touch with people all the time but I'll send a snap chat out to a group of friends or hang out with some people I haven't seen in a while.

My relationship with my parents is doing pretty well and I'm very close with my brothers as well. I could definitely work on it with my sister, I still live with her but I was never close to her. I'm starting to get along with my dad again(He made a poor decision in my sophomore year of high school and I didn't want to talk to him anymore). I've never had a girlfriend but I've had little flings in high school and hooked up with a few girls senior year but never sex. 

I dont know guys, is it the weed? Do I need to go out more, or quit gaming/being on my computer? Am I mildly or heavily depressed? Or is this just what its like at this age. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks for reading my rant, I appreciate it.

134,"So last Friday at school ANTIFA came to my (high) school and was occupying a portion of my halls. They constantly were pestering me to sign their petition and then started chanting at me. I'm response I yelled back ""fuck your petition"" although this was probably a bit unnecessary they were being a serious issue for my friends and students in general.

A couple seconds later a school administrator can and grabbed me to pull me aside and talk to me about my behavior, whoever rather than saying what I did was wrong, only told me that ""they will hurt you for saying that"" and tried to force me to another side of the school, even though I was trying to get to an area they were occupying. 

Due to the fact I actually had classes with a few of the protesters I asked to apologise (I did not genuinely feel sorry, I just didn't want to get jumped after school. We already have had vigilante justice issues at our school) the admin then reminded me of the threat but a smaller group had come over and was now partaking in the conversation.

Including but not all of the people I had known and shared classes with. They were starting to get frustrated so I pulled the ignorance card and then, by the people I knew, was coerced into signing the petition.

After emailing I got a response from the principle about how not only was there not being any action taken against them they didn't seem to care. They believed that by my action I deserved the threat. On top of that they had previously known about the event and had denied ANTIFA due to an unclear petition. ANTIFA ignored their denial and still showed up.

My principal claims that he didn't want to deny them entrance due to not wanting to be seen as ""anti free speech"" even though ANTIFA has shown violent tendencies and used calls to action (not protected under first ammend btw).

Why this is so baffling to me is something that happened last year. Our superintendent (maybe vice now I forget) last year was forced to resign because he retweeted a tweet on his personal account with 42 followers that talked about how immigrants have caused more deaths than firearms (maybe AR15 specifcally, but the numbers were roughly correct if I remember right)

I refuse to stand down and I feel something needs to be done. Here are what I've thought about doing and pros and cons.

1) Email every contreversial conservative speaker I know (Shapiro, Crowder, hell maybe even Milo) to maybe see if they will hold some sort of an event, since the school wants to be not seen as ""anti free speech"" or maybe they will talk about it

2) Hold my own protest, but this one is kinda dumb. Like a protest to a protest? Lame.

3) Anonymous put up posters of conservative things on the public message boards.

Personally I would love 1 but it seems a bit unreasonable, so maybe I'll stick to 3. Although I don't want to rule out 2 if anyone has good ideas

(The petition was about inacting ""Hate Speech"" rules for ""the abuse of the first ammendment"" but was so loosely defined that it would include the PETA ""anti animal"" shit in there too. So even if you want anti hate speech laws it would be poorly implemented)

TLDR: ANTIFA protest led to me telling fuck your petition, and then an admin threatened me and now my school is backing ANTIFA not me, the student.",13Dec2018,1

I am in his back yard early in the morning everybody else was asleep, except one other friend of ours. Me and said friend are walking up to the front of the house through a side staircase that leads up to the front, the stairs pass by my good friends little sisters room. I am casually walking up the stairs talking to my buddy and as i walk up I sort of glance to the side and catch a view of her changing. I feel terribly idk if she saw me, i just basically turned my head forward and kept walking, I don't know if my friend (who was walking behind me) saw her. I didn't say anything about it and haven't since. I'm not sure if i should say anything to her or him about it. I don't know if i should say something cause she might think i was spying or if i shouldn't say anything cause it isn't really traumatic to me and maybe she is embarrassed and i just shouldn't bring it up, as i mentioned im not even sure she saw, and I really really dont know what i should do here and i feel terrible.

136,"Does anyone have any exercises or tips for becoming a nicer person? That might sound like a strange question. Lately I‚Äôve realized that when I think of people, see people, etc, my initial thought is always negative. I either think something negative about them or I remember a negative interaction I had with them. Not only do I hate that I think like this but it‚Äôs affecting my friendships and relationships.  Generally these negative thoughts are kept in my head but occasionally I end up with my foot in my mouth. It‚Äôs also just hard for me to get over the negative stuff. 

I understand the selfish aspect of this in that I want people to like me but most I just want to be the person worthy of being liked. I want to be the person who sees the good things first and let‚Äôs goes if the negative interaction I had several months back and remembers the good interactions more.

I can‚Äôt keep a steady routine as I have unfixed variables in my routine but the biggest one is Programming work and free time.

When I get home, I eat dinner (around 3:45pm) then go to my office/the basement to code till 6 or 7 or 8 pm and try to sleep before 10pm but I tend to stay up till 11 or 12 pm (like right now) then when it comes to doing what‚Äôs needed before bed, I don‚Äôt do it.

139,"Some backstory, my boyfriend has talked poorly about me over text to an ex a very long time ago.  Basically making small remarks about me being ""intimidated by her"" all because I didn't want them privately hanging out or talking for that matter when I knew he was still emotionally damaged from her leaving him. As a whole, we are past it and it was a looong time ago, but it still gets to me on overwhelming levels sometimes and I mostly keep it to myself because we've already hashed it out multiple times. 

Today we were talking to a friend about how he was upset his 4 month relationship ended, and my boyfriend says ""hey that's enough time to be really lost after losing someone, it's still an 'oh shit' feeling."" That's how long my boyfriend and his ex's relationship was, so I knew he was referring to his pain about that. 

So now I'm feeling irritated and worked up just over the fact that he felt anything at all over that, which I know is dumb and selfish of me, but it works up my insecurity. When he talked about me with her he didn't even stand up for me and I've always felt like he cared about her more than me at the time. I just get extremely upset over any mention of that part of his life and I don't want it to bother me anymore but god it fucks me UP.  Me and my boyfriend are great now so I have no intentions on leaving him. Just sick and exhausted of being emotionally drained any time I remember he gave a shit about her. She treated him like shit and didn't care and I just feel like I just should've been way more appreciated at the start. He's shown he really cares now, 2 years later, and the fact that I hold onto this anger so far ahead feels obnoxious to me but I can't let go. I'm jealous I guess, still..

Considering therapy so I can get past it, it's just that at the time I went to a therapist and they told me to put the blame on him and not on myself, which I don't blame myself, but I truly  believe he cares.

I know it's stupid and I'm old enough to have better answers to my problems but any perspective and advice would be so, so helpful right now.",13Dec2018,1
140,"FYI: this is a doozy. 


     A little info about me 27 y/o F bartender. From day 1 at my new job (2.5 years ago) this guy has been obsessed with me. He comes in when it‚Äôs slow and there‚Äôs no one else around which makes it difficult to ignore his sexist rants and ignorant remarks. When I first started the job I listened and chatted with him because it‚Äôs my job to entertain customers and provide good service. For a year his favorite thing to announce to anyone who would listen was, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs too young to date and too old to adopt.‚Äù Which is really creepy and always made me feel really uncomfortable. When I noticed his car more and more as I ran errands etc and when he actually showed up at my HOUSE, I had to draw a line. Problem is anytime I shut him down he‚Äôd automatically go on about how many guns he has in his car. Not an out right threat but it‚Äôs enough of an insinuation to deter me from getting in his face. Cause it‚Äôs, sometimes, scary being female.
    

      I continued to serve him beer but limited our chats to short convos about the weather etc. Then he decides to go on a racist rant so I shut him down because NOT in my bar- Never going to fly. My boss was present for this and knows about all of my previous complaints. My coworkers and I joke about the time he rambled on about he wished he could brush my hair for me (he‚Äôs insane). 


      I told my boss I‚Äôm at my wits end with this guy. He told me he understands and that he hates the guy too but wants to use him for the services he can provide (boss uses him for dump runs and access to machinery) and that he doesn‚Äôt want to 86 him. My boss said just show him your tattoos and ignore his comments. (Clarification: Dude is sexist and hates it when women breach his view of how women should behave ie smoke, have tattoos, opinions haha) 


      After the racist comments and being unable to 86 him I chose to simply ignore him. I hand him a beer and  leave to clean stuff if it‚Äôs slow. You know it was really fun watching him squirm as he realized slowly over time that I‚Äôm never going to give him the opportunity to chat with me again.


     Now he hates me so instead of him showering me in creepy compliments he goes on and on about how much prettier I was before I got a tattoo and says god knows what. I heard about this through other patrons from the bar. Which I really don‚Äôt care about since pretty much everyone hates the guy and no one actually listens to him...There are some dimwits who do though- which is mildly infuriating. 


    The other day he and some guys were chatting about how quiet it was in the bar (I‚Äôm like duh it‚Äôs 1 o‚Äôclock on a Tuesday dummy) the creeper in question decided to tell a bar patron who doesn‚Äôt come in very often that it‚Äôs my fault, that I have a bad personality. Nice job insulting the bartender. You‚Äôre not going to get another beer there buckaroo. So again I get to watch him squirm while everyone else gets good service and their glasses are never found empty. And he just sits there with his empty can. That is until he threw a fit and I kind of got into his face about it, hoping he would say something bad enough to warrant being 86d. 


    Is this really the best I can do though? What other steps can I take to ward off this dudes temper? I don‚Äôt want to just find another job because guys like this exist everywhere and I need to figure out how to deal with them. Especially creepers who never blatantly cross the line but basically live on top of the line and only rarely stick their disgusting tentacles across it. What do I do reddit?

: creeper is obsessed with me at work but I have to remain professional. Creeper creeps in a way where he always has deniability and I‚Äôve had enough.

141,"I‚Äôm really sorry if this post is long, rambling or seems like it could be better written. I became disabled last year and have been suffering with chronic illness ever since. I am a transient and have been going from place to place for the last 8 months. 

I have a sibling and also a parent who I don‚Äôt have a good relationship with. My mother has a long history of emotional abuse and my sister typically enables or sides with her, which has always made it difficult for me to deal with my family. I‚Äôm also a part of the problem I‚Äôm sure. 

When I became disabled, my family used denial to dismiss that something was wrong. They did not and still do not accept my explanations of failing health and denied me housing when I lost my job and could not secure disability. I pleaded and explained to them that I could not take care of myself anymore but was told I needed to keep working anyway. 

I went though more months trying to seek help from doctors but they were unhelpful and unwilling to document my issues for disability. I eventually lost my job. Unable to negotiate with my family on proper medical care or housing. My mother lashed out at me for having become ill and made me feel so guilty for stressing her out, I cut contact with them in May. I blocked both of them on my phone and email.

Here‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm not proud of: they continued to send me money for food and gas. I did not ask them to but they sent it every month. They stopped in October.

I didn‚Äôt want to email them but a friend of mine encouraged me to so I could make it through the month. Now I really really regret it. Since emailing them they keep asking to speak to me by phone and I feel so anxious because I know I am going to be emotionally abused again. I tell them I don‚Äôt want to give my number to them but they keep asking for my phone number.

I feel so guilty for asking for their help because I know I can‚Äôt do this. I can‚Äôt go back to them, j just can‚Äôt go through more blame for becoming ill. I feel awful about it but I think I would rather be on the streets than to go back to them.

142,"I met this guy in a course. We started as friends and he was really nice to me and cheered me up when I was sad. Within two weeks we kissed and there seemed to be a strong connection between us. He seemed to genuinely like and care about me. But he told me about his commitment issues because he‚Äôd broken up with his long-term girlfriend, so we must stay friends only, or ‚Äúcasual‚Äù.  We only kissed because I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sex since I only met him a few weeks before. 
When he told me about being casual/just friends it confused me because I wasn‚Äôt sure if he had feelings for me but didn‚Äôt want a label, or he just wanted intimacy to fill a void without any romantic feeling toward me at all. 
The month long course ended and we parted ways and we were both depressed. He said he‚Äôd text me and he‚Äôll miss me. I waited a week, no response from him so I initiated. But his responses were quick but boring and short like he had lost all interest. But then I asked a normal question, he didn‚Äôt respond after two days. I got kind of annoyed and said some passive-aggressive things about how I‚Äôm obviously not important to him and I deserved better. He never responded. I felt bad because I feel like I overreacted. So two days later I tried to call him to talk about everything. It got diverted to voicemail. 
I‚Äôm just wondering, from an outsider‚Äôs perspective, if there was anything real or did he just want intimacy, and did he really not care that much to just ghost me after we said our goodbyes.

143,"So long story short I'm a double transfer and regret transferring from my first school.

I did it cause of my major which I hated at the time because it didn't have enough art. However, that feeling of hate has been replaced with regret now that it has been so long. The school and location was perfect and I'm still in love with the place.

I visit when I have the chance to see my friends and it's like no time has passed once we're together

I left the best group of friends you could imagine. I met my current best friend there who I would die for and only get to see her every 3 months or so. This group of friends is the classic kind where we all sync up and every moment is fun and memorable. My last school was shit since I was a hermit and only made surface friends, but nothing deeper than that. My current school I have a decent amount of friends and a little group, but to me they're disposable. Not that I don't like them, but we aren't entirely a group that belongs together really.

I was happy at my first school and I get upset reminiscing about it because I was happy and haven't been since really. (Socially and mentally)

My friend just told me about her studying abroad and she'll be rooming with 8 people 4 of which are close friends. The will be a great matchs anyways. I'm pissed at myself for leaving. Yes it's only 4 years of your life, BUT ITS COLLEGE MAN. I should have stayed, I really should have. Not that it was a bad school too.

I have this one roommate called Jane (not her real name). Jane is a really person, she does not do any bad. But recently, I feel like I am going to lose my mind soon. Let me explain.
First and foremost, she is dirty. She does not shower and does not clean her clothes / dishes. So, the room smells. Really bad. I always gag when I first enter when she is in the room. She also keeps her dirty laundry on the ground. 
Second, her alarm is making me crazy. She keeps snoozing at 7 am, and it has been keeping me up. She snoozes for an hour and when I try to talk she gets defensive kind of. She told me that she has class but she never wakes up to go to the class. 
My other roommate is also not happy with this situation, she has told her about the laundry and she packed them up but the alarm and smell situation still goes on. I am getting crankier in my daily life and I am counting the days until the semester is done (almost 20 days). I also have my own projects and I need that well-earned sleep, but I can‚Äôt get it.

151,"So my wife and I got into a debate tonight...

She thinks that there are no friends that are willing to be your friend as friends because they like you as a person, she thinks that they are only friends because they are trying to get some sort of benefit from you.

She also thinks my best friend from high school (we've known each other since 6th grade)  is going to treat me different since he is now a doctor. He has no benefit to get from me since I'm not to his status level and I will have nothing to talk about. Since he live in a different city and he met different people that he can relate with his career he will no longer have use for me. Ex: she said that when my friend is in a difficult time, he won't get any benefit talking to me because I won't benefit him in any way since I don't know his current situation/career/life/major/marriage so talking to me is pointless. She also thinks that catching up with friends is pointless. 

And in my opinion the definition of a friend is totally different from hers, maybe because I was born and raised in different country than her. I believe that a good friend no matter what the status is, you will be there for them even if you don't get any benefit back from them. Maybe I live in a fantasy world but I believe that status means nothing, if everything was depending on status and you only associate with people that are the same level as you then I feel like that's not true friendship.

We had this thing called Masters In Math we got a sheet of paper with math questions on it, now I was a gifted student with straight A+'s on every report card I got. We were doing multiplication by 9's. There were 25 questions and 1 minute to do them. So I sat beside her and we always ""flirted"" and joked around with each other. She was already done so she was watching me finish up. I had 1 question to go with about 3 seconds left. It was 9 x 2, I knew the answer ""18"", so half way through writing it she took my pencil and said ""times up"" in a joking manner. I didn't finish. So... I didn't pass. When everybody else did. Every body knows I'm gifted so it was really hard coping with kids making fun of me because I didn't get the question right and pass. With all this negative comments and bullying going on, my friend (girl) was trying to say sorry. Since I've had other problems like this I didn't really believe her. Now I know she was being sincere. So I kept on brushing her off and ignoring her until we only talked in times where we were forces to be put together. I still like her and she still does like me but after I was a complete jerk, its kind of awkward. The ways in which I was a jerk was I met somebody else who was arch nemeses with the girl I like(d). She was also a girl. She started telling lies to me about her, I believed her and started to talk about her behind her back. The thing is I am always trying to ask her if she is actually doing these things, (stealing my lunch, ripping my test) but she always says ""no"". I have a weird feeling it is my newfound ""friend"" doing these things to make a bad impression of the girl I like. Now it is extremely awkward to talk to her. All I need is now I'm in 6th grade, (same class as her, and trying to become friends again).   The only thing is I am socially awkward, I stutter, don't look the greatest but try my best to and am extremely shy, even to my immediate family. I need a bit of ""advice"" on how to tell her without ""harassing"", or annoying/forcing her that I want to get into the same state of friendship we used to be in.

His father was home, but asleep so him and I were gonna just have a couple drinks and play Rocket League like we do pretty often together. I brought a 5th of fireball and drank about half the bottle pretty quick, but I absolutely remember the entire night. I was never drunk to the point where I would have made a bad decision. We stayed in his basement all night. I don‚Äôt know if it has any bearing on the story or not but my girlfriend of 3 years who means the world to me and I were arguing on the phone pretty intensely for a little bit that day which is extremely rare we‚Äôve never really argued about much. She proceeded to break up with me around 1AM over the phone. So I just kept drinking and drinking trying to not rlly think about it and I wasn‚Äôt honestly that shaken up about it. I was keeping myself distracted. Anyways, he hadn‚Äôt drank pretty much anything so he was 100% sober. My girlfriend called me around 1:45 saying she made a mistake and wanted to get back together so I agreed and we agreed to meet at my house the next morning around 9:00 when she got done with her finals. I went pee and fell asleep somewhere around 4:30AM after him and I played some games for a few hours and looked at some YouTube videos. When I woke up I believe it was around 9am.

I'm divorced and my two sons live close by with their mother, who I have a good co-parenting relationship with, we have a normal visitation schedule where I have them every other weekend for a few days, and visits beside that. I love my kids dearly, it took a long time for me to be a good dad and they mean a lot to me. Moving to this dream job would mean seeing them much less, though my new job and situation would afford me the ability to fly down every other month and have a month off every summer for them to fly down (recommended visitation schedule for far away parents) without a problem but at the age they are (2 and 5) I'm afraid that I won't get this time back with them and I might be sacrificing my relationship with my kids. 

I'm professionally stuck here, there is no moving forward here and I don't think another opportunity like this will come along soon, but if I take this job then I will exit my children's lives in a major way. If I stay here with my kids then I will stay stagnant in this position for a long time, even my getting a degree will take at least 5 or 6 years with the time I have to commit to it. 

I'm not a bad dad but if I take this step I feel like I'll be giving up on them, I'll be a deadbeat dad who walked out on them. I'm still paying child support and seeing them if I move, but I won't really be a dad, not in the way I want to be. This job is my way forward though, this is such a golden opportunity that I can't afford to just say no. ",13Dec2018,1

159,"Background info: My daughter is in 2nd grade. She is reading at a 4th grade level, has frequent compliments from school staff members about behavior and helping classmates, and is a generally good kid - though opinionated.  We recently moved to a new state from California.  My daughter was previously in a 10 star school, where she was at the top of her class in her scores for mathematics and science.  The school she‚Äôs in now is rated 8/10. The first time I met with her new teacher, she had nothing but praise for my daughter...until I mentioned that we‚Äôd come from California. She seemed...offended when I mentioned where we‚Äôd moved from for some reason.  All of her tests and homework assignments come home, and she has never missed more than 2 answers on any of them. She never struggles with her homework, and she even recently received an award for academic achievement, so imagine my surprise when her report card comes home, and her teacher scored her ‚Äúbelow grade level‚Äù in literally every subject - even art. I know she‚Äôs not performing below grade average, because, as I‚Äôve mentioned, I‚Äôve seen her test and homework scores. Not really sure how to proceed now, but I‚Äôm pretty pissed at the prospect of my daughter being treated poorly because of where she‚Äôs from. I honestly don‚Äôt know what else it could be.

Im in college full time and work 40+ a week and I was able to do homework at work most of the time on breaks at my original site. Ive been at the new place 5 months now and just miss my old school very much. The thing is the difference in pay is $15 vs $23 and I am still negotiating my pay so I still have the option to walk away. Should I suck it up and take the extra money?

162,"I know this sounds like trolling but I can assure you it is quite the opposite. Ever since 2015 I started going on 4chan and creeping on /pol/ and now my mind is totally warped and distorted. I thought what I posted and read was just for fun and trolling but I genuinely feel like I can't go back to what I used to be, which was a pretty left-leaning and open-minded individual. I honestly don't know which way is up anymore. Is this normal? Or is it old age? (29 M btw...)

I can't seem to get back to ""normal"". I can't seem to quit getting back on 4chan either, as much as I try. Going so far as deleting apps on my phone. I've tried spending time on reddit but I feel completely out of sync with the user base. Without getting too political, I do love Donald Trump but I don't know why anymore. I know he's a horrible person and has done many illegal things, which I do read and support on subs like /r/politics. But in my heart of hearts I can't stop loving the man and wishing the best for his family. And I know that's irrational and part of the brainwashing...I just can't seem to shake it off.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. My life has been falling apart at the seams ever since 2015. I broke up with my girlfriend, quit a successful job in a big city, ended up moving back with my parents. Have no job, no money, no real friends. Used to workout and eat healthy, now I barely eat and watch anime all day. I wish I was making all this up. And no, I don't blame all of this on 4chan. I know I'm a big part of the problem as well and have to stand behind my decisions. I'm not looking for sympathy. 

I guess, I just want to commiserate with anybody else that feels like this. What their personal experiences have been like? I know most will look at this and laugh but I am being sincere, perhaps in the weirdest of ways. I feel, well, alone in this but maybe this will resonate with somebody else. Maybe this is the wrong place to ask?

It has had some weird effects on me: it's made me super competitive, a perfectionist, and constantly depressed. It's not that I feel I'm not living up to other people's expectations, I feel I'm not living up to my own expectations.

My hyper-competitive attitude has driven the people I love and respect away from me, leading to even more depression.

My boyfriend just broke his phone. He can't get a new one anytime soon. I have an old phone with a cracked screen lying around that he could maybe use instead of spending the money he doesn't have on a new phone entirely. The main issue is that he is AT&amp;T and I am on Verizon.

I'm wondering if there is a way to put this old phone onto his account somehow? They are both iPhones. I think my old one was an iPhone 5c, his is newer. I can get the details later if you guys need that info. I just don't know much about this stuff",13Dec2018,1

Ok, I live in a house with two housemates, I am renting to own it from my folks, the housemates are paying me monthly to stay there. I am friends with both, but in the months we've been living together, issues have popped up. Roommate A I have been knowing for a couple years now, roommate B I met through A and have known for a little over a year. 
Roommate A had trouble holding a job and paying rent for the majority of his time staying here. He's paid rent maybe four or five times in the year we've been here. I cut him slack because he was my only friend for a time and we had been close.
Roommate B has come to me with complaints about A. For example, not cleaning up after himself, leaving food out, leaving the stove on, not properly caring for his pet cat and strong odors coming from A's room.
    Many of these things I have noted myself, but a few were news.(I work out of town for most of the month, and have a poor sense of smell.)
These issues have been addressed in group discussion and in one on one conversations. Little  progress has been made.
I gave him an ultimatum, get his act together or leave. Pick up after himself, no dirty dishes in his room, clean his room and deep clean his carpet. I gave home unroll the first of December.
He did enough to get by.
But now he's starting to get back into his habits. He continues to distance himself from his friends, does not help pay utilities and is currently late on this months rent, though his job pays well and the rent is only 250. 
Roommate B, I've had very little trouble with as far as cleanliness, he's better than me and it's just a few personal preferences we have negotiated on. B has a shit job, but has so far never missed a payment or shown disrespect to our home.
I don't want to ruin what friendship I have left with A but I want him out. Any advice? ",13Dec2018,1

So what should I do?? I want to wear the ring properly, as it‚Äôs very important to me, but wearing correctly can be a hassle. Do I suck it up and wear it on my right hand?? Risk a lot of damage to get it resized?? Remove the bud scar itself?? Or is there something else I‚Äôm not considering. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.

A video was also recorded. I thought at first it was my coworkers messing with me. But as I watched the video, it was just the camera trying to focus on the ceiling. It was operating on its own.

199,"This one is a doozy. I have many many questions.

Back Story: I graduated from high school back in May of 2018. I decided to take a semester or two off because I ""wasn't ready."" I'm honestly not sure if this was a mistake or not. I don't know if I should have forced myself (or been forced) to go. I just felt like my life was spiraling out of control and not going to college gave me some control. I went through some serious depression and came out of it around September. I was scared of failing my classes, I was terrified that I wouldn't know what to do. I didn't even know what I wanted to major in. I feel like there is so much pressure to immediately know what you want your career to be the second you're handed your diploma. I saw all my friends planning their lives, and I freaked out. I stayed home, got a job, made some money, and quit that job (that's a whole other story). Long story short, I felt like I was failing. I tried talking to my parents and siblings (all but one are older than me) and none of them seemed to say anything that made sense to me. I decided in October to attend a smaller college in my home state to get my generals done (I settled on music). I applied and was admitted for the Spring semester of 2019. After that, I would like to transfer to a University to complete my education. 

Now: I feel like I'm failing again. I don't even know what classes to take or where to start. I have always had a passion for music and theater, and I would like a masters degree in performing arts with a minor in theater...and maybe a business minor thrown in there too. On the other hand, a teaching degree is much more practical. Do I give up my passion for practicality? I can't be admitted to the music program until next fall anyway (the semester after this one). So, what do I do? I'm so stressed and I feel like my life is spiraling out of control again. I put registering for classes off until now, but I don't know what classes to take! I did research, but I take direction (i.e. ""this is exactly what you need to do"") better. I can't find anything telling me what I should or need to do.

I don't know if I'm alone here...but if not, maybe some of this advice can help other young people in my position. 

Here is to hoping someone can help.

tl;dr I would like to pursue a masters degree in performing arts (music) and I need help with general classes I should register for to begin.",13Dec2018,1

201,"My dad is in his early 60s and has been on disability for over a decade after an accident. He can still walk and is healthy though is a little bit overweight and he doesn't exercise. I don't think it can go on like this much longer. 

Besides family he has no one other than some friends he calls every now and then, but the relationships are shallow. Since his divorce with my mom he's been alone, I still don't think he's over it after so many years. Most days he sits on the recliner and watches TV. He has narcolepsy and has to take a lot of pills so has trouble keeping awake but he can and chooses not to. 

He lives alone and eats horribly. He told me he gets Burger King almost every day, and other than that it's snack food. He doesn't cook anything healthy for himself or if he does it's rarely. He was married for a long time and never had to cook. On top of this he doesn't exercise, partly because physically it's hard but also laziness. He has no purpose in life right now and it's made him depressed. No career left, no major goals in sight -- just living.

I'm worried and it's so hard to watch his health deteriorate before me. For a long time I wanted to believe my parents were superheroes, but little signs of aging are peeking through.  Dad struggles to get in and out of the car, or needs my help lifting a heavy box. Nothing significant - just enough to remind you that the clock is running out.

How do you do it? How do you learn to accept that the strongest people in your life are getting weaker?

Today i picked up my belongings from the repo lot almost 1hour away, and someone had pocketed all the cash that i had inside my wallet. I only have 1 night, maybe two at most, for a place to stay but have no way of getting back to my temp housing that's 300 miles away, I was in Restraunt management for the last 3 years and got denied unemployment because ""i didnt request a transfer"" (I've transferred before and i had to resign because 298 miles was the closest location and could not commute) and i recieved my last paycheck 22 days late and it was after bugging them that i talked them into sending me a photo of my check.  

Im 23 years old and I've been focused on maintaining high credit and  had 100% payment history over my 7 years of building credit, july 2018 i had to leave my job and move and was my first time ever being unemployed and my first late payment which began a snowball effect 

Ive held consistent work since i was 15 years old, but i wasnt allowed home and had to bounce around friends couches and get through high school while trying to make money. Ive always been promoted within my employment and continue to go the extra mile in everything i do. But having to balance school and work with an unstable living situation I've never had a chance to catch up or build any form of savings, and when i have gotten caught up something happens that sets be back again and i have to start from zero. 

I'm losing hope in my ability to bounce back from this and i just missed my 3rd car payment last week.  I feel like I'm extremely hard on myself and mainly embarrassed and disappointed in myself for losing everyrhing I've worked the last 7 years for. Ive ditched my social life and stress myself out by taking on too much overtime and being a detail oriented multitasker- and have absolutely nothing to show for the hardships and struggles I've pushed through but past due accounts and a car repossession and my credit was in the 700s and lost almost 200 pts .

Im at a loss and have accepted that i can't afford to get my car out.  Ive definitely learned from this and am facing my consequences but i can't seem to catch a break anywhere i go no matter how much i risk

But hopefully this will work out for the better,

204,"Little Background Info: I'm in my last year of high school and the class I want to drop is AP Capstone Research. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it's not my mom who's upset it's more my Dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I literally can't stand the class as I haven't even found a topic that I really enjoy enough to research it fully and spend a lot of time on it. On top of that, I have a full schedule and I just feel like I don't have the motivation to do the course on top of all my other courses. 

This decision has been kind of difficult for me to make in the first place as Capstone is heavily pushed by my school, so I've had to meet with 2 different teachers, twice and have them grill me on my decision to drop it before even getting the dropout sheet. SO yeah I doubted my decision a lot as the only people who were supportive was my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad sees my decision as a sign of giving up, being lazy and that I'm not determined and I can't persevere through it. That I lack 'tenacity' and should just brave it through because the Capstone Diploma is an achievement. I tried to explain that I hadn't found a topic I was really dedicated to and enjoyed, because it should be something that I enjoy. He responded saying that I don't necessarily have to enjoy it to be determined to complete it and if I hadn't found a topic I liked then I apparently don't like anything. He even refused to sign my sheet which is fine because my mom would sign it since she doesn't really care.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate letting down my parents or making them upset, especially because my dad just gets kind of quiet and I hate it so much. I just get this gut-wrenching feeling in the bottom of my stomach because I feel so bad about it and I'm now considering just doing it anyway. Should I just do the course and suck it up?

211,"A year and a half ago my ex boyfriend (21) of only a half a year (short, I know) cheated on me (21/F) and I found out. Even though the relationship was short lived, it impacted me in such a way was struggling with depression, and at the time I felt like he was my only friend. I trusted him 100%. 

When I found out, we agreed to get together and talk about it. During the conversation, he started crying‚Äîwhich his feelings are valid and I believe men should openly express their feelings‚Äî it just took me off gaurd. Being a person who is extremely empathetic, my reaction was to comfort him and suppress my emotions to make him feel better. This was stupid. I never had the chance to ask the questions I wanted to and I never understood why he did it. 

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm with a man who loves me unconditionally, and genuinely makes me happy. Then, I got a text message from my ex boyfriend, which said he felt very wrong about how our relationship ended and wanted to clear the air. He asked me to meet him, so he could explain himself. I never got the closure I deserved but I was still very unsure about this, because I am truly in love with my current boyfriend. The deciding factor, for me, was the fact that I can see how this broken trust from my previous relationship is slightly projected on to my new one now. Even though my boyfriend is completely faithful to me, I can‚Äôt help but think: who is texting him when the phone rings or be secretly jealous of his female friends. This isn‚Äôt fair to my boyfriend who has been nothing less then great. I HATE THAT IM LIKE THIS. My intentions to talk with my ex were pure and I went from closure to move on in my relationship not because I still had feelings for him.

So, I meet up with my ex at this coffee shop and he proceeds to explain everything that happened. I made it clear that I had a boyfriend and had zero intent to rekindle anything. And you know what in a weird way, I understand why he did it, I just wish he was honest with me. I blamed myself for his infidelity. I thought something was wrong with me. I thought that maybe I didn‚Äôt have enough of that and I was too much of this. It made me very insecure. This effected my relationship and how I trust. 

Having this understanding on what happened with my ex helped me to close that dark chapter of my life and I feel like I can only grow from it and move forward with my relationship. My question in all of this, is how do I tell my current boyfriend about this talk with my ex? Is what I did wrong? I wanted to wait for the best opportunity to tell my boyfriend, because he deserves to know, but I mentioned it to our mutual friend and she is threatening to tell him if I don‚Äôt.

214,"So I'm an 18 year old currently finishing his final year of high school, and frankly I'm in a very bad place right now. Admittedly, I have become mixed up in drugs before, but despite having an addiction to stimulants, I was able to get myself off of them over a long and shitty process that no one in my family knew about... until about 4 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my family is as invasive as it gets. They're overly caring in the way that harms more than helps. A while ago I was addicted to concerta and was able to ween myself off of it permanently by vaping (in secret). Long story short, my family found my vape, destroyed it, and proceeded to ridicule me and treat me like the black sheep of the family (still do) until I had had enough of it and told my parents why I bought a vape in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom took it terribly and blamed herself for my former addiction, and went ahead and told all of her friends for the attention that it brought. My dad was better about it and said he was proud that I had to initiative to get off of the drugs (even though he makes ""nicotine stained finger"" jokes around family friends and at family dinners). Whenever my mom gives me lunch money she'll look at me and say ""please, please don't buy drugs with it."" Now flash forward to today, one of my good friends came to me and told me that my parents are going to get me tested for drugs at my next doctors appointment. I'm off of drugs. I have been for over a year now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have struggled with depression for a long time, and my family has made it nothing but worse. They're very traditional, so when I asked for help my mom simply responded by saying ""back in the day people just dealt with it."" But now that they know I used to take drugs, every time I'm feeling down my mother instantly assumes I'm on them again. They ignore my actual cries for help, call me ""weak"" when I ask to get treated for depression, and assume that they know how to fix everything when in fact my family just self-confirms their bias about me constantly. After my friend came to me (he found out I was getting tested because they announced it in front of my priest and family friends at dinner when I was out of the house) I felt a pit in my stomach. Every laugh I have shared with my family and every happy moment has been shattered and sullied by their impression of me. They all think I'm an addict and I don't know how to fix it. I want to yell at them and I want to scream but none of it is going to change their minds. And at this point I think my mom HOPES that I'm on drugs because she gets to relish in the attention of it. I know that sounds drastic but it's the most prevalent emotion I get from her. I just want everything to be normal and I just want them to treat me like their son and not some fucking drug addled cunt, but if I get angry they'll just blame it on my non-existent addiction. I just want some help or advice because I'm struggling with major depression and ADHD and sleep issues but they can't get over themselves and their self-perpetuating family drama.

I always have been a very competitive person in general and it has helped me in college life and work life to a certain extend. However, it‚Äôs slowly swallowing my entire life and I start to compare everything I have with everyone.

About 8 years ago, we had a huge argument about a very minor thing. It was more of just bent up anger that culminated. I cried, she cried. She tried apologizing the day after but I was too hurt to forgive her. Her apologizes are really half assed and she never backs down from an argument. For the next 6 years or so I didn't really speak to her. During those 6 years alot of things happened. My great grandma (who took care of my sister and I) as children became ill. My sister was just finished up her medical school training and was about to help my dad with his practice. During that time she took care of my great grandma for a short time and then one day she just walked out and abandoned her. I felt really sad for my grandma and also about her attitude. Shortly after, I was laid off and I couldn't bear to see my grandma like that so I stayed home and took care of her for about a year until she passed. The following year my mother got cancer. It was a tough time for all of us. The responsibilities were divided between my immediate family. My sister was managing the medical practice, my dad took care of my mom, i was managing our real estate investments as well as took care of my mom. I actually had to pass on a dream job that I was offered across the country because of out situation. For these years I sacrificed my career. Over time, my mom's health improved. I went to my sister's wedding even though I did not want to. Last year, we took a step forward in our relationship (my sister and I). I came to apologize and tried to end the strain in our family. At first she made a big deal out of it but we came to terms. Over the year, I would barely interact with her, honestly because she is a very difficult person to speak to and I don't like confrontation. We see each other alot at my parents home (which we both share about 60% of the time). I probably said 10 words to her the entire year. Recently she had a kid. I did not visit her in the hospital because I don't like her husband. I also did not say anything because I was blindsided by the fact that her husband was staying at my parents house for over 2 weeks. I admit, it was not the right thing for me to do. She was apparently really angry about it. When I got home, I apologized to her and she started cussing me out and really taking low blows. There was a time where she did not visit me when I had surgery in the hospital. She explained that she was busy. It hurt but im used to it now.

My dad has a business thing going on in another country and he won't be here for quite a while and Im not very close to my mom and I don't enjoy being around her. What should I do?

I like the idea of going to a nearby country alone but I'm only a 5'6"" dude and I'm not sure if my parents will allow me. I live in Malaysia, so Singapore is nice but its really expensive and there's Thailand and Indonesia but I think my parents question the safety of those countries. I like idea of running at my own time and doing whatever I want because I want to but I don't know what to do. Any ideas?

236,"I've seen my dad almost every Wednesday since my mum chucked him out for being emotionally abusive to her and somewhat physically to my brother. I was 11, so I didn't know this. For three years he's been on drugs, but it's only marijuana. He suffered years of trauma as a kid, and his only escape was violence and drugs. He kind of stopped after meeting my mum but then they split and he started again. A lot of stuff happened between then but I don't wanna go into it to be honest. He caused a lot of trouble over the weekend cause he just left my Nanna's, where he was staying, and didn't tell anyone. My mum wants him to get help-she told me she wants him sectioned. If you don't know what that means, I think it's being put in a mental facility for a while to get help but it's not as easy to get someone sectioned like it used to be apparently. Anyway, he wants to see me tonight and I do want to go out with him but I don't know what to do? Do I just act normal or? He always said he'd die without me because my brother wants nothing to do with him and even though he and my mum don't hate eachother and they still speak, he misses her but she's in a relationship now.

239,"I desperately need your guys advice (you'll have to excuse my poor grammar as I'm writing this on a phone). I recently moved in to my girlfriends moms house, temporarily (not the first time we've had to do this). It's my girlfriend, her mom, her big brother (he's 40, that's another story ugh) and her little brother who has autism and downs syndrome (about a 2 year old mentally).

Id like to first off say how appreciative I am for my gfs mom for letting us stay here, it's a blessing (recently lost my job). Sadly I feel like her son is destroying her house and possibly her life in some ways. He stays up all night, makes sure all the radios and lights are on. We can't buy groceries because he eats EVERYTHING in the kitchen, he demands supervision at a constant rate and he's not getting that attention. Again, his capacity is that of a 2 year old, non verbal.

For some reason the mom is against group homes. I don't know if she feels guilty or if she's worried for his safety but I do know its limiting her abilities to live a better life. What advice would you gives give? Should we just ignore this or help her with finding a better situation for her son? ",13Dec2018,1
240,"New to reddit, so please bear with me.

General background: Working at a retail place where we serve both sandwiches and various drinks. Majority late teens work here. I'm one of the few workers who are in their mid-twenties (but haven't told many people my actual, but really, I look like their age).

At my workplace, it's important to clean up after yourself after each use of specific machines, spoons, cups, etc. It's acceptable to leave some items uncleaned due to rush hours, as long as we clean up after ourselves. Today, Ann (fake co-worker's name) and I were the only ones making drinks for customers in the late afternoon, when she asked me to clean the used cups and spoons in the sink. Keep in mind, those were her cups and sinks. I didn't mind, honestly, cause I finished the drink orders and so I did. Then 2 more customers came in we both did their orders, until she asks me again to clean her used cup, while I was trying to finish an order. I told her, ""Sure but let me finish this order."" She got mad at me and angrily cleaned it herself.

Later, after I finished washing dishes in the back, I was using towel drying some containers, when she came up to me and told me, ""You have to put liners in there."" I said, ""oh yea, I'm just trying to dry them."" And she literally rolled her eyes at me. She left to go get liners (plastic bags for drinks we put into the containers) in the back. When she returned, she said, ""You're suppose to let them air-dry you know."" I already knew she was irritated with me so I said, ""oh really"" because at that point I was annoyed with her eye roll at me (side note: air drying and towel drying makes no difference imho because we're gonna put liners into the containers anyways so what's the point in pointing out how to exactly dry these containers).

Fast forward, I was by myself at the register (we only have one register) helping a customer order while Ann was talking to our other co-workers at the drink station. I was putting the customer's money into the register, when Ann approaches next to me asking for the next customer in line (i know, i'm also thinking wtf can't you wait) and the customer I was working with was still standing in front of me waiting for her reciept. Luckily, the customer behind was kind enough to wait till we were both done. Ann, however, was urging the customer behind to order already. When the customer behind said she'll wait for the lady in front of her to finish,  Ann asks me, ""can we switch,"" which I'm sure implied ""move, you're not fast enough"" or whatever. I didn't respond as I was finally finishing up with the customer I was helping with, and left her alone with the register.


I always clean up after anyone, even if I didn't make the mess as I geninually don't mind cleaning up. I can't connect with my younger coworkers as we have about a 5 year age gap and our only connection is work, so I just end up cleaning as well as I don't talk with many of my co-workers since they kinda have their own cliques. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I don't get along with everyone at my workplace, it's just the yongsters talk amongst themselves usually while I'm off by myself. So I'm guessing Ann thinks that I'm better off cleaning than making drinks/sandwiches, and probably got angry that I didn't clean up after she asked and then tries making my life at work miserable.

246,"I've been at my company for 10 years in the same department and in my current position for 3 1/2 years. I do not have a college degree. 

Earlier this year, a co-worker who had been at the company for 2 1/2 years got promoted to my level and was making a penny more than me an hour. It irritated me but she does have her degree and it was only a penny.

A few months ago my company increased the starting wage for the employees a step below me. Before the new wage, they were making $5 less than me. With the new starting wage, they're making about $1.70 less an hour than me. The people who get promoted to these positions (lowest tier management position) are typically employees that have been with the company less than a year. A degree is not needed.

My company has not announced an increase for those on my level.

Recently, another co-worker was promoted to my level. He has been with the company for 5 1/2 years and in our department roughly 8 months. Before he was promoted, he was making around $1.15 less than me. Now with the promotion he is making over $3 an hour more than me. He does have his degree.

I don't know what to do about this. I think what makes it worse is my boss and I have had conversations in the past, where they could not believe the first person was making more than me. They promised me that the second person wouldn't make more than me but now he's making significantly more. Our annual raises aren't for a few more months. Getting a raise before then is unheard of unless it's from a promotion.

I honestly feel like Corporate may have increased the starting wage for my position but never announced it. I could be getting paid less than what the starting wage is now. I can't exactly go to HR and ask what the starting wage is because I am in HR. I just don't know what to do right now and finding this out has completely demoralized me. ",13Dec2018,1
247,"I have seen a lot of people receive great advice from Redditors. I am giving it a shot in hopes I get the same treatment. Back in March 2017, I started working at a logistics company in sales. I was quickly able to build my book of business and during my 2nd yeae, I doubled my income from the previous year (roughly $80,000 CAD). For the last 20 days, I have been missing work due to a family emergency. My dad is in the hospital and will be requiring a heart surgery. Keep in mind, I live two hours away from my parents so I've dropped everything at work to help out my parents. Sadly at work, my book of business doesn't generate the same amount of money if I am not present. I have expressed my concerns to my manager and HR. I mentioned during my absence, it will be very difficult for me to keep up with my day to day operations. I am not in the right mind to be able to look after my book of business. Side note I forgot to mention, I am on full commission so I have to ensure my book of business generates money for my bank account to stay healthy. My company opened up a new office in the city I currently reside in and I solely moved there to help them get the office running, so I can ask them for my own office closer to my parents. In my email, I also mentioned the support person we have in the office is not made out to handle my book of business due to his personality. My manager assured me not to worry about anything and they would take care of everything. But that new person, absolutely refused to help out and threatened to walk out the door. At this point, I gave up as I had more stress from my dad being at the hospital. I completely gave up and had my mindset on as soon as my dad gets better and is back home. I will have to go back and do damage control and get my book of business solid once again. I also requested that during the week of surgery, I do not want work to be on my mind at all. Once again hr didn't respond back, my manager did and said not to worry about anything. I have a bad habit of checking my emails from my phone and it was absolutely disastrous. I have customers reaching out to me directly on my cellphone (only a handful of my good customers have my cell). I explained the situation and they were super understanding. Told me family comes first and their business will be there for me once I return. 

But what got me thinking is, if I were to leave my current company to join a competitor. My company will do everything they can to keep possession of my book of business. Get numerous people to take over my accounts and do whatever they can. Even if they have to go negative for a few months, to prevent me from competing. 

There is another company that is 1/5th of my current company's size. I know the owner of the company will love me there. He knows the experience, and value I'll be bringing. I'll probably have to start around $50,000 the first year but once I can grow my book of business again within a year and help him grow his company. I know I can get closer to $100,000 in my second year. I did speak to him in the past but turned down his offer because I was in a good path with my current company. But this guy, told me the offer will always be there and he will always welcome me. 

This new company is in the same city as my parents. I'm planning to move back to the same city regardless after my dad's surgery. I am hoping talking to the president of my current company will help me. He might be able to open up an office for me in my parents city. But I will not know till I have the conversation. 

Anyone have any advice on what I should do? I'm 24 with a mindset of retiring as early as possible with real estate as passive income.  


TLDR
I live 2 hours away from my parents because of work. 
My dad is in the hospital and is due for open heart surgery in roughly 8 hours. 
He will not be able to work no longer so my parents will need the support from me by me moving back to the same city and living under the same roof.
My dad has been at the hospital for nearly 20 days. 
I missed work during my dad's stay in the hospital. 
I get paid full commission for work and my book of business is not generating the money it does when I am present
I feel like I am not getting the support and help from work that they can provide to other people in the company who generate way more money than me. (I am maybe 3 years away from their level). 
There is another company I can join in my parents city. But I will take a hit on my salary for the first year ($80,000 to $50,000). 
I should be able to increase my salary in the new company to $100,000 to $130,000 in my second year. 
I am on pace to make $100,000 to $130,000 next year at my current company.
I feel I will be more valued at the new company because of the knowledge and experience I will bring. 
My current company I do not have to start fresh but just do my own thing. 
What should I do? 


There are a lot of parameters missing. It's 5 in the morning, please ask any questions that will help with giving me any sort of advice. I did not expect to resort to Reddit for this when I told my work, I did not want to stress about during the week of my dad's surgery but here we are...thank you in advance. ",13Dec2018,1

I was a working student and entirely self-dependent (parents were supportive but just didn't have the means to help) but working and studying full time took a toll on my body so I dropped out in the middle of the semester to rest and then to eventually find work. I though I'd be gone for a year max but almost 5 years later I'm still working. Absolutely zero savings due to medical emergencies and other situations in the past.

I still wish to reapply to the university I absolutely love although it's looking bleak since the limit for readmission is only two years I can try to appeal, or even apply to other schools but our country recently had a change of curriculum (from 10 years of basic education to 12) while I was already out of college. Reapplying means I will need to go back to senior high for two years. Given my age and financial situation I don't think it will be possible. 

Which means I will be stuck working minimum wage or entry level work for the rest of my life. I am not smart or brilliant enough to ""rise up against the odds"" and I  basically have zero chance of being promoted without a degree on the jobs I'm qualified on.

All these years I keep fooling myself that this is only temporary and that I can just waltz back to school once I get my shit together but I have to accept reality.

While this has been fine in the past, I have always been left worrying about the quick-fix nature of their solutions.

We have had issues with water damage in the past, in various parts of the house. Landlords allege that squirrels are to blame for any roof leaks, and claim to have patched up the roof repeatedly.

I went in early on in the semester to schedule an appointment because I was having trouble with panic attacks and anxiety, and the soonest available time was in 6 weeks at, so I took it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I find out 3 weeks later that one of my finals has been reschedule to an earlier date. Didn't think much of it until a week before the exam, when I find out that my first, diagnostic therapy appointment is the hour before my final. I called to try to reschedule, but their next opening would mean not being seen until 4 months after I initially came in.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I kept the appointment and left a little early to make it to my final. Mistake. I failed it and didn't get the full benefits of my appointment since I was distracted and had to leave early. I think it's lame to blame me failing on not getting to review for that time, but I think that being in a different headspace in the hour immediately before the exam would have been helpful. I also think having to wait 6 weeks to be seen could have impacted the quality of my work this quarter.

I'm annoyed at myself for not doing well, but this specific situation wasn't entirely within my control because rescheduling would have been a bummer.

I felt it was kind of weird of him to touch me so frequently like that but I just shrugged it off, assuming it‚Äôs just a western people (or American) thing (I wasn‚Äôt born in the west.) I talked to other girls about this and they all said he touches them on their waist so I decided to ignore it, knowing for sure that he‚Äôs not specifically targeted at me. Now I was taking a week off school due to my mental heath issues and school forced me to go see a psychiatrist, and the first day back to school he opened his arms and hugged me tight and I thought it was nice of him because Ive always felt like I really wanted a hug from anyone, but it didn‚Äôt just stop there and he recently started hugging me from behind and walk with me with his hand wrapped around my shoulder (of course I thought other students/teachers would find this image weird, and probably so did he, he put his hand off my shoulder as other people were walking by) now none of the girls I‚Äôve spoken to said that they were touched by him in a way as intimate as he touches me and I‚Äôm just confused now, is this like a normal thing for westerners or Americans and perhaps I‚Äôm overreacting? Because I know in the West, people exchange hugs and kisses frequently even if they‚Äôre not in a romantic relationship. I‚Äôve been a frequent victim of major sexual abuse since I was 13 because I probably have the appearance of an ‚Äúeasy target‚Äù and I want to know if this is just me acting like an easy target again. 

Also, I‚Äôd like to add that he has a wife and I‚Äôm sure he loves her because I saw his phone‚Äôs lock screen set as a photo of her, and she is also a teacher at the same school. ",13Dec2018,1

271,"I'm 21 and I'm repeating 2nd year, I failed miserably first time around, so I jumped ship and college to study elsewhere.. didn't care much for that (plus it meant longer in college).

&amp;#x200B;

I've paid ‚Ç¨900 so far for this semester, plus close to ‚Ç¨300 on tutoring to pass these exams.  
I owe it to my parents to at least pass these exams - so the money isn't entirely gone to waste even if it's not something I want to continue with.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like college, I never have, I spent first year stupid drunk and extremely unhappy, with people who weren't really my friends.

Now I'm commuting from home, I don't know anyone in my degree, I don't enjoy my degree but I feel pressure to come out with a qualification.

I don't even value the degree, it's a basic business degree that means you have to get into a postgrad for it to be worth anything.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only 3 years, but this semester I've got 3 exams (all repeats), and next semester I'll have 6, maths, stats, finance, economics - all modules I hate (and I have some others)..

I don't even know what I would specialise in..

&amp;#x200B;

Or what I'd do after my degree, I don't want to go work at some accounting firm or online retailer (as we're all pushed to aim for)..

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know..   


I want to drop out, well, I want to pass these exams and then not go back next semester.

I'd probably get a job at some warehouse, or as a security guard.

  
To be frank, I want to play video games, I want to make a living streaming, uploading to youtube and twitch.. Create merch, and at some point I want to get into the world of property, stocks and shares I want to create businesses and grow - obviously that'll all depend on my position in the next number of years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be quite happy working at some basic job and growing my presence online on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it is something I could do while at college but there's a couple of things that are not in my favour:

1 - I need cash to invest in a set up, I have a decent xbox set up but it's just an xbox, I'd realistically need to start putting cash into a PC, and a streaming PC! I've always wanted to build one but I've never had the money (I'm selling a guitar so that'll cover a lot of it)

2 - I commute by a 1.5hr bus journey, so if I have a 9am lecture (lectures are not changeable, you go to the ones prescribed!) I have to get a 6:30am bus - because with traffic that bus journey can take 2.5 hours at times.

3 - My schedule, I'm gone from 9 to 7 at least each day.. and sure a job will have similar restrictions but at least I'll have some cash, I hopefully won't despise what I'm doing and I won't need a job on top of college, so I'll have more time and won't have the cost of college.

4 - I just don't like college, if I liked it I'd stay but I don't like it at all.

&amp;#x200B;

There's an online degree (primarily for people who are working/elsewhere) that's starting next year.. I would need to start into 2nd year of it..

realistically I could drop out after these exams, work and in 3ish years go and complete the degree online if it came to that.

&amp;#x200B;

If streaming/gaming was not to work out the esports industry is still something I want to get involved with, it's going to be a huge industry and one of interest to me.

&amp;#x200B;

'But what about the social life?'

I'm not that bothered.. I'm tired of going out and that's all anyone seems to want to do, it's just one nightclub after another.

Girls - I'm commuting from home, my day consists of buses, lectures and sitting in the library waiting for buses so I can get home, I don't have any friends in college and the friends I have at home are just interested in drinking and going out.

I want new friends, people with similar interests, but I've tried to join societies and clubs - they're genuinely just gathering hubs for people looking for people to go to clubs with, and to put down they're on a committee in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Back up plan? My uncle works as a carpenter he says there's an apprenticeship there if I'm interested, and he makes great money.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like a waste, I mean I've cost a lot of money, I've wasted a lot of time.

But at the same time I'm not happy where I am.",13Dec2018,1
272,I know going here for medical advice rather than a doctor is not the best idea I just want opinions first on how serious this could potentially be.

I‚Äôve got issues with GERD and stress/anxiety so maybe this could be from one of those but recently I‚Äôve been having some bad chest pain.

Before it was just occasionally off and on every once and awhile but since yesterday I‚Äôve had constant pain. I was sick over the weekend and had a couple dizzy spells one while I was driving which was super scary since I was probably 10 seconds away from fainting. I pulled over and waited til it passed but I was scared to drive for a few days after that. I almost passed out at school yesterday and since then I‚Äôve been having dizzy spells again off and on too. I‚Äôm eating 3+ meals a day even if I wasn‚Äôt that hungry when I was sick and I‚Äôm getting decent sleep so I‚Äôm not really sure why this is happening.

274,"(WARNING: Don't read this if you don't want to read something long!)

So recently I've been thinking about breaking it off with my bf but I'm still hesitant to do so. He is in jail rn for probation violations but that is not what is making me think about this. 

He is in his early 20's and still doesn't have a job or place to live yet. He sleeps outside or in his mom's sober home if he can. I would let him sleep at my place but I have roommates that are not fond of guests. He gets his income solely from dealing drugs. Which I DO NOT agree with. But every time I mention getting a ""real"" job, he says he's trying but drug dealing is just very tempting because it makes more money quickly. 

Anyway, my boyfriend has severe anger issues. What I mean by this is that he gets extremely mad over things like; not being able to find something in the store or not being able to find a cigarette to smoke. When I try to stop him from stealing things, when a drug deal he planned on doesn't work out, when I ask him why girls are sending him videos CLEARLY showing their cleavage ( I mean you can see their whole bra), when he can't do drugs, and when I don't want to do drugs with him.

When he gets mad he does things like yell / screams at nothing and random people. He hits / punches things and throws random objects ( he has completely broken his own phone before by throwing it). He has also pushed me before. Not to mention, he does this in public too. When I tell him this makes me feel EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE and UNSAFE. He says, ""Well maybe we shouldn't be together then if you feel unsafe with me"". Not something like; I'm sorry I'll try to work on it or I don't want to make you feel unsafe.

He also frequently does drugs. Things like cocaine, weed, molly, lean, xanax, suboxone(even though I'm not entirely sure if hes ever used heroin I think he just likes the feeling of suboxone). Almost anything he can get his hands on really. He also smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol OFTEN. I am in the process of trying to help him quit all of these things. I ESPECIALLY HATE when he takes Xanax. He gets aggressive when he's high, overly emotional or doesn't care at all.

STORY TIME #1!!!: There was one night my boyfriend had taken Xanax without me knowing ( I told him I won't hang out with him when he's high, but he lies to me and tells me he's not before I meet up with him ). So we were at Starbucks and he looks at me and literally says, ""You need to get the fu** out of here, I'm about to do some fu** sh*t, wait for me in that tunnel over there."" Despite how scared and worried I was I waited in that tunnel for half an hour, at night and alone. He never came and got me so I went to look for him then I saw him walk out of Starbucks with a girl. Then he texted me an hour later telling me to meet up with him. I decided to go home instead. He then texted me telling me that he was gonna ""go fu** his friend and that I'm a hoe because I didn't want to meet up with him"". The next day I told him everything that happened the night before because he said he didn't remember. He said, ""Damn really?!?! I don't remember that, I'm sorry. I must have forgotten that I told you to wait in the tunnel for me. I must have been doing a drug deal with that girl, because I would never ditch you to hang out with another girl."" I mean how am I supposed to feel about that?!?!

Anyway, he tells me all the time he doesn't want to live like this and if he could change it he would. He also says he has a horrible past that has affected how he is today. I notice that he tends to blame others for how he acts. But I feel that everybody has the choice to live a somewhat ""normal"" life and that he's just made horrible decisions that got him where he is today.

Most of the time we spend with each other is spent on him dealing and doing drugs. While only a small amount of the time we spend together is actually doing things a ""normal"" couple would usually do. This is a TOTAL BUMMER for me because I don't care about drugs, I care about our relationship.

STORY TIME #2!!!: There was one day where I had decided to go through his phone because I was getting skeptical of the immodest videos he was receiving. It completely broke my heart. I had found messages during the first half of our relationship to more girls than I can count. With stuff like: hey boo / b / girly / etc. And sending flirty emojis. ( All I could think was how dare he ask me if I'm talking to other guys, when I never have during our entire relationship, and when he's doing the exact thing he doesn't want me to do) When I confronted him about it I couldn't help but cry and when he asked what was wrong I told him. He said that he felt horrible and that he was sorry, he even ended up blocking the girls he was texting. ( And no I didn't tell him to or give him the idea to because that's his choice ) So I decided to stay with him and work things out.

Besides that, he told me that his ex cheated on him while he was in jail so when he got out he beat up her and the guy she cheated with. He said he took ""21 xans"" before he did this and after he blacked out. The next day he said he was in court and saw his ex in a neck brace with broken fingers and bruises. THIS IS ACTUALLY SCARY TO ME. And he didn't even tell me about it until halfway into our relationship. But honestly WHO ON EARTH DOESNT DIE FROM TAKING 21 XANS?!?!?! And how did he remember that exact number when he couldn't even remember that he beat his ex up until he saw her in court? He told me that he felt horrible for it and that he has changed how physical he gets with people.

Now don't get me wrong he does have a list full of problems, and I'm not perfect either but he also has an amazing side to him. And honestly I've been willing to work through things with him because the other side of him is what I fell in love with. You probably think I sound CRAZY but I will fight for the things I love. The other side of him is caring, affectionate, responsible, loyal, fun, calm, unique, honest, lovable and quite frankly just beautiful. It's almost like he's two extremely different people combined into one person. But I have my hope and faith in him that he can change for the better. And yes, I know this won't be an immediate change but I'm willing to work through it. 

I'm just starting to wonder if I'm only thinking with my heart. Is our relationship the actual definition of ""love is blind""? Am I in an abusive relationship? Am I wasting my time fighting for this? 

(Sorry that this is so long but I need advice or opinions from at least somebody) Thanks:)

275,"My dad recently passed away, and although he's dealt with health problems throughout the years, it feels like it all happened way too fast. 

My family is Vietnamese, and according to superstition, it's my fault.

My dad's younger brother passed away a month before my dad did, and I volunteered to support my aunt and my cousin in their time of loss by transporting his ashes from the funeral home to their preferred Buddhist temple, where their daughter is also at rest. 

This upset the rest of my family, because we're staunchly and conservatively Catholic, to the point where it's almost scary, and I was essentially egging on death by getting involved. Even though everyone wanted nothing to do with it, even my aunt who I was helping was super weird about it, because of the bad mojo - I felt it was the right thing, to be there for my uncle's family, because of all the tragedy they've been through.

The day after the transport, I noticed my dad was having serious heart symptoms, so I rushed him to the hospital, and then we lost him after a really hard two weeks. The stress of it also pushed my mom over the edge, and she had to undergo heart valve surgery.

So now, we're apparently past the appropriate cultural period of grieving and my aunt is finally allowing the rest of my family to relocate my uncle and cousin's ashes to a nearby Catholic cemetary - something she initially agreed to, but was always flakey about because of her wariness of my family's ultra conservative religiousness. Also, I guess she's slightly worried about her temple since almost misplaced her daughter's remains, and the rest of my family has pointed out she was baptized, that my uncle was a devout Catholic, and we're footing the costs of internment.

So I'm ready to make arrangements to assist my aunt again, since I have plenty of time off as I'm currently on leave from work to take care of my mom as she recovers. However, because this freaks out my mom and her side of the family, because this'll ""finish her off"" somehow through bad luck, I can't because my mom can't handle anymore stress. On my dad's side of the family, my last remaining uncle has reluctantly agreed to help, because he has ""nothing left to lose"". My aunt is stopped answering her phone. This all reinforces the idea that I'm to blame for my dad's death somehow, because I got involved in my uncle's final arrangements.

I'm still currently dealing with my dad's passing and all of his final affairs, and doing my best to support my mom, making sure she's okay both financially and healthwise while recovering from her surgery. 

Even though it's stupid, I've been beating myself up about my dad - I really miss him, and all the time, I think about all the things I could've done differently, how I could've made sure he was healthier and made him prouder of me and more fulfilled, but ultimately didn't. I think about how mom lost her husband and best friend of over thirty years, and how my little sister won't have someone to walk her down the aisle one day, and I just feel terrible and sick to my stomache, all the time.

277,"First of all, I just want to say that I do intend on bringing this to the attention of the school, as it is completely unacceptable - I'm just not quite sure how.

My younger sister (16 years old) recently confessed to me that her history teacher (who used to be my teacher!) has been making a few comments to the female students in her class, which definitely could be considered flirting. There are also rumors that he has dated a student, although  I have no way of confirming this. However, I do know that my sister wouldn't lie to about things like that, and when she told me that said teacher has indeed directly asked her if she wanted to go out for drinks, I was livid. 

I know what kind of personality this man has, as he used to teach me as well. Although I've never personally seen him make such advances, these allegations don't exactly surprise me because I have known him to be a bit creepy - even just for a laugh.

My sister isn't willing to talk about this to anybody in her school, and to be fair I get why she doesn't want this kind of attention on her. However, I can't let this slide and action needs to be taken. I'm not sure who to contact about this, I have no ways of contacting the principal directly as this is a huge school (over 2200 students) and no contact info of his is available online. I can only contact lower-level advisors in the school, with no guarantee that they'll pass along the info (this school has done shady things in the past). 

Should I still go ahead and get the word out to anybody who's contact information I can get my hands on, or are there any other more effective ways I should handle this?

I just want to shake off this extra irrational guilt, so I can go back to grieving and taking care of what I need to take care of, in peace.

285,"Hey all, so yesterday I was putting some furniture together with my roommate that we got for Christmas and we didn‚Äôt have a Alan wrench. I walked in my complex (bunch of townhouses kinda squeezed together.) I walked down the aisle knocking and a girl hat lives down the street that I have talked to on occasion answered, we have always smiled and exchanged flirty smiles. 

Once she answered she told me to come inside and I can help her look. When I was inside we just formally introduced ourselves and kinda had small talk about work, before I left with the Alan wrench, I asked her if she maybe wanted to get dinner because she looks great and she seems nice, she totally agreed and seemed happy and gave me her number. Once I left a little while later she texted me back and said ‚Äú I hope the Alan wrench helped! :)‚Äù I responded and tried to start small talk and got no response all last night. This morning I sent a simple text just asking if she was free Sunday and have not received a text back. Do I give up? I don‚Äôt want to come off creepy I just feel like if she wanted to say no she had a opportunity whenever I asked but now seems to be ghosting me. She‚Äôs very pretty and we seem to get along well from our past interactions.

So My GF gave me access to her amazon account. Yes i know i shouldn't have and i will face her wrath when i confront her but I had a look at her amazon coin transactions (for moble games) cause she used to have a problem with microtransactions on pc games one year she spent ¬£3000 on it.

So i have a look cause she said shes been spending a lot of time playing mobile games, and that got my suspicion up.

So i check and shes spent over ¬£1100 since july on 2 mobile games. Im really worried that this is turning into a problem for her.

I have no problem with that - we use separate frying pans, I understand the logic that you might reuse the oil on it, the kitchen isn't flooded with other dirty dishes and sometimes I do that too. What irritates me is that the spatula is always on the pan too. So far I've explicitly asked him twice to wash it because I need it and he doesn't take the hint that our common spatula isn't an integral part of his own frying pan and when I want to use it I have to ask him to wash it, wash it on my own or take the second one, which is way worse.

Today I was avoiding him whenever he came to me because, well, I ABSOLUTELY dislike him. I just wanted to be left alone and it's not my fault he couldn't take a fucking signal.

Anyway, he snapped at me and said that I was embarrassing him.

I'm angry. I don't hate people without a reason, I trust that everyone's a good person. But no. This man? Completely different. I absolutely fucking dislike him to the core. Even my mum hates him so much that she isn't even trying to mend her relationship with him. She just keeps quiet about her whole I-hate-my-husband story.

Why doesn't he do some self-reflection? He's my dad, I know, but sometimes I wish I had someone better as a dad.

He wanted me to tell him to his face that I hate him.

You know what? I'd tell him that I absolutely hate him, but now's not the time.

Maybe sometime later, but not now. I'll convey my hatred in a different way. He won't be able to forget it.

So 2 of my long time friends (around 10 years) have organised a holiday between the two of them, and sent out an open invite to everyone we know saying that we should come along for whatever portion of the trip we could. Excited, I was planning on joining them for a short leg of the trip. 

Last week I woke up one morning to find I had been removed from a group message to do with it, so I asked my friends about it in another group chat. They said that there had been a couple of nights out where I had been out of control in the last year, and for that reason they thought I would be 'too unpredictable' to go on their trip. Obviously I was really upset, but they said their minds were made up.

I've travelled on my own a lot and have plenty of experience with solo travelling and looking after myself, I'm very street wise etc. Could my friends just be overreacting because they haven't done anything like it and are worried about what my impact may be?

For reference, on one of the nights out, I ran off from the group and disappeared for the whole night (blacked out), they were obviously very worried about me but I was fine. And another I bit one of my friends on the shoulder as they were trying to force me to take shots, which I was way too drunk to do at the time.

300,"I‚Äôm 21(F) and I started this job at the very beginning of August, and I‚Äôm still in training. It‚Äôs a customer service job but we have to be insanely knowledgeable about so much shit. Maybe that would be okay if I wasn‚Äôt such a mess, but that‚Äôs why I might have to quit. 

The problem is, I‚Äôm being trained on finally getting on the phones lately. I‚Äôve lost sleep over it, I spent a week having to take medication for my stomach because it gets so fucked up it can‚Äôt function without meds when I‚Äôm anxious, I‚Äôve cried multiple times at work and at home, and every time someone mentions the phone it feels like someone holding a gun to my head.

Now look, I got better with making outbound calls, but I don‚Äôt know if I can take 100 calls a day and not off myself. Genuinely. I was suicidal before this and I thought maybe since I am socially stunted to a ridiculous degree, this would help me. And it has, but I don‚Äôt think phones are going to work.

I‚Äôve already gotten called into my boss‚Äôs office with my supervisor present about crying at work. Basically saying it has to stop, like I didn‚Äôt already know that. I hate crying at work I absolutely 100% try not to, I hate looking like a crazy fuck at work all the time but I genuinely cannot help it, and the only reason they found out was because my trainer went and told my supervisor that I was crying. 

I feel like the time that it will take me to get meds (which I‚Äôm working on) and get them situated and working, and the time it‚Äôll take for me to get used to the phones without having breakdowns isn‚Äôt going to be accommodated - which I absolutely understand.

I can‚Äôt decide if I should quit this job - that is the best job I‚Äôm gonna get for a long time - to take care of my mental health and find something I am not so horrible at that doesn‚Äôt fuck with my head (we have high standards here and I have a self esteem in the negatives and perfectionism issues and it‚Äôs not great), or if I should keep having breakdowns at work and take the chance on if they don‚Äôt just kick me out one day and tell me to never come back.

Please can someone give me a (kind) opinion? I genuinely can‚Äôt figure out what to do and this is my first decent job and I do not want to leave because I like it mostly other than this phones shit.

Basically, I [m22] have a friend [f20] who has an emotionally and physically abusive father and I'm not sure how to help her out with it. 

I don't want to go into too much detail but I'll summarise it as best as I can of the recent issues:

Basically she is really into gym and recently injured herself so she can't train, so she is not in the best mind set as it is, but he's basically been telling her that she deserves to be injured and that she's weird for wanting to go to the gym and train with weights and really tearing into her confidence body image among other things. She's been really worried lately that he'll beat her during one of the several fights they've had lately.

Her mother basically enables all of this and doesn't do anything to help her with her situation or improve her home life.

She doesn't have the money to just up and leave since she doesn't work

Do you guys know any good ways I can help her out or give her some decent advice to hopefully improve the situation.

My teacher is a lovely woman (she has helped me get a college place for next year and such) but she has been going through a rough patch at the moment. She is having a divorce and it has been very difficult and the school have not been very easy on her.

The other night she had several glasses of wine over a party at the school. And she was not in a good state. The cops in my area (understandably) are very rigorous and had she got pulled over her teaching career would be finished.

I didn't want this to happen, so I (I don't drink and am teetotal) drove her home instead. I have told her I will not tell anyone about this incident (in a way that would identify her obviously) but in return I want her to get cleaned up and that she should get a good rest over the Christmas holidays.

I have a great job, doing exactly what I want to do. 3 years ago, they remodeled our office into a terrible open workspace. I sat with a group that I got along with, which made it not-so-terrible. It turned out that I got along really well with the guy I shared a workspace with, also married, and we developed a close friendship. Around the holidays last year, I realized that we were getting too close (emotionally, not physically), and pulled back a bit to respect my marriage.

The guy got upset and stopped talking to me completely, which is obviously awkward. I tried to be cordial and he was not responsive. They rearranged the space again and now we sit on our own. In June it got to a breaking point and he was being openly mean. He yelled at me about a project we were both working on and I made an official complaint. He thinks that I was being manipulative by being his friend and now I‚Äôm trying to take his job. It feels like I‚Äôm going through a terrible breakup and having to sit next to the person for 40 hours per week, so obviously my stress level is through the roof.

I have been interviewing but due to the nature of my job it is difficult to find a position quickly. I am the primary breadwinner and have the only benefits, so I can‚Äôt just leave or we will lose our house. I have been a finalist for several jobs after a lengthy interview process only to be told I am overqualified or that I am being considered for another position that will open up in the future.

Then he made a joke about how he makes no money.

I am so resentful of him. I need to leave this job and he is not supporting me emotionally or financially. He has a degree but has the same job we had in college. My hair is falling out due to stress and I am shaky and constantly tense.

326,"Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this on, but I'll fire away anyways. So, a few months ago, I found that I had a new cousin. Her father got around a lot and always went to other states. Here is where things get scary AF. Apparently she was born out of a sex cult. Her father would have sex with many women and then sacrifice the children to Satan. So they literally would farm out babies for sacrifices. Luckily for her, she was sick as a baby, so she wasn't deemed ""pure"". One of the women turned her in to one of their cousins to raise her. Her father made a fake birth certificate for her when she was older with the name of him and the woman. So now she has no ""real"" identity. Honestly, her life starting from birth seems like a fucking mess. Her first cousin took a DNA test with her to confirm the relationship. WTF can we do to fix this?",13Dec2018,1

333,"I'm currently job hunting, but managed to get a job full time but only the last half of November and December. The manager said he couldn't offer me a job afterwards, as they would already be overstaffed the following months, but that the job could give me a foot in at the other stores of the same chain, owned by the same two men(whom I have not met). 

My problem stems from my colleagues. The manager seem to like me, but the 3 other workers dont.. The first few days were fine, they are kind of a joking, sarcastic bunch of people, who didnt talk much aside from handling customers. There is only one girl besides me.

I dont know if its me, or if its the stress of christmas that has gotten into them(its a bookstore), but they don't respond to anything i say unless its a work related question. Sometimes i get a nod or a ""mm"". Its all throughout the day, but an example i remember, because i just got off work, is when i said ""see you tomorrow"", they looked up at me, but back down quickly with no answer. 

This really points to them not liking me and ignoring me on purpose. If this is the case, i dont know if i should say anything, as the job is only temporary. But i'm kind of scared of them speaking badly of me to the manager, when he will probably give me a personal recommendation to the other stores, as he hinted at that. 

BUT maybe there is a small chance this is not the case. As by observing them, they dont really seem to smile at anyone, not even customers. they dont talk with any emotion. They're kind of dead. Which is why i thought maybe they were just stressed and in bad moods. I myself am very bubbly and smiling often.

335,"About two years ago, I came out of grad school with a PhD. Like most people in academia, I had this dream of becoming a teacher, but as you may know the job market is extremely punishing. (Out of scores of application, the only offer I got was for $12k a year, no benefits.)

&amp;#x200B;

I took a different job at my undergrad alma mater - not a teaching job, but a job that would let me use my skills in a different way. When I was hired, the vice president - the head of the office - told me in no uncertain terms that this wouldn't be a gateway to a teaching job. I know this because I wrote it down during the interview (taking notes is a habit). She said, ""If you work here, you work in this office, not in X Department if they want you to teach a night class.""

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward two years. Turns out I don't really want to teach anymore. I like what I do now! Plus with all the politics that go into teaching, it's a minefield I don't want to reenter. But in casual conversation with Coworker Jeff, I learned that Coworker Hank has taken on an adjunct teaching position at the university, in addition to his role in this office. Hank was hired a little over a year ago in an administrative assistant role and reports directly to the VP who told me that I was expressly forbidden from taking any teaching position. Our roles are both 8-5 jobs, but I'm sensing that Hank might have gotten special treatment because of his proximity to the boss.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I right to be furious about this apparent double standard? It seems irrational to me because it's not even an opportunity that I want anymore, but I don't know that I would have felt this way two years ago. But I know that I'm angry, and I don't know why. I feel like a dope for listening to my boss and not trying to break the rules outlined as terms of my hiring, when it seems other people aren't put under the same restrictions. I also feel like I've gotten my first dose of ""loyalty will get you nowhere,"" and I'm wondering if I'm ready to move my skills to another organization.",13Dec2018,1

343,"okay so me and this girl(p) have been friends for about 10 years now. I see her like m sister. there've been time when we've drifted but the love is always there and during hard times I know she finds solace in me. but that's the thing. I feel like that's all i'm good for. this insecurity of mine was bought to the forefront of my mind this weekend, where long story short we ended up chilling with another girl(a) from highschool.


it was my first time seeing P in a while and i noticed massive diferences in the way she treats me and A. For example when she greeted me, it was a quick hug type thing. With A, she ran upto her and greeted her with a lot more excitement. And the rest of the day it A and P were basically in their own world doing there own thing while me and P's boyfriend trailed behind.


It's weird because me and P have been friends for a long time and i've always been loyal to her. A has had times in the past where theyve been really close but they had a fallout and weren't in contact for 4-5 years and rekindled recently. A is not a good person, she lies and can be very sly. P has said to me that she knows this and she doesnt trust her but shes fun to hang around with. It might be worth noting that me and A have completely different personaliities? I can be quite reserved when im not comfortable in a situation whereas A is more bubbly, she kinda has an over the top personality. But that day watching them made me feel like being in highschool again. where i was second best to her and im questioning my own worth. i know P considers me to be a true friend but i feel like she sometimes takes that for granted. 


ANYWAY this post is probably really silly but it was getting to me and it's helped just writing it out. So my question is, after reading this, is do you think I should talk to P? and how should I approach the situation?In the past when i've tried to talk to her about how her behaviour affects me sometimes she's got defensive ( we saw each other after a long time, and she was on her phone a lot of the time.

I have a good job and can work hard and organize when I'm sitting down somewhere looking at a bunch of short term tasks, but I can't plan or handle my life goals at all or even just basic maintenance level and it's all catching up to me.

I'm trying to figure out a way to talk to a therapist with my insurance. To be honest the idea of looking sometime in the eye and admitting the worst aspects about myself terrifies me. Maybe an online therapist.

I just have to get this out. I don't know how to solve this but I can't just keep all this to myself right now without going crazy.

I take home $700 a week after taxes. I'm somehow still always broke. I smoke at least $300 worth of weed a month. At least. I take Adderall just to function at work and when I need to get chores done, and that makes it harder to be mindful and open to positive emotions.

I spend a lot of money each and every weekend without fail on stupid things. And going out to eat. And way too much on girls and weed. I make and plan for budgets all the time but it's so hard sticking to one and everything gets away from me so easily. I have almost no impulse control and I hate that about myself.

My long term patience and discipline is awful. Im not above ignoring huge problems until they bite me in the ass. I'm very lost and really just trying to focus on doing well with my job. I feel like if I try to fix everything else I'm just going to fall apart.

My house is a mess. No clean laundry or dishes and my ex girlfriend left me with this rescue rabbit I'm trying to find a home for but I am probably just taking to a group I know locally. I can't care for it. It's all a big mess and I never feel like doing anything productive when I get home.

I'm not eating right, or sleeping, my rent is due tomorrow and I'm $500 short and my roommate already paid me his portion earlier in the month and I spent it. I have no savings. I don't think I'll be able to afford gifts for anyone this year.

I learned last week that an $1800 medical debt I had to put on a credit card has a judgement against me and I don't even know if my paycheck this week will be garnished or not. I'm thinking about going to paperchecks and cashing them while I figure this out. I'm in TX so they can garnish my bank account, but not my paycheck itself.

I don't have a driver's license. Either anxiety or laziness or something. I dunno

a few days ago decided to be active on the app ""amino"" to see what it was like. a girl messaged me and the conversation was innocent at first eg. ""how are you doing?"" ""what are your favourite shows?"" 

i didn't think this person had any ulterior motives so i replied and said hello. she suggested we move the conversation to google hangouts, i thought it was because it's easier to message there.
when we talked on amino she asked for a selfie, i sent one because maybe she wanted to confirm i was a real person i think?? not sure. she sent one as well, but ""accidentally sent two"", one was apparently of her boobs which i did not see. she deleted it, but asked if i wanted to see. due to social anxiety, i have a hard time outright saying no, so i said nudity makes me feel uncomfortable and that it's fine she doesnt have to send it. 
glad she took this as a no and didnt send the pic.

by this time i was kind of scared and uncomfy, but felt bad blocking her or deleting the app because she seemed rly lonely.
so we continued a convo in hangouts, it was ok for a bit we had a regular convo. she told me she is 15, that's a lot younger than the people im usually friends with (19-24) but i wanted to give her a chance because i know it's hard feeling lonely. i told her many times to please not bring up or send anything nudity related or sexual, but she still did subtlety (asking for selfies and videos, which were just me waving and one of me saying hi) she would say they were cute and that im so pretty. ok thats just a compliment, i thought.

after sending one video she said it was ""sexy"", which made me uncomfy so i tried changing the subject to something else. at one point she asked to play truth or dare, and dared me to show my bra or a pic of me without of bra which i responded with ""i cant"" or ignored the message i dont remember. 
an hour ago or so she messaged me saying i'm the only thing she lives for and if we werent friends she would probably kill herself. this is what made me feel even more locked in because i felt even guiltier if i blocked her, which i have a problem with (feeling guilty about about everything), after growing up in an abusive household.

365,"I‚Äôve always been like a 3/10 in terms of looks because, even though I‚Äôm well groomed and such, I have been very unlucky in the genetic lottery and managed to get an ugly face. Nothing I can do much about, it‚Äôs mostly the structuring and assymetry and such of my facial parts. But outside of that I‚Äôm healthy and in good shape and I very often get compliments for my personality.

I‚Äôve been trying to get a gf for years upon years now but every single time I tried I got rejected because they never found me attractive back. All of them just ended up as friends. But usually I set my standards pretty high, as I normally wouldn‚Äôt even try dating anyone I don‚Äôt find immensively attractive.

Now a girl-friend of mine is trying to hook me up with a friend of hours but I almost immedeately declined and I feel kinda bad/weird about it. She apparently has a great personality (friendly, intelligent and whatnot) according to my friend but she does seem like a nice person. But I didn‚Äôt even want to go on a date because I didn‚Äôt immedeately find her attractive.

Now I‚Äôm thinking, considering I‚Äôve never had a gf and want one, am I just being a picky moron? I feel like I‚Äôll never get a girlfriend this way. So should I just say ‚Äúnevermind could we try anyways‚Äù or what? 

I don‚Äôt find her ugly or anything, but my two main gripes are that she is very small (like 20 cm smaller than me) which would make me feel weird in public I think because it‚Äôd look as if I‚Äôm with my sister/daughter instead of a gf. And I also don‚Äôt like her hairstyle, my only issue with it is that she doesn‚Äôt cut the part that goes over the forehead if that makes any sense.

366,"Apologies for a longer post, but I'll just get right to it. I [18m] just completed high school from Singapore (for those thinking about NS, I do need to as I am an international student). Currently, I am applying for universities in the US.

Now here lies the problem. I personally don't really have a preference for where I want to study. This obviously complicates the process for me as I am really unsure of whether I want to go to a certain University, and hence, if I want to apply there.

My Dad, I think, wants me to study in the US and is trying to persuade me to a bunch of universities. He does say that he will be okay with which ever uni decide. My indecisiveness kinda makes it hard for me to turn down the unis he keeps bringing up.

I think it what happened today really made me start thinking. He brought up a uni and asked, ""so obviously you will go here if you get aid, right?"" I replied that I can't confirm that I will, and he asked me why not. At that point I realised that I really had no good reason, I just am undecided. I think the prospect of not being able to meet my friends (including my crush), is one of the reasons for my indecisiveness. 

So in sum, I think I just need some advice on how and what I should prioritse or consider in making such decisions. Have any of you/ anyone you know been through applying and can share their thought process? I swear it would be really helpful. Thanks a lot! Feel free to ask for clarifications.

Tl;Dr: Need help identifying and prioritizing factors for University applications and choices.",13Dec2018,1
367,"Third time posting this because other subs don't want it, I guess. 

It's late where I am, and I'm using Speech-to-Text, so I'm sorry in advance for any errors or lack of clear explanations. If you want a lazy TDLR, just read the last two paragraphs. Thank you so much in advance. 

I could really use some help. Before I ask for advice, here's some background: originally, I was studying music therapy at my first university. Due to some medical issues, I had to take a semester off and move back home my junior year, and I ended up transferring to a different university close to home so I could continue to recover and attend school while close to family and friends. 

When I transferred, I chose to study recreation therapy at my current university because it basically ran parallel to what I was studying at my first university, plus it was completely online save for some internships. It was a perfect fit for my needs at the time as well as my career goals, so I jumped at the chance to pursue this. 

Let me tell you, I regret ever getting into this major. What I knew when I first got into it is insurmountably different than what I know now. I should have graduated a year ago, but because of the university's incompetent advisors as well as ever-changing requirements for this major, I've been set back at least two semesters. Not to mention I have extra student loans because of it.

I love the work itself, but the career outlook and job prospects are so bleak, I'm worried about my future. Insurance companies don't want to pay for this type of work. They would rather pay a physical therapist or an occupational therapist. 

Everyone in the medical community thinks anyone can do our job, so any recreation therapy positions that become available are taken up by other medical professionals that don't have the credentials to be a certified recreation therapist. 

Speaking of recreation therapy positions, they are few and far in between. I've spoken with plenty of people in the field, and about 80% of them end up in recreation management or activities directors positions doing absolutely nothing related to recreation therapy. I have a friend who graduated from the same exact program about eight months ago, and she's working part time as an activities director in a nursing home. She has yet to receive a job offer for a position that utilizes her degree and her certification. 

The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification is so uptight about its requirements for licensure - moreso than other fields - that it defers potential recreation therapists from pursuing the career. Rec therapists I've spoken with have admitted that they are very tempted to let there certifications expire because not only are they not being used, but they also don't have time to keep up with the demanding CE credits while maintaining a full-time job and family obligations. 

I need over 900 hours of internship experience. *900!* I have looked into other programs, such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical/occupational therapy assistant, and none of them require that many hours! This wouldn't be such a terrible thing if it wasn't for the fact that my school does absolutely nothing to help its students secure internships! 

All they do is send out an extremely outdated list of internship sites. Half of which are not even recreation therapy sites; they're simply physical therapy or occupational therapy sites, which means recreation therapy students have to compete with physical therapy and occupational therapy students for a spot. My school basically says, ""Good luck securing a mandatory-for-graduation internship"" and leaves its students to hunt for the ever-elusive recreation therapy internship. 

I'm not sure if it's my area, but the recreation therapy sites, hospitals, and physical / occupational therapy sites are abhorrently unprofessional. I've contacted over 10 different internship sites at the beginning of the semester (August) to try and secure an internship for next semester (January). I've called and emailed each one at least three times, and I've only had four respond to me: two fell off the face of the Earth after I responded back, one had the courtesy of telling me they weren't hosting interns anymore, and one I actually have an internship with. I'm professional and courteous when I speak to these sites, so I don't think I'm putting them off from responding to me. 

You would think that things will turn around now that I finally have an internship, right? Nope. The sole internship site that responded to me and was actually willing to host me is 45 minutes away from my house if I leave at a decent hour (around 10 AM). If I leave during rush hour - which is something I'll have to do based on their programming - it takes an hour and a half to get there. To accommodate all the driving I'd have to do, I changed my schedule for my job so I work full days Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays, meanwhile I intern full days on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The site absolutely needs me those days, so my schedule is inflexible. I have Sundays off for religious reasons. 

My [very, very bad word] of a boss (whole different story for a different day) warned me that I need to give her at least one weekend day, even if it's a half day. She has let countless other people slip under her radar for this requirement before, but for whatever reason, she's breathing down my neck about it despite being a hard worker. Due to the political climate of my job, and the fact that we're in the slow season right now, I am very afraid I'll lose my job over the fact that I have to accommodate this No Man's Land internship site at the expense of my boss' good side and maybe even my job. This job pays extremely well for an occupation that's getting me through college, and I'd hate to lose it when I only have 4-7 months left of my degree. 

Finally, there's another pain in the booty internship requirement: before I graduate, I have to have a full-time internship that lasts 15 weeks and is no less than 40 hours a week. Completing this requirement will force me to quit my job because my job's hours of operation are not compatible with the typical 9 to 5 hours of an internship site. 

I still live with my parents, and they're sweet enough to help me with my financial needs while I'm in school, but I really don't like being financially dependent on them now that I take care of my own bills. To add to that, I don't feel like quitting a well-paying job for an internship that will contribute to a dead-end degree is worth it. You got to do what you got to do, I understand that; but I feel like it will be a complete waste of time, money, and resources (read: loans) because it's all for a degree that plenty of other people have expressed disappointment in when it comes to career prospects and respect for their position.

After reading all of that, it seems obvious that I should switch my major, right? Well, not exactly. I'm dying to switch majors, but because I'm only two semesters away from graduation, it's almost dangerous to switch majors at this point. My school offers pre-recreation therapy as a major that isn't as demanding with its requirements, but I feel I'll run into the same problems I have now post-graduation. My other option is to switch to recreation management, which will allow me to graduate in two semesters as well. I'm leaning toward this option, although I'm not sure if it would be easier or harder to find a job with this degree. 

Another thing that's holding me back from switching is my parents are expecting me to graduate with a degree in rec therapy. They'll be furious with me if they find out I'm switching my major so close to graduation, regardless of whether or not I'll still graduate on time. It's not like I can keep it a secret from them, either, because they know I'll have to complete internships, and they will undoubtedly ask about them. That's a whole other can of worms. 

Anyway, I'm considering grad school because I have a strong connection with speech therapy, but I still need to obtain a bachelor's degree before applying to graduate school, and again, I don't want to waste time and money on a recreation therapy degree when it's possible there will be little to no return of investment.

Another fear of mine is, what if I decide against grad school? Even worse, what if I don't get in? My bachelor's is my backup plan, so it has to be something useful or else I'll be stuck with my parents forever. I'm open to getting a second bachelor's degree, or shit, maybe even an associate's degree. I'm open to anything so long as the career prospects are good enough and the program is at least somewhat flexible to allow work.

I guess my question is, where do I go from here? Do I get my bachelor's in recreation therapy, or do I switch to one of the other majors I mentioned? If I do stick with recreation therapy and have trouble finding a job, should I obtain a second bachelor's degree or just go to grad school? What do I tell my parents? *Should* I tell my parents?

If you made it through all that, I commend you, and I sincerely thank you for reading. This post was a long time coming on account of how many times both my school and this major have spat in my face despite my earnest efforts. I just want a career helping people through therapy that allows me to be financially stable and actually use the degree for which I went to school. This whole endeavor is making me lose hope in that dream. ",13Dec2018,1
368,"I have thought of writing this too many times, but never knew how. I‚Äôm from a culture where people don‚Äôt really show emotions nor talk about their private lives so already as a kid I understood that no-one will have a glue of what‚Äôs happening inside my family. I had to turn 28 to finally understand that none of this is okay. And for some reason now... so many years later I‚Äôm beginning to reflect and deal with all these messed up memories. 

God, it‚Äôs such a long story, but I will try to wrap it up. I‚Äôm sorry if it‚Äôs a mess :( 

My mom: very manipulative and dramatic  person who is also kind of messed up because of her own tough childhood. Highlights: She used to come to my room when I would be doing my homework and keep telling me how I was born: she had had 4-5 abortions before having me, so I was very ‚Äòlucky‚Äô. Before my birth she tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the hospital window, but my grandpa stopped her. 

Right after my birth she slit her wrists and spent couple of months in a mental hospital. I was looked after by her parents who apparently were the only sane people out of my whole family. Ironically they were also the first ones to pass away. 

Anyway... off to the good start, I was mostly alone with my mother, since my dad wasn‚Äôt around which in return made my mother depressed and alcoholic. She even has offered me to commit suicide with her saying ‚Äòwhat would I do without her anyway‚Äô and throughout the years she would keep telling me that she is not coming home after work anymore and that I will be taken to an orphanage. I would cry my eyes out every day waiting for her to come home after work. She would always be 3-4 hours late.

After years passed I learned that she enjoys manipulating me(some sort of sociopathic tendencies) so I slowly started to not care anymore. This made her angry as fuck, so I would constantly hear things like ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even care about me, you cunt! You are not my daughter!‚Äù I was 8. Next minute she would act fine and offer me a piece of cake. Same pattern would repeat every day. 

Things got a bit better when my stepdad came around and my mom couldn‚Äôt show her true colors. Yet. My stepdad is a really nice guy, too nice. You know this 40-y ole virgin type of nice guy that just wants a family. I remember one Christmas eve when most guest had left and my stepdad was already asleep next to the livingroom. My mom was drunk and told my stepdad‚Äôs best friend that she doesn‚Äôt love my stepdad. The friend kept saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre drunk, you don‚Äôt mean that‚Äù, but my mom kept repeating it. My stepdad‚Äôs best friend keeps away since then.

Anyway I left when I turned 18, I let her know 3 days before and she said she doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. The day after me moving out: massive drama about me ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù. 

My dad: didn‚Äôt believe that I was his child until I started looking like him a bit. He would party a LOT and introduce me to all of his girlfriends while he was married to my mother. Didn‚Äôt want me to tell my mom and when my mom had still managed to get the information out of me, my dad would punish or hit me. They finally divorced.  My dad truly believes that women are meant for cooking, cleaning and fucking. Like. Truly.

When I turned 13, he went to prison for murder(bar fight), got out after 4 years. He never paid any child support saying that my mom will spend it on alcohol anyway and when I would go visit him for a weekend, he would just take me to his parents place outside of the city and that was it. 

He was partying until I was 13y old. He even once took me to one of these parties that lasted for 3-4 days. Everyone constantly wasted and driving from one place to another. I never knew where I was or who were the people around me. 

Fast forward to today: I moved far away from both of them, but since they are getting old, they want to keep in touch and it honestly kills me inside. I don‚Äôt think they are good people. They are just that... stupid that it makes them evil.

My dad would invite me and my boyfriend over and all of the visits have been horrible. Mostly it‚Äôs sitting in front of TV and watching my dad drink 10 bottles of beer and rant about WWII or something else he knows nothing about. When he asks about my life, he interrupts me in the middle of the sentence to say or ask something completely irrelevant showing that he‚Äôa not listening at all. Last time he had been partying the night before, slept in and failed to pick us up, was massively hungover, had lost his phone and two of his friends were sleeping on the kitchen‚Äôs floor. We tried having a nice breakfast in the livingroom and one of his friends decided to come and snore right next to my boyfriend. 

My dad said sorry and come again.

When visiting my mom she usually just goes and watches TV because her favourite show is on. Then she would complain that I never visit and I am ungrateful. At the same time she prepares a really nice dinner and keeps saying how happy she is to see me. 

Honestly there are a lot of things to add to the story, but I think you get it. 

I was triggered because mom just asked me to lend her 1000‚Ç¨, because she needs to have a stomach operation. Knowing my mother:
1. She will never pay it back as she has never paid any of my loans back. Last time she asked me to lend her 100‚Ç¨ so she can buy a ‚Äòcat of her dreams before she dies‚Äô. The cat was 500‚Ç¨ and very expensive to take care of.
2. I am pretty sure that even if there is an operation, it‚Äôs not 1000‚Ç¨ (we have mostly free healthcare) 
3. She thinks my boyfriend is rich and therefore I have to support her.

I told her that we don‚Äôt have such money atm, she stopped talking to me. 

Final thoughts: I have a good life and I am done blaming my parents. I think because they are such fuckups I turned out a better person and I‚Äôm good at taking care of myself without any help. But the only thing that keeps getting me super stressed is when my parents reach out. I mean I keep my phone on airplane mode so my drunk dad can‚Äôt call me on weekend nights. 

But I still feel so fucking guilty, there is this stupid need to please your parents. They have done 90% horrible shit and 10% of nice things and I still feel like I owe them something for these 10%

I would appreciate some feedback from people who have been in similar positions and please don‚Äôt tell me to confront them, they will just brush it off and continue the same shit. 

Thanks!

380,"On Monday a woman totaled my vehicle while I was bringing my kids to school. Physically we are fine. Mentally, I keep hearing my children screaming every time I am not distracted and my children beg for mommy not to drive our other vehicle and basically are terrified to ride with me. The accident was not my fault. 

The vehicle I had was a 'beater', but it was a beater that took me six months of greasy fast food work to afford. I had the lowest coverage insurance on it. Mini tort is out as our out of pocket costs have already passed 500$ and dragging this out more will only leave us more negative than before. 

We are on the hook for the towing. The holding fee. The police report. The two car seats that have to be replaced. We are out a working vehicle, the portable DVD player that was in the car along with a handful of other electronics that were pulverized in the crash. 

I have spoken to both insurance companies. The police. The towing company, the body shop where my car is being held until we pay the fees, and the junkyard who will give us a measly 200$ for my vehicle. I have spoken to a personal injury lawyer and a lawyer that specializes in car accidents. 

We live in Michigan. There is no recourse. We are legally obligated to shell out all this money because some lady hit us. We have no recourse for going after her even to replace the car seats. 

I have all her information. I want to write her a letter. I want to send her pictures of my children. I want to let her know that I now have to walk everywhere with my children in Michigan during the winter. I want to tell her how long it took me to save up for this vehicle everyone says was a piece of crap, like that makes it better that the woman only hit a 'beater' car. I want to let her know that we used our Christmas fund to take care of this. (Please do not offer to help with xmas. Even if my kids get nothing, they do have every little single thing they need and most things they want. We will be fine, there are other kids who have nothing already and will get nothing this year. Find those kids, please. We need a vehicle, and I'm the only one who can make that happen. But thank you to anyone who offers this to strangers online, you people are truly angels.)

I just really want this woman to know what she did. It seems like shes getting off with a ticket and insurance will fix her vehicle, and her life goes on. I know I'm being absolutely juvenile, *but how is that right?!* She was at fault and ticketed but under Michigan law she doesnt have to replace a single thing of mine or my kids that she destroyed. I feel like I'm being punished for having someone HURT ME. Me and the kids spent the whole day in the hospital. (My car insurance covers that.) I just... I'm so angry. I want her to know how bad she hurt us. Nothing more. I'm not asking she do anything. Just that she knows what she did. 

I'm leaving out a lot but the officer at the scene knew her and labeled her as a 'spacey' person. And me and my kids have to pay the price, literally. 

Can I get into trouble if I send her one single letter? That's not harrassment. I'm not going to call her names. I just want to list how me and my children feel, how our belongings are destroyed and it has cut into any money we had for Christmas.

381,"Hello :)

I'll start this off with a bit of backstory. I'm 15, and I've been ""homeschooled"" for almost a year now. The reason I left school was because my social anxiety worsened, my attendance dropped down to 50%, and I was getting no help for it.
I do believe that leaving school was the best choice for me, and I've been less stressed in a lot of ways since leaving. However, new problems have popped up.
One thing my parents don't know is that I haven't been studying. I studied for about 4 months after leaving and then I just stopped. Stupid, I know.
It's not that I don't want to study! I know that not keeping up is fucking up my life. I just don't care.
I don't care enough about myself or my future to look after it.
At the same time, I'm dealing with some other problems on the side (an eating disorder thats been going on for about 2 years now, social anxiety still, generally feeling shitty constantly) and I know that I need help for them. I just really don't care about myself enough to get help. I just figured that one day I'd kill myself and wouldn't have to worry about any of it.

Sometimes entire days will pass before I even think about studying. I just forget. I don't want to forget, I just do. I leave the house about once every 3 months, if that, so time passes incredibly fast in here. I know the obvious answer to this is to go out more. The thought of going outside and seeing people makes me feel sick from anxiety. I struggle even going out into my garden because I feel like I'm being watched. I feel like someones watching me even when I'm alone at home, too.

However, now that I'm 15, my GCSEs are approaching. I want to start studying, and getting help, just so I don't completely disappoint my parents. The thing is, when I look at how much I need to catch up on I feel completely overwhelmed and confused as to where to start. 

I feel scared and helpless.  I would really appreciate some advice. Thank you.

It‚Äôs odd, ever since school ended and I feel somewhat lost not having a billion things to do and sometimes I get a little stir crazy. It‚Äôs winter so that takes away from things I can be doing. I am trying to keep myself busy and prevent myself from getting depressed. Is there anything anyone does that they find to be an inexpensive, relaxing activity? Thanks!",13Dec2018,1

385,"So I'm 28, sober and really happy with where I'm at right now. But, from the age of 17 through 26 I abused all kinds of drugs, lived a crazy lifestyle and got into (minor) trouble with the police etc. 

In 2017 I met a girl who showed me I was better than that, a clean living girl who had loads of faith in me. Since then have did everything in my power to change my ways. I moved to a new area, cut off all my old ties, got on top of my mental health, got on top of my finances and am doing really well and I'm really proud of these achievements. At this time I did alot of these things 'for her', I mean, I wanted to elevate myself, but for the wrong reasons. She knew my whole past, because I told her (something that came back to bite me, but I am a very truthful person and hate telling lies). 

So we broke up later down the line, which is what it is, but when that happened I got quite depressed and went back to my old life for a few weeks (remember before her, this is all I knew) and in turn lost my driving license for DUI after driving home from a party. 

I worked through this and I'm better than I have ever been in all aspects of my life, because now iv done all these things for myself, not someone else. I feel like I have been given a second chance at life. My problem being, I am now talking to other girls who I really think I want to get to know better, but I don't know how, or when, or in what depth should I share my past with her without scaring her away? There is no risk of me going back to my old life, but I feel it paints such a bad picture of me. One that I would happily forget forever and one that has no bearing in who I am today. Help!

386,"Hey guys, 

Need some advice on my current situation. I graduated in December 2017 so I‚Äôve been in the workforce for about a year now. I‚Äôve had two jobs where I worked about 2 to 3 months for each and I‚Äôve gotten let go of both during the 90 probationary period. 

I think this has mostly to do with my anxiety. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about the future and I always have negative thoughts about what I‚Äôm going to do next. This affects my daily activities and routines and I get severely depressed. The two jobs I‚Äôve had were working offshore, where you can‚Äôt get depressed and you need to be able to push through those tough times.

I can successfully say that I think I‚Äôve gotten to a point where I can manage my anxiety now Due to taking medication and seeing a therapist.

I do not get crazy anxious anymore however I am worried about my current situation. My resume is suffering as for last year I‚Äôve had two jobs off shore that both lasted about two months. 

Should I take both of those jobs off of my resume and just say I took a year off to travel or something or will this severely affect my ability to get a decent job if I leave them on my resume.

Will I be able to get a good job again or have I dug my own metaphorical grave?",13Dec2018,1

Before our Intercourse, we put a lot of time for foreplay, we enjoy it both so much, i love it also caring for every inch in her body, then fingering ( i know her spots) and she enjoys this two, and can get multiple Orgasms, as I think,

the problem is with my Penis actually, the head is very sensitive, it get's to ejaculate the moment i enter, if i control it so i ejaculate shortly after , less than 20 seconds i think, the erection stays after that, but not for too long too.. at first i was cautious with condoms, then we made it without condoms but in her safe days..

 my gf never mentioned that she has a problem with anything, i just wanna make her , us actually,  enjoy more, so what do you think guys ? is that a problem ?

389," Hello reddit. Need some help, I work for a large printing company and recently I‚Äôm starting to feel fed up with some of the conditions I‚Äôve been forced to deal with. Am I  being too easy or too harsh on my employers ??!

On every machine they‚Äôre is 2 entry level employees (except mine)  they say they‚Äôre is no need for two on this machine because the way the product is delivered From the front to the end of the line  but they only put young smaller fast pace individuals in this position. They‚Äôre is no break system so if i want to get some water use the bathroom I have to wait until someone can cover my position and if thing are running bad My breaks are not  a priority. I‚Äôve skipped meals for the sake of production. I find myself actually running around my work area just to keep things running smooth because of the wear and tare on my machine and with new policies added to my packing requirements everyday My job is becoming increasingly harder At what point does a one person job become too much/ unsafe for one person alone ?? A scary thought I seem to keep having is what if I slip and fall and hit my head who‚Äôs going to know if nobody comes out of the control room?? 

With the lack of breaks, increasing work load, wear and tear on my machine causing me to to do questionable things for the sake of production  do I have a position to speak on this to someone outside of my job or am I just whining?? ",13Dec2018,1

391,"I have heard a lot of information about the placebo effect and I am beginning to think it would be very beneficial to my wife with her anxiety and depression. Before I dive too far into it I want to be clear that she was diagnosed with both through a therapist (does not see anymore). She has a very hard time opening up to me about things that bother her and when she is feeling either of these things. I know anti depressants are an option although I personally believe that they are more hurtful then good. I believe they mess with the homeostasis of the body and produce serotonin in the brain and cause the brain to drop the natural production of serotonin. Also with taking any sort of medication along those lines is a backlash worse then the initial problem (if you have a stuffed nose and take nasal spray it clears the nostrils although when it runs out typically you have an even worse problem then initially). The question I have would using sugar pills and telling her they are anti depressants potentially work by tricking her brain into producing more serotonin? Also it would not be forced upon her more of a suggestion, also would it be unethical of me to try a placebo effect on her? I want the best for my wife and her to be truly happy and I am trying to think of any way possible.",13Dec2018,1

399,"Alright so for context Battlefield is one of my top favorite game franchises of all time I have loved it since BF3 and even after BF1 (wasnt a huge fan) was still super excited for BFV now my problem. I dont have a huge budget for games, I choose to spend the little money I have elsewhere for the most part. But this was a definite yes for me. So however long its been since launch I finally purchased the game two weeks ago (the deluxe edition even, I know its a waste of money but like I said I love battlefield). And I installed it, during installation I found out you could play the story after it had downloaded 29% I was super excited! I could get a little taste of the game ahead and play through a fairly good story. Now the game finished downloading overnight and after I got home from work that day I jumped on my PC to play when I launched the game an error came up something along the lines about not having access to the online servers, and I tried every fix I could think of before googling it apparently it was a problem with Direct X12 so I turned it off. That didnt fix the issue, so after weeks of trying different things uninstalling reinstalling etc. etc. I finally reached out to EA support. They informed I had been banned for breaking the terms and conditions of the game. They said after thoroughly investigating my account the ban had been proper and that the matter was settled I of course submitted another ticket (as they would not let me respond to the email) requesting a double check I had never gotten to play the multiplayer how could I have possibly broken the rules. At this point I am very frustrated, I have wasted my lunch break typing up this rant, and EA has spoken saying that I deserve the ban and even linking me the terms and conditions several times, Which I read and still havent even had the ability to break.

I recently graduated high school &amp; she's a year younger. So after my grad we lost connection a bit (thankfully).

She just texted me about 4 times asking if I'm coming to their hang out this weekend. She texts in a way like I already knew about it.. whatever. I feel guilty since she's being mostly polite w the words she uses (besides the fact she's txted me 4x). 

Her and her group of friends also put me in a group chat, that I'm not included in w convos at all. Its irrelevant and it's one of those chats when there's no ""leave conversation"" option. It's mainly just two people talking back &amp; forth. Might as well not be a group chat.

Things turned bad there and myself and a few of my closest friends left that community and formed our own. That also fell apart after a few months because of drama and arguments, and some people just deciding to leave. After that I ended up in a different discord server with a lot of new people who I don't feel particularly close to, with a fair bit of toxicity and people I don't get along with at all. I felt like being there was doing me more harm than good so I left, but now I'm regretting it. I feel like I'd rather be around people who make me miserable than be completely alone. 

I do have a boyfriend who I'm very happy with but it's a long distance relationship (UK - Canada) and I don't get to see him in person very often. I feel extremely lonely when I'm not with him and it doesn't help that the timezone difference means I'm either unable to talk to him for most of the day or I have to stay up really late which makes me feel even more lonely because I can't even talk to my family as much.

I just have absolutely no idea how to go about making friends. The only friends I've ever had I ended up finding by random chance. I can't work at the moment due to health reasons, I'm currently studying at an online university which doesn't give me as many opportunities for socialisation as a regular university would, I don't really have many interests or hobbies. I'm into gaming and music but my tastes are a little weird and I feel self conscious talking about things I like. I'm teaching myself programming but I'm not good enough to really have conversations with other people about it.

I'm just at a complete loss and don't want to have to go back to somewhere that makes me unhappy just because I get so desperately lonely otherwise.",13Dec2018,1
420,"Made craiglist add for skis with accessories, I get message from a dude in Texas who says he will give me $20 extra to hold the skis because he is going to send me a check. Then he says the check will be over 270, somewhere around 1000 because he has another item he has to pick up. 

He tells me I can wait until I have the cash in my hands from the bank after the check clears, whether it be 24 hours later or immediately.

421,"I left a job, at the end of June, after being there for over 11 years, due to stress. My boss was, literally, making my job harder than it needed to be and I was living to work. 

I was able to network thru my husband and land a cushy job for more money, better benefits, and an overall better work environment. This new job offers flex hours and will allow me to go back to college to obtain my Associates degree. This degree is not needed for my line of work but it has always been a 'bucket list' item. Plus, I dont want my daughter to ever have ammo against me when I request that she should go to college.

So, today, i had an interview with a company for a very lucrative position in a my actual field of work (not what I'm doing now). I'm more than qualified and they want to hire me, like, yesterday. Oh, and they're offering me 15k more per year with stock options.

My delima: my husband is a very respected individual in his field and I used his good name to  get a job. I've only been at my current company for 5 months and I dont want to burn any bridges. With the new job I will have to give up on my dream of obtaining my degree.

422,"A bit conflicted.. Before we made it official, we said it's okay to see others.. (this was first week of May). By end of that month, she kept saying that our agreement was pointless because she's only seeing me and not interested in anyone else. By June we booked a trip together and we really became a couple emotionally (not official yet). Now this is where I got so confused, weekends of June, she said she's home but really it wasn't her house. Also, everytime she was at the guy's house they would drop her off closer to her work. I brushed it off that time because of our initial agreement. Last week of June she acted really strange, then she blocked me on social media. She said she was hurt that I went out on a provincial park with a high school friend (girl) in May (before the agreement) and thought I was still hanging out with her until June. So we discussed that and and got over it. I thought she blocked me because she chose the other guy and did not want me to see. Fast forward to July we started officially dating. We really hit it off as a couple and had a great vacation together. Everything was perfect! then 5 months later I felt the same betrayal.

The reason why this past situation came up is that how she acted those weekends is the way she acted last weekend. Same sequential things (acted distant and dodgy, told me she was home, lots of different excuse, someone dropped her off closer to work, and she blocked me on facebook on her birthday because she didnt want let people know she was turning 27 - I was going to post a cute and funny message but that happened)

We recently talked about it and she admitted that she lied to me all those times and that she was setup by her bestfriend with the guy and she didnt like him at all. She stayed over on weekends and after parties for a month and she claims that she was always with her bestfriend and 2 other dudes. Knowing this, I was a bit suspicious and hurt. So I asked why would she hide it and why would she want to agree if she said she only wanted me? She got pissed and said no matter she said I wont buy it but I only wanted clarification why she did it in the first place.

Anyways, I wanted to see what everyone's thoughts are.. Am I wrong to get upset that she lied to me constantly for a month but we had an agreement? I feel like my trust is now gone but I want to get it back or is that too foolish and wasted time?

TL;DR - Prior to dating, had an agreement to see others, a few weeks after confesses ""exclusivity"" about her feelings to me. After 5 months of officially dating, admitted that she was hanging out with someone and sleeping over at their place. Her reasoning doesnt add up and I feel betrayed.

423,"To say the least, as an employee in fast food, I improved significantly in working faster and learning everything quickly. My biggest issue was for some reason dealing with managers. I always felt that they mocked me or tried to micromanage me. I only liked 2 managers genuinely, one because of their down to earth attitude, and the other for their sense of efficiency and how they viewed competition as a good thing. The other managers I knew had anger issues and would be physical hitting things when angry. This in turn has made me feel like this job has no way of me moving up as I've worked for 4 months now.

Now I am offered a management position at another place and is starting training in January. Thing is, while I am confident that I can learn it, I notice as an employee I was constantly told I was slow. It was my first job, so those impression stuck with them.

428,"Hey everyone, 

Just looking for a bit of advice. 

So I spotted a gas leak at one of our venues on Monday (work within a therapy service as admin) and told my manager immediately. She got someone out the next afternoon and they advised that the it was a leak and they'll try and fix it as soon as. 

Now they have shut the gas off on the road, and due to this a couple of our neighbours and us have no gas. This is especially bad for us as we have no heating due to having a convey boiler (the central heating runs off the gas). So it is now freezing cold within our venue and our manager bought stupid little oil heaters which do absolutely nothing. 

So today I turn up and I've got a good four layers on, hat and scarf, and my colleagues have as well. The practitioners are seeing their first clients in and the gas men turn up and get to work. I email my manager and advise that it is really cold and she calls and states to ""get a cup of tea, put a heater on, and you should be fine"". Great. 

The gas men are doing the best they can and they are having to turn the gas on and off to see if they have fixed it (which they haven't) and this is making an awful gas smell throughout the whole building and making us nauseous. I again, call my manager and my colleagues are emailing to advise that the smell and weather is not good at the moment (went down to 0 degrees last night and was 11 degrees in the office on the thermometer) and that it is not suitable. The managers and my manager did not listen. 

The gas men then open the front door to run pipes through etc., in which the admin/hot desk office is in, with me and my already ill colleague and we decided that we could not do it anymore. So we call and advise that it is not suitable for us nor the clients entering and having their sessions in the building. Eventually after 3 hours they agreed that it is not suitable. We managed to cancel 10:30am clients and rearrange their appointments to telephone, however had to stay at the venue until 11:30am due to other complications. 

My colleague and I had gotten the brunt of the coldness and gas and we very angry. 

We went to our main venue in which they had decided that we were to work from. I advised that I was not feeling well nor was my colleague who was with me and that the gas had gotten to us. **Also the apparently the gas men said it was not dangerous, however to get air when possible**. One of my colleagues gave me a hug and advsied that I really smell of gas, wonderful!  I was quite angry with my manager and advised that I could not speak to her (as she wanted to) at the moment however she insisted. There was many people in the main venue today and I got very upset and cried and I advised it was not fair the conditions we were put in and that it should have been decided when the gas leak occurred that the venue closed and appointments rearranged or located at another venue, until it was finished. The work they was doing was loud, it smelt, it was cold, not suitable for us or clients at all. 

She only advised she was sorry and that they have done all that they can. She then advised for me to go home and get warm ( because I was still suffering from the cold at the other venue). It took me ages to warm up at home, and I couldn't feel anything but numbness. 

I have wrote an email to HR to explain the conditions we were put it, how the clients and employees health and safety was at risk today and ask for a contingency plan implemented to stop this from happening again and for the management to apologise for putting their employees through these conditions. Also to ask for a risk assessment be done at our main venue and that one to see how safe it really is (our main venue is unfortunately worse). Have I over-stepped? Will this go against me? My mum seems to think it will and I am scared now that I have sent the email that I shouldn't have done. Will I lose my job? I don't want this to go against me, I just wanted someone to hear about how bad our conditions were. I am so worried now, all I wanted was someone to hear me out. 

Thanks for reading and for any advice given. 

TDLR; Working conditions were very bad at our workplace due to a gas leak. We were in 11 degree weather, door open, no heating, and very bad smell of gas - in which both clients and employees had to suffer through until our complaining made them see how bad it was and let us leave to other building. I have sent an email to HR to advise how bad the conditions were and asking to put a plan in place to stop it happening again, but now I'm thinking it shall go against me. Have I done the right thing? Should I have left it?

But out of all these things she does, she doesn't really enjoy them and she also states that she is not depressed. A big reason for her is working till she gets old and grumpy.

I get what she means by not depressed, like overall just sad. I'm really just sad and it also hurts me, because I thought she would've been a happy person. I'm not really worried about her in terms of suicide, but more worried about her mental state and how it isn't really nice to be just sad, like without a reason.

How can I help her? I don't really know what to do, when we're meeting I always feel how she's not really happy, just pretending to be.

446,"I recently got married and my husband is very well off ($70 mil).
We've been dating for 2 years, engaged for 1 and got married 4 months ago. His money is inheritance because unfortunately his father passed away shortly after our wedding, up until that point he was a COO of his fathers company living off of his paycheck which was amazing (55K monthly) but this amount of money is on another level (for me). He's the CEO now. 

I come from an upper middle class family,two parents and three kids, we all went to private schools and got cars for our 16th birthday but we certainly didn't have the Richie Rich childhood my husband had. My parents got everything they have through hard work, they both come from poor families and have always supported their relatives who unlike them,never pursued higher education and were comfortable working low wage jobs and being on food stamps. 
They're the type of aunts,uncles and cousins who only call for money and don't pick up the phone when we call them with job offers or to ask how everyone is doing. That was one of many reasons why they weren't invited to the wedding, other one being that it was a smaller wedding of 50 people closest to us. They weren't upset until they found out that my husband and I didn't sign a prenup, thanks to my rambling sister. 

They've spent every day since calling, showing at our gate at random hours, coming to my husbands company and staying at the lobby until escorted out by security and one of my uncles threatened to go on a hunger strike if we don't give them money. They each want 100K which would be a total of $2.3 million. My late father in law was a well known and respected businessman with an impeccable reputation and they've threatened to take this to the press and lie about all sorts of things to get what they want. We could legally disprove whatever they say, but we don't want the unnecessary attention. We appreciate our privacy very much! 

We don't want to give them the money that will go towards parties,drinking and buying jacuzzis. They've been offered jobs multiple times but always refuse. 
We also don't want to put them in jail because it would further complicate everything and at the end of the day, my parents care for their families, it's hard for them to accept the way things are. 
If taking legal action becomes unnecessary, how do we proceed to tell them without jeopardizing anyone? We already have top notch lawyers but they're very insensitive to the subject.

I am 19 now and am finally realizing how much this shit has really negatively impacted my life and over the last two months I have been going to the gym and have lost around 20 pounds (was 285 to begin w and am now 259, yay!).

  Anyways now that you have some background, on to the issue. Lately she will not do any physical activities WHATSOEVER. Totally sedentary lifestyle and jokes about not doing exercise but then actually just doesnt do it. She eats constantly and when I say she has gained weight, its a lot. We took a trip to the beach this summer before school started back up and she had stretch marks from such rapid weight gain. I am just really concerned she is gonna fuck her life up like I did and regret not maintaining herself. I am not going to be a dick and say anything behind my moms back obviously but I am just concerned. What do you guys think I should do?

453,"I know it‚Äôs bad to do that, but I felt insecure in the relationship and paranoid he‚Äôd cheat on me for reasons I‚Äôm not gonna bother typing out atm. 

Anyway, I was using his phone to text a friend of his that I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in a while (he let me). My bf went to shower and while I was texting that friend, I thought, ‚Äúhmmm, lemme see who else he‚Äôs texting‚Äù. I was scrolling through his texts, there wasn‚Äôt much, and found a female name I didn‚Äôt recognize from two months ago. As I read their short conversation it appears as though they‚Äôre coworkers. They were talking like they‚Äôre best buds. It seemed like she was asking him to extend his shift til 7 (couldn‚Äôt fully understand the context) and he said that‚Äôd be better for him. Then he asked if she wanted to grab dinner afterward, and she asked where, and he said ‚Äúlol making the man decide, huh?‚Äù I cant remember what else was said but he cancelled on her and there were no subsequent texts between them. 

It strikes me as odd because he always tells me what his plans are and with who (on his own volition). A few times he drove a female friend home and he told me, I didn‚Äôt mind. But I never heard of this woman before. It‚Äôs got my mind reeling, and now I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúif these are his texts, what could possibly be lurking his Instagram DMs or Facebook PMs?‚Äù 

I‚Äôve always been too afraid to snoop, because for one, I don‚Äôt like the idea of invading someone‚Äôs privacy and two, I‚Äôm afraid of what I might find, something that‚Äôll confirm my suspicions. He does seem really committed to me, but you never know. Am I just being insecure? Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

455,"So I‚Äôm living with four other guys from my fraternity, we‚Äôre all friends, get along great, but they‚Äôre in the same pledge class so they‚Äôre just a bit closer. This is relevant a bit later. We‚Äôre college guys so of course we‚Äôre going to be messy, the kitchen gets trashed on the weekends so we end up cleaning. Four of us, myself included, all clean up when we see stuff out, dishes, loading/unloading dishwasher, trash, really basic stuff. The last guy though does nothing but play Fortnite, all day, every day, to the point where it‚Äôs 2am and I can still hear his call outs through my wall.

I really don‚Äôt care what he does in his free time, but he never does chores, we‚Äôve taken his xbox once and forced him to do chores, but after that the other three guys gave up. I‚Äôve found up to ten of our cups on his desk, so his excuse of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt cook so I don‚Äôt have to do dishes.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt fly, but two of the other guys want change but are apathetic towards it, while the other defends him saying ‚ÄúMoreThanFour, you‚Äôre just as messy.‚Äù Referring to a dish or two left out after cooking, something everyone is guilty of.

456,"To clarify, my friend (called Owen from now on) is NOT a diagnosed schizophrenic. I live in the UK

Owen has a number of recurring symptoms which (from the result of my quick Google search) seem to only appear in schizophrenia:

- he‚Äôs been having auditory hallucinations on and off for at least 2 years

- he‚Äôs recently started having visual hallucinations (for about a month as far as I know)

- he has recently socially withdrawn when he used to be extremely extroverted

- he is apprehensive of certain people, namely (and annoyingly) his parents and doctors

I‚Äôm not going to ask for medical advice here (it‚Äôs against the rules) but you can see why I think this is the case.

Obviously these can be extremely dangerous especially if untreated, and I want Owen to see a doctor before he withdraws even more. He agrees that he should tell his parents or see one alone, but ‚Äòturns off‚Äô every time I mention it - just saying ‚Äòok‚Äô or ‚Äòye‚Äô. I should mention I don‚Äôt talk to Owen at all in school; only ever through messaging. 

Only me and Owen‚Äôs girlfriend (called Evie from now on) know this is happening now, because he told me and I persuaded him to tell her. Evie and I have spoken a little about it, but we have no idea what we can do to help.

What do I do? I don‚Äôt want to intervene and risk hurting him, I‚Äôd much rather persuade him to do it himself. I don‚Äôt know how to help. Thank you in advance for your support.

457," Isolation, and shunning society used to seem like a favorable way of life, because it felt like a healthier alternative than contributing to a social system I didn't wholeheartedly believe in. The world is complex and full of contradictions, and I felt like my *inner* world was the only stable thing I had any degree of control over, so if I could successfully build my reality within it, there would be no need for anything external beyond the basics like food and shelter.

As stable as my reality feels, I'm now realizing that I need to ground myself in a *collective* reality if I want to avoid falling deeper and deeper into depression, and eventually madness.

Much as I hate to admit it (because it brings my isolated existence into question), I'm still a social creature at heart.

I'm in great need of a new value system, but there doesn't seem to be anything unquestionable and stable that involves others and sets me on a clear path for the future.",13Dec2018,1
458,"I was always very bright and very anxious, and when I got older school became a major point of stress for me.

There are other ways to make money and not being a student is not the same as not educating myself.

I need to find a way to redevelop my sense of happiness and self worth, to really claim my decision not to continue with college at this time in favor of improving my mental health. 

So my question is, for those of you who were ‚Äúdestined‚Äù to go far in higher education but then chose not to, how did it go? Are you okay? What changes have you made to maintain a positive perception of yourself? What do you do for work? What ways do you educate yourself?

I have a friend who I‚Äôve been friends with since freshman year and now when it comes to sitting next to him I get nervous and I really, really don‚Äôt want him to sit next to me. He usually does, though, since there‚Äôs so many kids he ends up being one of the last ones, which means that my space alone in the single-seater all the way in the back will be taken up with him.

He likes to hold my hand a lot and hug me, and in freshman year I usually let him because he was my friend and I didn‚Äôt find anything wrong or weird about it. About a third of the way into the year he put his arm around me and grabbed my boob which was completely out of the blue and I swatted his hand away and I didn‚Äôt talk to him for three weeks.

465,"Hi all. Long story short my parents are addicts, I moved away after college and rarely visit because it's always stressful, but I feel obligated to visit during the holidays because I want to see my nephews and nieces. I visited this past Thanksgiving and it was a total shit show (I'm still recovering) and now my brother is guilting me for not coming for Christmas even though he knows how stressful it is for me.

I've been to al-anon and therapy long enough that I've learned to be less codependent and am learning how to put myself and needs first, but it's difficult during the holidays. My brother says to simply not see my parents when I'm there, but I know I'll feel guilty being there for Christmas and not seeing them; it'll consume my thoughts the entire time. On top of that he always urges me to stay at his house since I ""never see the kids and they miss me and want to spend as much time as possible with me"". I miss them too and want to see them, but they live in a small 2 bedroom house with 3 kids including a newborn so I'll need to either share the kid's room or sleep on the couch. I'm a 30 year old 6' guy using precious vacation hours to visit, call it selfish but I just can't do that stuff anymore.

I've explained all of this to my brother several times and he says he understands, yet every year we still go through this. Despite learning how to deal with codependency I still feel responsible for my  family and carry a lot of their burden in an effort to make everything as ""normal"" as possible, so I'm extra sensitive to this situation because I feel the need to be there for my brother/nephew/nieces sake, but I know it's not the best for myself.

468,"Current situation: I graduated college last year. I got a job that allows me to work remotely, but I don't enjoy it or find it stimulating or challenging. I moved back home. I am working remotely from home while trying to travel as much as possible, and mostly trying to pay off student loans.

I moved home to save money and give myself time to figure out where I want to live next. The only problem is I have fallen into a deep depression and am now paralyzed with indecision about where to move and what steps to take next.

I could stay here for another year or two and continue to pay off debt, but I feel so depressed and unstimulated living at home in the suburbs.

For the record, I am very passionate about social impact, and want to do work that has a positive impact. I love travel, arts, education, and care a lot about mental health issues and empowering others.

I could move to a new city- I am interested in Austin, Denver, San Diego. I'm open to other ideas, but those cities seem to be a fit for what I want (good arts scene, decent weather, lots of outdoor activities). Other times, I am thinking I should stay on the east coast because I enjoy the bustling and historic/diverse quality of east coast cities...one option is NYC, where a ton of my friends live, but I feel so reluctant about living there (expensive, being just another cliche person living in NYC, feeling lost in the crowd, etc.)

Part of me wants to move to NYC or a big city and be extremely career minded. Another part of me wants to continue to travel as much as possible, even though solo travel is quite lonely and I think has been fueling my depression and indecision. And part of me wants to move to a more manageable laid back city, but I'm scared of moving somewhere where I know nobody, and hating it, or not finding happiness, and becoming even more lost. 

I feel like there are all these ways my life could go- be career oriented, city liver. Be a nature person living in a more nature focused city that gets into hiking and all that shit. Sometimes I see people on Instagram living out of a van with their SO doing acro yoga and taking awesome photos and I think ""I want that!"" Other times I see friends living in NYC moving up a career ladder and think ""I want that!""

(Now side information, we have an inside broom and an outside broom. I handed my dad the inside broom.)

I go down to see my mother and start to tell her how dad was on the roof, and asked for a broom. She kinda ignored me. I then continued with telling her that I didn't know at the time if I should have gave him the inside broom or run out side to get the outside broom. I was going to tell her how we might need to but a new inside broom, but she didn't let me finish. She started fussing up a storm saying that I was going to let him fall of the roof and ignored him when he asked for help. 

I kinda just sat and took in my mother's out break, and responded like a normal person. First with, why the fuck would I want my dad to fall off a roof. Second that he has the broom.
My mother just grumbles that 'she knows me' and wouldn't be surprised if I let my father fall of a roof.

This is not the first time my family has done this to me, not only my parents but also my sisters ( I have two older sisters).
And it's always 'i know you', then imply that I would do something, mean spirited you could say.

Another example
My sister invited a group of friends (also my friends) over, while my mother had a head ache. I told my sister that she had to cancel the plans, that today was not the day. She first made me tell everyone it couldn't happen, then made it out that I just don't like anyone. That I didn't like my friends, and only use them when it was good for me.

Like I'm not crazy right, that's really crazy. Like I can understand somethings, my parents always made it clear that I wasn't there favorite. My sister's often say how much they can't stand me. 
I get that, I've always known even when I was a kid I wasn't they're favorite, but I was still there's and I happy and ok with that.

But like why are they acting like I'm the wicked witch of the west.

478,"A little background about me before I ask my question: I am a recent Freshmen in college with absolutely 0 experience with women considering I went to an all boys high school and was extremely shy and introverted in middle school. Also, there is a tldr at the end of the post for those in a hurry.

A few months ago I met a girl at a party I went to, and it seemed like she was really into me, being really physically close to me and continuously staring at me throughout the night even when we weren't talking to each other. However, later on I found out that she had a boyfriend at that time, which made me feel sad, but I was still interested in being friends with her and we kept in touch rather frequently.

Jump to 1 month later and we still keep in touch and are friends, though we hadn't seen each other since the party, and I tell her that another party is happening at the same house as the last one we saw each other at. At first she is split on whether to go or not, but after I tell her it would mean a lot to me if she went, she came. That night she told me that she had recently broke up with her boyfriend, which made me extremely thrilled to hear, and it seemed like she was still into me as well, usually smiling whenever I was with her and usually being relatively close to me. The next day I asked if she would like to go out with me and she said yes, however, she told me that she wasn't really looking for a relationship at that time, which is very understandable, and I probably should have asked her out later. Cut to our date, and it seemed like it was going well, I was feeling pretty good and she was talking and laughing just as much as I was, though our goodbye was a little bit awkward.

The next day, we start texting and I ask if she would want to go out again, but this time she tells me she just wants to be friends for right now. Obviously, I was hurt and confused, but I understood where she was coming from, considering the fact that she just got out of a relationship. We still texted and we met again a week or two later where we found out we have a lot of stuff in common, extremely similar interest in music, humor, dogs, and movies, which refueled my confidence in us being in a romantic relationship again.

Cut to present and we still keep in touch rather frequently, and we still meet up, with her continuing to show relative signs of interest in me, usually smiling and laughing at what I say as well as never looking at her phone which I noticed she usually doesn't do when talking to other guys. However, I'm confused on what I should do now. Should I ask her out again or am I just thinking too fast and just be content with being just friends for right now? My therapist is telling me to slow down right now and enjoy our friendship but I'm worried that if she is into me right now, that she may lose interest if I don't ask her out soon. What do you guys think I should do?

Tldr: Met a girl at a party who seemed interested in me. Found out she had a boyfriend but still kept in touch frequently. After she told me she broke up with her boyfriend, I asked her out, seemed like she was having a good time, but turns out she just wants to be friends, however we find out that we have a lot in common and she is still showing signs of interest, I think, in me.

479,"Dear people of Reddit. (Tl;DR down below)
At the old age of 22 I finally found the time and place to loose my virginity with someone I am comfortable with and who's always found me attractive and all. We have been in a (on and off) long distance relationship for two years now. So tomorrow should be the day...but when talking about preparation (what to buy...condoms) he said that he has never used them (I remembered he was a virgin, like me) so I was surprised and asked him if he had already had sex. 

And he said yes, well...he explained that this summer (we had broken up) he shortly had a girlfriend (he told me about that) and that they ended up having sex. (And at some point when we're talking he once said that she wanted to wait etc...but like  now he says that they ended up doing it anyways).

Uhmm as soon as I heard that I felt very betrayed. And sad, cause I was really hoping it would be our first time together...for both. And I kind of wanted to do it with someone who's also a virgin like me at 22. Also I don't really like him that much, but I am stunned at how attracted he is to me (and he proposed that we first have dates and then when we meet again (in the summer) do it). 

Cause we'd only have tomorrow and Saturday to do it/hang out together and uhmm hopefully it would be enough. I don't know. IN HIS DEFENCE I would say that it's rare to find someone who's still a virgin at 22, and that in the period we broke up I ofc could not control what he did and didn't, and that after he broke up with her and went back to me...I didn't ask him if he had done something. So my fault for not asking him.

BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I feel hella betrayed and weirdly disappointed, I really wanted it to be something special and idk...maybe being both virgins is my (stupid) definition would have made it special. 

Moreover, I'm 22, will be 23 in February. And never go out (extremely strict parents) so have no other occasions to do it or so until I'll be 26 (need to finish my masters first...before leaving home). Also I'm not particularly attractive, and my body is only ""young and beautiful"" now ...idk at 26 (cause I barely will have time to hit the gym with uni,work and everything). 

So idk, right now it wouldn't feel right to do it, but at the same time I'm very frustrated at times and ughh we're only young and ""hot"" once. I feel like waiting for the right person (etc. When I will be able to..cause I'll be 30 or so (fuck))will be magical but also...they will be weirded out cause ""how is this 30yo still a virgin!"" So feel like maybe it isn't that much of a great deal...idk

What would you guys do in my position???

TL;DR I have the opportunity to loose my virginity w someone I have previously been in an on-and-off long distance rel. with. One of the times we broke up he had sex w another girl (he was a virgin). Then we got back together (been 5 months we're back together) and found out he is no longer a virgin just talking about tomorrow (we should meet then and date/do it if we feel like it).
Idk why it bugs me that he is not a virgin. Is it that much of a great deal?",13Dec2018,1

The second question is a bit more complicated: So for a while now I‚Äôve dealt with depression and some not very serious suicidal thoughts. When I was laying on the chair waiting for them to start with the laughing gas and antithetic I felt completely fine and normal. Just a little nervous.

I began to have thoughts that I didn‚Äôt want to go back to living my normal life. It is always so anxious and painful to just exist and it was so much better to feel like I didn‚Äôt exist in that room. The gas numbed everything and made me feel only half conscious which felt very nice. 

Then the nurse said, ‚ÄúOk you‚Äôre going to start feeling very sleepy pretty soon ok?‚Äù I knew that meant she was about to put me to sleep with the antithetic.

499,"Problem 1

So I sold my mum a Playstation to give to my brother for xmas, I let him have it early. He has a past of stealing from me and he took my only pair of jeans that fit me secretly when I said no (I thought), this pissed me off to no end and it a moment of pettiness on my part I took it from his room and set it up back in my bedroom, with the mindset that ""he always takes from me without any repercussions, he can wait till xmas"". My mum said it is okay to give it to him early, but she hasn't paid me yet so I could still go and sell it, in other words it still belongs to me but I will admit a little shamefully that I took it back and am making him wait out of pettiness, it isn't fair he always takes my shit, he has stole my instruments in the past and sold them, he uses my ¬£50 backpacks (with permission) but always fucks them up, he is always taking my clothes and while he hasn't stole anything since the last time I called him out on it (basically I couldn't find my guitar and was passing by the local pawn shop and just thought, what if? Lo and behold it was there) Anyway that is all in the past and forgiven but him taking my jeans this morning made me think that it just isn't fair. 

He gets home from work, he says he hasn't took my jeans and I can't actually prove it, I actually think he hasn't at this point and I made a mistake and jumped to conclusions. So his xmas present playstation is set up in my room, in other words I basically gave it to him early, took it back off him as punishment for stealing but turns out he might actually be innocent. So my mistake I can admit that. It's not very nice to accuse him but honestly I can not blame myself. Still though I am not as petty as I acted in the moment and I plan to give it to him again in a few days after I have completed a few days. Not sure if this is the right thing to do, because of problem 2 below

Problem 2.

Anyway he comes home from work and starts kicking off about the playstation and tbf I can't blame him if he is innocent, I basically teased him about it. But he smashes shit up whenever he is angry, he picked up the iron and threw it. He also asked to lend money to buy someone else an xmas present (he cant afford to get my mum one) and when my mum said no he started getting more angry. It upset my mum and she said cruely but correctly that ""why is she on the last of the list for a gift"". Anyway I can understand why that would upset my brother but I also understand why my mum is upset. It actually made him cry and they had a huge argument. He started saying that 'he was gonna kill himself'. I told him to shut the fuck up trying to guilt trip us. He denied that and said he was going out and my brother being upset and my mum crying they hugged and I think he apolagised I am not sure. Mum was crying and he has gone out.

Now this is obviously unrelated to the jeans I was talking about but whenever he doesn't get any money or something he wants he bangs around the house smashing shit all the time, the thing I am struggling with is he an abusive person who knows exactly what he is doing or does he just have an anger problem?

It is a thousand times worse when he is drunk and he is generally and agressive person but he is kind on the inside. Luckily he hasn't got acted out being drunk since he was arrested for assualt and another crime and went to court. He is always remorseful and ridden with guilt after major arguements and events but he will still break things. We are all depressed and want to enjoy our lives and we all have our ways of escape, his is weed, mine is alcohol. Thing is I get angry sometimes and have smashed things in the past but I have outgrew that behaviour and he still acts like it, like a bullying child even though he is 22. He is a good guy but I don't know if what he is doing is purposefully abusive (trying to intimidate us) or if he just has a problem? Also relating to problem 1, having these thoughts are why I am ubsure what to do with the Playstation. Like I said I am wrong for taking it back if he is innocent but after the way he acted out I do not wanna give it to him and confirm his behaviour gets him what he wants. (Everyone is scared of him me included when he is angry, and my mum tries to please him, as a sufferer of past domestic abuse with my dad, it's clear she hates conflict)

If it matters me and my brother are the only guys in our immediate family and he towers over us. We have never met our dad (abusive and dead so we are told) and never really learnt how to manage our emotions, as a result I have grown up as as an effeminate cryer and he has grown up to be a stereotypical wanna be manly angry guy. We are all good people I believe but I need to know if he is purposefully being this way to intimidate us? Does it even matter if I know he is truly good or not?

503,"There is a person not gonna name names just in case but we'll just call him L.

Last year

I transferred into this school, seemed like one of my best options for a high school. I immediatly figured out L had some type of issues. 3 months in L throws a laptop and chairs at our antagonist we'll call him ""A."" A was very good at antagonizing L as they both have issues and clash at least once a week. A targets L in dodge ball and laughs when he gets him out L could do nothing about this as A was vastly athletically superior. This lead to L throwing laptops and chairs all around the gym floor before being detained. Fast forward three weeks L brings a gun holster with scissors and a blade no handle not a knife just a blade. A angers L and L throws the blade and scissors at A. L has never really been punished for this behavior because he has ""issues."" (we'll get to that later though) 

L home life 

L has come to school with seemingly magic bruises and marks even a black eye once. This leads me to believe L has experienced some type of abuse at home. This is probably why he does not act up for weeks on end.

This year

L messed up on a question on kahoot and A made fun of L and laughed at him when he retaliated. L ran at A and tried to throw a punch. (Remember A is vastly athletically superior and would definitely win in a fight.)  L ran out of the room before the teacher could come back.

Today 3 days later.

No punishment or even bruises on L. L starts to yell things like ""I'm a f'ing loser, Ok!"" To seemingly nobody. I dont want to pull a Shane Dawson but it seems like L is slightly depressed. Last bell of the day L is acting like he has a gun and saying ""target spotted"" to random people around the class L refuses to leave his trumpet and carries it around with him all day, you are not supposed to do this. When confronted about opening his trumpet by my friend he screams ""I dont have a weapon ok!"" Like no little yelp i was 3 hallways down and i could hear him yell this.

This has cost them a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of stress. My dad has developed alepcia and what hair is left is now white.

She's someone I know from last year, class representative, usually has people around her, and when I find an opening to talk to her I have absolutely no idea how to and I get nervous and start cracking shitty jokes. Besides sports teams and schools projects, what could I do to get a chance to know her as a person?

We sit next to each other in two classes, but we don't talk much. She's really focused on her classes, all A's. We are usually helping each other more during exercises than talking.

I really want to get closer to her, but I don't know how, and so far all answers I've had are similar to: ""well, go up and talk to her!""

514,"so, i went to the barber yesterday and asked for a fade and for them to also trim the top of my hair. keep in my mind that  i am 17 years old, very skinny, i have a huge 5head that is halfway covered by my giant bushy curly hair so it looks decent. anyway, my mom is with me and she asks for the barber to 'cut it short!'. i simply thought it was a joke cause i already told my barber how i wanted her to cut my hair but nah, right after my barber was finished i looked in the mirror to see that she had basically cut my hair so short to the point where the curls dont even form. i faked my happiness up until we were in the car to go home. i was furious! now i have to go to school with all my giant puffy curls gone! i forgot to mention that my head is the shape of an oval standing upright, and now with my forehead showing it looks like my face is trying to push itself out of my head. (if that makes any sense). it just does not look any good. maybe if i was muscular and swole it'd probably look decent but i am as skinny as a stick and it almost looks like an army haircut. any tips or advice on how to grow hair overnight? i fucking hate how i look right now.",13Dec2018,1

I don‚Äôt really use Reddit that often and this is the second post I have ever written, but I thought I‚Äôd give it a try. As you may wonder why I‚Äôm in need of company, I‚Äôll let you all know why. So here‚Äôs a short story.

I have come to the point in life where I‚Äôm kind of like ¬´fuck it, let‚Äôs give it a try¬ª. After 4.5 years of being in a relationship, things went bad and we had to part ways. This only happened a month ago. So here‚Äôs the deal. I don‚Äôt want to spend New Years Eve alone. At this point I really need to get out there and do something that I never thought I would ever consider doing. Spending New Years Eve with people I have never met, just to really get out there and out of the comfort zone. If there are anyone out there who see room for one more, just let me know. The further away the better, as the travel is no problem.

Sincerely,

517,"So I'm a big believer in friends supporting each other with any emotional or mental health needs they have, and I do this a lot. I think I'm actually good at it!

About six months ago I got a job as a Mental Health Recovery Worker for people severely affected by mental illness and so I now provide emotional support 9-5 all day. I then come home to messages and phonecalls from friends who are really struggling and also need my support. Yesterday, I came home from work and spent an hour on the phone to one sobbing friend, then messaged another for half an hour because he didn't have the energy to call, sent a few quick texts to others just to check in, another asked for a phonecall so I could help with motivation... then there's no evening left and I had to go to work again in the morning!

 I'm just beginning to feel like I don't have the emotional resources to support everyone I want to. How do I make sure that I can do my job well, keeping my service users safe, and also provide the high level of support that my friends need?",13Dec2018,1

520,"Hey Reddit! My name is Carlos (18M) and I'm not good at anything. In fact, I'm terrible at most things. See, my entire life I was always focused, interested, and entertained only by technology. In this realm I became really good at programming, designing, fixing technical issues with computers and routers alike, typing, and solving problems analytically. I would spend my days (and nights) after school, programming and watching youtube videos on design concepts or things that interested me in general. 

As you might imagine, I wasn't very socially inclined and I didn't have much of a life outside of this small world I had created. I struggled with depression and anxiety and my posture was terrible.

I'm much better now in those aspects except for one thing: as I've slowly began living a normal life (job unrelated to my talents, close group of friends, occasionally getting fucked up at parties, playing video games, etc.), I've realized I'm so incredibly incompetent at doing the most basic things. I even lack knowledge of things most people know. These things aren't necessarily important, but it's such a mindfuck realizing how much I missed out on by having tunnel vision throughout my teenage years.

525,"Long backstory short, came from little confidence until just this year when I began to better myself and this summer when I finally had confidence in my appearance that was supported by a few acquaintances (comments from guys recognizing my personal growth and girls who I knew of but never really talked to commenting on how I'd changed at parties). Off to freshman year of college, freshmen move in a week early to get accustomed to campus and there are some school organized events to get students involved, yada-yada. First night, there was a party. Huge party thrown by the school, DJ stand set up, thousands of students around the block dancing, partying, having fun. With my new confidence I began to go into the big crowd of people and had a blast. Danced around, talked with new people, all around good time. A few of the girl I was with gave me their Snapchats but I was new to the whole confident thing so ever knew how to approach that, just let them kind of be. Two nights later, one of my roommates was telling us about some people he met at orientation and asked if we wanted to hang out with them and we were like sure. I watched him pull up the name and I recognized it as one of the girls I was with at the party. Alright, convenient. So we met with them hung out for a while and became decent friends. I was always making slight moves on the girl I danced with, she was cute, you know. Each one was shut down and laughed at but I thought there was tension there. A few weeks later we were drinking in our dorm before going out to a party and it was me, two of my roommates, and her. Drunk us were talking and me and her at the dance came up and she swears up and down she didn't know. After that though, she got much more touchy with me. She came to sit on my lap and just kept kissing me on the cheek, I was in front of other people and we all had plans to go out so I didn't do anything then. After that night, I feel like sober her never really wanted to hang out with me for God knows what reason, until a few weeks of barely keeping a streak later she hits me with the, ""I haven't seen you in forever"" kind of messaging so we became closer again. This leads to every night she goes out to a party, drunk her would come back to the dorm and stumble to my room instead of going back to her friends' rooms. Every time this happened, she would sleep with me (not hook up, like we would cuddle I guess and maybe like a little more but that's it). She would always be really touchy when shes drunk and would look at me almost like she is waiting for me to do something, but sober her doesn't seem to want that so I never felt like I should. Days before she leaves for Thanksgiving we are laying in my bed, she's drunk and says ""Do you think it'd be weird if we made out?"" I said no, but still didn't feel comfortable making the move, I felt like my confidence was fake I think. So nothing. Over break, we talked a little about us and me being her friend came up, so I asked if that was all she wanted from it. She comes back with ""I'm just seeing what happens."" So she didn't straight up deny it, gave me hope, whatever. Few days later we were on the topic of sex and I was jokingly questioning her ability and I said she could prove me wrong, but she claimed we were too close of friends. That shit kinda hurt after the last few conversations, but I digress. I stayed friendly with her but kind of separated myself as it hurt to be around her a little where I wanted to try and she never did, or said she did anyway, unless she was drunk. Fast forward one more time to this Sunday, this is the first time in forever both of us were drunk, both laying in my bed and I decided not to be a pussy, so I asked how tired she was, she said why, and I said I wanted to try something. I start to guide her and she hops on top of me, we start making out, I start to work my way down, but as I'm taking off her shirt she says ""Weren't you gonna go smoke?"" I said that I would much rather be doing this, not exactly like that but that sort of thing. So she stopped and then just laid down on my chest, in the same cuddle position I'd gotten used to at this point. Disappointed, guess she was just tired. Next day I bring up something she said about us hooking up that night, and she just says ""we kinda did"". She just kind of blew it off. That was just this past weekend and since then I've been pretty shitty. Just random depression-filled hours that I thought I left behind years ago. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm in a shitty obscure section of the friendzone where she does just enough to convince me there's hope, just to string me along. Do I listen to drunk her or sober her? If she would just give me a solid no, I could finally just be her friend and I'm fine with that, but there's just that little hope in me that she still wants more, but I don't really believe it. Should I stop letting her get close like that when she gets drunk, like set boundaries? Should I keep trying?Now I'm just depressed because I'm lost. I don't know what to do, I need help.

527,"Posting on a throwaway because I don't want any of the important people in my life to know how miserable I actually feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I dropped out of public school because I've always been terrible at following schedules and waking up on time was just impossible for me. I finished high school online. I've never really been a social person and now that I'm an adult I obviously have to navigate around having a job, to my luck jobs that are mostly... based on being social, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm  a very tech savvy girl and have been playing video games my entire life. I know entry level HTML coding and can work my way around MS Word, Photoshop, and Express Scribe.  It doesn't really get me anywhere and I don't really know what would suit me. I've been trying my best keeping up with my retail job but every day that I have to drive up there I'm pretty much debating if I wanna run my car into a light poll or actually show up for work.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, what I'm asking for is advice on what I could do in the mean time that could fix my problem rather quickly. Ideally I want to work towards having a remote job that I can rely on. I have multiple questions so whichever one you could answer would mean the world to me.

1.) I've dappled in trying to find a transcription job but I'm not really sure if they're stable and if I can rely on it enough to quit my current job. I make about 10/hr so I don't need much to live on... based on that salary. Does anyone do transcription work through popular sites that keeps their head above water and they can live just on that salary? I've signed up for: 3PlayMedia and Allegis but they're taking a while to respond (got rejected by Rev).

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Are there any certifications that I can do online that can get me a foot in the door to maybe a tech job?

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Do any of you feel the way that I do, helpless and that you'll never really adapt to the whole job setting? What did you do in that situation? What career path did you take? Did you end up going to college?

&amp;#x200B;

4.) I've even thought about twitch streaming because I like videogames so much. However, I'm not really good at networking and getting myself out there. If you know anything about building an audience, that could help to.

I'm about 19-22 years old, don't want to specify just in case someone might think this is me.

Last but not least, sorry if I sound really oblivious/ignorant, I don't really have any family that can give me advice and none of my relatives have gone to college.

532,"I've (27f) been thinking about my ex (26m) a lot more lately since we broke up in January and I was just recently able to admit that the reason I think about him so much is that I still have feelings for him. We never stopped speaking since we broke up. We catch up here and there and we send each other memes pretty regularly. He's even told me that he misses hanging out and he's told me that I'm still very special to him. I was the only person who believed in him at some point so I know that he genuinely cares about me as a close friend. I know that he did value what we had and I have been okay with being friends but he's with someone else now and I don't think I can entirely move on until he's not in my life anymore. 

It took a few months for me to come to terms with the breakup but I dealt with it on my own and I didn't let him know just how difficult it was for me to make that decision and to accept it for what I was. I just couldn't trust him due to insecurities built from my previous relationship  and at the time I also decided to move back in with my parents 80 miles away because I was struggling financially living on my own. I suggested we stayed in a ltr but he wasn't down for that. I felt that if he truly loved me, he'd think it was worth it too but he didn't think it'd work out and I respected that. We only dated for half a year. My longest relationship was of four years so I was willing to commit to this one too. After four months of being together and of me trying to figure out if he wanted something serious with me, he finally told me that he loved me and I genuinely felt that was real. I was in love with him too and he made me feel so good in a way I hadn't felt for a good chunk of my previous relationship. Well he went through a depression soon after that really good phase of the relationship and he became unmotivated. He wasn't willing to commit anymore as I was. The last couple months we were together, things got weird and I didn't feel that he loved me the way that I loved him. We had quite a lot in common and there was definitely chemistry there but he just wasn't as enthusiastic as I was anymore and that definitely made me lose hope and so I decided to just move away and let him go. We ended things respectfully and as friends although I knew deep down that I loved him. It was so hard but I thought it was the best decision I could make for my own sanity at the time. 

Now from time to time I feel like I made the wrong decision but he's with someone now and that's why I find it hard telling him how I feel about him. I don't just want to cut him off and delete him from social media without explaining why first but I also don't want him to think I'm crazy for still feeling this.

535,"Warning: long post

This first part is just sort of leading up to the main issue(s) and trying to set some sort of scene. B)

And here's some information to note: My landlord is 81 and generally a bit creepy (makes comments about my clothes and attractiveness) 

I moved into my first apartment this year with my friend. I was pretty desperate to get out of my dad's place and we sort of jumped on the first offer we saw... which ended up being a big mistake. 

We went and saw the place and it was pretty shit, dirty, and kind of small. Not only that, but it was a house that was turned into four apartments. We're a bit more apprehensive but still desperate. The place is a bit overpriced, but still very cheap ($675). For the most part we assumed (because the landlord said so) that the place would be cleaned up before we moved in (It wasn't).

We noticed a shed during our visit/tour that was attached to the back of the house, but didn't think anything about it. Figured it was mostly for storage and wouldn't be a big deal. Or a deal at all, really. 

Fast forward a bit and we're going over the lease and getting ready to move in. during this time we were guaranteed total privacy beyond what was necessary. 

We move in and I take the back room that shared a wall with this shed. As it turns out my landlord and his friend sit in there. All day. Smoking. The walls are thin enough that I can hear every single word as well as the radio and TV which they constantly playing. I never said anything because I figured that I should have seen something like this coming and can I really be upset about my landlord being in his home (btw he lives in one of the apartments too).  

We go a month or so in and I'm still on edge in my room, but stubbornly not saying anything. One day, as I'm taking a nice after-work snooze I'm woken up to the sounds of someone walking around. I figure it's my roommate and try to doze off. The door to my *bedroom* opens and I hear someone who is decidedly NOT MY ROOMMATE. I peek with an eye and it is my landlord. I just want to note, again, that I was asleep in my bedroom. Not only that, but I'm half-dressed since this was IN MY BEDROOM.

I was livid, afraid, and feeling all around shitty. I looked it up and confirmed it was illegal and was getting ready to confront him about it. I didn't want to drag it into legal action, but was ready to in case of repeat instances. We talk to him about it and as it turns out he was trying to tell us there was an inspection. Later that day. As far as I understand we're supposed to get 24 hours (or more) minimum notice for anything like that.

Anyhow the conversation goes well and we get promises that it will never happen again. A few minutes later I'm in my room and I hear a goddamn argument ensue that eventually leaves with my landlord storming off. 

He hasn't done anything like that since, but something else happened that's less invading than the illegal entering, but more than being able to hear him and his friend(s) (there's multiple) all day while also having my room smell of smoke. 

I had a friend over for some intimate interactions and while doing so my landlord pounded on the shared wall and yelled at us to ""knock it off"". I never addressed it, though looking back on it now I really should have. 

I pay every month to live in this place-- a place that was legally designated for me to reside in meanwhile he sits in a shack that is not a part of his personal apartment all day, smoking, drinking, and generally making it hard for me to not notice him-- and I don't complain about it. I feel as though I'm entitled to get up to whatever activities I want in my own room as long as it's not illegal or horrible disruptive (which I can promise you, it wasn't). 

I just feel overall like I don't have any true privacy in my home. My bedroom is supposed to be a safe haven and some nights it's hard to even get any sleep. I don't know if talking about the issue would solve anything due to how he is. I just really don't know what to do. My lease won't be up until August and I'm counting down the days until then.

Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated since I'm at a loss.

So, background: This year I started at a new school, a very small one, for my senior year. I met a girl we'll call M (17), and we became friends during orientation. I'm not too close with her as her personality is big and loud and she's a bit too extroverted for my more quiet, chill, introverted self. A lot of what she talks about is drugs and sexual encounters she's had, and she often dominates the conversation in a way that makes it hard for me to talk to her. But she's cool, we have a lot of the same interests and same sense of humor. However, a couple weeks in, I started talking to J (M,17), a guy in the lunch group that adopted us and in my science class. We grew close fairly quickly, and I started crushing on him. 

Short story: He and I liked each other but were both too afraid to try anything, he also started liking M and asked her out about a month and a half ago. A fair amount of shit has happened and is happening, and I'm just lost on what to do and what his feelings for me might be. 

Long story: So, we danced around each other for a while, but he and M hung out for like three days straight before her Halloween party, then he asked her out two days later, and I found out over a week later when M had hickies. J and I hung out at his house almost a week later, and he admitted his feelings for me and so I admitted mine back. (Though to avoid drama and awkwardness, I said I didn't really feel that way anymore.) The talk confuses me though, since practically within the same breath he said he was questioning who he should be with to the second of actually asking M out, then saying that his feelings for me faded after he got together with her. Then says that we could still be a thing if he and M were to not work out. 

We've also gotten drunk together since, which lead to drunken slow dancing, hugging and cuddling initiated mostly by J, me attempting to spoon him as a joke and him offering to ""show me how it's done,"" us laying down with his head on my chest and him tapping all across my chest saying ""if we were together, you'd have marks aaallll over here,"" and him nearly offering to bite me when I said something like I didn't know if I was into that when I didn't know how to respond, him going on a bit how he likes my breasts when I said something like how they're annoying and putting his hand on one, all of which I can excuse because we were pretty far gone but that leaves me wondering what his feelings are. However, when we started sobering up, he started messing around with a potentially dangerous kink I have, which 1) wasn't safe with him stumbling around fairly drunk still, but he was just like ""its fine, I have all my attention on this,"" 2) even if it wasn't sexual for him, it is for me and he knows that, and that isn't right when he's in a relationship. 3) I told him to stop but he didn't, saying he knows I like it and he ""liked my reaction."" That was a few weeks ago and I haven't talked to him or M about it. If he were to pull shit like that again, I'd raise hell, but I don't know about right now. After J told M about our conversation on how close we were to being together, (""in every alternative universe, we're together,"" and ""if the cards were played any differently, I'd be dating you instead of M,"") she became uneasy about me and it seemed to cause tension between him and her. We're ok now, at least about that, but now I don't want to do anything to cause tension. 

Also, I'm not so sure I'd want to be with him after being second choice like that. I'm just wondering what I did wrong, what she has that I don't. He said that he knew about M's feelings towards him while he wasn't sure about mine, and my friends say that while I'm ""out of his league,"" M isn't as much so, and so he felt more confident and comfortable asking her out instead of me but idk. I mean, I just don't understand why if he liked me for so long and so much that he started taking better care of himself to try and be more appealing to me, that his family was shocked that he asked out M instead of me because I was the one he talked about, and that his first thoughts on seeing me was that I was pretty and maybe would like to be in a relationship with me, why after hanging out with M for three days he just ups and goes out with her? The idea of being with him now also annoys me in that he was a virgin before being with M, and I still am, and so if we were together now, I'd be learning from his experience that he gained from choosing M over me, and that just pisses me off. It'd be one thing if they met before and were together before I knew him or if he just generally wasn't a virgin when we met, but the way it is now, I think it'd remind me too much about how I was second choice yet again. Is that bad?

Yet I still like him and want to be with him. I half want to just say fuck it and get with someone else, but it really wouldn't be fair to them to have feelings for someone else while in a romantic relationship, and I'm not one for casual relationships or friends with benefits. I also just want to say fuck it and get a girlfriend (I'm bi though I prefer guys) as it seems like it'd be easier for me to be in a relationship that reminds me as little of him as possible than with another dude. But idk, there's two other guys that like me but, excuse my language, that's not fucking happening, and I'm not sure if anyone else does. I chose to stay instead of graduating next week and my decision is biting me in the ass, but next semester there will be a group of new people coming to our school and maybe I'll find someone else, either just friendship wise to hang out with instead of just J and third wheeling it if M is there, or maybe romantically. I'm not sure what to do, what his feelings are, anything. I'm just lost, and can use some input on what other people think of the situation and what I should do.",13Dec2018,1

To start, I am a 12th grade student in Romania and I just recived answers from Tilburg Global Law LLB and UK Portsmouth Law LLB and Law with International Relations LLB. I want to know, whether or not i should pursue this oportunities. Their sites and students say those universities are good, but at the end of the day, what else should i expect them to say? I'm interested in working in the international legal field of work, but as much as possible, European Law. While I've read that to practice law as barrister or anyting else I'd need three or more years of practice, does it apply to this bachelor's as well? If so, where could i do my internship or even gain experience? From what I've read, practicing law as a foreigner is hard or near impossible. I tried to look up vacancies which require this LLBs or internships, but nothing came up that didn't require a LLM and a lot of experience. Should I do my bachelor's in my country and then do my LLM somewhere else? Should I try to apply somewhere else? Am I going to be able to practice without a LLM? My goal, as I said before, is to practice law at a bigger level, not just divorces or defending criminals. Is there anyone that works in such an organization? If so, how did you get there? Or even if a former student of European Law, International Law, Global Law or anything relevant to this reads this, did you manage to find a job?   
My plan would be to graduate and work for a few years to fund my Master's degree, but if it can't be achieved, I'm opened to any suggestions on how I could improve or adapt it to the conditons I might find myself into.",13Dec2018,1

I confessed and he told me he didn‚Äôt feel the same way and that it would be hard for him to keep a LDR which I understand but I still had some hope. He started to grow cold and stopped calling me (we would do voice chatting everyday after work), I insisted of the calls but it was clear he wanted his time alone.

This sunday I asked to hang out and he said it would be better for me to not call him and get over him as he considered me a best friend not a romantic partner. We have not talked since and I am having a hard time because we went from talking every day to not talking at all, I can‚Äôt stop crying as I miss him a lot we were very close.

541,I‚Äôm a freshman in college and I just finished up my first semester with a 2.0 GPA. I hate myself right now. I went through a really bad bout of depression this semester and am just coming out of it. I had intense suicidal thoughts and considered jumping off my dorm building many times. I‚Äôm not using depression as an excuse but most days I was physical unable to get out of bed. I didn‚Äôt do homework because I hated existing and saw (see) no hope for the future. I know it‚Äôs kind of contradictory to say I have no hope for the future and also care about flunking out of college. But that‚Äôs how it is. This has been a huge blow to me and my already minuscule will to live. I feel like a failure. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I started meds a few months ago and haven‚Äôt considered suicide in awhile but now I‚Äôm thinking about it. I don‚Äôt remember the months where I didn‚Äôt go to class. I don‚Äôt remember missing class and not turning in homework assignments. I can‚Äôt see this as being my fault but I‚Äôm suffering the consequences. I don‚Äôt see any way out of my depression now. I don‚Äôt see how I can stop hating myself. I don‚Äôt fucking know what I‚Äôm even doing on this sub. I really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm hoping to gain. Maybe just some encouragement or someone to tell me it‚Äôll be okay. Just so there‚Äôs that tiny bit of hope that it will be before I remember I‚Äôm a fuck up and my life means nothing to me. Sorry.

543,"I take spanish in high school and have a sub since my original teacher is out for maternity leave. This teacher is extremely strict about everything and seems to hate everyone. It is the end of the semester and we have finals now. Our spanish final is split in two - speaking and multiple choice. The speaking final is the problem. He made it so where he has about 100 questions, and he will ask the question out loud and he will call on random people. He‚Äôs not making sure everyone answers a question or anything, it‚Äôs just whoever raises their hand will be graded on how well the answer was and the amount answered. He never told us how many questions we need to answer to get a good grade or any scale at all about this portion of the final. I thought this seemed extremely unfair to those who can‚Äôt answer them as fast as others who are more fluent (there are 1 or 2 students who are natively fluent in Spanish). I feel like it will be more of who can answer the questions faster than them every time. He said he‚Äôd be fair about it but even if he was, it‚Äôs not giving those who really struggle in the class an opportunity to do well having to compete with everyone else.

I just need to know if he‚Äôs being unreasonable here, or if the test really of fair. My parents both agree with me and my counselor seems to agree too but was was going to talk to the teacher about it. The test is worrying me and need clarification on this.

I have a strong desire to get that friendship back, even though I know we're fundamentally irreconcilable. At the same time, I have an overblown fear of upsetting her or making her uncomfortable just by being around or saying ""hi"" in the hallway, even though she said we're fine. On many occasions I've had anxiety attacks where I alternate between ""I should go talk to her"" and ""I should quit"" when in reality I should do neither. My work performance has suffered severely.

I reduced contact as much as I could and over the months the level of anxiety has dropped and my performance is better, but I'm still not over her and it's incredibly frustrating. Although she's not on my immediate team and sits three rows away, I still see her every day at work, it's impossible to completely avoid her, and it seems to just keep reinforcing these strong feelings I've had for her since the day I met her.

552,"In a thank-you note to a priest who officiated my marriage, I mentioned that I had spiritually adopted him (so I would be a spiritual mother), or in other words, I'd pray for him like I would my own kid. He had been very helpful and supportive of us for several years and while he seems very socially awkward, I had considered him a  friend. I thought the least I could do in return for his support was  pray for him. A few weeks later, I made a joke about being his ""mom"" and he told me not to say that and I could not be a spiritual mother because that's only for nuns (it's not). I was embarrassed and apologized.

A few weeks later, my husband raped me (again, and the priest was aware of this problem). I had no one else to talk to and can't afford therapy, so I told him a little bit about it. I know he's not a therapist and I wasn't looking for a solution to the problem, I just wanted someone to listen. Just get it off my chest so I wasn't carrying it all around. He told me that I would be better off talking to a professional. 

I understand what he means and it's fair to tell someone if you don't think you can help them. But now I'm embarrassed and ashamed for ever saying anything in the first place, for putting myself out there saying I'd be a spiritual mother, and for thinking he would actually be helpful. 

Switching churches isn't an option, so I have to see him at least once a week, but I've been avoiding him. Should I say anything to him about how hurtful I felt he was? Or should I just give up and accept that whatever friendship we had is now gone?",13Dec2018,1

As of now, I live with my parents for free, in my hometown and in my childhood home. I have a job I love and some friends here, but I'm ready for my next adventure. He wants me to move there and he's promised to help me accomplish some goals that I've had since before we were together. I originally wanted to move there around April to give myself time to prepare and set a job up and save money, plus then I wouldn't have to worry about a harsh winter (I'm very southern, I have no idea how to deal with weather below 40¬∞F). However, he wants me there sooner so now I'm preparing to move up at the beginning of January. He keeps telling me to trust him, but I'm very scared. 

To add a level of stress to this situation, he does have children from a previous relationship, their mother being his ex-wife who still wants to be with him. I don't have kids of my own and have never been with someone who has had kids, so I'm very worried about that aspect as well.

He's a great partner and I have discussed my trepidations with him in the past, however he views it more as me backing out of the move/ having cold feet than of me just wanting to discuss my (imo rational) fears.

At the beginning of the year my mom had to go to the Mayo clinic at the beginning of the year in January (We live in NM) and thought she was only going to be there for a week. With what was going on I had a feeling she wasn't going to be gone for just a week but I stayed quiet.

Needless to say she stayed there for my entire Spring semester, January-May, but was lucky enough to be able to stay with the only friend we had over there and didn't have to pay for a hotel, unlike the last few times she's had to go down there.

They put her on a new medication and said they would see her in October, when October rolled around my mom kept making up excuses as to why she kept pushing the appointments back and wasn't saving money for the trip.

TO CLARIFY: The friend my mom was staying with when she went down last time has her mother living with her and her mom hated my mom just because she was staying with them.

So she wanted to go to the Balloon Fiesta and down to Texas for Thanksgiving and was super confident that her Mayo Clinic trip would only be a week this time. (She should know better by now)

She left in the last week of November and had a hotel by the hospital for the week and was going to her appointments...and has had to stay 3-4 weeks. After the first of the month rolled around and she paid all the bills we're essentially out of money and she doesn't have a plane ticket to get her back here. Even if I drive to pick her up. That would be paying for a lot of gas we can't afford.

558,"this is going to be long, but just need to vent. Also would appreciate any advice because i'm feeling all over the place. overwhelmed, stressed, kinda hopeless, defeated.. I don't know what do.

So- I just finished my last exam for this semester. (1st year in this program). I worked to get into this program as it was super competitive and I got in... great.

well the grading structure for this course is anything below 65% is a failing grade. I managed to get well above 65% in all my classes except one. I had a 70% going into the exam and I don't know what I have now because I just wrote it today but I'm pretty confident I passed.

Anyways the course has this rule where if you receive one grade below 65% but not below 55% you can be offered a supplemental.

Now I passed all the classes. However we also had labs, which I unfortunately got a 58% in, and not for lack of effort. I showed up to every lab, always participated, and didn't fail because of lack of understanding. Just stupid little errors that you cant ever really put into practice except for the 3 h a week you are in lab(and that time is divided b 4/5 other people) - also the way the grading is based in these labs really cheeses me.
In these labs if you pass on first try 100%, pass on second try 66%, pass on third try 33%. There are 3 tests, and then a final. The final is worth 18%, if you pass first try - 100%, second try 30%, and for the final there is no third try.

I passed 1 of the labs on first try, 2 of the labs on second try, and well on the final lab I completely bombed.... twice. So I failed lab. 

One of the instructors told me that basically they are going to have a meeting on Monday to go over everyones grades that they received on the exams/see if anyone got under 65% on 2+ courses/labs and if so automatic out of course.

As long as I didn't get below a 65% in any other course (fingers crossed in this exam) I'll get a supplemental on the lab..... I obviously want this, but the idea of either not getting one or getting one is giving me so much anxiety. 

I haven't told my parents yet that I am at risk of failing. I don't want to disappoint them and my mom cried when I got accepted into this program she was happier then I was.

I have no confidence in myself from lab. If I do get a supplemental I'm going to obviously study for everyday leading up until the re-test. but I still could fail and I have so much anxiety at the moment I cant think of anything else. If I fail again or if I don't even get to complete the supplemental How can I tell my parents I failed.. 

I seriously don't know what I would even do financially. I wouldn't get the student funding that I would be depending on, and Ive already spent my entire savings on extra costs that this course wanted and I have no backup plan. I don't want a backup plan I really wanted to see this course through.

This is the first time I've ever really failed at something school related and im not dealing with it well obviously. Monday is so far away and my mind is just harping on it.

also not for nothing, I made this post on a throwaway mainly cause I just feel like downing a bottle of pills would be easier then telling my parents I failed. also im 22 and feel like I should already be finishing college and starting a life and if I fail out of this im back at square one, except with a shit ton of student debt",13Dec2018,1

Is it weird that I'm 29 and want to go out?  I bought myself a cute pair of heels, skinny jeans, and an off-the-shoulder top that shows just a tiny bit of belly so it's not like I'm going out in a micro-mini and super short crop-top or anything. I dunno, I guess I just wonder if there's something wrong with me because it seems like nobody my age thinks going out to a club to dance is something they should be doing.",13Dec2018,1
561,"I recently fell out with a very close friend \[A\] due to. Another friend \[B\] is still friends with \[A\]. I went to \[B\] before I fell out with my friend for advice on how to repair our friendship. Friend \[B\] stressed that she thinks of me as a best friend, so we've been hanging out a lot more recently. They even went as far as to support me and say that the friendship with friend \[A\] might not be over, and I opened up about mental issues and how responsible I feel. It's complicated because I can't see or contact friend \[A\] at their request, but obviously I'm still friends with people who know them.

&amp;#x200B;

Friend \[B\] has cancelled on me a couple of times because they forgot they were doing things for friend \[A\], to which I didn't think about is that is fair enough. I messaged friend \[B\] to as if they'd want to hang out last weekend, they said yes and sounded enthusiastic. Came to the weekend, and they didn't message or look at my messages. Friend \[B\] also invited me to a Christmas dinner. I had no message of when it would be, but saw that they have had the Christmas dinner and friend \[A\] was there. Am I overthinking this? Friend \[B\] is usually pretty aloof with messages and stuff, but I can't tell if I'm being stupid and can't see that they don't want to be with me, even though they agree to and have said they wanted to remain friends with me. It's also worth noting that friend \[B\] has been friends with friend \[A\] a lot longer than me, so perhaps it makes sense that they'd invite them. I'm just unsure and a bit nervous over the whole thing. I sent a message to friend \[B\] just now asking if they don't want to hang out with me, so I can stop planning things with them.

565,"So, I stash some cash at home in an old box my cell came with.
I just ed wanted to keep the money stay together and being hidden form views.
I am living with my youngest brother and my mum and since a few weeks I miss money in my stash. I told anyone about it but they could figure out I have to stash some money bc I pay a lot of bills with it.

Usually I would harass my brother until he admits he took it. I really doubt my mum put here hands in there.
The problem comes here.
I was diagnosed atrophy of the opticus  (eye nerve). Doctors couldn't find out what resulted in my nerve cell Desintegrate but after a little Intel I gave them about my lifestyle we figured it might be due to malnutrition. Anyways,
this just does not only affect my seeing abilities but also worsen my capability to focus, think, remember, orientate and other memory related stuff.
Since then sometimes, when I was with friends, for example, and talked about the past, we had different POVs  of what happened. I was always sure my memory is flawless but it turned out that I was wrong a couple of times.
For then on, I was never sure again about what I remembered.

This is quite a bummer by itself but getting worse when I don't even trust my own notes.
With my stash is always a handwritten piece of paper and the amount of money.   I the amount written and actual there doesn't match, there is something missing.

So right now I am missing 100 bucks. My brother low income and is a stoner.
But I can't confront him without being sure he took it.
Even if I hide aways the money in another spot, I can't overlook that  mishcievous little Bastard probably stole my money.

569,"I'm a skeptic. Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of things I don't believe in: astrology, ghosts, crystal healing, homeopathy, karma, any kind of deity, dream interpretation, personality profiling, organic farming, gluten sensitivity outside allergies and Celiac's... etc. Basically, if there's not a decent sized body of publications supporting it, I don't really buy it because it may as well, as far as humanity is currently concerned, not exist or just be wrong.

I realize I'm outside the normal distribution of skepticism, and I realize that just going ""that's not a thing"" is a quick way to lose friends and influence no one. My mother is a hippy dippy Scorpio and reminds me of this often. BUT, I don't know what to say to ""I felt a presence in the room, it went through me and I felt a chill!"" or ""Everything happens for a reason!"" or ""You're such a Leo!"" It honestly irritates me a little that my phone is auto capitalizing astrological signs. 

So, how do I talk to people when they bring up things like this without just going silent and staring blankly at them before awkwardly changing the subject? Are there any other skeptics here that have found a good way to diffuse the awkwardness? I hear things like this from people I like and respect and don't want to offend. I don't like and respect them any less, I just don't know what to say because ""I don't believe in that"" still sounds like ""you're stupid or lying for believing it,"" which I definitely don't think (usually). I am definitely passionate about evidence based thinking, and think some of these things can become dangerous if taken to an extreme, but also understand that a short conversation is unlikely to change anyone's mind.

573,"Hello. I'm not entirely sure where to ask this question as it's more of a job/career question than advice but here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24, currently living in Sweden without citizenship but instead on a Polish passport (not illegally or anything like that).

I've been here for 7 years during which I've tried a few education programs like carpentry, administration or service.

I always dropped out because of this or another reason (real reasons though) and now I've been looking for a job for over a year to no avail. I've got some work experience in entry-level stuff like elderly care, cleaning and warehousing.  
I'm sick of trying to convince myself that I like it here. Moved to a piece of shit dad who despite being here for 25 years still thinks he's in Poland, with Polish TV, Polish newspapers, Polish food, Polish friends (just one, actually, yeah, ''networking''). Being in this environment and actually ending up successful is extremely difficult, especially for a kid who hasn't even yet figured anything out.

I can't imagine working a high level position here even in 20 years as the language will just always be a blockade. And I don't wanna spend years learning the language just so I can fucking study. I don't wanna end up having to choose a low class career for life due to this. I don't wanna speak this language either, to be fair, it has a fucking melody. It's fun not if it had to become my primary language that I'd study or work with. Just today I've looked into a Personal Trainer course and going over the classes I was like ''holy shit this is so fucking interesting!!'' and then imagined the terror of having to copy-paste page after page into google translate. That's when it dawned on me. I looked up to the ceiling, took a big breath and said ''Fuck this shit''.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to move to UK as I always loved the place, the language, the culture, everything. Well, maybe not the weather.  
I'm getting super excited at the mere thought of moving to a first world country and understanding every single word I'm exposed to. I just read the last sentence again and it's actually ridiculous how big of a relief my mind will feel. No more asking people to repeat or translate anything. No more google-translate. No more begging girls to speak English. No more fucking ''Have you heard of varkuprokrugtraktakten?'' on job interviews. No I fucking haven't, dammit. Has, like, anyone, even, at all? Or did you just grab a bucket, filled it with vowels, shaked up and threw at me? Lol. No more googling grammar for hours because the resources are so fucking poor you need a personal pocket Swede if you ever wanna have a quick answer to your question regarding the language. I haven't been able to experience the freedom, it's such a fucking nuisance to have to ask people to explain what this or that means, even though they all tell me they can't even tell I'm not Swedish due to how I talk. Not to mention the fact that I need to put in quadruple the work at school and how my last 2 teachers here in Sweden kept saying how I'm their best student getting straight A's all while I could barely understand the material. Sorry I probably should delete the paragraph except for the first sentence as I got a little carried away.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm totally clueless on where to even begin and I'd like to ask you guys a favor to mention a few companies who have professionals providing information and resources for people in my exact situation. As for the cities, a friend living in UK mentioned Bristol, Southampton and Bath being nice, maybe you know of any other ''cities being nice'' whatever that means. I imagine the rate of wage to rent or architecture and infrastructure, perhaps even crime rates, all together.  
Whatever resources you throw at me I'm going to eat that up like the post-workout chicken tits.  


I didn't actually mean to write such a wall of text, so if you got to the end I both salute and thank you. Cheers guys.

575,"okay so I'm really worried about my friend. they're a very strong independent person but has been going through a lot . I fear that their depression and stress will spiral into drug addiction and troubles . they went to a psychic and the psychic told them they have a dark energy attached close to their heart that their mother had implanted in them . My friend needs cleansing because my friends energies and chakras are out of wack and that the darkness hates their happiness and manifest through drugs and poor choices and that eventually they will end up with nothing- from what my friend tells me the psychic was spot on.. but .. they want a LOT of money to cleanse her and have already had her do all these rituals. but as quite a spiritual person myself, my gut just has a weird feeling and i think they really need a second opinion. when I say a lot o mean A LOT my friend won't be specific but its definetly more than they can afford. my friend is totally freaked out because of this darkness attached to her and how accurate the psychic already was.

 Could this be a scam or right ? any psychic or energy healers that would really do this if a person really needed help ? I'm afraid that if my friend gives in all their money will be gone and they will spiral. :( any advice ?",13Dec2018,1

577,"I don‚Äôt know where to start so I‚Äôm going to start before my road trip I had been with my girlfriend for 5 and a half years and living with my parents for my whole life I‚Äôm (23). My best friend had moved to Boston about 4ish years go to go to Berkeley school of music and he had informed me that his roommate had bailed on him a day before paying rent so he needed my help... in the middle of a pubg match. I had cleared my Saturdays so that we could hang since those were his only days off... anyway I had nothing keeping me in LA since everyone I knew was gone and I didn‚Äôt wana live at home anymore, so I asked my girl if she wanted to go, she hesitated at first and I told her I could go first and scout it out/ test the waters because we were having our problems but she then later agreed that we would do this together and make it work for the best. We made our plan and within a week we had packed everything in her car and said our goodbyes to everyone including the dog I had gotten her for Christmas. The drive from Los Angeles to Boston only took us two days I‚Äôd drive during the night she would drive during the day. We finally got to Boston I got a job with Tyler and she kept her accounting job in LA as well as getting two new ones out here.  During this time she would start to come home very late and drunk and started drinking all of Tylers alcohol, I could tell she was depressed so I asked Tyler if I could get Eli to come live with us who was our other best friend and his girlfriend Des was Savannah‚Äôs. To help her not feel so alone..At first he didn‚Äôt like it but I later convinced him to let it happen so he did and they came and Savannah could of cared less when they arrived.... but that‚Äôs how she always was, never affectionate and careless but when we came here it only increased to selfishness. She would come home at 10pm or later even though she would get off work around 5pm and her excuse was I‚Äôm hanging alone at castle island because I need space or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never home who cares‚Äù. So I‚Äôd ask her to take time off work so we could explore but her excuse was always that she couldn‚Äôt. Anyway so when des and I got here I showed them around the area and took them to the laundromat where sav had been going when they arrived and I snuck up behind her to hug her while she was on the phone and the second I put my arms around her she quickly hung up the phone, locked it and put it her pocket after she had just been laughing and having a good conversation. This happened again when she and I and des were in the car listening to music when suddenly a name pops ups says Brandon is calling on her car screen, she quickly hangs it up again and I ask who Brandon is and she says it said ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù I know that‚Äôs bs and doesn‚Äôt make any sense...Two months and constant arguments between she and I later about this later discovered that she had been leaving her car parked here and seeing this guy who she met at work two months ago by Ubering to his place where they would then bar hop and he would drop her off here when he had finished fucking her. After I confronted her about this, she admitted it and I kicked her out. After asking her if she wanted to break up and remain friends earlier and just live here, I was taking care of rent anyway. So she leaves and takes everything besides my Xbox and tv which my friends help me save.

I have never been alone since about 19, sure I live and work with my best friends know but it‚Äôs still hard. So now I‚Äôm alone in my room and this idea pops into my head ...‚ÄùI had oxy in my back pack from having my wisdom teeth taken and I should still be in my back pack‚Äù I told who I had to tell goodbye and tried to end it but one of the people I told goodbye to was my Xbox friend of 8 years who‚Äôs mom worked for a suicide hotline, next thing I know the paramedics are taking me to the hospital. All my friends including Tylers Gf Holly all stop what they were doing and come to visit me, I lied my way out and they took me home and took care of me. The next day I‚Äôm  feeling hopeless like I wish I didn‚Äôt say bye to anyone and just did it. So what does a single depressed person looking for happiness do? Browse tinder, and des has taken some great new pics of me so I said fuck it... the first 4 were all matches one of which was this beautiful lil suicide girl named Mikaela (MK), the second we match I get a message from her saying your gorgeous and I was like ok this is fake but it wasn‚Äôt and she was a rebound sure but she also had all the qualities I liked, she texted so fast and got me through my work day and I called her on my break she basically melted on the phone... so I asked her if she wanted to meet that night she was hesitant for good reason but she eventually said fuck it come pick me up. So I drove to here and waited out side her complex and here comes this lil skater girl with a smoke in her mouth she stops in front of me and takes off her hood and looks at me with these lost puppy eyes like I had just saved her life and like I was the only guy in the world ... she was so beautiful and excited we just sat in the parking lot smoking talking and goofing around until they were out. Then we hopped in the car and headed to my house, while we were driving I let out my hand for her to hold and she let out a verbal ‚Äúawww‚Äù and just looked stared at me while I held her little hand and we dove, giving me those eyes that I had never seen before like she was finally happy. We deleted our tinder apps on the road together and talked about all kinds of things. When we got home I introduced her to my friends and we all hung out until we retreated back into my room where we just talked until 7am, we made out, watched videos, watched black mirror, and then I asked her if she would still want to be my gf in the future (something we talked about via text) and she said hell yes and asked me if I‚Äôd want to be her bf and I told her ofcourse... we wake up and realize what we just did and confirmed with eachother that it was too fast and to take it slow. The day goes on and I take her to where I work because it‚Äôs so close and then take her to my favorite place to eat. We start to talk while we walk and I can tell I‚Äôm being to affectionate and she‚Äôs just ignoring it but she‚Äôs still with me and not asking to go home. Later that night I need to take her home so I do and she takes me in a spin in her car which is the same model as my now ex‚Äôs car only in blue. I kiss her goodbye and make sure she gets in safe then drive home and we still are texting.

The next day she sends me a text saying that she‚Äôs not over her ex, that I moved too fast but she still wants to remain friends. I‚Äôm like cool but sad because I feel like I fucked up somthing that was perfect but I apologized and admitted my faults and explain that I was so affectionate because I had been in a non affectionate relationship for 3 years after my ex stopped trying so when I met her I just word vomited like an abused dog getting love for the first time. So I give her time and don‚Äôt text her and try to work on myself but can‚Äôt get her out of my head. Couple days later MK calls Des and is like I still want to see Cooper (me) and do ‚Äústuff‚Äù with him but I‚Äôm not ready for a relationship. I told des that‚Äôs more than ok because atleast I have somone on the outside and she‚Äôs not completely out of my life. Des tells me she‚Äôs coming next week so I just have to wait. She just made me so happy and I forgot about everything when she was here.

TLDR: moved to Boston with my 5 year Gf, she cheated in the two months we had been here and for the two months. I tried to kill myself told my parents they told me they are getting a divorce. Met a new girl that that I ruined the first date but she still wants to try and I want to peruse her while I work on myself. Everyday getting harder.

I just don‚Äôt know what I should do it hard for me to wake up in the mornings, hard to go to sleep, hard for me to find someone else even though I have other girls that I want to hang and I keep making excuses, hard for me to work and all this other shit and I know it sounds stupid because you guys all have your problems including my friends and I just feel weak. I told my mom and dad when they visited form a business trip they told me that they are getting a divorce.... I just don‚Äôt know anymore. The fact I‚Äôm gunna see MK in a week is the only thing keeping me going and if it doesn‚Äôt work atleast I made it a week longer but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to continue pushing with dead batteries. But I have no goals or ambitions so I‚Äôm here on Reddit to get more outside advice... please let me know what you guys think.

Thank you.",13Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a good relationship with my mum and it's been getting worse and worse since the start. I have divorced parents and I go back and forth, and as time goes on I only get tired of it. My dad will talk badly about her and she will talk badly about him. I hate arguing because I used to hear it all the time when I was younger- it gives me panic attacks.

She is very strong-willed and will not change her mind on something when she is set on it. We can't agree on anything that has to do with mental health, especially my issues with anxiety. I have moderate to severe anxiety, and it gets in the way of a lot of things. The thing is, I've been getting better with the help of therapy and I'm finding that my main trigger is her. I hate being home.

She gets very upset with me when I show that I'm anxious. I had a panic attack in public because she forced me on a ride and wouldn't let me clean myself up or use the restroom when I was hysterically crying. I opted out of playing 2/3 band songs because I was sure I was going to vomit. I play bass and the team did absolutely fine without me for the last two songs. I came home and she yelled at me for being irresponsible and selfish.

I'm barely ever in a good mood with her, even though I try really hard to be. We just can't get along. She insulted my hair once and I gently came to her to talk about how she hurt my feelings. She completely overreacted and told me I was being dramatic and oversensitive. She has told me that I am a disappointment, a horrible sister/daughter/friend, that everything I did was unattractive and that no one would love me, selfish, self-centered, and incredibly rude and disgusting. It has lowered my self-esteem drastically over time and I've tried to talk to her about it, but she just says I'm being dramatic.

She has never really threatened to hurt me until yesterday. It was always little comments like ""I'm going to squeeze your head"" but never serious. I got into a really bad argument with her last night. I was cleaning out my room and put things in bags without thinking and she came and corrected me, but she seemed very irritated and tense. She kept asking me why I was so irritated and I told her she stressed me out. We went back and forth until she was done sorting through my work. She told me that I stressed her out too and I told her that ""it's mutual, then"", and went back in my room and closed my door, trying not to slam it. 

She stomped up the stairs and slammed the door open and threatened to beat me. She told me she was ""going to whoop my ass"" and that she was serious. Really serious. I didn't say anything and was shaking and crying after that. 

I am afraid of my mum and hate being home. She won't believe what I say about my health and how I feel and I feel like there isn't a way out of this.
