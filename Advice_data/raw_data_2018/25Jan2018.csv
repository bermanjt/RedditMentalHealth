2,"so, my partner (they/them) works for this local landscaping business. around christmas, they went home (we live in a college town away from our families) for about a week and ever since they came back, their employer and coworkers have literally ignored them. at first, we just let it go because we live up north, so not only had it snowed multiple times, the snow and ground were frozen for weeks because of how cold it was up here. it's been warmed up for a hot minute now, and every single time my partner has called anyone, nobody picks up. they're leaving voicemails, texts and nobody is calling or texting back. this has been going on since the beginning of january! we don't know what the hell is happening. my partner was a good worker, was always at work unless they were really really sick, never argued with anyone, never got in trouble with the boss. we're kind of at a loss as to what to do? rent is coming up and  they're struggling. they can't just ghost and employee right? like that has to be illegal or at the very least unethical. can we report them? is there ANY action we can take or does my partner just have to suck it up and find a new job?

4,"I've got a tenant who rents from me, and her health is in serious decline.  She's in her mid-40s and is host to a number of health-related problems.  Her diet is horrible, and she is completely sedentary.  She isn't a lazy person.  She's just so overweight and unhealthy that it's hard for her to live.  I get the impression that she has a food addiction.

I'm fairly confident in saying that virtually all of her health and work-related problems are a result of her poor health.  She's been an academic advisor at the local university for over a decade and has applied for positions in other departments, but she hasn't gotten a single offer.  Like me, I think others see her as a ticking time bomb. She's doing an MBA program through the school, as well, and she thinks that it will help her improve her life and earning potential.  I can't imagine anyone would hire someone in such poor health.

Anyway, I'm a fit guy (competitive athlete), and I maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle.  It's disheartening to see this person running herself into the ground through food and lethargy.  Should I have a talk with her and ask if she is interested in making a drastic change?  I'm not really one to tell others how they should live (as long as they aren't being a detriment to others.)  However, I feel like she's at a point where she needs to make a significant change or face a horrible tailspin.  A simple diet and exercise plan could easily turn her life around.

5,"So I’m a junior in high school and i guess I’m average, my grades are As and Bs, but I’m not nothing special like I’m not top of my class or have perfect SAT scores. I hate school. My parents always say “Do good In high school so you can be successful” that’s true but I’m NOT going to spend like another 12 years in school trying to become a surgeon and then have a miserable life after that like getting called in at midnight and restless hours and sometimes seeing people die and guts and blood eww

6,"I'll try to keep this brief. 
My sister (22) is near me (24) now. She just got a job at the same tech company that my bf works at in Silicon Valley. 
First: My sister was scrambling to find a place to stay for the first month of her job and my mom invited my sister to stay at my bf's place bc I rent a room out of someone's house and he has a bigger place. She kept asking how I could stay over half the time and it would be a problem for my sister to do the same. I think my mom forgets that when I stay over, I stay in his actual bed...
Second, my family met up the day my sister moved closer to me and we all had a nice lunch. The next day, my sister had to fix her flat tire and had 2 hours to kill. My mom texts me to see if my boyfriend is available to meet her for lunch (bc I worked that entire day and he did not). I told her that he was actually doing things (like Skying his parents, running errands, etc). 
Third, my boyfriend and I just signed a lease (today) for our very own space. We ended up getting a 2 bedroom bc it was cheaper than the 1 bedroom and we figured we could use the extra space as a guest room since my boyfriend is from Europe and his family wants to visit us in the States. What does my mom suggest? She asks if my sister can move into the extra room. I don't think my mom respects that while we want to have my sister over, we want the room to be a GUEST place for both our families/friends. Also, we want to see what marriage would be like together (we've dated for 2 yrs now), so we want to keep our place JUST us. 
How can I tell my mom to give my bf and I little more space? She is turning into my dad's mom at this point.

7,"I have a highschool punk ""band"". We don't have a drummer, which is problem one. Recently, we secured a gig for a local charity night. Upon hearing this, both the bassist and a guitarist said that couldn't do the practice. They have both regularly failed to come to band practice. They entered this band knowing the expectations were weekly practice and occasional shows. I kinda think they need to be replaced, but in a town my size its gonna be hard. And the bassist is a long term friend of mine. Idk if or how to let them go, or how to get new people.

Here comes the second part. This was supposed to be our first gig. Because they pulled out, it was canceled. Now, it will be harder for us to get gigs there, which is one of our towns only music venues. How do I go about getting gigs now?",25Jan2018,2
8,"Full disclosure: I am a sub male speaking with a female dom on tumblr. We have been talking for a while and we seem like a good match. She has said that she likes me but even though I've shown a picture of myself to her she refuses to do the same. She says it just makes her uncomfortable to show her face. I'll be honest in that part of the reason I want to see what she looks like is to see if she's attractive. It's fair that people in a relationship are physically attracted to another right? Anyway, it's unlikely that she's lying about her gender because she's agreed to speak on the phone tomorrow. What should I do?",25Jan2018,2
9,"My husband and I own a duplex. Husbands Mom (aged 80) lived downstairs for a year and died there in Hospice. Once the place was vacant my folks (aged 73/74) said they wanted to move in and I knew it was a bad move, but my husband encouraged it and now I'm in a real pickle. 

My parents didn't want to move in as is, but to improve the space so they dumped $50K into gutting the apartment and were planning to move in April. The idea was that even though they were well now health wise (with a few exceptions) we would care for them here as they aged. I don't care about the remodel, but they saw the remodel as an exchange for this future care kindness (or so I thought). They pass, we have a lovely apartment downstairs.

Well, they just learned that my husband and I are investing $6,000.00 from our savings into our new business that we started last year that is having a cash flow issue. They do not approve. They ripped me a new one on the phone about my ingratitude for the remodel, poor decision making and their hesitance to move in with someone so financially irresponsible. 

Thing is, we did TALK about these value differences (we are entrepreneurs/ they are traditional corporate types) before they plunked down this cash (remodel is now done by the way).  

So, it's obvious to me that this is just the first of MANY troubles to come if they're bent out of shape about $6K. What the HELL do we do now? I am not going to change the way I manage my finances just to keep my parents happy. 

Do I buy them out of the downstairs? Unfortunately they over-improved it and I won't get that amount out of a sale. Fortunately, I have the $50K in savings and can give it to them so they can walk away.

11,"I am currently a college student taking a semester off to earn some money for tuition. I will be doing this for six months. 

I have two job offers. 

One is a super relaxing but boring scanning clerk job where I go into an office from 3PM to 11PM and scan documents. I will be working with 4 other people and they tell me the job is super easy. There's no one looking over me and I can listen to music all night, etc. But my worry is that it will be depressing. 

The pay is $12.85/hr, which is $1.50 above min. wage in BC, Canada. It's not bad considering that all retail positions pretty much pay min. wage. And it is a guaranteed 40 hour work week from Mon to Fri.

I have another job offer from Rogers (one of the major telecommunications company in Canada) for a customer service call center position (""Customer Service Consultant""). The pay is $16 an hour plus commission! I should be getting at least 32 hours a week but obviously, it's going to be a lot more stressful and demanding. But maybe it will be more challenging and fun. I always wanted to work in a commission-based job. But obviously, working in a call centre might be depressing as well. 

Which job would you take? Should I worry about which one looks better on a resume? I am going to major in accounting so none of these are really relevant but I think the customer service call centre job at least shows that I can talk to customers professionally, build relationships, and handle busy work which is probably better than being a scanning clerk for future accounting firm positions.

I have to be the smartest. I have to be the best looking. I have to   be the biggest dude. I have to be the most liked in a group. I have to have more friends than people I meet. It's bad and super unhealthy, and I get that. I can't be the best at everything, and never will be.

The thing is, I don't know how to get rid of this mindset. I don't know how I can be ok with being average at certain things. I know I have to, and I will, but how do I accomplish this mentally.

If I'm not perfect at something, then I really beat myself up over it. And it can be small little things, too. Maybe I messed up a tiny bit in Bio Lab today, and then I beat myself up over it. Maybe I feel like I came across as too goofy to someone, etc. It's not even stuff I should be beating myself up over anyways.

It has also translated over to my social life. I tend to see everyone else as being perfect. I can't see that their flawed. I can't see them as being normal people who have flaws/issues/lifes. I just see them at competition and perfectionists. I then judge my mishaps to their ""perfection"" and it only gets worse from there.

He is my HS sweetheart and we found ourselves back together no love lost after 15 years.  Anyway, as all marriages things get bumpy.  But we've always figured it out.   There's been some big bumps.  But lately I feel like we have run right into a wall.  It's starts with his father (63?M).  He is homeless, well sort of, he's living on my couch at the moment. It has now been a month of him here.  I was against it from the beginning.  We have 3 children (1 mine bio, 2 his bio, 0 kids together)that we need to worry about.  We had both lost our jobs recently and funds are incredibly tight.   I found a part time job and am struggling with health issues.  It just wasn't the right time.  We were/are not in a position to take another adult in.  Plus we don't have an empty bedroom for someone.  So back to being against it.  It was a conversation,  I said no.  I brought up all my points and issues with it.  And still here he is.  And still is and it's not looking any better.  He has nothing,  no job, no benefits, he didn't even have an ID.   This has caused major problems.  I feel like my husband didn't stand up for me and that he just bulldozed his way over me.  I told him last night that I am Incredibly unhappy.  His response was to ask me if he should leave.  I'm appalled and so hurt.  I love my husband and have fought like hell for this marriage.  But I don't know what to do...  I suggested counseling but our insurance won't pay for marriage counseling.   And we are so broke right now we wouldn't be able to afford it out of pocket.

26,"Apologies for the length of this. I haven’t told anyone this before but I had a mental breakdown yesterday and am struggling, please help. 

I am 20 y/o who has moved to a different city for uni. I have been depressed since 2016. I’ve seen my doctor for about 4 months and was on some medication for 3 months before dropping it in April of last year. I haven’t gone to see my doctor in the past year. No one except me knows I have been diagnosed. 

The reason being is I think I know why I’m depressed and have suicidal thoughts. I used to get hit when I was younger by my dad but did well at school and got into a good university. However I have a younger brother (13 years old) who lives at home but gets hit for various reasons. Mostly it’s to do with his anger problems. He gets angry quite easily and doesn’t ever want to do any homework. My dad hits him because my brother has a lot of minor physical problems like asthma, foot deformity, eye problems and some other things. He worries that if he doesn’t do well at school then he won’t be able to get into uni and not be able to have good office job. My dad worries that if he doesn’t do well, he will struggle all his life with manual labour jobs which my brother won’t be able to do and so he won’t have a successful life.

My brother got hit before when I lived at home but I didn’t really do anything. To be honest I don’t know why (I think I might have been scared). 

I talk daily to home. In November of 2016, my mum told me that my dad hit him again. I literally hung up and broke down. I sobbed and cried for the first time in a very long time. For some reason at that point, all the memories of when my dad hit me came back (which I blocked off) and I broke down.

I’ve asked, pleaded with my dad many times but he wouldn’t listen. He just dismisses me. When I went home in the Christmas, Easter and summer holidays, my dad didn’t hit him when I was around except once in August of 2017. I blocked him and he got really angry at me and told me to never do that again.

Since then to now I can’t think properly. I went to a psychiatry conference a few weeks ago and there was a lecture on child abuse. I almost cried there and then but didn’t. Sometimes, especially today, I wanted to kill myself again. 

I can’t help my brother and it breaks my heart. I understand and believe that the reason that my brother has his anger problems is because my dad hits him. As a result he gets more angry and it’s just a cycle. I’ve thought many times of calling the police/CPS but haven’t been able to. 

Despite absolutely everything, I still love my dad. He’s been everything to me. I haven’t been very close to my mum but my dad is someone who supports me financially, gives me advice and helps me out with anything I need. I simply can’t break apart my family. Additionally, I know that my mum won’t be able to cope alone and my brother will most likely be taken into custody. However in the short time that me and my brother were totally alone I’ve asked him to tell his school teacher but he said he won’t. I’ve tried to apply to a boarding school for him but wasn’t able to receive the bursary and therefore aren’t able to afford it. 

I haven’t gone to see my Doctor or signed to student counselling because I know at some point I’ll open up and everything will breakdown because they have a duty to report. 

I have thought of some things I can do instead over the past year and was wondering what you might think of these:

1. Send an anonymous report to CPS but keep it brief like “heard shouting” in the hopes that the police visits, at least gives my dad a scare, and he stops hitting. 

2. Send an anonymous email to my brothers school teacher saying I’m his friend and that I’m worried about him because he looks sad etc. Maybe if the teacher prods him my brother might open up. 

3. Send an anonymous letter to my brothers Doctor in the hopes he might do something. 

I would give everything to switch places with my brother. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. ",25Jan2018,6
27,"About a year ago, I responded to a post on a social media app. This girl was complaining about how she felt really lonely despite having a large group of friends because she couldn't be herself around them; she'd have to dumb herself down, etc. I told her that I understood how she felt and invited her to hang out. 

The first time I met her, I could tell that she was a little unstable. I'm pretty good at reading people and, while I could tell that she was a good person, I could also tell that she had a lot of emotional trauma. She has a warped perception on life, men, relationships in general, and really the entire world. It's a very pessimistic, horrible perception.

The more I got to know her, the more child-like I found her to be, despite the fact that she's older than me. I felt like a lot of her perceptions stemmed from fear and self-preservation than logic or wisdom. The nice thing about our dynamic was that I'm kind of a ""mom""; I'm responsible and take care of everyone and everything, whereas she's a bit more of a wild child. I'd keep her emotionally stable and try to discuss her negative perceptions and she'd help me let loose and get out of the house.

Toward the end of our friendship, she started to get a little insecure and even hostile toward me. She'd make a lot of little back handed statements whenever we'd hang out like that I'm vain or a bitch or she'd belittle me because I didn't agree with her pessimistic views. One time she actually brought up my race as reasoning for having a better view of the word by calling me privileged. 

The final straw was, well, a sketchy dude she met one time at a party while drunk/high invited her out to dinner and I told her to be careful and that I was worried for her safety. It seemed as though she thought my issue was that I thought she might be into him rather than that I was worried for her well being. She said, ""He's not dating material."" And I jokingly said that none of the men she'd told me about seemed to be. She started putting down my boyfriend at that point, telling me that because he wasn't a high earner that he wasn't worth shit and that if we compared the people we'd dated I would ""lose"". 

So, I stopped being friends with her. Since then, she's made multiple attempts to continue a friendship with me, even after I told her that I was no longer interested in being friends with her. She's tried manipulating me into begging for a friendship, then when that didn't work she tried acting like she didn't care about me, and when that didn't work she tried to pretend like nothing had happened, and finally now she sent me a gif today that said ""Like it or not, you're still my friend.""

I don't understand why she's so intent on continuing a friendship with me. When we parted ways, she said that I was abusive and that I'd slut shamed her, among other things, so I don't understand why she'd pursue a friendship with me if I allegedly treated her so horribly. I liked being friends with her before the relationship soured, but I can't ignore the issues that have presented themselves or the fact that she spoke ill of the person I'm in a relationship with.

Should I give her a second change or should I tell her to bugger off?

We've shared so many things about each other's lives, past, and have almost everything in common about each other, and I mean that. 


Recently, she's told me that she'd wanted to break up with her boyfriend, and I'm not sure if that was the truth or if she was just exagratting, because she's said this before and played it off last time she did. I took notice today when I seen her, I looked where she was looking at me and she looks at my eyes and lips a lot (mostly eyes). She also told me yesterday that she was glade her boyfriend wasn't there at the school we go to, because she didn't want to deal with his bullshit. 


The bullshit of her boyfriend she is referring to is to my knowledge of what she told me that he was acting depressed and mopey, to the point where suicide was joked around with himself. I asked her when did he started acting like this and she said 3 months ago. The cause of his behavoir is something really small that I just think it's too preposterous to be mention on this post. 


This girl, I hang out with her probably almost everyday (weekday). And we've grown to know a lot about each other these past 5 months. She's also invited me to her huge ass birthday which is 4 months away from now. And at this point I know I've got to make Some sort of move on her. 


This brings me back to my question on what to do with this girl that's losing interest in her boyfriend. I really like her a lot and I think she perfect. I'm just kind of scared to do anything too big to move on her, as I don't want to ruin the relationship we have now.

37,"I’m a tech editor on a team of tech editors, and the one with the most seniority (alas, that means little for authority). One of my colleagues just moved into my office with me, and I can now see where lots of her issues with quality are coming from.

She shows up ~45 minutes late every day. She reads the news for about half an hour before even bothering to check her email, dicks off on her phone, shops for furniture, looks at real estate sites, takes a 40 minute Starbucks break after “working” for an hour, you name it. But here’s the weirdest part:
She types NONSTOP ALL DAY. Our jobs do not require this in any capacity. It’s some window in Outlook. Every time I get up, she quickly closes the window. (The fact she thinks I’m stupid is also infuriating.)

We peer edit each other’s work before final delivery. This should normally only take about an hour or two, but her stuff has SO MANY glaring errors that it takes me so much longer to get through it. I feel like she just assumes she can half ass it because the peer edit will cover her own ass at the end of the day anyway. 

I take a lot of my pride in what I do. It’s incredibly frustrating to work with someone who gives absolutely ZERO fucks. Especially because our company is of a pretty significant caliber. Finally, I busted my ass looking for a job for YEARS before landing this one, and I worry I am taking it personally that she obviously just doesn’t care/never had to work hard for nice things like I did. 

I want to talk to our manager about this, but I am afraid of just coming off as a tattle. Do I have the grounds to bring up any of these issues? If so, what do I say?

In the meantime, is there anything I can say to my colleague in a professional way? Namely that I don’t care what she does/types all day, but that it’s insulting she thinks I’m that stupid when she “quick closes” the mystery window?

Thank you!!",25Jan2018,3
38,"So, okay, backstory. I've wound up moving in with a household that's known each other for a decade or so, and the head of household here, we'll call him C, had some neurosurgery recently - Reportedly something that was to prevent damage from a bike accident from getting worse, but he's in a wheelchair now. Supposedly recovering at decent speed, and still able to do design work and maintain his life pretty well, but...

As someone whose fresh into the environment, I've noticed he reaches for words a lot. He's got a ton of clutter in the environment - Not true TV-grade horror-story hoarding yet, but clearly on the path to it. People in the house report he's always been an irritable guy, and recent general frustration could certainly be just being in a wheelchair, but no one here knows for sure how much is sensible emotional response to the situation and how much is damage. His live in dependent boyfriend catches the worst of it - I've seen moments where C asks BF to do something, BF goes and takes care of it, but a little delay, and C views it as a much, much longer delay than was a perfectly reasonable diversion to take care of a side project. Lots of little moments where his internal auto-complete on what happened is just noticeably off from reality, that kind of thing is always there. 

I'm not sure how much of it is me worrying, or projecting, but when I raise these concerns with people they all go ""Yeah, we know, nothing to be done"". 

I'm not satisfied with that. So here I am. Asking what can be done, what resources or directions, or methods can be used to combat this. Or maybe just even the right subreddit to ask this in, I don't know. I'm worried, and this guy's high paying job is the lynchpin of a whole household of tennants and people who give a fuck about him but don't know what to do, and I'm just not going to sit and worry. I want to do something.",25Jan2018,3
39,"I'm 23 and for the last 5 years, I've been taking care of my disabled mother and little brothers. I've been searching for jobs but haven't been able to find one, I've gotten interviews but no job. We're supposed to be moving in a few days because the landlord is kicking us out but we have nowhere to go. I feel like I failed them, and its because I did. I can't get into college because I don't have the money and FAFSA isn't an option atm since my Dad can't provide his information and I'm technically still dependent on him and my mom. I don't know what to do, I don't want to tell my girlfriend all of this because I'm afraid of what she'd think and I don't want to make her feel like she's not enough but 90% of the time, I want to just quit life. Everyone will probably think I'm weak but I just don't want to keep swimming against the tide, it feels like Im fighting a battle I'm not capable of winning.

46,"This year has been extremely hard for me. My parents are trying to fit all of the parenting in that they can before college, and I've gotten a therapist to deal with anxiety and stress. I just had midterms, and they didn't go well. The three classes I worried about the most and wanted to pass the most I got D's and an F. I agonized over studying for them the past few weeks, and in the end I didn't get much studying done at all honestly. My stress levels were constantly way too high for me to do anything but try to get away from it. I've had problems with procrastination in the past, but this time it was different. It wasn't ""I can do it later, it's fine,"" or laziness (I think). This time whenever I was stressed and staring at my notes or looking at a pile of problems I couldn't solve I was seeing myself fail in college. I applied to some very difficult schools, my top choice being RPI for a while but now I'm seriously reconsidering because I'm unable to pass even a few AP midterms in high school. They've asked for my midyear grades, now I guess I don't have to worry about failing there because I probably won't get accepted. I'm even reconsidering what I want to do with my life.. computer science. I'm amazed with how people can program and make video games or websites and software that people can use. The midterm I did the worst in, the one I was the most confident with, AP computer science, I failed. I'm crushed, I failed in computer science and I feel this is a premonition to me failing in college. I feel like life is too difficult, that I've bit off more than I can chew.. I'm scared I'm making a mistake, maybe I'm not meant to program. I want to be able to succeed but I feel so limited and incapable, especially after this experience. I'd really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you for your time, whoever reads this. :,)

47,"So I got my first girlfriend a few months ago. She isn't a bad person but I feel there's no way a relationship can really work out long term between us. I'm having trouble with her being morbidly obese and haulting all action to work on that(she was trying to lose weight when we met, but she's stopped in the time we been dating), and I feel so unwanted when I'm with her. She'll only touch me if I ask, and if I ask too much she seems annoyed. Despite being in a relationship for more than 2 months, I still haven't had my first kiss. I have female friends that touch me more than she does, and I don't ask them to. I also get to see her only once a week if I'm lucky because her parents treat her like she's 10 even though she's 23, and she enables it. That's a real turn off for me as well. I don't hate her or anything like that, it's just that she's a friend and not a girlfriend for me. So I don't want to upset her, but I really want to free myself from her so I can find someone that does want me, and does want to touch me.

48,I have worked at this retail job for ten months. I’m not scheduled to work till 2/7/18 and today is 1/24/18 so I wrote a resignation letter/2 weeks notice and left it in an envelope in a drawer they are always in and out of signed to my two managers who did not work tonight since I wouldn’t be able to put in my two weeks notice verbally in time because I start my new job on the 29th. I didn’t tell my supervisor because I assumed I should let my managers know first and I figured after they read the letter they will tell her. I also put in the letter that if they had any questions to not hesitate to call me. Was this unprofessional?

49,"Hi, I got moved into a new program at work because they were understaffed.

When I got it, I met some people and they showed me some stuff. I already have an understanding of what is being done on this program, and I picked a lot of things up quickly.

I left the coworker's desks (one desk for two people) for about 20 mins and came back. When I came back, one of the guys have left for a meeting and the other did not want to give me any attention. The guy who left, left his computer on and his IM up. It was an IM chain to the guy he sits next to.

The IM chain was insulting me, saying ""He acts like a robot,"" ""probably a Mountain Dew drinking guy"" (whatever that means), and ""Why do we hire people like this."" I was completely shocked to see behavior like this.

These messages are done over company IM, and saved into their computers. I have no idea how I am supposed to act around these people any more. They judged me based on my looks alone.

Do I tell them I saw their messages, do I tell my manager, do I tell HR? Do I tell them, but fake that someone approached me about it? I'm so lost right now.",25Jan2018,14

58,"Some background.  My father was physically abusive when I was little.  My parents fought each other for custody and my mother won.  I have not had contact with him since, though he repeatedly tries to send me letters.  He has always maintained the abuse never happened and I was fed false memories.

I remember being knocked around by him, and I remember having to wear sweatshirts in summer to hide the bruises.  I could describe that memory in 100% visual detail.  Yet something just happened today that has me questioning everything.

Because I ALSO swear I remember my mother confiding in me many years ago that she was the one who called the police on my father.  But all of a sudden, she says that she didn't call them, and she never told me that.  At first, it was ""I don't know who called them.""  Today, it's ""Well, it was my friend, Denise, but I just didn't want to tell you that.""  She is no longer in contact with this friend, I should note.  I might have been more inclined to believe her, except EARLIER, when she insisted she didn't know who it was, I suggested it might have been my swim instructor (he could have noticed the bruises) and she seemed quite willing to go along with it.

I'm scared, and I don't know what to believe, and which of my memories are true and which aren't.  What do you do in this situation?  What can I do?  I should mention here that I am disabled and depend on my mother to get around places.  I also do not have the money to go to a specialist who might be able to tell me which of my memories are real or not.  I just now realize that the few times I did talk to my father after Mom won custody of me, she seemed a little bitter about it, like I had betrayed her trust.  It made me feel very guilty.  (He was abusive toward her, too, just not to the extent that he was to me.  If my memories are real.  Oh, God, I can't believe I have to type that.)

62,"So I get done early with work and I'm headed to the gym that's near my apartment. I'm about 10 blocks on the last stretch of road when this pickup literally pulls out in front of me. There couldn't have been more than 5 feet between us when he crossed that intersection and I fuckin t-bone the shit out of him. To my surprise this truck takes off. Now I'm fuckin pissed! There was a liquor store in the shopping center he pulled out of so the entire time I'm thinking ""this fucker is drunk and I'm not letting him get away"" so I take off after him. I still can't make sense of it but maybe 2 blocks down the road he decides to stop. I pull my car in front of the truck, to block him. Now the driver starts pressing down the gas, like it's fucking Grand Theft Auto, and starts trying to push my car out of the way. So I'm just going to fucking hurt someone, real goddamned bad. I get out of the car and look in the truck and it's 2 black kids. I was so fucking stunned that I hesitated. I can't beat the shit out of some kids, can I? The passenger gets out and then the driver. So I'm walking around towards the back of my car to grab him because I'm not letting this fucker run from the scene, right? He reaches under his hoodie and into the waistband of his pants and he starts saying ""I didn't do this"", or some weird shit, but that hand totally fucking steals my attention because we're literally 7 feet away from each other - if he fucking shoots me at that range I'm going to be in a little trouble. So I'm trying to quickly put together a plan about what to do if he starts shooting. I can't go left because the vehicles are there. If I go right he can easily cut me off because he making a circular movement around me. So it's like I'm in the middle of this circle and he's walking the perimeter of it,  and trapping me. Behind me is a dead end. I literally envisioned getting shot, right there in the street and all I could think of was ""Don't let this fucking kid take my life. I'll take anything else but don't let me be dishonored like this"". They fucking ran off and I stood there like a jagoff. 

My car is all fucked up, I'll most likely have to drive a rental for a few weeks and they never caught the kid. And to be honest, even if they had caught him I don't think I could have ID'd him because I was not looking to see what pretty color his fucking eyes were. I was watching that hand and trying to time my reaction to the possibility of bullets coming at me. 

I had considered a conceal carry permit for awhile but I'm almost glad I didn't have one because as soon as he reached into that waistband I would have put this kid to sleep. And if he didn't have anything, can you imagine that headline? ""Racist white man shoots an unarmed black teen"". Aside from that I would have to have lived with taking someone's life too. 

I wish I could have done something more brave, and there's a good possibility this kid didn't have a gun but I grew up around Los Angeles and it's no exaggeration that you'd better be paying attention to the kids because they do shoot. And I thought, for a split second, that if the kid was crazy enough to do all this what's to stop him from taking out a witness too? Disappointed at my reaction and wish I had someone else to talk to about this.

PS: Vehicle came back as stolen. They had picked up a kid matching the description I gave and asked me to ID him but I could not say, with 100% certainty, that he looked like the driver of that truck.

67,"So I need some advice on how to handle this situation. I have a lot of bitterness that has built up towards my mom and now I have a hard time even talking to her without feeling frustrated. My mom really does care about me but the problem is that she cares a little to much. I'm 20 years old and I want my independence but she has a hard time seeing that I want to handle most things on my own. I've tried talking to her about this but it doesn't work. She always tries to get in my business and asks me so many questions about everything. An example of this is that me and my last girlfriend broke up mainly because of my mom. My mom always had her nose in our relationship and has been way to involved which scared my last girlfriend away. My mom has extremely high expectations of me and anyone that I date and she lets that be known which causes a lot of pressure on people. She was always messaging my ex, judging her, stalking her social media, trying to ""help"" when me and her were arguing by messaging her, and continuing to try and ask me personal questions about our relationship. This made things really hard because I was in love with my ex and I saw a future with her. Because my mom was so pushy, judgmental, and not minding her own business it made my ex feel like she could never live up to the expectations of my family which ultimately ended up playing a big part in why she left me. I feel as if it isn't her business who I date and that she shouldn't be so involved and I've tried to explain this but it doesn't work. She continues behaving and acting like she's entitled to know everything about my life and everything about the person I'm dating. I have tried just staying silent but when I do she starts nagging me for more information about things even when I tell her that I don't want to talk about it or that I want to figure out the situation on my own. I've tried voicing how I feel which ended in her crying and her behavior going right back to how it was before I talked to her about it.

69,"#How do I rebuild my broken and stunted life?


TL;DR:

I'm a 28 year old man. I have no job, no friends, no family.  I weigh 550 pounds. I am on SSI disability for anxiety and PTSD and my weight. I have been homeless on and off since I was 16 years old.  I am on a waiting list for public housing. I'll be in an apartment in a month or two.


**How do I build a life?**

This is going to be long, sorry about that. And sorry for any spelling errors. It was very emotional for me to put all of this into words.


I was raised by two horrible and sick people.  My mother  is a narcassist and paranoid schizophrenic. I have had no contact with my mother in 10 years. My father is a pedophile, rapist and has borderline personality disorder.  I have had no contact with my father in 2 years. 

When I was young, my parents kept my sister and I completely isolated from people and culture. I have never played with a child my own age. I never learned to play or socialize with anyone.  She would read the bible to me and my sister for hours a day. We  were technically homeschooled, but never learned anything except the bible.  When my parents would leave, they would lock us inside the house, and tell us that if we left, people would kill us or abduct us or corrupt us.  

We had a small TV in the house, but no TV antenna. It was only for playing  certain videos that my parents approved. We could only watch church material and a few old movies. When my parents would leave the house, my mom would take the TV with her and lock it in her van, so we couldn't watch anything without their supervision. 

My mother also would regularly starve us. My mom was obsessed with health. She always thought she had cancer or something.

 She would feed me a tiny bowl of plain oatmeal for breakfast and a few leaves of lettuce and a small chunk of tuna(maybe the size of a quarter) for lunch.  When both parents were home, they'd almost always fight, and they'd each end up in different rooms, and my mom would be crying and my dad would be sleeping. My mom would say dinner was ""fend for yourself"".  We rarely had family dinners. I don't even remember them.  My sister usually make food for me and her. She'd make me ramen noodles or spaghetti or mac and cheese or whatever for dinner.   
My dad would over feed me when he could. On weekends he would take me to the McDonalds drive through and buy 12 cheeseburgers and let me binge. This was the only ""real"" food that I'd get for the week. My mom would never allow me to eat fast food.  My parents would eat their own food, but feed us crap. We weren't allowed to have the ""adult food"". (By the way, I thought this was normal until a few years ago).

It was pretty common for my sister and I to go to sleep hungry, and then with my acutely developed sense of smell, wake up and unbeknownst to them, sit at the top of the stairs, watching them eat pizza  and take out chinese food and other ""adult"" food.

When I was 10 years old, my dad left my mom, and took my sister and I to live with his mother on the other side of the country. To my sister and I, he was rescuing us. We loved him for this. We hated my mom.

At 10 years old, I was a horribly weird child. This was in the year 2000. I had never heard any music with lyrics before in my life. My mom would only let me listen to classical music because she was worried that the lyrics in music would corrupt me. 

I had my dad buy me a CD to listen to music for the first time. It was Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. I was blown away. I didn't even know people could make those sounds with their voices. 

This is where my life opened up incredibly. Everything was amazing. My world got HUGE overnight.  TV, Music, culture, THE INTERNET! My dad bought my sister and I computers. I spent most of my teen years on my computer. It was amazing to me.

After moving across the country, my dad divorced my mom and got full custody of my sister and I. He enrolled us in school, and I went into 5th grade, and my sister in 7th. 

It was terrifying. I didn't even know how to talk to anyone. I had never met anyone my own age before. I didn't know half the words they were using. Everything almost sounded like a foreign language to me.  This lead to me being really awkward and getting bullied a lot.  I ended up dropping out of school when I was 13 and my sister did the same when she was 15.
My dad told the school that he was going to homeschool us. He never did.  We never did any homeschooling. I never graduated high school. 
Around this time, my dad started feeding me. And feeding me, and feeding me. I never had a mom to starve me. My dad had no idea how to cook. Every day was like this. Breakfast: 4 sausage mcmuffins, Lunch at the all you can eat Chinese Buffet, and dinner was a bucket of Fried Chicken. This lead to me ballooning to over 400 pounds by the time I was 14.

Around 2004, my dad leaves his PDA(kinda like a smartphone, minus the phone) in his car while I'm waiting for him. I decide to play a game on it. While I'm looking through it... I find pictures... of my sister. Naked. And pictures of various female family members(my grandma, my aunt), their heads photoshopped on to pictures of naked women, and lots of child porn.  I am confused. I have no idea what to make of this. I'm  14 years old. I quickly put the PDA away and pretend I never saw it. Over the years I'd realize the way my dad treated my sister, and it made me sick inside. I was worried he was molesting her. Apparently I learned last year from her, that he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14. And I mean ""teach"" her.... physically...

---- 
My dad was kind of a scam artist(I did not know this  at the time). He didn't have a job. What he did was go to desperate people who wanted to get out of their mortgages, and ""buy"" their houses, and then rent them out. Turns out he didn't really buy them, he got them to sign a quit claim deed to him, and they still kept the mortgage in their names, and he would rent the houses for a price over the mortgage. The owners kept the mortgages in their name, but my dad paid the mortgages with rent money from renters. He'd then ""rent to own"" those houses to people that would put $5000 down to buy these houses from him. 

He did this for a few years until he had 20+ houses. In late 2006, he decided he didn't want to be in this job anymore. He took all the rent money for October 2006 and didn't pay the mortgages, causing all of the old people he got the houses from to default on their mortgages.

Conveniently, my dad decided that we would drive acrossed the country to go on a long water fast together to lose weight.  So he drove us out to the Arizona desert in 2006 in a big box moving truck, and we both sat out there reading books for 40 days straight without eating, and only drinking water. (Now that I think back to this, I think this was child abuse, but I thought it was good at the time because I lost 100 pounds).


While we were out in the desert, all of his houses were being repossessed, including our own house.  When we got back we had no where to live. My sister was 18 at this time, and luckily for her, she had moved in with her boyfriend. I was stuck with my dad.  


Over the next 4 years we would be mostly homeless. Sometimes  squatting in abandonded houses, and during winter times(this was in Michigan), my dad put on a suit and tie and  would rent an office in a run down office building for the winter to keep us out of the cold. We'd sleep in offices while he cooked up another business plan that would eventually fail. Oh yeah, and I gained back the 100 pounds that I lost during this time, plus another 100 pounds for good measure.  In the summer of 2007, my dad convinced his mother to give control of her business, a well established local pet store, over to him.  We'd live in the back of the store. My dad did a lot of ""renovating"" of the store, but in reality was inflating the costs of the renovation and taking out loanss and skimming cash off the top.  By October 2008, this store of 40 years was out of business and all the employees were out of a job, and we were homeless again.  

So what did my dad do? Did he get a job? Nope.
 He put on a suit and tie, went to another run down office building, and rented out an office for $350 bucks a month for some new bullshit business for the next year. I went with him, because I had no where else to go. 
In the middle of winter 2009, his office building was set to be demolished so it could be turned into a parking lot for the new YMCA, so we were once again homeless. My sister begged her boyfriend to let us move in with him. He hated my father. But he eventually let us move in, but only for a few months. 

My dad ended up concocting a new plan while we were there. He decided that we should both go to college together and becoming nurses.. I was now 20 years old. He's in his 50s. At this point,  I  only have 2 years of elementary school under my belt.

He decides to make up some fake  trans scripts and a diploma for me, and has me apply for college out in Arizona, and of course apply for loans and grants.  
The community college there is incredibly cheap, and we'd end up getting a few thousand dollars in refunds back from loans and grants each semester, so it would pay for us to live and survive. He also faked some records so I could get in state tuition.

So we move out to Arizona, and now I'm in community college, totally unprepared, and every semester, further indebting myself for another one of my dad's schemes.  We do this for 3 years and I fake my way through college, really going nowhere. My dad encourages me to just take a bunch of classes to figure out what I want to do with my life, as long as I stay in full time so I can keep getting money to pay him for rent. My dad also has not taught me how to drive. Now I realize that he did this to keep me dependant on him. 

While this is happening, my sister loses her job and has a mental breakdown, tries to kill herself, and is hospitalized for awhile. She ends up getting on disability for her mental illnesses and is still on disability today.
 She is worried about me, and comes out to visit me in Arizona. She eventually helps me by buying me a car. I take the car, and teach myself to drive, against my dad's wishes (at this point, I'm 23, she's 25). Within a month of having my drivers license, my sister convinces me to move back in with her and leave my dad in Arizona. Now I see my dad cry for the first time ever. He's begging me not to abandon him. I almost decided to stay, but my sister begged me to move back to Michigan with her. So we did. 

Immediately after we left, my dad stops paying the bills(which are all in my name by the way, I did not know this, and this ends up ruining my credit). And he moves into his car.  

Within a month of living with my sister in Indiana, I have a job. Another month and I make some friends at work, and a month later I move in with 3 of them and we all share a house. This is by far, the best part of my life. I smoked weed for the first time with my new friends, and it was transcendent. I was having a great time. I'm working full time, 40-50 hours a week (just at walmart, but I actually loved my job). Every few days, I get emails from my dad, telling me how miserable he is living in his car, and how dangerous it is for him to live there. 

After 8 months of this, life is going great for me. And my dad shows up at my house in Michigan. He gives me a sob story and convinces me to let him live with me, in my bedroom.  He mentions that he wants to kill himself all the time. I reluctantly let him move in with me, but tell him he can only stay for a month, and he needs to go to the homeless shelter. 

Over the next month, he hates that I'm working full time. Its the holidays and I'm really busy at work. He resents that I'm working and I'm self sufficient. He sleeps all day while I'm at work and stays up all night in my bedroom on the internet watching movies and videos while I'm trying to sleep. My performance at work starts suffering... 


I end up getting injured and losing my job at walmart. I was clumsy because I was sleep deprived.  My dad seemed happy that I lost my job... I ended up telling him to leave. I can't handle it anymore. He moves out into the homeless shelter. He's furious at me. 

I decide to go back to college. I finally found a career that I think I want. I want to be a paramedic.  I go down to the local community college and sign up. I take out loans and grants to support myself.  A few weeks later I show up for my first class. 

Guess who's sitting in the front row? 

Yep. My dad. He wants to be a paramedic now too. 

This was a miserable semester. It was so fucking embarrasing to be in the class with my dad. I end up passing the EMT portion of the class, the first semester, and I drop out of the paramedic training. I just don't want to be around my dad.  

Around summer of 2014, my dad asks me for help cleaning out his storage room. I reluctantly oblige and help him.  I noticed something in the corner of the storage room. Its a locked aluminum box. I've  seen it before many times, and always wondered what was in it.   While he's doing something in his van, I check out the box, Its actually unlocked, so I open it. Inside.... is hundreds of  pictures, a few hard drives, KY jelly, tissues, and... my sister's underwear.  I slam it closed, and walk out of the storage room and take off. I left my dad without any explaination. Later that night I felt a horrible pain in my chest. I think I'm dying. I can't breathe. I can barely move. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. There is crushing pain in the center of my chest and radiating up my face and down my arms. I'm sweating, I'm numb, and cold.  I stumble outside and call 911.  I tell them I'm dying. I'm having a heart attack. I'm only 24 years old.

After being in the hospital for 2 days, and undergoing cardiac stress tests and ultrasounds and everything, they diagnose me with panic disorder. It was just a panic attack. That's what a panic attack is? I had no idea. This felt real. It couldn't just be in my head, could it?  

Over the course of the next few months, I have these same events 3-4 times per day. I feel like I am absolutely, 100% dying, multiple times per day. My dad is now an EMT with the local ambulance service. If I call 911 again, he might be the one showing up  at my door.

It takes a few months, but I eventually break down and tell my sister what happened. I tell her what I found 10 years ago, and what I found 10 years later in his storage room. My psyche was not letting me hide this anymore. My sister felt terrible for me, and told me that she knew something was wrong with my dad. She told me he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14, and tried to get her naked multiple times.

She decided to confront him. I couldn't bare to look him in the face. I was a coward. I couldn't look at him. I left her to confront this predator alone. 

She tells me that he told her that he admitted it. He said that he likes incest. He told me he'd get counselling for it.  My sister and I decided to cut off contact with him. This was in 2015, and I haven't talked to him since. He's emailed me a few times and told me he got concelling for it and is better now. He told me the consellor said that being attracted to his daughter was normal, and was understandable because the pain he went through with the divorce (???? bullshit).

Anyways, after all of this, it basically destroyed me. I couldn't work. I was having panic attacks every day. My sister convinced me to apply for disability. I did, but it would take 2 years for me to get it.

We both had no where to go. We felt unsafe sharing the town with my dad.  We decided to move to the woods in the middle of the country. We found a place that sold empty property with no money down, and we got 5 acres out in the middle of the woods. My sister and I lived there for 2 years while we waited for me to get disability. I needed it. I was agoraphobic(still kinda am), and I needed to heal and be away from people. 

Once I got disability, my sister wanted to move back to live with one of her friends in Indiana. I applied for public housing in the local town closest to me in Missouri. I was approved and have an apartment waiting for me.

For the first time, at 28 years old, I'll be living by myself. Rent and utilities is 30% of my disability check.  After rent, I'll have $500 to spend per month. After other bills(phone/car insurance), I'll have $400 per month.

I also will be getting a check for $13,750 in back pay in September of 2018.

So here is my situation: I'm in the middle of the country, alone, no job, no friends, no family, no high school diploma, 550 pounds, and on disability. 

I do not want to stay on disability forever, but I'm not sure where to start building a life. I am very alone, and I've never been completely alone before. I'm scared, and could use advice.

Thanks, and sorry for the long post and if it was rambling and confusing.",25Jan2018,76

75,"Hi all, I'm currently a college student trying to decide on college plans, and I have to make a decision real soon. Today, I was suddenly offered a summer internship position to do research at the NIH over the summer. Let's call this internship A. Meanwhile, I have an interview on Friday for another position at the NIH - let's call this internship B. 

Internship A requires a commitment of 12 weeks, which is slightly long for my tastes. It's almost double the travel time, and I would need to bring a car to the area. My parents are willing to let me bring a car, but we only have 2 cars, meaning that they'd be stuck with 1 for 12 weeks. A is giving me a deadline of Monday to accept.

Meanwhile, I have an interview with B on Friday. I interviewed with B last year, and although they ended up giving the position to a senior, the PI called me and said they seriously considered me and wanted me to apply again next year if interested. Last Fall, she contacted me asking to apply, and I'm set to interview again. This internship is a lot closer and is in a better location, IMO. I think it would be around 10 weeks, which is what I'm looking for. 

I really don't think I'll hear back from B before the deadline for A. I don't want to accept A and then renege, so I'm super conflicted. Could anyone lend some advice? Thanks so much!",25Jan2018,1

I'm crying as I type this, but I need advice. I have a really bad step dad. As a kid, he was EXTREMELY physical with me. He spanked me a lot and gave me bruises twice, and even pushed my head against the wall when I was 8 for not doing my homework. He also pushed me in the corner of the fence and threw my shoes at me as hard as he could if I left them outside.....Oh, and when I was 13, he hit my knee as hard as he could with a 2x4. For cussing at him. It swelled my knee up too. (Definitely shouldn't have cussed at him, I was being an asshole but he had no reason to get physical like that) I'm telling you this because you guys need to know he was horrible. He did other bad stuff too, and I have PTSD from it....

Anyway, I'm currently 17, I have a girlfriend, and I graduate this May. But I take a lot of medication because of my depression and anxiety. But to get to the point, my stepdad wants to remove my lock on my door. I don't understand that though, because, I'M A 17 YEAR OLD BOY WHO MASTURBATES. And I finally got frustrated and told him that. But he says, ""Just do it late at night or in the shower, you're a child and you don't deserve your own privacy."" At that point I lost it, and started screaming at him. It was a lot of built up emotion. I'll go into more detail if you guys are interested, but I don't know what to do. I want my privacy. He NEVER knocks on my door, just barges in if I keep it unlocked. I don't want him, or anyone, walking in on me masturbate or if I'm getting dressed or naked. I feel like I deserve privacy.

The idea of going to the gym frightens me as I struggle with social anxiety and i’m not sure that i can afford a membership.

My parents want me to go to college, and for good reasons. I have a discount of 50% at the local university (which is a really good one), I've been doing PSEO and have racked up quite a bit of credit (which, with the discount, would get me through college at about 25% of what the price would normally be), and this particular college is known nationally for being good at teaching my ""dream job"" (not *my* dreeam job, just the one everyone assumes is my dream job).


I on the other hand really don't want to go to college, again, for good reasons. I have my business plan all written up (~100 Pages of detail from who to order from and when to sell, to optimal pricing and website design (estimated yearly profit is about 100k-350k)), I have the money needed to start, and I have the skills needed. I also want to point out that I'm currently a Junior (HS) and have an ok job (~$13/hr).


The only thing stopping me from doing this is my parents wanting me to go through college and get a degree. I just don't want to waste four years of my life for something that will probably be useless in the long run.

I signed up for obamacare/medicare back in may before I had my job and in december I signed up again on the 15th with my new work details for what I assume is 2018 coverage. When I was jobless I had this terrible ear infection so I was doing everything I could to get a doctor to see me so I got approved for a free clinic and I assume ths does not in any way count. Aside from that both applications say ""state agency to contact you"" and I have not been contacted at all. 

I claim nothing/no one on my tax forms and looking around I saw some sites say I might not even have to file taxes if I made under $10,000. So my question is what the hell do I do? I plan to file taxes and I know there's probably a tax return for me but I'm wondering how much and if I will be penalized for not having health insurance despite filling out an application for medicare and never receiving a response and if this tax return will cover that penalty which I hear is a whopping $625.

Goddamn fuck america, honestly. Sure is a incentive to work for a living rather than collecting welfare huh?

Also how in the fuck do I get health care? What is even the process because I am most definitely confused. I went through healthcare.gov and seemingly nothing came of it. 

I've since filled out a tax return and so far it seems like I may not be penalized but who knows. Regardless it looks like my tax return should cover my penalty if I have to pay one.

I've already applied to all the colleges I need to, but I'm nervous. I'm definitely not ready to leave my home state yet, so that only leaves me with a couple college options within driving distance. I figure if I go to school within driving distance I might as well just live with my parents during that time.

But I've just gotten an opportunity to buy a tiny little house in a tiny little town right in between my home town and the city I'd probably go to college in. Me and my girlfriend would live there together as roommates. The house is only half and hour away from my parent's place.

The place just looks like a kinda old house on the outside, but whoever lived there before completely renovated the inside and it's absolutely gorgeous on the inside. Just about our dream home.

The house costs $43,500. Monthly mortgage on a 15-year loan would be $300 or under.
Two people working minimum wage in my state working 20 hours weekly make $13,400 a year combined.
$300 a month is $3600 a year. I don't really know how much utilities cost.

Is that enough to live comfortably on? I figure we would be working more hours than that anyway since I won't be in high school anymore by the time everything's settled. Everything would be in my girlfriend's name, I would just be living there and paying bills. There are no options to rent in my area.

I would love to get an accounting degree later, but I'm really not ready to commit to a college. I know that should mean I'm obviously not ready to commit to a house, but I have to choose one, haha.

The tough decision is whether or not to pursue my passion in college. At the beginning of high school I took up a new sort because soccer was getting a little to competitive and I sucked at it. My least favorite thing about my middle school sport was the running. Dear lord there is nothing I hate more on this planet than running. So naturally when picking a new sport I went for the only one that didn’t have any running. That’s how I started as a swimmer. Now my team is pretty wide spread in terms of skill. You have people who have swam their whole lives and are crazy stupid fast (kid who goes 48.9 in 100 yrd fly for you swimmers out there) all the way down to people who can barely swim let alone race. Now I’ve been doing this for 3 years now and honestly it’s become the greatest passion of my whole life. I also have history in drama and performing arts which previously held that spot but now doesn’t hold a candle to swimming. Swimming is also super important to my health. My entire life I’ve been overweight and never in a good shape. Even when I started swimming it high school not much changed. It wasn’t until the beginning of this season that I decided “Fuck being fat.” Swimming is the driving force behind my weight loss and while I’d like to say I’ve completely transformed my body, I still am very much in the middle of this process. So my times aren’t great, I am a pretty average swimmer in general and on my team pretty below average. The problem is I care so much about the sport that I want to do it in college. I’ve talked to a division three college with a small team and they seemed open minded enough, but I’m worried I’m not even close to college swimming standards. I’m torn because I care so much but I don’t know if I can do this. Thanks for any advice.",25Jan2018,2

I have no one to go to for good advice so that's why I'm posting here.

When I'm at work people tell me I look sad or too serious. I consciously am not aware that I look that way because i don't feel that way, and I am not intentionally making my face look like that. I look a lot younger than I am, and because of that people treat me like a kid. I'm not really good with making jokes or making people laugh so people tend to just stay away from me. I do have a bit of an anger and anxiety issue and I think i might have severe depression. I feel like get upset for real reasons though, and I catch myself if I get upset for something minor. An example would be, is if I see my coworkers literally doing nothing all day when there is stuff to do, which puts more workload on my other coworkers and I. And my manager doesn't give a shit either so it makes each day a little harder to deal with. This type of stuff gets me really upset. I've had a tough upbringing so sometimes I have trust issues with people. I can be very blunt or just very honest sometimes too when i feel like i need to be. Life shows me that I should lie sometimes but I don't want to, because I believe being an honest and forward person is more respectable. But most of the time it seems that honesty is not generally accepted.

I feel like all this stuff is adding up to create a horrible social life for me. I believe my perception of life is normal, my behavior might not always be, and there is usually a reason for it but I feel like everyone that gets to know me learns to hate or dislike me.

She's 18 now, so she can make her own doctor's appointment, and get her own prescriptions(I think? I'm not well versed on how adult life works). What kind of price would an appointment with her/a doctor be? And if the doctor deems that she needs antidepressants, what kind price would that be? Unfortunately she wants as little connection to her parents here, so hopefully getting medicine doesn't break the bank(she does have a job with lots of hours for her to work). What can she do?

103,"We work 5 days a week. They gave us 2 reflective shirts to wear and my boss expects us to wear them every single day. So either we are wearing dirty clothes or washing laundry every 2 days..


In my province (CANADA) if they require a uniform they are also required to either clean them or pay us for the cleaning. None of which is happening (i have raised similar issues in the past to my boss and he just says “suuuuure linzers”). Pisses me off to no end.


I asked a few people. Some guys havent washed theirs in weeks. Others wash them every 2 days. I hate even wearing them at all because they make me too hot.

104,I don't know how he got them but one of my friends that I'll call Mario who has nudes of another friend I'll call Daisy. See Daisy dated another friend Luigi and it kinda created a shift since they acted different and Mario didn't like Daisy so I basically fractured the group. Well now Daisy and Luigi aren't dating but because of a fight I now just have two different friend groups. This changed when I found out that Mario some how got nudes of Daisy. I never got along with Dasiy that much but this Is really messed up. I asked my friend Toad what should we do and we both agreed that we should either tell Daisy and/or Luigi. I'm not gonna hang out with Mario any more and I don't live near them or else I might have just told the cops or Mario's mom or something. I guess I'm just wondering if I'm doing the right thing or is there more I could do? (Also yes the Mario thing and no not a troll just easier than coming up with names.),25Jan2018,3

They were willing to give me money for rent in exchange for my ""company"" but I'm scared. How will I live with myself after? I have a job interview soon but that's not guaranteed and it won't be in time for me to pay rent and bills. The last time I ended up in a similar situation was when I was a teenager, planning on killing myself with pills and I traded my body for free pills. I avoid thinking about that but I've been able to move past it, keeping it as a dark secret. I'm not attracted to this person in that way but I've read that people who find sugar daddies just focus on certain aspects they like about that person instead of the things they find unattractive. What can I do to make money quickly? Or should I take this as an opportunity to cover my bills once and try to move past it after?

110,"M16 I feel like shit, I’m not depressed (I don’t self diagnose and I rarely feel sad). When I say I feel like shit, it’s because I can’t explain well how I feel, mostly because I feel little even though I know I should feel more. This causes my head spin at times. I don’t think my brain is right, I barely show emotion, I’ve rarely felt angry, sad, or happy, but I know I have some emotion, I laugh a lot but not because things are funny or happy. I have been more social, family members were worried I was acting too strange.

Some what recently I have discovered over things about myself, and one thing makes me truly feel unlucky. I have an attraction to little girls, I don’t know why, all I know is that they’re too young. I’ve never acted on this, and I don’t want to, plus I don’t like little girls the way a normal person likes adult women, I still like adult women, so I know (no I have never been abused in any way).

Recently some things happened and my mom said she would send me to military school (I’m pretty sure I was barely able to get out of that one by acting more caring). The reason was my very strange behavior which I was easily able to change, also certain “fantasies” I had which they figured out. (no this has nothing to do with pedo or sex).  The worst part is that when they confronted me on this I probably should had cried or showed some kind of negative emotion, but I tried to hold in laughter,  I guess I have no other response, I haven’t even cried in about three years, but I can barely remember anything before 12. Anyways I see laughing as something lucky for me, usually it is a response to some kind of shock or discomfort, but I doubt that for me since I have laughed randomly for no reason.

My parents offered me therapy so I rejected, I doubt it will help, and I don’t believe in free will. I guess my brains just fucked up somehow. At least I function fine and am getting better at blending into my social surroundings. I believe I have certain good things going for me, I don’t want to waste it all.

Since this is advice, what the hell should I do? Sometimes would be fine killing myself, but there’s just as many reasons to live as to die. Should I accept the therapy?",25Jan2018,1

My mother lives in Virginia with my little sister so I got a hotel room for us to stay in while we are here because I don't want her to be in the apartment where my mother died. I guess I just have questions about what things am I responsible for, what do I need to handle, and honestly, tips for raising a teenager. I feel like I have so many things running through my mind. I have spoken with local police and called the funeral home but what else do I do? How do I make the best decisions to take care of my sister? What do I need to prove guardianship and get her into school where I live? (Alabama) Is there programs for assistance financially for situations like this? Am I responsible for the medical bills and debts my mother owes? How do I handle getting money from her accounts? How do I turn things of,  like power, water, cable? How can I afford to raise my sister? Should I put her in therapy?  What kind of things am I forgetting to take care of?

112,"Hey folks,

I'll try to keep this short, I'm the general manager of a radio station for my university. Our website went down because the previous GM didn't tell me a bunch of things, and we didnt pay our web host for the new year. I paid them, got our website back, and thought that was the end of it. Turns out, I had to pay for the hosting AND the domain name, which lapsed in October of 2017, without my knowledge. Some random dude in North Carolina now has our domain and is squatting on it, there's nothing there, he just has our domain. 

We've had that domain and url since 2003, and it's on all of our promotional media and tied into multiple accounts. I'm basically fucked due to my predecessor not telling me how to do anything, so I had to play a ton of shit by ear. 

I tried contacting the guy who has our domain but he hasn't responded. Do I have a legal leg to stand on here? He's definitely squatting on our url. And we definitely fucked up by letting the domain lapse so I know its not really illegal for him to have our website url, but its definitely a dick move! We kind of need it back, or a ton of promotional media (roughly 1000 stickers etc) are unusable.

She stopped and looked at me and I said sorry in a soft tone of voice. She didn't say anything and kept discussing the scaffolding sheet for a few minutes before she got up and spoke to another student in the class.

Would she know that it was accidental? Could she think that the touch was deliberate? I feel so embarrassed  since this has happened. I don't what specific advice I'm asking for, but how can I not still feel embarrassed about this the next time I see this teacher?",25Jan2018,0
116,"So back in August, I moved away from home to a popular college town to attend school. I got my own apartment with a few other roommates in a student apartment type situation. My bills included, rent, car payment, car insurance, groceries, toiletries, and pocket money. All together, my bills totaled $1200 a month. I worked as a server as a causal family dinning restaurant and didn’t make as much as i did at my  previous location. (Transferred Restaurants) Since August, my pockets have always been tight because of the lack of money I was making. It was almost hard to get a second job while trying to balance school and have the other job work around my first job and my school schedule. Every month I was calling family members for money to help me with rent, and other bills. Eventually, i fell behind in bills. Back in December, I took off for three weeks and went home for break. I worked at my previous store while on break to keep income coming and I was nearly happy to get back to earning the money I used to earn which is way more than I make at my current store. Anyways, I come back in the beginning of January from my break only to find out that my job had new management. They weren’t complying with my crazy new school schedule so they fired me. It’s been three weeks since I’ve had a job. I currently have $18 left in my account and rent is due no later than the third of February and I have no one that can pay my rent for me. Loans and etc are out of the question because my credit is poor/fair due to my constant late car payments and late credit card bills. I’m having a hard time finding a job that pays decent money and give good hours and once again, my school schedule is crazy so doing two jobs is nearly impossible.

117,"I was in a sexual relationship with my teacher when I was 16. By the time I turned 17 (2015) we had decided to start secretly dating. Its a serious wonder how we didnt get caught but thats beside the point. The romantic relationship continued until i turned 20 because I broke up with him.

Over the course of our relationship, he had cheated on me with a girl who graduated the year before me, during the entirety of my senior year. When i graduated their relationship ended. I found out about it 6 months after the fact, and didnt leave because essentially i had nowhere else to go. 

He had also revealed himself to be a VERY good liar, manipulator, and a gas lighter. After I found out about the cheating thing, about six months after i graduated, i realize now he began slowly changing the dates of certain events. Like when we decided we would date (i dont pay attention to or celebrate such things, which i had explained very early on), which year i had hung out with my friend on a specific event, and other important landmarks in time. 

After my car broke down (like a year after i had graduated) my life became very isolating. He wouldnt let me drive his car to see friends or even go 3 minutes down the road to get cigarettes. He began bringing up how expensive it was to drive when I suggested he take me to my friends, even though he drove a very new and fuel efficient car. There were months at a time where the only people i saw were him, my coworkers, and his friend. When my car broke down i had to wait to get a job until it would be convenient for him to take me to work, so i would only see him for months at a time and his friend. 

(I did have a job i walked to for a period of time, but my manager would verbally berate me infront of coworkers and customers so I quit. I didnt get a job anywhere else in town in fear of running into her. It also doesn't help that i have severe anxiety, long term depression and bipolar disorder. I dont get mad like some but i do get very depressed and frequently irritable. I was mostly off my medication but i did take it for a couple months here and there. I didnt notice a difference but i was very numb regarding him and the situation except when i broke down about the cheating.)

So after that incident I didnt have a job until shortly before i broke up with him.

After all this and the date changing, he actually convinced me that i had cheated on him in the beginning of our relationship. I had made out and heavy petted with a guy a during the 4th of july weekend in 2015 when i went to celebrate with my bestfriend. He had convinced me it happened a year after it actually did, and that we had started dating in april when it was actually august/september. So when I DID realize the years were off, he just pointed out that april is before july. Then he made me go into detail about what had happened between us.

He knew about the event for months, he began snooping through my phone as soon as i moved in. And he never brought it up. When i asked him why he never brought it up, he said that ""I had already forgiven you for it. If i can forgive you for cheating why cant you forgive me"". Him cheating severely damaged the relationship and i would break down randomly over it. 

He had also started very intense screaming arguments over weird things. The strangest thing was that I ""wasnt talking in a happy tone"" when I was gently telling him that i felt emotionally neglected. It lasted for 5 hours. 

If I was crying over anything, he would look at me with a blank face and go back to his game. Then if I brought that up, it started another argument that lasted a couple hours. 

My thing is here, is that we broke up 4 and a half months ago. I realized the extent of his manipulation only a few days ago. 

Up until this point, I had thought that we both did ugly things (cheating), and that this was just the sad attempt of a relationship doomed to fail. I now see (after the confirming of dates of very close friends i trusted with my secret relationship) that it was doomed to fail because he had been lying to, isolating, manipulating, and emotionally neglecting me. 

My issue here is that if I dont know if I should report him to the school board or not. He had that relationship with the former student, but she was dating someone else at the time too, so im not sure it was grooming. Im also not sure if he was grooming me because im the one who actually initiated everything. But im aware his behavior is dangerous. I had lost 2 years of my life to him and I do genuinely fear for it happening to another student. He once admitted that he saw highschool as his social life.

I also am scared of what will happen if he gets caught. Will he try to kill himself? I dont think i could forgive myself if someone did that because of me.

 I also dont know what i would have to deal with if i came clean about it. It could very easily be proven true. I met his friends and family while i was still in school, and once a student literally saw us together. Someone did call and report that he was in a relationship with a student but no investigation was made, though he was under heavy suspicion.

Just, everything is so emotional. I put the pathetic in empathetic. I feel the severity of the consequences if I tell, i feel dread knowing how his life would change. But i cant let go of how sneaky and manipulative he is. I cant say that he will get with a third student but i cant say that he won't either, or that he hasnt already.

I dont know what to do. So much is wrong with him but Im not sure if its moralistically right to tell the board. I cant look at it objectively, the whole thing is so overwhelmimg i can barely think straight. 

He also has a history of doing horrible things. He used to be an opiod addict, he once drove a disabled person to see their parents (his job at the time) while on acid,  and he stole over $1000 from another place he worked at. He got it expunged from his record while representing himself, if that goes to show how well he does in defending himself.

I just dont know if I should report him or not. Like I said he would DEFINITELY be caught, but its too emotionally overwhelming for me to figure out.

I am 16 years of age and have taken up cannabis usage, I do not smoke (have in the past don't like it at all) but I eat edibles at rather low dosages (such as 3-5 mg thc).

At first I truly just wanted alprazolam and adderall because they seemed as if they would help my anxiety and concentration but then I realized they were just as bad for the brain.

It caught me completely by surprise, especially because the reason given was that I didn't know enough. Now, there was no training, no performance reviews, no talks of critisism (positive or negative) throughout my employment. The document I was given even said that the company had spoken to me about this once before, but they never had.

There never seemed to be a problem to me, I could do nearly every aspect of the job without assistance except for a few things that I had not come across yet.

Graduated a couple years ago, managed to get a decent paying but soul crushing job. Some stuff happened with the main organization I volunteered for and that basically shattered my image of it, so I quit volunteering there.

The city I lived in was just bad in general and I feel pretty jaded about people after living there.

Saved a bunch of money from my job, quit, traveled for a few months, went back to the city I had been living in. Things were even worse after I went back.

I actually managed to get a New Zealand visa before I left the first time and since there was nothing tying me down in the US, New Zealand is where I am now but I don't want to live here permanently.

Now I don't really know what I want to do. I had thought about moving to Minneapolis but I hate winter, and it's somewhat similar to the city I had been living in. 

I've also thought about moving to Puerto Rico but a large part of the reason I'm not going back to my old city is because of all the crime and poverty-related chaos.

I just enrolled in college and declared my major for writing and literature with hopes of being an english teacher / counselor, and help at risk youth, addicts, students, through a potential major in sociology. I know I want to humble myself and preach about appreciation and be that cool role model that can inspire people to learn and be self aware.

BUT, i need/got a reality check. Is teaching, especially english, a decent way to make a living? Is it safe from the shadow of automation? More and more kids don't read and learn through khan academy and stay glued to their phones... I also think about the political climate and the tension in the world. God forbid something happens that'll make me have to move from the US (not that its all that great anyways), what does an english teaching degree help me do, can I survive in a global market? 

I'm tech savy, loved programming in high school and I was proficient in math. I'm helping my little brother build an arcade machine with rasberry pi. 

I'm torn between choosing to teach or learn mechanical engineering (or something like that) and risk it not being the thing that makes me happy...or I will cave under the pressure and not succeed or not find a job (same fear I have for english). I also fear that writing is too daunting for me and takes a lot of blind faith that someone impoverished as I can't afford (i also think I can always be the self taugh motivated writer right?)

I am unsure of what to study and would appreciate some guidance. It's taken a long time to actually follow through with enrolling after being in remission. And fear of having a short life has made it hard for me to progress. I just want some advice on what I should to or any advice, so I can use the newfound strength and resolve inside of me and invest in a future, rather than let the fear of my mortality prevent me from even trying..... and losing the most valuable thing -- time.

I met this girl more than two years ago, we became very very close. We were basically dating even though we never made it official. I loved her and she loved me, it has been said numerous times. 

We work in the same building so i picked everyday and we went to work together. We had a few minor arguments but nothing serious and was always solved within a day maximum. Our minds were properly in sync.

A little over a month ago, conversations withered down to almost nothing, any text i sent was replied to with a ""ok"" or ""no"" or just flat out ignored. Her birthday came up in early January and she invited me to her party a week before that, when i got to the place i called her and she ignored me, i watched her screen my call. when i went to wish her a happy birthday her and her group of girlfriends decided they were going home and that was that.

She has shut me out of her life completely. When i ask her what is going on she said ""(My name) I cannot do this I'm sorry, i cannot explain anything to you or anyone"" Then on Instagram and snapchat it is like there is absolutely nothing going on. 

When i asked her if there is an end in sight to this or will it be like this from now on she replied with ""I am not sure""

I am confused beyond belief, she has been a part of my life everyday for the past two years, and now nothing.

A lot happened, my brother wanted to move in a year ago (he's 20). He hates the city, has strong ideals about countryside and small towns. I was able to relate and I tried to help him out. I'm 24 years old. I'm trying to ask if I could of handled it differently?? If I'm the asshole, I try to be honest but we're all a little biased. How responsible should one be for our younger siblings??? If even at all??

I got out of my families drama storm in San Diego and purchased a decent trailer for myself, parked it on my father's property in a different county and started helping his business.

--setting the scene--
My brother needed help and I decided to split my already limited trailer space to help him get on his feet. He's got a job and a car so there's no real reason for him to stick around, he's got an income. He's supposedly been saving money this whole time for a better car. I didn't think it was a big deal.

--meat of the issue- a year of living together--
So I've been listening to some controversial Media. In our limited space, he greatly disagrees. It's hard to avoid conflict of opinions when we're within arms length and earshot at all times.. so he wants me to turn off my YouTube  video, I can turn it down but I won't  turn it off. I can tell whenever I pinched a nerve because his face gets all red and his voice gets shakey. 
I say- ""This is my home, I can listen to whatever I want"" 
He says- ""But I live here too!""
I say- ""this is my home, I'm just helping you out because we're brothers, if you don't like it than leave""
He says- ""I saw that coming""
I say- ""you should have seen it coming""

he's always arguing about how I'm too logical, I don't understand human emotions which is certainly not true. While he Ignores any logical conclusion with an emotional appeal. Doesn't like my logic, doesn't like my pot plants, doesn't like my opinion of people. he's ironically racist, doesn't like that I'm white, doesn't like white people. And talks to me like I'm some kinda evil warlord conqueror (half brothers), doesn't do any chores. Doesn't like the way I talk, says he doesn't take me seriously. Sense I'm not his older sister's blood sibling: he says I'm not an uncle of her new baby, then corrects himself to say I'd be little more than one of many common street uncles.. 

In his defense, I often say things like fuck feelings, I go by logic. I've said ""fuck your feelings"", I've said fuck you or ""well fuck you too"", ""fuck friends"" but I've never actually directly called him anything more than ""emotional"", or ""don't be a butt"". I apparently talk to much.. to myself. I refuse to turn off my videos, but I'll turn them down if asked. Etc..",25Jan2018,1
128,"I was recently hired for a new job in a totally new industry and a type of job I've never really had before. It fulfills so many  of the things I've been looking for in a job. I start a month from now and I'm mostly excited, buuuuut...

I also have a lot of worries, because it's a pretty big career change for me. I keep worrying that I won't be good at it. That I will be super socially awkward with new coworkers (I'm pretty shy/anxious in these situations). That I finally got a chance at something I am really interested in doing and I'll mess it up somehow. That I'll actually end up hating it more than i expected. 

So my question is...How do you deal with the anxieties of starting a new job? How do you make a good impression off the bat? And if you've ever made a big career change, did you deal with any imposter syndrome? What did you do to overcome it?",25Jan2018,1
129,"Let me give background on myself. I'm socially awkward and a bit too rambunctious and am totally fine being on my own. However, having experienced bad friendships, I also feel like dealing with those type of relationships. 

I am a part of a sports club at school. We're not official, so anyone can join with or without experience. I've been on the team for a year now and have enjoyed watching myself improve in skill and confidence. I enjoy playing, despite being the weakest link on the team (can't run, can't catch a ball, can't throw well either). 
However, the friends I made either all left or have pushed me out for the newer, and admittedly, more interesting team members. While there are teammates who are friendly to me and will chat with me if I run into them, for the most part, I feel pushed to the outside and almost completely ignored. 

I didn't care about this for a while and brushed it off, but when my friends saw how the team didn't really interact with me during an event, they become more angry about it than me. Now I can't help but wonder what I should do. 

Should I stay in a sport I enjoy, put a lot of energy and time in, keeps me exercising, and allows me to escape from my major for a few hours or should I use my time elsewhere and start over with a small chance I might ""fit in""? ",25Jan2018,1
131,"I want to be in control of my emotions - anger, anxiety and depression.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to learn how to be confident in my presence, my reaction and my words. I want to be strong, yet calm.

&amp;nbsp;

This is mainly in reference to dealing with angry people. I look at the characteristics in the previous paragraph as wise and proper, and I want to learn that.

&amp;nbsp;

One difficulty is that many times people are angry when driving, so I get no chance to defend myself, and due to past experiences of not stnading up for myself I get angry and depressed.

&amp;nbsp;

Another is that I lack social skills to make and maintain friends. This makes me feel 'less' than others and so it feels fake to act strong or confident and defend myself (I give in to their abuse).

I am lost, what can I do?",25Jan2018,1
133,"TLDR: Girlfriend left me about 2 months ago for my best friend after 3 years of relationship.

So I’m just gonna share my story with my now ex-gf in hope to vent a little and hopefully get some advice on what to do in future relationships. It will be a heavy wall of text, hopefully some of you will read it all.

I was a med student. 19 years old, never had a relationship before. One day I met this girl at a hospital and never really made a move for a while even tough I liked her.  Eventually, we kicked it off and started dating.  She was really really into me, and I was into her too. Now, I don’t consider myself to be a very attractive guy (around a 7/10?) and she was about a 6 too. I really liked her personality and most of her traits, but never really liked too much that she was a bit overweight and her teeth we yellowed because of smoking (she had already quit smoking by the time she met me).  We dated for about 5 months before I eventually asked her to be my girlfriend. 

Now, I never was one to confront anyone about pretty much anything. She knew I never had anything with anyone and she eventually told me that pretty much all her past relationships (3) were some kind of abusive, and she cheated on her last bf because the relationship was falling apart and he treated her very badly. I accepted this and moved on, since I really only cared about her life from the point she knew me and on, not really about her past. Her family was a dysfunctional one: her father was an alcoholic, her mother yelled a lot, and her brothers pretty much did anything they wanted without any consequence, leaving her with much of the guilt and responsibility. My family wasn’t as easy too, my parents were very overprotective and I was really filled with insecurities and doubts.

Nevertheless, the first 1 and a half years of the relationship were amazing. We went to classes together, we talked a lot, we went out, all our friends loved us, she really liked my band (I’m a musician) and I loved going out with her to take pictures (she is a photographer).  I was always for her, always listened to her, and loved to please every one of her desires.  Her family was crumbling apart, there wasn’t a single day were her parents wouldn’t fight and make a mess, and it really made her life a living hell. She would constantly say that she loved me, that I was the only thing keeping her alive, that her life changed for the best when she knew me.  And I deep inside always knew and feel the same about her. Sure, some times I wasn’t as attracted to her as always, but who cares about one’s lover body anyway? You can always lose weight, cut/dye your hair, get better clothes, etc. It wasn’t important to me, because when I saw the way her eyes light up when she looked at me, I knew inside my heart that I was madly in love for her.

Eventually, college started to get hard.  She was a bit behind me on classes, so I always had a bit of a bigger workload than her.  This is when she started to get clingy, because I sometimes didn’t really had the time to be texting her almost 24/7, or calling her for long hours. We were both med students, and I think pretty much anyone knows that the workload can be sometimes exhausting.  We were always communicating, but sometimes not really in a healthy way for me. I always knew her life was worse than mine, so I just didn’t bothered her with my issues, because I always knew hers were worse and she needed me to vent and have a shoulder to cry on.  To top it all, I was really insecure and afraid of commitment, so it took me about 1 year in the relationship to be ready to have sex with her, and she waited for me as long as I needed, even if it was hard for her. I remember the first time we did it I was afraid I got her pregnant and basically did not touched her for 3 long weeks until he got her period.  I was stupid, I know, but didn’t really felt good and was very afraid, as a med student one really knows how easy is to get pregnant you know.

Eventually, I started to get a bit tired of her neediness, and started distancing myself a bit. Nothing much, but I really could not be texting to her how much I love her or how much I missed her every hour like she did with me, even if I did, because my time was getting shorter and shorter.  By the time I was almost 24/7 inside a hospital, she had to put college on hold for about a year because reasons, and I mostly supported her as mush as I could.  She would never really understand the workload I had from this point on, because hers was always lighter than mine.  In contrast, her family was getting worse by the days, and she really needed me for emotional and sometimes economic support, and I mostly gave it to her the best I could. One semester, she had to travel to a rural area to serve some kind of social work, about 3 hours apart from me.  I remember that we cried a lot, she because she didn’t wanted to go but absolutely had to, and me because I hated seeing her so unhappy. I managed to make room on my scheduled to go visit her for 1 weekend, even if it costed me one call on the hospital and the subsequent pain in the ass for the rest of the semester.  In the end, the distance from her house was really good for her, and she meet some amazing people and got to have some needed good company. 

When she came back after 6 months (march 2017), our relationship suffered a bit from the distance, but now too much. There were some other issues that I never considered up until now: our communication was really lacking: I mostly never told her when I was mad or she did something that made me upset because I didn’t want to fight with her, so I just let everything pass. She never told me when she was mad too, but she tended to just treat me with indifference and lack of attention and love for a while, which I hated. I tended to drink a bit too much when we went out with friends, and I sometimes felt that unsettled her, but I never really cared too much. She always wanted to have me by her side all the time when we were out, but sometimes I liked to have my own space.  She did not had many friends, mostly guys because “she never understood women very good” and didn’t liked that I had any girl – friends because she was jealous. I never saw this as red flags of any sort so I just accepted it and let it pass by, I didn’t need anybody that wasn’t her.  My stress levels would often go off the roof and I tended to vent with her, and she was hurt but never told me anything. I was a bit lacking on the attention department too: when we were together, I just couldn’t get my hands of her (both sexually and not), but was starting to get a little tired of her neediness over the phone and social networks (she would constantly tell me she loved me, she missed me, she needed me, I was her everything, and even If I felt the same, I couldn’t bring myself to say it every 20 minutes or so). To make matters worse, her family was getting worse by the hour, with abuse and fights almost every day and night. Also, our country is currently suffering a crisis and everything was getting harder by the day: there is not much food, the crime rates are going rampant, the medical attention its shit; you know, the usual third world country day-to-day life.

Flash forward to July, it was time for me to go to a rural area to basically study, work and write my senior thesis. I was going to be out for 3 months, on an area about 1 and a half hours away from town with daily electrical and phone lines failures, food shortage, bad climate, and a serious deficit of medical attention. This is when all started to fell apart. Her parents finally decided to get a divorce, so her house was more than ever a living hell. She started getting panic attacks, night terrors, chest pain. I tried my best to console her, but eventually I just wasn’t enough. I couldn’t bring myself to fully understand her situation, and every word I said was received with bad feelings and words that made me feel like I just wasn’t enough to her, that I couldn’t solve her situation at all. She was inside the hospital and her workload was getting very big too, and mine got ridiculous! Was only allowed to go home for weekend every 15 days, basically worked from 7 am to 7pm plus 1 full night every 4 days, sometimes I got home from duties at 12-1 am. Plus I couldn’t eat as much as I needed too (life was expensive there) and got a bad case of diarrhea from drinking unboiled water (silly me). I managed to loss about 7kg in 2 months (from 63 to 55). I really tried to keep contact with her as much as I could, but my smartphone would not work most of the time and I was so busy working that sometimes I didn’t even remember to text my parents to tell them I was fine. My stress level was just off the roof.

While all of this was happening, she met a really good friend of mine on the hospital. Let’s call him John. This dude was my best bud: in the past, we hanged out a lot, have a lot of pictures together, and really hitted it off because we were really really similar (liked the same bands, the same drinks, many of the same stuff).  She always told me she was a good person and talked about me like I was a god, and was getting very good friend vibes from him.  I was truly happy for her because she found someone of my trust to be her friend and support her too.  We were starting to become really distant: I could only text her about 2 o 3 times a day, or call her like 15 minutes, tried to tell her that I love her and Missed her but it was never enough, she wanted to know about m every hour, to be texting me all the time, and I just could not, I was feeling exhausted and suffocated.  To top it all, my sister and mom decided to leave the country, leaving my dad depressed and apart from me and me almost completely alone, so I just got really really depressed and angry. 

Eventually, she started to not text m with the same frequency.  While I was a bit relieved, I was worried about her safety.  She mostly just told me she was studying and spending a lot of time with john. She was often asking me if it was okay from her to stay at john’s place to study (there was no electrical power on her house for a while). I always told her that I trusted her more than anything and he was like a brother to me so it was fine.  She was always studying, and didn’t had much time for me, and I did not have much time for her. I always thought relationships were like that: some times people get separated for a while, but can really work things out.  I was just going away for3 months, and she just earlier this years was away for 6 months, so if we did it one time we could do it a second, right? Sometimes I would get to the hospital to do some quick things and run into her and John and the rest of the gang and had a bit a good time.  I remember I did one time and found them together studying (or so I thought). I said hi in a good mood, they said hi, he eventually left and she was like shocked, I told her what was wrong and she said “I did not expect you to come today”

Around mid-October, I had a free day so I got to her house and waited her there. When I called her, she told me “I’m on my way with john, is that okay?” I told her that it was fine (it really was).  She got there, he eventually left and she talked with me.  She really felt bad, her anxiety was getting worse, and she felt our relationship had too many issues. She did not know if I even missed her.  For me, it was impossible to understand. She did not understand me! Of course I loved and missed her! I was suffering a lot too! It made me mad, but I just told her that I could just go on like nothing happened and work things out, that I just needed 2 or 3 more weeks and I would be finally free. She told me she couldn’t act that way.  We got silent, and changed topics.

I started getting a bit of more free time and started texting her more often, but it just wasn’t the same. I don’t really know how to explain it right now but she just wasn’t the same. The love just wasn’t there anymore. When I finally could get back home, I went to her house and she had the talk with me: She had an anxiety attack so strong she smoked again, she felt abandoned, depressed, not loved, not the same.  I was destroyed: how could this happen so fast? How could the days happen so fast I did not notice? We both cried a lot, and I swore to her that I would do anything to work things out, anything she wanted.  Some days later, she told me that she really didn’t felt the same about me, but she knew she loved me and wanted to try to get the spark again.  It devastated me, but I knew that we could get things to work out.

Our birthday was approaching (we share the same birthday). And well, 2 days prior to it she broke up with me.  I wanted to die.  She said she just did not felt the same way, that I did not deserve what she was doing to me (she treated me like living shit for the last 2 weeks), and wanted some time to sort things out by herself.  I was destroyed, but loved her a lot and respected her choices. So we broke up on a good mood, had sex for the last time, and parted ways. Even if it destroyed me, I wanted to make her happy. We promised to stay open to each other and that we would both speak our minds openly about anything.

I started to go out with my friends and her with John, pretty much her only friend.  We texted a lot anyway, and she was very open about it with me “just like you have your friends, I have John”. I never suspected anything, because he was my best bud, he even went to my house on my birthday. Even if I suspected, we both promised to be completely honest to ourselves. About a month later, she cam back to my house to visit.  That day was amazing, we chatted a lot, kissed a lot, had sex, had lunch together. I really thought things were going better. I asked her if she had something going on with John and she said no. But then she asked me “how do you feel?” I told her I had my ups and downs. When I asked the same, she said “I don’t want to hurt you but I am doing rally good”. That mad me feel like she just wanted sex that day, so I never said anything about getting back together.  Wasn’t it her place to do it? She broke off with me, I just needed something, anything, to know. She just had to say she missed me.

I started to cut contact, every chat we had hurted me, I still wanted her back, but I did not want to be the crazy needy ex-bf, she wanted space and I gave it to her. On xmas, she texted me to wish me happy holidays and I texted her back, eventually asked her if she wanted to hang out, and she told me she was at john’s.  It hurted me, but still did not think about it.  If she was moving on with him, why was she so open about it? And why did my good friend decided to date my exgf from 3 and a half years of relationship? I trusted blindly on her and him, so I just let her move on.  On New Years Eve, they both texted me, he told me I was his hero, that he loved me, and was his best bud.  She texted me wishing me a good year, we chatted for a while, and I just cut contact.
Some days before or aftr that (can’t really remember now) I had a bad feeling ad called her to ask if she had anything with him. She replied “No, we already talked about this, we just spend lots of time together. Just as you have your friends I have mine, it is good to have friends to vent and handle a break up you know. And even if I move on with someone else, it is not like you can get mad, just like I can’t get mad if you move on”

Now, about a week ago, I finally found out thanks to some common friends that finally spoke to me about it: the were going out since mid august, they were an open couple on the hospital while I was away. They constantly said to each other that they loved each other, they were the love of their lives, that their love would last forever, and everything.  She would stay at his place most weekends, and (I did not know this) HE LIVED ALONE.  When people asked her about me, she just nodded her shoulders. This and a bunch of dirty talk (really, really strong stuff) that she never had with me.

This is where I lost it.

My palms were shaking, my chest was exploding, my stomach wanted to pop out, my legs wanted to run away until I dropped and died.  How could she do this to me? I trusted her more than anybody, totally and blindly, and she just cheated on me? WHY!!!?? I wasn’t even dating anybody, I was working!!!! How could you just let slip by 3 years of a serious and committed relationship just because I was away for such a short amount of time!!? Next morning, I got to her house and confronted her about it. Needless to say, it did not went well. She denied everything, EVERYTHING, until she finally said they “just started talking about having a relationship but did not wanted to hurt my feelings so they don’t have anything but don’t rule out the possibility in the future”. She said she loved me, that he was never going to be like me, that she tried the best she could to save our relationship, that she wanted to get back to me that day when she came to my house but I did not said anything, that she didn’t deserve me, that it was all her fault, she did not know what to do. Tons of crying, no yelling.  I just confronted her about all that happened and demanded answers. I can’t really remember much that I said, I was out of my mind, but I do know that I never insulted her.

That day, a friend of mine called me for an unrelated reason and asked me the one thing she never had to:” so, did you get back with your gf?” I exploded and can’t really remember anything I said to her, but I do know that I called my exgf a whore, my friend a motherfucker, and a lot of mean things.

So, here I am. That was a week ago, and I still can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t stop thinking about it, can’t forgive, can’t forget, can’t move on. I feel like I want to die. The worst thing was she just exploding on social networks: “Thanks for remembering me who you really were” “I regret nothing” “I would be anything I want until the day I die” “I never saw the light until I saw his eyes” “Time to grow up” “innocence is a bliss until reality hits you in the face”.  What the fuck!? What did I do wrong? Does distance equals cheating!? What did I do wrong? I just can’t understand anything that happened, I gave her my life and she just dumped it for sex and attention. 
I want to get her back, I just can’t move on, I don’t even know how to date anybody.  And the sole thought of her being happy with this guy so fast and having sex everyday multiple times doing any kinds of nasty things while I’m just here heartbroken is killing me. I feel used, not loved, not wanted, not desirable. I was stupid, naïve, they basically fucked in front of me and I just could not see it.

134,"So like, I kinda felt like this was a bad idea from the beginning. She said she wasn't interested in a relationship, but she seemed to be really into me. We went on several dates, had sex together and even had some really deep conversations about life and death, our anxiety and depression issues, etc. I thought we were really compatible.

Then, one day, she went cold out of nowhere. She never texted me first, whenever I texted her I kept getting one word answers, she completely ignored any questions I had about potential dates, she didn't seem happy to see me at work anymore and in my opinion the most painful thing, is that she acted the exact same towards everybody else. Just different towards me.

I texted her a while ago asking if I hurt her in some way, she responded saying she wasn't sure why I would get the impression she was hurt? then when I told her why, she responded saying she's been pretty happy.

Listen, I can handle rejection. I've dealt with it before. What hurts me way more is that she didn't have the courage to tell me she isn't interested anymore. I'm even okay still being friends, but the way she's been acting, I'm not sure if that's really an option. I can't simply cut this person out of my life too, because I see them nearly every day.

I'm just wondering, what's the best way I can deal with this? Should I talk to her (in person) about it? Or should I just let it go and try my best to ignore her?",25Jan2018,2
135,"So here’s some backstory, I’m from America and moved to Australia recently. My boyfriend is 20 and his younger brother is 17. We all stay with his parents in their home. All my boyfriend’s brother does is sit on his ass in his room and play video games. Does not socialize for shit and stays up to 4am and sleeps till 4pm. Before you say anything, “no he isn’t depressed or suicidal”. He’s said it himself. He loves life.

Now, here comes the issue. My boyfriend is always being asked to everything! Take the bins out, unload and reload the dishwasher, walk the dog, clean the bathroom, etc. His brother? Nothing. It’s not only his parents that ask, it’s his grandmother that lives next door that ask him to do stuff all the time too. Now I engage with cleaning too, just because I’m thankful of his parents for letting me stay here. I just can’t get over why they don’t ask anything of his damn brother.

It enrages me so much. My boyfriend gets barked at if he doesn’t do what he is told but his brother doesn’t even attempt. Sometimes me and my boyfriend do things without being asked. I just can’t understand this.

Excuses were made of, my boyfriend being older or some bullshit. There literally is no excuse for his brother not to do anything.

Basically, I just want to know how to approach my boyfriend’s parents and say something. Why? Just why? But I don’t wanna be rude, or cause awkwardness. So how do I do this?

TLDR; boyfriend’s brother doesn’t do anything, sits on his ass, I live with him and his family and want to confront them about it",25Jan2018,3
137,"This really sounds ridicolous but as you may know, snapchatting has something that has become synonymous with teenagers. I have this one friend that snapchats often when she’s with someone whether it be in school or not (sends around one a day). I am also friends with this person and they NEVER send me on streaks or story or anything yet almost everyone else always gets posted. Does that mean anything or am I just overreacting?",25Jan2018,1

139,"I work as a receptionist at a nice company, we don't have a fixed lunch hour but it's generally known that everyone gets 1hr lunch break. Since I'm at reception I can't go to lunch unless someone is covering for me. The girl who was previously the receptionist comes and covers for me ( let's call her Ria). 
Ria comes cover for me when she feels like it, the first two months we're alright but after that I've been having lunch in a tiny room inside the office, she always says she's too busy and then continues to be out for two hours during her lunch break. Almost every time that I do get to go to lunch she'll call be way before my one hour is up and tell me to come back, she has to urgently go somewhere. Sometimes she says she will go first and then I can go to lunch. On these days she stays out for 1hr20 mins or even 2hrs, comes back and tell me that she can't cover for me and I should just buy something and eat at work. 

I'm studying with my own money so I barely have enough to buy essentials so I can't buy lunch everyday which I fixed by bringing food from home. I've told ria before that I really want this lunch break as I go straight to college after work so she gave me break for day. 

I really don't know what I should do here. Do I talk to her about this or talk to my boss ( previously asked him and he said to talk it out with Ria), I can't get another job at least until the end of this year.

141,"So I'm 19, from Canada, graduated a couple months ago and I don't know how to make life better. I have 3 friends but 2 of them date each other so if I end up trying to see one of them the other comes along most of the time and im an awkward 3rd wheel and the other friend is like a female version of me and its hard talking to her since neither of us know what to say (shes also incredibly busy with school). 

I work a job with a mix of high schoolers and adults (only other people there my age are 3 girls and only 1 of them im kinda friends with). 

Ive been a pretty lonely person most of my life (never been in a relationship, never been to a party, I can probably count the amount of times I hung out with people throughout my 5 years in high school) and just idk what to do now to try and entertain myself or try and make life a bit more exciting instead of living every day on repeat (go to work, video games, sleep, repeat). Does anyone have any tips to try and help me meet new people or how to talk to new people or just anything to help get me a life?",25Jan2018,0
143,"I live in a first world country, so I have that going for me.

I was diagnosed with OCD at a young age, it got severe in my teens and led to me being basically out of the world. I went to school online and had no friends, no interaction with anyone besides my mom and some strangers online (haha, but strangers online can very often be better than people irl! so i don't whine about that too much). 

I starting going to real therapy at 19. I try to cooperate with the therapy, but I trust the medicine more (this isn't saying much, however). The medicine just takes the edge off, that's all. I still spend hours doing my things and just recently I didn't shower for nearly 3 months because I was afraid. I did shower eventually. I know medicine has to be readjusted and all that, but I'm 21 going on 22 in June and i'm less than hopeful.

At 19 I entered college, chose a difficult major, and tried to work. This, of course, failed because I was nowhere near ready to manage getting up and going outside 5 days out of every week. I had to withdrawal for medical reasons the first semester.

I owe money because I had a grant, but I'm poor and mentally ill so it's hard to pay it back. I have dug myself out slightly, only because my mom helps me and I live with her (if i didn't i'd be dead, for sure).

I know the debt isn't impossible to pay back, but I feel like by the time I can, I'll be too old. I feel like 23 is too old to be finishing up a BA, much less starting one. I don't want to offend anyone, btw. I think it's too old for me, not anyone else. I know that sounds ridiculous to some people but I spent no less than 8 years of my life in pure hell. Isolated, tired, depressed, and suicidal. I feel like I've already wasted so much time. This started when I was 14, meaning I never had a high school experience. I never enjoyed youth, I just waded through it. I think the same could be said for my early adulthood.

The thing is, I'm sick of it. I really do want to kill myself sometimes. And not to be dramatic, not because I'm selfish. I just want this to end. I don't want to be taking meds throughout my life, playing with them until I get it right. I don't want to wait and wait and wait for my life to begin. I really have suffered so much. My mother has too. And she was physically disabled before this illness of mine. She's getting older and I can't burden her like I do anymore. My best option would be to marry a man that's willing to cope with it, willing to be there. In return I could keep his house, birth his kids. It isn't my dream, far from it; I always wanted to be making my own money, to have a career in law/politics (though i do respect women who choose to become housewives, different strokes for different folks). I simply don't believe I'd make it out there on my own and a husband is what I'd need to have a roof over my head.

My question is: What would you do if you were in my situation? Do you think life is worth living for me? Should I keep trying? How would you remedy this? Be brutally honest, because I quite honestly have NO idea what to do. I haven't the faintest suggestion of self-worth to be found anywhere within me.


TL;DR: I have severe OCD that prevents me from leaving the house for months. Have had it for 8 years, I'm 21. I live in poverty with my mother who is ill and I cannot burden her any longer. I am in debt and cannot go back to school because of it. Holding down a job is impossible right now as I cannot maintain a schedule, even with medication. I am considering becoming a housewife and finding a very, very kind (he'd have to be to deal with me willingly) man who would accept me. In return for taking care of me financially, I would give him a clean home, kids, etc. I always did want to have a career but I don't know how possible it is for me now. I have days that I'd like to die and it seems the logical choice to me. What would you do in my situation? Do you think there's any hope for me? Be brutally honest.",25Jan2018,2
146,"Hello, reddit, I am a college freshman. Currently I am attending a local community college. School life was ok, until this guy recommended me to take an online class with him. He just recommended me because this class is pretty easy class and I thought it would be ok to take it with him. I was not thinking of doing collab with him, because I always study alone unless there is a lab for my lab science courses. Anyway, at some point, he literally forced me to collab with him. I accepted it, but I started to feel like I am getting bullied. I set up all the clients for the online course (we have to install a certain program to take that course). Not only that, I was pretty much forced to send every quiz answers, although grading policies were ridiculously forgiving. I told him that I don't think it is not ok to share the answers. A week later, he said, as a compensation, he will give me all the homework and essay from the other courses that he took. I was going to say no thanks, but I felt like I had to take it because there was no way to escape this however. Later on that day, I told him that ""it's ok not give me the other courseworks that you've done. Let's not cooperate and let's not share the answers as well. I do not need your works and I can handle these by myself. And, If I copy all of your works, what's the point of taking those classes then? I don't think I will be picking up anything from that course. Even if I transfer into 4-yr college successfully, I don't think I will survive at all. And according to what you have said, this is your last semester. Why don't you do it by yourself then? You won't have any problem transferring outta here? No offense, but let's not collab at all."" And he started to yell cuss at me said ""You are pretty damn good at making an innocent person look like a demon. You listen to what I say and answer property you fucking faggot. (Yes, he literally said this.)."" And since that day, he's been calling me a few times a day and this is giving me an anxiety. Similar thing happened for psychology as well. He (same person) suggested me to cheat on it, so I was going to drop it, but he bullied me just because I was not willing to cheat on that course. And then I dropped it, then later on he apologized to me. Now this does not work. It's his last semester, I don't even know campus police's gonna take this issue seriously. According to him, he thinks I am obligated to follow his ""order"" just because I am younger than him. What do I do now? I can't even sleep because of him. Recently I received a phone call from him at 11 -ish pm. Please help 

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1 - I reported him to the school deans. Not only that, I am willing to send a written discrimination complaint letter to the district as well. I was not going to send the written letter, but he kept calling me middle of the class. This is actually traumatizing. I've never thought of visiting safe space in my life. I had to stay in the school's safe space for quite awhile because he is literally camping in the library for 24/7. 

tl;dr - Currently attending a local community college. Taking an online course with a guy. Constantly bullies me whenever I refuse to collab with him.

147,"I apologize, this is long, will edit it into something more comprehensible tomorrow, but fk it. 
Here is some background about how I used to be as a person. my actions have always been based on my strong moral compass. In my soph-senior years in high school, I became very social, very close with my brother and parents, I had my first couple of gf’s during that time, began meditating. I was essentially living exactly how I wanted to live. Also, my ability to empathize with others was core to who I was.

My drawn out story starts when I went to uni. During the first semester I felt amazing, I was the life of the party, I had several fraternities rushing me, hooked up with more girls than I’d previously kissed, and did some drugs. Mainly just smoking/drinking, which is whatever, but I also did LSD about once every month. At first, I really enjoyed tripping (I did it before college several times) because I’ve always been curios about life, different experiences, and where I fit into the universe. But, at the end of the semester, I realized I hated being at that school (too small, nothing to do but party/drugs) and I decided I was going to transfer. 

So, the basic set up at the end of the semester is: -have a lot of friends through drugs -this is a drastically different version of me than before - I have guilt (thanks moral compass) about leaving these friends who really like me and want me to be a part of their organization/club/life in general

2nd semester I became a complete shut in. I didn’t talk to my friends, trying to make it to the end of the year w/out them. However, bc of my guilt I ended up going to a formal for a friends (local) fraternity at the end of the semester. Everyone (all 30 of us) were tripping in a farmers field, and this was when my perception of everything really broke down. 

I felt that I was a fake, that I was deceiving everyone there and I hated both myself and them because of it. I realized that I was the only one who I could count on in life, even though I have the best parents and brother I could ask for.

Now, I understand that it’s natural for perception to get fucked up when your tripping. That’s a part of the deal, I get it. What I’m still struggling with (now a soph) are the effects of that trip. My anxiety has been through the roof, I have 0 confidence/self esteem, I can barely hold a conversation (let alone, one with a girl). My ability to be present/in the now, which has always been a skill of mine is gone. I am the complete opposite of who I was two years ago and I hate who I’ve become but I don’t know what to do. If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate your reading my ridiculously wordy post, and thank you for any/all help.

TLDR: guy was very thoughtful growing up w strong moral compass, has loving family, got out of his shell in highschool, felt connected with friends and family. Guy goes to college, parties his guts out, hates it, decides to transfer, feels guilty about leaving friends there, trips w friend and realizes he can’t trust anyone or anything because he sees how society is a scam and in the end we’re all alone. Now, guy struggles with crippling anxiety he never knew of before.",25Jan2018,2
148,"I’ve been dating my girlfriend for nearly 4 years now, she is literally everything to me. I can honestly say she is my best friend and we can just be our crazy weird selfs around each other.

We met through a mutual friend and even though went to different Universities, we kept a strong relationship, a few bumps here and there but overall good!

She moved back home (Northern Ireland) (I live in England) and we agreed that I would get a job over there, however she gave me some things to stick by, no call centre jobs, no sales jobs and a job that’s over £20k. Now, I have a degree in primary teaching and it’s not really what I want to do, so I’ve been looking at other things, I suggested maybe getting a call centre job and studying at the same time for an IT qualification which I can then go into. But no, she wasn’t having anything it and keeps on claiming that I’m not trying hard enough to find a job.

I have even said I would look for teaching jobs and have already applied for jobs that I would never think about doing. This deal had a deadline and she has pushed it back several times in order to give me more time, I must admit that for the first few months I didn’t really look but since October I’ve been trying my ass off to find something. Even though she keeps on telling me that I’m clearly not trying hard enough, even though I am applying for teaching jobs which I really don’t want to do.

I don’t want our relationship to end because of this however she has given me a ‘final’ deadline which is the end of this month. She has mentioned about maybe extending it but then going back and saying she’s not because she knows nothing will change, even though I really am trying.

What do I do? Every solution I try and come up with she just knocks down without properly listening and is too stubborn too. The only reason she doesn’t want me to get a ‘shit’ job is because she will be embarrassed to tell her family.

153,"I’ll start off by saying that I (15m at the time/now 18) have never been in a relationship so I don’t know if I really know what Love is. But this wasn’t just me being a horny 15 year old kid thinking I was in love with the first girl that I had connection with. When we first met I wasn’t physically attracted to her, but I genuinely felt happy to go to an otherwise boring class because I knew I would get to talk to her. I told my self at first that we were just friends and that thinking there was a connection there was just my dumb teenage brain talking. I eventually did admit to myself that I had feelings for her. I told her probably 6 months or so after we met, which was probably way too late and expectedly she responded with sympathy and a kind excuse to conceal the brutality of rejection (something like “I’m not looking for a relationship right now”). We remained “friends” to finish the year and occasionally talked in the last few years of high school. I would like to think that we stopped talking as much because we didn’t have any more classes together but I know if we were just friends and I didn’t have feelings for her that we would’ve still talked and texted each other regularly throughout high school. Flash forward to 2018 and I am starting my second semester of college. Every so often since sophomore year I think about her and my regrets in our relationship. I can say now knowing what I know that I was in love with her; probably since a week after I met her. And I am probably still in love with her. I still am able to contact her through social media but have never done so. I wrote a message to her in my notes detailing basically what I am saying in this post. My worst fear now is that I again have waited too long and that she has forgotten about us. I hope that at one point she felt somewhat of how I feel about her, but I don’t know if I’m willing to risk sending her a paragraph admitting my love 3 years overdue on a chance that she at one point had some level of feelings for me. I guess what I’m asking is am I in love with her or am I just too over dramatic and is it worth risking embarrassment again for a chance that she might feel the same way",25Jan2018,1
154,"I posted this in the r/peronaltraining subreddit and I wanna try to get advice on this:

I'm currently 18 years old and looking for both work experience and a way to earn money. I was thinking about enrolling in a course to get certified as a fitness instructor and train people after school (I'm in high school). The thing is, the fees are pretty expensive... Like, over $1000 to become certified noninclusive of exam fees. I'm also a girl and I notice people in my gym tend to hire male instructors... So, is this worth it? Would people hire an 18 year old girl to train them? Would YOU? Considering I only have after school days to work, will the income and benefits eventually weigh out the original cost?

155,"I will try to keep this as short as possible. I am not a native English speaker, so really sorry if I sound incomprehensible at times. 

A little background. I am an uneducated, unemployed 21-year-old from a third world country. I passed high school at 16, had a messy life the past four years. Didn't get in any college, chased a career in sports until a serious injury. Well, tbh, I was pretty mediocre as a sportsperson so my chances of having a successful sports career were already pretty slim. 

So anyway, I have worked a few menial jobs now and then for a year or two. And I feel trapped, my life is not really going anywhere. I wasted quite a few years of my life, I just don't want to waste anymore. My mom lost her life savings to pay my medical bills and I want to restore her savings too. Problem is I can't understand how I should proceed from here. 

Now I want to go to college. I came across programming around September of 2016. Always loved solving problems and programming just made it way more exciting, so I got hooked. I don't really think I am good enough to work as a professional programmer, but programming has really kindled in me a passion to learn. Given a chance, I really want to study economics and philosophy. But, the problem is that I have very low marks from high school. I never concentrated on my studies and was honestly glad thinking that I would be done with studies after finishing high school. I never thought seriously about career and made some really, really questionable life choices. Consequently, I barely scored 80%. On top of that, in my country, if you seek admission in a college years after graduating high school, 2% of your marks are scratched for each year that has passed, bringing my marks significantly below the required cutoff. 

So what would be your advice to a guy like me? I used to be an alright student, it's just I lost my interest in studies around 8th grade. But now I really want to learn. I am not financially that strong, so paying for college without incurring a relatively huge debt is out of question for me. I also want to have a successful career where I can really support my family and bring them out of the slump.  So what do you guys suggest?

156,"Hi guys

I am in desperate need of advice! I have lurked on this forum for a while and have seen some of the brilliant and live saving advice given by you guys and I could really do with some of this right now (any help would be much appreciated)

So I guess I will try to keep this as short and to the point as possible. 

I have lived in private rented accommodation for 6 years. Initially I lived in this property with a friend for 4 years and between us we managed the property fine, all bills were paid on time and things were great. Unfortunately my friends work relocated and he ended up moving with them. Around this time I also lost my long term contracting job and struggled to find anything in my area that paid anywhere near the same.

Roll on 6 months, I am again contracting but now for a lot less money and struggling to keep my head above water, literally using up all my savings to keep the rent &amp; bills paid. A work friend conveniently was looking to rent a room in a house at the time and ended up moving in with me. 

This is where it gets messy; I returned home from work one day in October to find that the ‘work friend’ had moved out without any notice and could not be contacted. This said friend had owed me 2 months’ rent which I covered plus I then come to find they had also not paid 3 utility bills totalling £2,400!  (They managed to do this as they worked from home a lot so could easily take the letters and I was none the wiser)

These utility bills were in both names, so unfortunately I am stuck with them. I have tried to plead my case with the companies but they don’t want to hear it. 

My issue is I cannot afford to live in this property by myself and pay the outstanding bills.

My partner has brought a property and has offered me to move in with them around March time. I am on a rolling monthly contract at the minute and have to give 1 months’ notice before leaving the address.

I am now stuck and don’t know the best course of action!? By moving in with my partner it frees my finances up greatly to be able to settle these debts quickly.  Can I move out of a privately rented accommodation whilst owing on Council Tax &amp; Utility bills? I have been told conflicting things from the companies owed to regarding this. Some have threatened bailiffs etc if I was to leave the property with the debt still outstanding. 

Again any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

Intelligent but severely ADHD / emotionally unstable / difficulty sustaining motivation toward organised goals. I don't feel particularly depressed. I just don't do much with my life. I have no friends, no special interests, etc.

-OK relationship with family. Parents ageing. Only really see siblings around holidays.

-I think I am schizoid / or possibly some form of introverted ASPD. I am not violent or criminal but I am a little bit misanthropic or impatient with people. I don't care about empathy. I am not asking for empathy from others either. I am asking for ideas that I can put into practice. Never been diagnosed with anything. I mentioned ADHD above but I mean that in the colloquial sense.

I think my parents' divorce as a teenager and some things that happened after that may have contributed to my introversion / limited my socialisation. Perhaps I turned inward rather than dealing with the real world during my formative years.

How can I start over?

I want to get more out of life. I want to work a professional job or be skilled tradesman. I want to get married or have a long term relationship.

I have little capacity to work toward goals in a sustained way though. I spend most of my time in fantasy, mental masturbation, and learning for the sake of diversion from reality. I love to learn and probably know much more about the World &amp; Nature than most people. But, perhaps, unlike an Autistic person I am not particularly attached to or passionate about my widely varied interests. I just pursue them to pass the time / as a mental diversion. Also unlike an Austic my understanding of social dynamics is very good but it don't feel that emotionally invested in the social ""game.""

I am thinking about making a blog or something where people vote on my daily decisions and letting others direct my life, because I don't care about what I do much. Not caring results in sub-optimal use of my lifetime. If I had a surrogate volition I think I could live a pretty good life. Slavery might have some merits in my case. How does one live without one's own interests or values to guide one's choices?

168,this feeling has been building up for years. but recently mid 2017 till now it spiraled down to an eventual grave.  it started around 13 years ago when i was introduced to my older brother I never meet the man. Till I was 13 which was also the same year our father died. Before my brother came it was a modestly strict Christian  house hold with my uncle and mother  there wasn't much infighting and every one cared for one another. But things changed after he started to live with us. (My brothers was abandoned by my mother when he was 9 because of a war and didn't reconnect with her until he was an adult) he started to drink and abuse drugs  heavily  brought infighting to an extent I wasn't ever use to. And used my mother's guilt to pretty much get a pass on his rude and manipulative behavior. Towards me and my other family members. Which when on and hasn't  stop for about 10 years. It has caused me to go through my teens depressed and  hateful towards everyone. Which unsurprising evolved to a mental breakdown at the age of 19. And an isolation from the world till I was 21. His  disrespect towards my uncle and constant steal of his possessions for money forced him to move out so he was gone for about 3 years which affected his health because now he looks like he is going to die given that he goes to the bathroom every day doesn't sleep doesn't eat poops blood and doesn't want to go to the hospital out of fear or superstitions. Which has fucked with my head in interesting yet shitty ways. ( oh he recently got scammed out of his savings by his older brother for a fake bond which was supposed to be worth over a million but he didn't tell anyone what he was doing which thinking back might make his decision to not go to the hospital even more tragic) and my mother which has guilt of abandoning him just let's it go. The man is close to 40 has 3 kids and has made noting with his life he spends his days just ordering her around when he is home. And when I try to make a point or help my family I get ignored  and try to help while I see the people i care and loved dig them selves to a grave.  I honestly don't know if I'm the one who is wrong . Fuck that I need to realise that the world grows dark and even if I feel like shit the alternative is death and I won't except  it unless it's accidental or old age. Maybe I am crazy ,25Jan2018,7

170,"This is my first time on reddit and decided to get some advice here because there's people on from all aspects of life that might be able to share their experience.

Basically, my girlfriend right now is about 5 weeks pregnant. We’re both in our mid 20s, with respectable and stable jobs. We still live at home with our parents. We’ve been dating for just over a year now... but that was supposed to end... Last week...

It’s been a rocky relationship from the start, but she has been my first serious relationship. I was unsure from the beginning, but she’d been in many relationships in the past and so I listened to what she said about our relationship. I guess I was unsure with the relationship, because of how it started. Basically, I was a virgin (yes, mid 20s virgin, but I grew up in a religious household, but I had always wanted to break free. At the same time, I respected what religion had taught me and tried to live by it). We were just friends at first, and she found out I was a virgin, and I found out she had slept with 10 guys in her life. After a few times of meeting up, she started flirting and making sexual comments, and one night, she came over and we got piss drunk and well.. I kissed her but she put her hand down my pants and you can guess where it went from there. I thought it was going to be a one night stand, but it ended up turning into a regular thing, and from there, it became a relationship. She was always the dominant one in the relationship, she would always be the horny one and initiate. At times I would be horny, but I would almost never initiate. There were even times when I didn’t want to have sex (crazy for a guy to not want to have sex??), but I would go along with it because it made her happy? I dunno, I felt obliged. I couldn’t really make sense of it. At one point early on in the relationship, she asked me, what I thought of abortion. I said, “Never! Life is life, who are you to control who lives and dies”. To which she replied, “What if the girl conceived not by her consent, by rape for example?” And I replied and stood my ground, saying they could put the baby up for adoption. She found that interesting, but at the time, I guess it was my religious upbringing talking. She’s in a family where her father left her mother 4 years after being born, and her mother had kids with 2 other partners...

I tried to break it off a few months into our relationship, but she asked me why? I told her because she wasn’t my ‘ideal girl’ (which she isn’t), and that I didn’t see a future together, that I didn’t love her. She told me that I hadn’t given the relationship a good enough chance, all her friends took around a year before they decided that this was the right person.  So I gave it another shot, and waited around a few months. I tried and tried, but I still didn’t love her, and I’ve never said it. I wasn’t unhappy, in fact, I was pretty happy, things were comfortable, it’s just that, I didn’t love her, and I felt like I hadn’t given life (other girls) another chance. What if... What if there was someone else, better than her for me? But knowing I had stuck with the first girl I seriously dated and ‘settled’ in a sense, would I truly be happy? I didn’t hate her, nor did she do anything wrong by me. I liked her and cared for her,  it’s just that she just wasn’t the one. We had our fights like any relationship, and I did try to break it off another 2-3 times, but she said, that she’d work on the things that I said were the reasons why I wanted to leave. She did, for a bit, but then she reverted to who she was.

Now see, I’m a conservative, introverted guy who is very conscientious. She’s basically a diva, queen, centre of attention. I don’t even understand how we came to be together or how we even worked together.

So just over 2 months ago, I said that I really could not go on with the relationship. I told her that I liked her and cared for her, but that there was no future because I didn’t love her, and I didn’t see us getting married and having kids. It had been more than a year of seeing each other by then. But I knew she loved me, and that she could see us getting married, having kids and spending the rest of our lives together... I just couldn’t. We’re only getting older, and being in our mid 20s, I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time. We needed to get on with our lives. As I told her that I wanted the relationship to end, she said that I couldn’t do this to her right now. She made me feel guilty for wanting to leave, that I didn’t know what I was going to be missing. What I was going to be losing... She then asked for time, time because she had just broken the relationship with her sister a week prior (which she did not tell me about), a sister whom she is super close with, that they share every little detail of their lives together. She felt that her world was crumbling, and that she was losing her sister and her partner (me). She asked for time, and I asked how long? She said 1-2 months, but I said that that’s too vague. She said 2 months today.  I asked her why? And if it even made sense? She said, that that was the only thing that made sense to her, even though it crossed Christmas, New years and her birthday. She knew all of those things, and said it would give her time to find a psychologist to speak to, to get over the whole situation. So we agreed, 2 months from that exact date, we would break up. Things were awkward AF initially, because we didn’t know to act, but after a while, we kinda ignored the fact that we had a date of break up, and had sex like normal, where she would initiate. I felt guilty, and confused, that we were being so intimate even though we were going to break up. I tried not to have sex with her, but she always would push me. In the heat of the moment I guess I got caught up most of the time.

So that 2 months date came. Our break up date. That was last Friday. That day she was crying and I asked her why. She said it was nothing. We talked, and we both knew what was going to happen at the end of the night and we spoke about it. We knew we were going to break up. She then asked me “If there was a problem that seriously involved you and would change your life, but someone could do something to completely erase it, would you want to know? Or would you want the problem to be dealt with and for you not to know?”. I replied, that I would rather not know. For the problem to be abolished. She said this in tears.. I knew there was only one reason why. She also knew how I felt about abortion. I asked her, if she was pregnant. The day that we were meant to break up, she told me she was pregnant, 4-5 weeks pregnant. My world turned upside down. What do we do? Do we abort? But I’m against abortion. Do we keep it? Who keeps it? Do we put it up for adoption? What do we do? We decided to stay together for a little while longer while this all boils over, to show face to the rest of the world. I want out of this relationship, but I’ve been asked to try and learn to love her for the sake of the child. She wants to abort because she cannot deal with the shame it will bring both of our Asian parents and how it will impact our lives over the coming years, but she has learnt to love this child, this foetus inside of her. She wants to abort because she knows that I will only be there for the child, to support it financially and in its upbringing, that I will not love her or be in a relationship with her. I will merely be the father of her child. Our lives will be tied forever. But if she aborts, we will be separated from that day. What do we do? It’s not even my decision at the end of the day... I leave it up to her.. So Reddit, what advice can you give me? Or what is your opinion of the whole situation?

Tldr; got my gf pregnant, we were supposed to be broken up 2 months ago because I don’t love her, but I gave her time to recover from psychological problems (because I don’t hate her ,and I care for her), but she’s now 5 weeks pregnant with my child. What do we do? 

Edit: she is on Implanon, the rod contraceptive in her arm that's supposedly more than 99.9% effective. I don't think she's lying about the pregnancy to keep me in the relationship, but it hasn't been confirmed with ultrasound.

171,"I have a toxic job and I decided to put in my 2 week notice. However I’ve been told that they want me gone before  the date of my resignation if I give them the official notice.  I don’t start my new job until about 4 days after my official last day. What should I do here?

172,"I was interviewed for a job with a salary that's a lot more than I am currently making, and the formal offer letter is going to come soon. The interview was yesterday.

At my shitty retail job, I am currently making $11 an hour. Due to a combination of retail and sales really not being right for me and also being semi-bullied into it by my less-than-competent boss, I was getting maybe 25-28 hours a week; call it maybe 16k a year before taxes right now. If I stayed there a whole year, which I haven't, yet.

Because I hate my current shitty job and I want a better paying one that doesn't give me panic attacks, I went on a spree of job applications last week, and applied for one through a staffing agency in with the other eight or so I applied for that day. I've had shitty luck with staffing agencies before - I needed a job, it was $13 an hour to just do absolutely mindless data entry for and 8 hr shift with absolutely no social interaction or hope of upwards movement. I almost didn't apply to the job I interviewed for yesterday because I didn't want to go though that again, but I figured, fuck it, just make it rain resumes.

The job involves data entry, too, but it also involves, like, actually working with accounting software, and doing what sounds like scarily complex manipulation of that data. I'm good with computers, and I can figure anything out if I work at it - I test well, and I pick up new computer skills really easily, so the fear I'm having is likely just my anxiety talking.

It's a work-from-home job for awhile until the new office finishes construction here - then I assume it becomes an office job. 

The pay, assuming I actually get the 40 hrs a week promised, is roughly quadruple what I'm currently making. 19 an hour through training, then 30 an hour after I finish training.

I'm in my mid-twenties. The most money I have made in my life was 13 an hour. 30 an hour is more than my parents make. I've never gone to college, but I want to, and to become an accountant - this sounds like a perfect job for me.

I feel like I'm not good enough, even though they're offering training; logically I know that if they were to hire someone with the skills they need already, that person would be more expensive than $30 an hour, but it just doesn't connect.

My parents - money's always been tight. They spent so fucking much money in divorce court - it didn't end until my little sister turned 18. They have approximately no savings even now, and my little sister's college tuition sure as fuck isn't helping that situation. How do I deal with suddenly having more money than my parents? They both remarried, and I have two working stepparents as well, but - what the fuck, y'know?

I have a car, it was $8200 used, and I put down 3k on it when my mother helped me get it. That seemed achievable. Big, but achievable.

This fucking $30 an hour job offer is something like 62k a year? Assuming I do get that forty-hour workweek. Even if I don't, though, it's still way more money. My mom makes maybe 55k, and she's been to grad school - she has a mortgage and bills and a house and kids and student debt - I have approximately zero debt and a car payment less than $300 a month (the car's in her name right now out of necessity, we bought the car when I didn't yet have a driver's license).

Point is, if I suddenly get a stable job that I like well enough to stay in for at least five years or so (longest job I've ever had was... probably a seasonal job that was like, two or three Christmas seasons long) - I could, conceivably, move the fuck out. I don't particularly want to, but I could get an apartment of my own without worrying about it. I could get a fucking MORTGAGE, maybe; 30 an hour by 40 hours minus taxes is like, $900 a week, conservatively. $950, maybe.

This feels insane. I spend maybe $50 a week tops, and that's rare I get to that; less than $300 a month for the car, and yeah I splurged too much on Christmas presents this year, but - if I have this job, next Christmas the amount I splurged with is going to be a drop in the bucket. I could max out my Roth IRA contributions for tax year 2017 before that April deadline.

This feels like an impossible dream, and I'm terrified it will be taken away from me somehow.

My current plan is to buy approximately all of the software books - Quickbooks is one of the softwares I'm gonna end up using - and study them day and night like I'm - like I am being faced with this desperate, impossible dream. I liked the Quickbooks for dummies book I saw the preview of on Amazon yesterday evening; it makes a lot of sense. From what I understand, Quickbooks is thought of as too easy to use? Like, a crutch that does a lot of the math and formulas for you, so that you don't learn half of what you should. I'm very new to this, it might well be fucking wrong.

So I guess the question is - being that I know not much and they are going to be training me and I am very good at learning things - how the fuck do I make myself stop feeling like I'm not good enough for this position? How do I confront the idea that - I'm gonna have money? I'm a compulsive saver, and I really don't see my expenses rising very much - my idea of splurging on myself is like, $9 sushi once a week vs cooking things more cheaply at home. My savings account emergency fund is gonna look pretty fucking fat.

As for burnout - that's what happened at that $13 an hour data entry job, as well as high school - I was fighting depression, and anxiety, and what was probably undiagnosed ADHD (girls tend to be pretty underdiagnosed in that one, in the US), and the sheer drudge of selling my soul to corporate overlords, combined with something that was probably SAD, way not enough social interaction at that job, and complete lack of trust in that employer (it takes some serious fucking obliviousness to walk into a room of temps making $13 an hour and talk about how the company has however many billions. Like that would raise our spirits).

How do I stay excited about this? How do I not burn myself out over it? How do I fail to succumb to the dread that, really, I'm gonna fuck up and get super fired? Not regular fired, but superfired. Probably out of a cannon, judging from the intensity of my anxiety.

How do I take hold of what feels like a miracle? Any advice or philosophy on this would be greatly appreciated; please don't try to make me feel stupid, I already have enough of that, thank you.

Hey everyone, so before I begin this post I want to say that I am all for people following their passions in life and being themselves. I’m all for it.

This is a very sad case that is only getting worse, that’s why I feel the need to post about it on this.

My brother in law became absolutely obsessed with the thought of being famous in 2013, after a popular rap artist at the time revined one of his videos of him doing a dance challenge. Literally obsessed. I’m not just talking creating his own artist name for himself, making a soundcloud, etc. I’m talking about quitting his low paying job and using all savings to pay thousands and thousands for studio sessions, buying expensive jewelry, clothes, etc. The thing is his music is not good. It isn’t at all. I am no musical genius, but his content holds no good sound, lyrics, etc. He emulates the generic rappers you hear nowadays who don’t have any talent in my opinion. He got kicked out of his house and moved to Los Angeles. He is about 1 frozen pizza away from starvation, yet he begs my MIL to send him money constantly which pisses me and my husband off. He had a job at a store and quit. He just paid for a first class ticket for himself to fly to Atlanta to meet with a record label.. it didn’t go well. He’s in his mid 20’s and we cannot tell him what to do. But we are worried about him. He posts himself smoking and drinking every night, he says it’s for publicity. He talks shit about other rap artists, calls them gay on Facebook, and gets hate for everything he says. He believes this is the way to get noticed. He is going about this fame search the wrong way. Is there any advice you redditors have in regards to maybe how to help him realize this may not work as well as he wants? Or should I just leave him alone and just let him do what he wants.",25Jan2018,1
177,"I will write this question, to get a third person opinion. I will be very mature and I would love to hear what others think about this ....  it will be very long as i try to explain my question, but I would really pray for you if you find the time to answer it for me. Its really huge and my whole life depends on it. please excuse my grammar mistakes 

So my story started, when I met this amazing girl, two years ago in a random gathering. I really saw how different she was from the first moment. She was just different that everyone else, and after talking to her I realised that she is the most perfect woman I have ever seen. 

I tried approaching, and it was obvious, that shes the exact opposite of me, shes just too sweet for this world. And I am kind of an asshole :p. Not in a bad way, i treat the people that I love in the sweetest way possible, but lets say there is some kind of a devil inside me. 

So things worked for me, and I admired the way she looks day after day, and she was very careful, because she knew he mom wouldnt like me. Her mom would not like me because we come from a traditional country and she wants a guy who is rich and carries a famous last name, so she can brag about him in front of her friends, and I am kind of that guy who never inherited anything from his parents, and who would work for ever penny he has.  The girl is a sweetheart to the point that she would rather listen to her mum, even if it broke her heart. She wishes to find a combination of what she wants, and what her mum wants at the same time. So my way was full of obstacles and everyone was against it, including her sister who was also my best friend at some point, just because they believed of how stubborn her mum is.  

So, i loved her, and i really fell in love with her. We had our problems and misunderstandings but they were cool. 
Afterwards we lived together, and our lives are the best thing in the world, except for uhmmm .... every single day fights. 

Now what i know for sure, is that I loved her more than she loved me, I am willing to marry her right away. Id leave everything for her. I quitted smoking, changed my bad friends, became a better student in my university, i became less chaotic in our house. I always clean and keep the house clean so she can be happy. Nonetheless, i did some stupid things, like sleeping at her friends house that I had known for 1 night although she didnt want me to, and she tried to ask me not to do it, and she cried a lot, and I still went, nothing happened there and she trusts me, and the reason i went wasnt because i didnt love her or whatever, but i felt rude to return an invitation that was made ecpecially for me but its just stupid. and after some time, we fixed everything. 

Now after some time, we started fighting a lot. Shes a bit sensitive, and I am a bit provocative, and fights light up. 

also, she lost her sexual attraction towards me, like when we first met, she was soooo into me, and everything, but now, she is never in the mood. And she wants more of foreplay and so on, although i massage her body for more than 30 minutes everyday and I move my finger on her body because she likes it for hours while shes topless and im kissing her back,front and lips, but she doesnt consider this as foreplay, she thinks of it as a relaxing thing.she thinks i am never satisfied, and again because we come from a traditional  community, we never had sex, and she considers me touching her private spots very bad religiously. Although, the massage part, she thinks its okai to be topless, but the bottom parts arent ok. I triend everything, I thought I might be doing something wrong, but im always shaved and clean and so on, and i asked her directly and she made me 100% sure that im not doing anything wrong, and she is just avoiding it due to her religious conscience. 
She watches me going to the bathroom to touch myself, and shes okai with it. I suggested that we stick to certain bases, and we stay beyod the limits of what makes her comfortable, but she avoided the situation. I tried giving her some time, without being sexual or attending to be, and after around 10 days, I started crying in the middle of the night, after i tried to foreplay for an hour of different kinds of pleasure, and she also refused, and wanted to sleep after i was done massaging her.  

since I have a strong personality as she describes, she had to be tough with me and not to show me that im weak ever. So instead of asking me to do cute things, she gets sad, because cute things must come from me, and not her.
We fight every single day, and i hurt her every single day because i find a way to put the blame on her every single time shes sad or annoyed by anything, i just find a way. And she hurts me, by reminding me how  was her ex boyfriend of a man, and that i will never be the same, she manages to tell me, that i will never change, and I am a mean person from the inside and that will never change. She reminds me that i keep disappointing her, and she keeps on having hopes in me. she never says i love you to me, while i say it 90% of the time. 

We are not being sexual anymore, its been a long while now, and were fighting and fighting and hurting each other. We really love each other, and we really want to end this and be friends, but even if were friends, we fight. What can we do ? ",25Jan2018,1
178,"So my girlfriend is extremely beautiful, and way out of my league. I'm very lucky to have her and even though she herself doesn't see it, she is very attractive. We've been dating for about a year and a half and she gets a lot of attention from guys who I know are only trying to get close to her to try and have their way with her. The problem is that she's very oblivious to the attention she gets and often mistakes the attention for people just being nice and friendly. Innocent mistake. I'm not saying every single guy that talks to her only wants one thing but a good handful of these guys make it very obvious that they want something out of her or are very persistent and constantly ask to meet up with her (and coincidentally I'm never invited). I'm a pretty jealous person and I know she wouldn't never cheat on me, but I hate how some of these guys just don't know when to stop and are just watching from the sidelines like a thirsty audience waiting for their chance to swoop in and take a sip.

I've tried talking to her about being harsher on these guys and telling them to back off but she doesn't wanna be rude or mean. Whenever I bring it up she calls me controlling and says I just need to trust her, which I do, but that doesn't stop the guys from slowly breaking down her barriers and flirting with her. I've learnt to just accept that she's attractive and guys are naturally gonna try to flirt with her and make their moves but what annoys me is that when she says to them she has a boyfriend they don't back off at all.

185,"I would think that the A-1 facility that was stolen from would take responsibility for their failure to provide security, but I did decline to buy insurance to save some money since I’m poor and in the midst of moving out. I lost about $5,300 in electronics, a lot of which were game consoles with digital titles downloaded onto them. What sucks is there’s a ton of save game data I’ll never be able to get back... and not to mention the priceless personal items that are missing.. but that’s getting off track a bit.

I called the local police department as soon as they reported it to me, but they were unable to file a police report until office hours. So finally I arranged to meet with an officer when I was off work, and we went over the break in and I reported all the items I believed to be missing. They said that they would look at the security camera footage but they could not show me it because of some liability issues.

I’ve been super busy with work and moving out, so just now I was able to fully account for everything, I just sent my police department the full list of stolen items like they requested and total estimated value (way higher than I first estimated, “probably under $1000”, turns out over 5k!)

Do you think I took too long and they’ve forgotten about this case? I hate that I can’t look at the security footage, also apparently they didn’t have any cameras set up inside the actual storage facility and they’d have to see the person getting out of their car/ losing stuff into their vehicle and leaving.

Should the storage facility be held responsible for this theft? Would I have a case to claim that they should reimburse me, regardless of insurance coverage? Or is that just wishful thinking?",25Jan2018,1

Recently, for the THIRD time, my (ex?) bf broke things via text.  The first time, I knew it was a decision not thought through, irrational, and in the heat of the moment.  Total time apart was maybe 24 hours.
Second time, he first asked for a ""break,"" then, unsurprisingly, ended if for good.  A month or two after that we met up again, he said he wanted to get back together, then the next time told me it would never happen.
Not even three weeks ago, he messages me again asking to meet up, and me thinking with my heart not my head, said yes.  I knew I wanted to only maybe be friends, and take it slow to see what happened.  I was terrified of him doing the same sh*t he was did before.
But, I was weak.  I fell right back into his arms and we essentially got back together.  Obviously, I was still reeling from the previous breakup and wanted to talk through things and ask questions.  He told me he would answer anything, and he would do whatever it takes to get me to trust him again.  How naive I was.  Once things started to get tough, not only because his short and avoiding responses, I learned my aunt had breast cancer, and my parents were talking about divorce.  
So, he TEXTS me, says that he can't do it, that I'm verbally abusive (I can see why he would jump to that conclusion, I was being up front and quite crude in asking questions...but not abusive), and that it's over for good.
I am unsure of how to move forward.  Right before he contacted me again I was getting to a good place.  I feel hurt, betrayed, and am utterly disappointed in myself for being so naive.

194,"Hello everyone,

I have myself in a unique situation and need some advice from an outside perspective.  I will start with what my life currently is like and then what it could transition too.

2 years ago I was able to buy a house which has been amazing.  I also rent out the spare rooms to close friends, between my payments and their rent I make it through the month with little cash flow issues but I just pay all the bills first and then get paid back within a week or two afterwards (everything is split evenly).

I am currently working a job ($20/hr) but in simpler terms $41,600/year.  I travel about 2.5 hours a day total for this job.  I also have interviewed and been offered a different job 6 minutes from my house for $45,000/year.  I am a bookkeeper/manager.

Around the same time I bought the house two of my best friends moved to Denver and got involved in the industry out there and are very successful.  They called me last night offering 60,000/year to go out and manage and do the accounting for one of the sections of their business (no growing or selling).  It is kind of like a dream job and situation for me.  No set hours (I work till the job is done, most likely 4-6 hours a day).  Between the raise and the opportunity to find some part time work out there I could be making quite the salary.  60,000-80,0000 and have a quality work/life balance.  I would have to pay $500/month in rent for this opportunity while also paying for the mortgage and student loans I have back home.  My car is paid off but it wouldn't operate that well in Denver so I would sell and buy something else (I am expecting to get about 2,500-3,500 for it) and to purchase a used SUV with that money.  My credit is great and I am comfortable financing.

My family has quite a lot of issues and drama stemming from their divorce a few years ago. Brother and sister issues and my grandparents are getting older.  I feel very uncomfortable leaving them all behind and moving halfway across the country.  My girlfriend and I are getting very close and serious and would also put a strain on our relationship.  She has her own business and clients that she has worked very hard for the past few years and would kind of have to leave that behind and start over in Denver.  I am confident she can but I feel a little selfish making her do something like that.  I would probably go out by myself for 2-3 months before she came.  I would also want to remove my name from the utilities at my house and have them in my friends name and they would just cover their share of the mortgage plus whatever utilities they wind up generating.  

To summarize:

Current:  $41,600/year working a normal job with a mortgage and student loans, family is close, relationship is strong, work/life balance not so hot

Potential A: $45,000/year (opportunity to raise over the next few years as the business transitions to their sons) working a normal job with a mortgage and student loans, family is close, relationship is strong, work/life balance much better.

Potential B:  $60,000+/year working a job in a risky industry, with mortgage, student loans, rent, car payment, family is far away, relationship will be a little rocky, work life balance amazing.

What would you do?

Edit: I am 26 years old if that is a factor to any advice you may have.

Edit 2: My dad (who is the only one aware of this situation right now) Has offered $100/week to pick up some of the responsibilities of his businesses to stay if money is that big of a factor.

Makes it really tough to go to sleep and eat/talk because I really hate that smell. It gets on my clothes sometimes so when I go to class I often smell my shirt and it just smells like straight feet despite me putting cologne/extra deodorant.  
What should I do? Confront him and ask him to wear socks 24/7? Haha.

198,So I am a recent grad and have been at my company for about a month now. The role I had initially applied for was filled by a current employee in a different department so they let me interview for another position in that same department I had initially applied for. Now the person who had filled the position I wanted has left and the position is open. There is an option to have the position be filled internally within my department and I would love to switch. Is it a good idea to try and see if I can switch although I’m new and have only been here a month?  The position I want to switch into is my area of expertise as I had interned at this company in the summer and that’s all I would do. ,25Jan2018,2
199,"My brother and I were best friends our whole lives, but about 4-5 years ago, he started to change. Here are a few examples:

In 2014, I made a commitment to paying off all my personal debt. I made a plan, put the plan in writing, committed 100% to the plan, worked like crazy and 1 year after beginning, I paid off all credit cards, student loans, and automobile payments. When I told him, he wasn't happy at all. He stayed silent and you could tell he was visibly not happy for me at all.

When I got engaged in 2015, my brother kept talking about the size of my wife's ring and that I got screwed on the price and how he got a much better deal on my wife's ring than I did.

-My brother and I used to work at the same company, in the same job, and earn the same salary. He was not happy working there any longer and decided to take a small pay cut and relocate to a new city for a job that he thought would make him happier. I also left that same job, but I made a plan to better my career and my personal development. Since leaving that job 2 years ago, I have more than tripled my income. My brother is furious about this. He asks me how much I make, but when I tell him, he says that my pay is complete bs and that I don't deserve it and that I'm ""lucky"", yet he doesn't acknowledge any of the hard work I put it in to accomplish this. Also, I have NEVER bragged about any of this, but topics such as salary have always been open in my family, so that is how he knows. I am a project manager at my job. My brother knows this, and continuously says that project managers are idiots and know nothing and worthless to a company. He loves to throw in these comments during normal conversation.

I should also mention that my parents are caught in the middle of all of this. At my mom's Bday party this weekend, he was there and things got heated and turned into a screaming match and the night was ruined. To make matters even worse, both our wives are pregnant and are expecting early next year. I don't want to not have our kids be in each other's lives. My brother is very stubborn and has been known to hold grudges. I know that this will never be resolved if I don't make the first move, but I am very angry and tired of always being the bigger person. When I ask my brother what is wrong and what the problem is, he says nothing is wrong and that everything is fine, but then he finds ways to put me down and everything I do.

What should I do?",25Jan2018,1
200,"Long story short, since January 1st, I switched parking spot with an old man living in the same building, since he doesn't need it anymore. 
I paid the monthly fee and the landlord agreed I could park there.

Problem is: He mistakenly paid it too, and keeps asking me I should give him money for the parking spot, sometimes also threatening me he will call the police, or break my car.

I spoke with the landlord and it's everything ok from their side.
They have to refund him.

now, I have the sensation the old man has some kind of dementia, and any time he sees my car over his old spot it triggers something.

207,"Quite a number of people have told me I come across like I have no vulnerabilities. Spoiler alert: I do have vulnerabilities - I'm only human. 

But it's made me realise that I'm not sure how to be vulnerable around others. I think it's affecting my ability to form deeper-level relationships, because people somehow see me as bulletproof and unrelatable.

It kind of shocked me to realise recently that I even struggle to admit to myself that I'm not as brave as I pretend to be. I didn't even realise I was only pretending to be brave! Anyway, sometimes I'm scared and I need help and reassurance, but I'm not sure how to even identify that feeling in the moment, then remember (in the moment) that other people can help me through it, and then follow that through by communicating my emotional needs to others. It feels so alien and strange.

I realised that my parents' response to any kind of negative emotion is defensiveness and denial, so that's possibly where it comes from, but I would dearly love some practical help or tips on how to open myself up to the world and the people in it. (Thank you!)",25Jan2018,1

210,"I have been with my SO for 5 years and from the start his mom has always been an odd person. She tells crazy off the wall stories that are no way possible. For example, just the other day she said she actually witness a man cut his own head off with a chainsaw. And that is just one of the crazy things she has said in the past, I could probably write 9 books on the ""Shit my one day mother in law says."" 

My SO has told me over the years how his mom abused him: physically, mentally, and (recently rembered; he repressed these memories for 30 somthing years) sexually. She allowed her countless partners and their children to also partake in the abuse.

I want a restraining order and this woman locked up.

 She has a mental illness and has been commited a few times but will not tell any of the family what the diagnosis is. The scariest part is she lives in a house full of guns and weapons and is mentally unstable.
My SO is absolutely terrified of her and what she is capable of. He lived through it and it has really taken a toll on him, in more ways than I can count. 

It seems that she has planted seeds in his brain to trigger certain reactions from him so she can step in and act like a hero. This recent time all started because her SO was hospitalized. She called my fiancé and said they found K* passed out at work with no heartbeat and that someone told her to find a ride to the hospital. So he picked her up, and cryed the whole way to the hospital thinking K* was dead. While his mom just sat there saying nothing. They walk in the hospital room and low and behold K* is sitting up bright eyes and bushy tailed. 

It also needs to be mentioned that my SO has a serious fear of hospitals because his mom had him commited to the psych ward when he was 25. 

So all was going ok, until a trauma patient was rolled in right next to them and i can only imagine how shocking/terrifying it is to see that when you have never seen anything like that before. So they moved K* to another wing of the busy hospital for lack of room in the ER. It just happened to be the behavioural unit. The staff rolled K* out of the room to run tests and that's when my SO's mom chimmed in with, ""You're an empath. And did you know we are in the psych ward now."" So then of course my SO is scared that his mom is trying to freak him and have him commited again. Ugh, there is so much more to this story of all the other weird shit she said to him. My SO got himself out of there and had to take his mom with him, since he drove her (she could have taken K*'s car that was parked at the building next to th e hospital where she works). 

So, next day, his mom calls asking him to drive her up to the hospital again to get K's car. He agreed and drove her up there. On the car ride he was trying to commend her because she had been a respatory therapist in the ER in her past. He said something along the lines of ""You must have delt with a lot of scary stuff like that trauma patient yesterday. I bet you helped save a lot of lives."" Her reply to that was ""Yeah, but I had to take a lot of lives too."" WTF!!! 

They arrive to the parking lot where K's car is parked. She tells my SO to park in a really strange place and they get out to walk around in search of the car. After a while of this my SO says let's get back in the truck and we can drive around while you push the alarm button, so we can find the car faster and get out of here."" Her reply ""Oh. You're never getting out of here."" Again WTF! 

At this point my SO has had enough and says there is a car here for you. You find it. I'm out. He leaves and tries to call me, except I was in class in a basement that has no service whats so ever. He panicked and called my mom and his aunt telling them he thinks his mom is trying to have him commited again. 

I get out of class and see a text from my SO that says ""CALL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" So I'm a little freaked out because of all that went down the day before too, so I call him back no answer. I call again, no answer. So I called his mom because I knew he had been with her (also this was before I found out that she molested/raped him...I can't talk to that bitch right now without losing my cool and as I stated before she is dangerous). She said ""oh I'm home now. But I gotta tell ya he had a serious meltdown in the parking lot."" I'm like ok? 

Finally, I get a hold of my SO and he was just in a frenzy of fear, panic, fight or flight kinda mode.

I am going to end it here. However, this is no where near the end to all of this madness.

218,"My fiance and I took in a mutual friend as a roommate to get her out of her folks house at the time.  She's in her late 20's and was just getting antsy about still living with them.  She's been our roommate for about 2 years now and she's planning on finding a place of her own with her boyfriend.

We all thought she would look for an apartment to make her first steps of Independence with, but she said she wants a house.  Now all of us around her are doubtful she is responsible, let alone financially dependant, to afford keeping up a mortgage, utilities, house keeping, etc., so we've all tried lending her our collective two cents of experience to persuade her to maybe consider an apartment for a year or two.  She will not take any word from us.

I know I should be concerned for her finances and struggle she's setting herself up to fail with, but I'm more worried because I think she wants a house solely for the purpose of having a dog...  We have 2 of our own and she loves them, but she literally left one outside in the winter because she drank herself to pass out one night while we were out.  He's a pitbull with a thin coat, he would have died if we didn't get back as soon as we did.  I can't imagine what neglect could come to any dog she takes in.

Another issue I have is her, how would you say, ""questionable"", relation with her boyfriend.  They had a rocky enabling history and made up and are back together after problems with drinking and whatnot.  They both cleaned up a bit and got back together, only to have her become a drunk lump on the couch on the weekends because she got a DUI.  One night while she was passed out, the boyfriend pretty much said he regrets getting back together with her if she was just gonna go back to being a drunk.

And on top of all this the boyfriend recently broke his ankle and is expected to recover by July.  So he is quite immobile and short on work.
Edit*: Also he has no health insurance...


We all feel she is just acting desperate to keep up with everyone else that she put on blinders and is pursuing a very poor life decision.

227,"I have this friend we will call Bob. He's a pretty cool guy. He's 18, I'm 20. You wouldn't think the age gap would show but it does a good bit. 

He's a normal person and is fun to be around but for some reason he feels like he needs to make an impression. He always talks about how he hangs out with this trashy drug dealer who works flipping burgers (despite never using drugs). Every other day he says something about the drug dealer and what he's doing like this person has to do with my life ""I might go over to Blaine's house to watch cannibal holocaust"" ""Blaine said if I went over I could smoke for free, I might do it.""

He also has a GF, he acts like he hates her and says he's going to break up with but never seems to do so. She's a bitch to me and my SO but despite the many times we've made the preference that he hangs out while she's not around he still insists she's just shy. But if we're alone talking about her ""I'm leaving that bitch"" sure buddy.. 

He always messages our chat saying ""let's get fucked up this Friday"" with that being said. He's never been drunk, high, or any in-between. I'm not saying it's bad to have never done those things but stop acting like a party kid if you're not. 

Okay now this is the worst thing of all. He never stops talking about school. Ever. EVER.. Everything revolves around his geometry homework or his expensive college book or his lame assignment. Every day, multiple times a day. We could be talking about how much the local tax sucks and he would send a picture of a math formula and say ""it's not as bad as this shit"". 

We have this other friend we will call Fred. Fred is a kind and cool person but most times we usually hang out with just bob because Fred seems shy and introverted. Of all people, bob is the one most vocal about not wanting Fred around but only after I voiced my opinion on the matter. He always jokes about Fred like they're enemies. But the next day we could hang out and he'd say ""should we invite Fred?"" Me:""do you want to invite him? You can.""  Bob:""Ah idk I just don't want him to realize we've left him out.""

I honestly like Bob, he's a cool and normal dude. I just don't know how to get the bragging to stop other than ignoring (which I've tried).

But now I have no money and no meds and I don't know what to do.

I do have an old bottle of some of my previous antidepressants but none of my old painkillers. I thought about taking them but I'm now thinking maybe that's not a good idea because I'd have to wean both on and off and I don't think I have enough to do that and I don't want to mess up my brain chemistry.

I tried walk in clinics because I figured they might have samples but they either didn't have them or didn't want to give them to me.

I think I can live without painkillers, it sucks but I'll pull theough. But I really need something for my tourettes and depression.

Anyway 2 minutes later his phone rang and the woman he was with got up from the table rather abruptly as he said he had to take the call, he answered the call and we were sat there minding our own business not ear wigging at all haha and he put the phone on loud-speaker which is really weird and rude as the restaurant was full at the time i guess he had his hands full with food but still no one wanted to hear his conversation but never the less!!!
They where talking backwards and forwards and the other person said cap/kap/kp no idea what this is was being put on binas or binase on the 28th and he was going to make a lot of money from it he said that people had signed none disclosures or something but he was good friends with a coder? at this place who told him this.

233,"Hey /r/advice,

so a little important information that you should have is that back in November my roommate got a boyfriend, good for her, although it was basically as if they went on a first date and then he started living with us. After three months of him basically living with us for free I got tired of it and told him if he’s to stay over here as much as he is he should be paying something. I settled on one third of utilities (which is around $40, compared to the near $1000 my roommate and I spend on living here a month). Instantly they had a huge fight, nearly broke up two times, and I got blamed for it. Obviously I know it’s not my fault at all. Well now that the fighting has ceased he proclaimed that he won’t be coming over as much because he apparently can’t stand me. I don’t know what it is that makes him dislike me as I’ve always been cordial (I literally let the guy live with us for free for three months). 

It’s been about a week since I’ve heard that and he’s been over a few times. I’ve thought about confronting him over it, why should I have to host someone in my own home that disrespects me so much? ",25Jan2018,1
234,"Like a really really really big failure. Like I left home to move to the mecca of an industry I was passionate for, and now I’m not even doing it. The good friends I made aren’t my friends anymore. My four year relationship is stale and if we stayed together we’d absolutely be settling. I didn’t even try anything cool, I just sort of did nothing for three years while my old friends got degrees and found themselves in college and people wrote books and started businesses and invented shit.

I’m not even depressed depressed, like debilitatingly sad depressed. I just suck at my life and I don’t really want or know how to do it anymore. I was really depressed for a long time but I beat it recently and now that I’m out I see myself for what I am, a talentless unbalanced doof.

And in that clarity I’ve at least felt a drive to create something from my experience, something in film or music or writing, some way to make anything out of the very dull and hopeless state my life has somehow entered. I’ve experienced a lot of interesting situations, I have stories I want to tell. I tried it, I tried writing music, I got into woodworking, I made a missing person doc about a friend I haven’t seen in a month, I assembled and pitched a content marketing plan to my boss. Most importantly I started writing down every thought that had an inkling of depth to it and later attempting to create from it.

But no medium has resonated in me. Nothing I’ve picked up has made me think “yeah, this is it” or even “this isn’t working but I could see it under the right circumstances”. I’m being very aggressive in feeding my creative side and I’m having fun but I don’t really feel like I’m doing anything anyone will like, it’s all for me. And my newfound interest in this has me neglecting my other responsibilities, to my live-in girlfriend, my health, fitness, minimum payments on cards.

I’m torn between giving up and going back to college for an engineering degree and being a successful human calculator with a wife and kids and respectable friends, or shooting myself in the foot and doing the starving aimless artist thing indefinitely until I lose my home/friends/job/girlfriend and kill myself.

I was recently offered a job and accepted. However, while I was interviewing for the job that I accepted, I interviewed for another job that would have a significant pay increase and be more challenging. I should hear back from them sometime next week whether or not I have an offer. 

I have student loan debts that I desperately want to pay off so, money is a major factor here. 

So, what I'm asking is if I am offered the job with higher pay, what is the best way to maneuver with the job that offered and the job that may offer. (If I get an offer of course!)

239,"I’m a senior in high school and have been conflicted about where I want to go in the future. I have a job that I don’t want to leave but I know it’s because I’m just too lazy to go to college. I could’ve applied to a good university and probably gotten in, but that time passed and now I’ll have to go the other one I got into if I decide to go there.

About a month ago I told my GM I wasn’t going to college and wanted to move up in the company. I bugged her about it twice just to make sure I wasn’t throwing away my future.She then set things in motion and I’ve been learning other positions so I’d be able to be a manager. My friends have been telling me to go to college as well as the employees and managers who still work there. The GM wants me to stay cause I’m really good and one of the best and motivated employees there. I know I want to go to college and I’ve recently come to he realization that I could either go to college and come out and make like 50-60k immodestly with potential to make more. I’d also be able to retire and have a non poor life and do what I would like to do. The other option with staying at my current job would leave me living in poverty making only 30k a year and maybe in like 10 years be making 50k. Never be able to retire or do anything with my life.

So I’ve decided I want to go to college but I don’t know how to tell my GM, espically given how much I’ve bugged her bout it. Any advice on how to approach this.",25Jan2018,1

It’s very painful to walk in and even after the boots are off it hurts. Even after 12 hours of being bootsless I can still feel the pain.

252,"I’ll try to condense this as much as I can because it’s pretty long.

I’m a 22 year old and I’ve always seen myself as an artist, but with no real way or talent to express or create anything (until I started playing an instrument that I found out I had a knack for a few years ago) so I spent most of my life doing things that I thought would make me happy and would make me a lot of money. That led me down the IT path as computers are easy to me and so I thought it would be fun and well paying to work on them all day.

I was working part time doing consultation at some computer repair shop and going to school for information technology. I got a full time job offer while working there for a software company and worked there for about 6 months until I got promoted and do something basically akin to database management. I dropped out of college to work here full time. I also signed a lease on an apartment with a few of my friends and we are about 3 months into it.

While this job is certainly well paying, I feel very depressed. I thought this is what I wanted to for the rest of my life but the excitement of the new high paying job has quickly faded. I feel like I drew myself in a corner by pursuing things I thought I wanted to do, and things that I thought would make myself happy instead of actively pursuing my passions and working on them.

Now I feel like I’m trapped. I’m trapped in a lease, which means I’m trapped in this job that doesn’t make me happy. I also don’t want to lose the independence I’ve gained, but working almost 12 hours a day (this includes my commute to and from) drains me and leaves little time to myself when I come home. And when I come home, I’m so tired that all I want to do is relax and play video games. 

I feel like I don’t have the time to pursue my passions and practice my craft. I feel like I’m trapped in this life I’ve created for myself. I’m really depressed and cry in the bathroom a lot. I don’t see any way out. The depression makes it hard for me to have any motivation or drive to do anything else than to find methods of escape (video games, porn, weed, etc).

My invoice, listing everything in the parcel, the prices, my name and address, my email address, and the last four digits of my visa are on full display on the outside of the box. It's in one of those plastic pouches but unlike other parcels where the invoice has been folded so only the address is displayed, everything is on show.

Is this a normal/acceptable practice for sending invoices, or should I add that into my email to the company? I'm just a little concerned that all my information was clearly visible to the number of people who handled the parcel. Or am I overreacting and shouldn't mention it when I contact the company about the other issue? I don't want to make something out of nothing, but if it's not usual practice I want to make them aware before something happens that could impact their business or privacy of their customers.

261,"Hi Guys, I'll start off with a timeline of events.

Mid June - Loss occurred. It's a garage fire. Fire did not penetrate firewall but smoke definitely did to the rest of the property.

Few weeks from loss: Asbestos/lead testing conducted, few contractors and insurance adjuster come in for estimates. Asbestos found in joint compound in every wall and popcorn ceiling. 

1 month from loss: Insurance adjuster estimate comes in at roughly 25k for repairs. We move into temporary housing.

2 months from loss: Asbestos abatement for affected area in garage is done, then demo and cleanup begins. 

3-4 months from loss: Contractor sends in their estimate which has a few line items open (undertermined amount). Total for what's accounted for is close to 100k. A week or two later I believe I call my insurance adjuster and he tells me because of the large discrepancy a 3rd party contractor will need to come and verify the estimate. He advises me not to do any more work until this is sorted out and that he will let us know when the 3rd party contractor will perform the estimate process. I call him back a few days later asking to talk a bit more about all of this and hear nothing back. I let it go for the time being thinking that I will eventually get a call back. I want to point out that popcorn ceiling removal/abatement is left as an open item on the contractors estimate. The removal/abatement of the popcorn ceiling wasn't done with the original garage abatement as the contractor wasn't sure if the adjuster would pay for the removal or just have it cleaned.

6 months from loss: I finally hear back but not from my adjuster but from my contractor. He tells me he sent a bunch of paperwork backing up the estimate and after review it has been accepted. Payment will come so process moves forward but not actual work because the holidays are a week away. The popcorn ceiling removal was left as an open item on the contractor's estimate for reasons listed above. Now that the contractor's estimate is approved the abatement company sends in their estimate right before the holidays. Basically took the approval of the contractor's estimate as ""we agree with all the work you described on the estimate"" but obviously not the amount as there was no dollar amount ont his particular item.

6 months, 3 weeks later: The abatement company is ready to get to work so they try to schedule. I tell them I have not heard anything from the adjuster and that I want to get confirmation before work begins. I leave a voicemail message and get a phone call back days later. The adjuster doesn't know which quote I'm asking for approval on. We spend 10 minutes while he tries to look for it and tells me he doesn't see any estimates sent in in the last few months. I call the abatement company and ask for them to resend the estimate. They copy me on the resend and I see the original message sent right before the holidays. Adjuster calls back shortly after our conversation and asks why this abatement is being done now and not months ago. I explain to him that it was on the estimate and before any more work was done we wanted to make sure there wasn't going to be any more disagreements with money.

Present: I get a call from the adjuster telling me that they will not extend our housing any longer. His reasoning is that the abatement should have been first of all separate from the contractor's estimate and this work should have been done at the very beginning. And that this extra delay voids the insurance company's responsibility of paying for housing expenses.

In my opinion, the delay of this abatement is negligible compared to the delays that insurance took to approve estimates. The amount of time needed to do the work for this abatement is a week and it would have been done already had insurance promptly took care of their approvals. I feel as if I'm being punished for wanting insurance's green light before getting work done and am now about to have to find a place to live in within a month. I've tried to speak to a adjuster manager to no avail. I always get a voicemail with no call back. Any tips on speaking with someone from insurance with the authority to help? Or tips on how to talk to them if I do get someone on the phone? Lawyer up?

263,"My boyfriend and I are good friends with another couple. They come over for drinks almost every weekend and we always have a nice time. Last weekend, we started having a seemingly innocent discussion about how there are so many new gender definition terms and preferences when, all of a sudden, my friend said something along the lines of ""Where does it stop? Pretty soon pedophilia and necrophilia will become normal"". 

My boyfriend and I both stopped dead in our tracks and asked him if he was actually comparing people's sexual identity to being a pedo or necrophile. His girlfriend then jumped to his defense and kept stating that they had ""nothing against gay people"" but that he had a point nonetheless. I was not buying it. My boyfriend and I were both gobsmacked and kept trying to calmly explain how offensive they were being but they ended up asking us to drop it and left shortly after. 

A few months ago, I had suggested we all go to a drag show and his girlfriend brought up ""not being into that scene"" (which kinda rubbed me the wrong way but I passed it off as no big deal). I'm now starting to see the bigger picture and lost a tremendous amount of respect for them. 

I'm now at a point where I don't know if I want to be around them or if I should respect their point of view and avoid conversations like this in the future.

264,"Hi, Reddit. I am in need of some advice that might help in my decision of completely changing my life. Here is my situation in a nut shell. (PS, this may be a long one)

Some background information: I am 18 years old. I live in the Midwest. It is now January, I am graduating high school in May. My boyfriend is 20 years old, he lives on his own. We have been together for over a year, and the relationship is serious. I'm pretty sure this is the real deal. Hopefully I don't sound like a love struck teenager.

Around November of last year, my boyfriend's immediate family (dad, mom, younger siblings) announced that they are moving to Phoenix, Arizona. His dad is in serious need of a new job, and the people in the small town they live in are kind of rotten. They have lots of family and friends down there, as they are from the west coast. The kids are stoked to start a new life under the sun. I was excited for them, until I started hearing my boyfriend's mom start to pressure him to move with them.

Obviously I can't move down there until I graduate high school, but thankfully the lease for his apartment doesn't end until September of this year, so we have time to think about all I am about to explain.

I have lived in the Midwest for all of my life. I have lived in the same house, gone to the same school, had the same friends. So if you can't tell, moving away to start a new life at this age sounds pretty terrifying.

My boyfriend does a lot of computer programming / game development / graphic design / a lot of other stuff I don't even know the correct names for. Nonetheless, he's pretty freaking talented and smart. I, on the other hand, have no real hobbies and not one clue about what I want to study in college or do once I graduate from said college. 

The relationship I'm in with my boyfriend is very serious, and my parents know it. I basically already live at his place because I'm over there so often. So, moving to start a potential new life in the desert doesn't sound half bad when I imagine doing it all with him. 

Here's the catch: I have no idea how to make it work. 

As for before this potential change, our plans are for me to move in to his place with him after I graduate high school this summer. My parents acknowledge this. We both plan to work full time, and possibly part time on some nights or weekends, in order to save up some good money. If we moved, this money saved would all be spent on the move and the new apartment in Phoenix.

As for the actual moving down there, here is his vision. He goes down there this September. His parents refuse to let my boyfriend and I stay with them at their new house for a few months while my boyfriend and I get new jobs, and while he gets his 3 months steady income down so that he can actually get permission and trust to rent a new apartment. Therefore, I plan to stay at home and spend time with my family for the few months that it takes for him to stay with his family, find a job, get 3 months steady income, find a new place, etc etc. At that rate, I would probably end up in Arizona by January 2019.

My plan I feel like might be a bit more thought out. I would prefer to stay here in the Midwest for four years while him and I go to college. We can either stay in his current apartment (or find a new place around here if we really wanted to) or we can move in with my parents and rent out/renovate their two bedroom one bathroom basement (doesn't sound too exciting but hey, it's cheap). This way, we could also go to college, but I wouldn't have to worry about leaving my whole life, on top of going to college, on top of working full time in a place I've never even been to and with people that I don't know. After we both finish our four years of cheap college here, we can use our year that we get before beginning to pay off our student loans to find nice jobs in Arizona, possibly rent a house instead of a shitty apartment, maybe even get married before we get down there so that my parents can help us pay for it (they refuse to pay for it if it happens in Arizona because they don't want to have to go all the way down there AND help pay for the reception). This way, we will be set to really start our lives, and we will both be 100% sure that we will be together for the rest of our lives, and I will be reassured in knowing that I'm not moving to Arizona with a boyfriend just to move back because we break up for some reason.

He has had trouble finding a good job because he doesn't have any college education. He already has the experience. But here in the Midwest, it's a pretty big deal if you don't have a degree. All of the banks, railroad companies, and corporations down here that are hiring for the computer skills that he has, also require a college education for the most part, even if you have the experience. That is, according to him and what he has told me. That is why he is so eager to get to the west coast and find better opportunities for the skills he has and the things he likes to do. A lot more eager than I am.

I apologize now if this whole situation sounds super confusing. It is really confusing to him and I too! I know it is going to be a near constant subject on my mind from now until the time his current lease is up, so I am just desperate at this point for another opinion. I'll stay active on this post, so if there are any more questions, please feel free to ask away!

270,"So, for context, I'm 25/female. 

I feel like I've done all the right things so far in life and I'm so disappointed that I'm living back with my mom and am about to be unemployed. 

I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in 2016. I studied History (yeah, yeah...I know), and I didn't graduate with any debt and graduated at the top of my class. Soon after, I joined the Peace Corps. I decided to leave my post for safety and health reasons. Subsequent to this experience, I've been spending the last year as an AmeriCorps VISTA worker and I've been keeping up on odd jobs.

I recently moved back in with my mother because I just couldn't afford to have my own place (see: VISTA salary). My previous odd job was working for a rich Jewish landlord as a writer and a groundskeeper in addition to my VISTA work. He didn't make me pay any rent on the place I was living. But I decided to get out of there since he often would make comments toward me that made me uncomfortable; such as, ""Girls your age are attractive but the problem is that they're usually not very intelligent and are boring."" I also always felt indebted to him and was in an isolated community without friends or support. After a lot of deliberation, I decided it would probably be the best thing to do would be to go home and get on my feet somehow.

I've been back for about a week, and I feel awful. I've been applying to jobs non-stop and have had one interview so far that I was rejected for. I recently went back to my old job that I had when I was in college and they offered to hire me again. I'm just so disappointed in myself that I'm in exactly the same place (if not, worse) before I graduated from school. When I was in college, I had a car and reasonable savings. Now I don't have a car and have about $1,000 to my name.

I've honestly been thinking about suicide. I just feel like I'm at a dead-end. People in my life always told me that if I went to school, did internships (I've done 4 internships now), graduated and had no debt then I'd be gravy. I'm still going to school (I'm using my VISTA award to take pre-req courses). I think I'd like to become an Occupational Therapist, but I have no idea how I'd even begin to pay for graduate school when all is said and done. 

How do I relieve my anxiety in regard to this situation? I feel like I won't ever be able to afford to live some place on my own or have the emotional strength to do so.

Reasons I don't want to go

We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that.

It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at.

My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive.

I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to

276,"Hi, this is my first post. Sorry if I’m rambling and if I don’t do this right, but I’ve been having any issue I was hoping someone could help with.
I’ve been broken up with my ex for quite some time. The relationship started out good but eventually he became very abusive. It was mainly mentally and emotionally, but there was a couple times it was physical, too. After he got addicted to heroin it just became worse and we had to end things. Although, he’s done so many bad things to me, I can’t seem to let go. Specifically, I have a box of everything and anything he’s ever given me from letters, to lighters, mix cds, and pretty much anything else you can imagine. It’s been so long that I know I need to get rid of the things in order to help me heal but most of it is from the good days and just going through the things gives me such a breakdown. The idea of getting rid of any of it sends me in such a panic and I don’t know what to do.

278,"Hi, it's my first time posting. I just wanted advice on how to get myself out of a hole that I've dug quite deep.  

&amp;nbsp;

It all started when my friend suggested we do an exchange program our university offers. I was hesitant honestly, but I wasn't going to totally pass on it. I was tasked to do the researching and budgeting since she was busy with a full time co-op. We ended up choosing a school in Australia that appealed to us, but my already hesitant self was even more turned off by the idea when I did the budgeting. It costs $10k - 15k for 1 semester abroad (understandable, but still a very steep price). I expressed my concerns which got her slightly concerned too. Everything changed though when things like scholarships and whatnot were an option. Now, my friend is a straight A, well rounded, ""how are you so perfect?"", kind of person so I knew she wouldn't have a hard time nabbing scholarships. I, on the other hand, am not.  

&amp;nbsp;

Just a side note here: Like I had mentioned earlier, I was hesitant just on the overall idea of doing this abroad school thing because I didn't need to do it. It wouldn't help me graduate any faster. One of my biggest problems is the fact that I have a hard time saying 'no'... So yeah, that's how I ended up getting roped into this. She's also my only close friend from university so I almost felt like saying no would be disappointing... I don't like disappointing people.  

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, back to exposition. Stupid me decided to go through the whole application process for the exchange. Like seriously. Around September-October is when I officially got accepted into the school in Australia. You'd think I'd be celebrating, right? HELL NO. I purposely didn't hand in some requirements so that I wouldn't get accepted, but lo and behold I was! I could've still declined their offer at this point, but due to a combination of just being busy with school, other unrelated issues, and my anxieties regarding losing my only friend, I didn't decline. I wanted to tell her after our 'final' meeting with the Abroad school program people about wanting to back out, but she was so excited for it that I just couldn't bring myself to do it.  

&amp;nbsp;

Now it's January 25 and she had planned to fly out Jan 31. I've officially declined the offer from the Australian school, but I have yet to tell my friend. I am a complete idiot, yes, I know. This has caused me so much anxiety that I've noticed myself pushing her away instead. She's been wanting to meet up to exchange gifts and I keep telling her I'm busy. Her birthday passed on Jan 21 and I didn't greet her. I haven't even wrapped her Christmas gift.  

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't had much luck with friends ever since I've moved to this country. (context: I moved to Canada in 2011 from elsewhere and it was 11th grade. It was very lonely and depressing times.) I didn't want to ruin this 1 friendship, but I think I officially have. I need advice, I know what I have to do, but I don't know how to do it. Advice would be much appreciated.

Edit: Forgot to mention that one of my childhood friends is in Australia too and is excited to see me when I get there! I have to break the news to here too. I hate myself.",25Jan2018,3

289,"I don't even know where to begin so I'll just get right into it. I am a 20 year old male and in April last year an old high school friend of mine started working at the same place as I. It was a dead end, depressing, mundane retail job so naturally I was pretty excited to see a familiar face. Anyway, turns out we still clicked really well and after 3 months of working together, we both decided that we wanted to go travelling as we had nothing to lose as neither of us had a career locked down or an SO or anything to keep us here.

Initially I wanted to go for 3 months, he wanted to go for 6 and as time progressed we saw no reason to restrict ourselves and bought a year's work and holiday visa for Australia. That way we can do either, or stay for the year if we enjoy it.

He left for a different job around September and we've kept in contact through social media, with the odd meeting up here and there, but we don't work together so it's difficult to chat as much as we used to.

Since leaving, he has had a few issues with family and things and is increasingly unhappy with current life so is excited as anything to get up and go and is pretty much set on going for the full year.

The issue though is that... I'm the opposite. I've really started to take a liking to my current life and I'm having second thoughts about leaving. I haven't had a real girlfriend ever, and 2 months ago I met a really sweet, amazing girl and we click really well but we obviously can't be together if I'm going away as it's not fair. I've really fallen for her and the timing is the absolute worst but it really gets me down when I think about what could have been...

On top of falling for her, there's been a lot of general improvements in my life and I'm much much happier with how it is but it's too late to turn back and I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I want to go anymore... I know deep down that it will be really good, but I've not even left yet and I'm already homesick. I'm going to go anyway because it's not fair on my friend if I don't, but if I had been travelling alone I would have already cancelled.

There's no way I'd be able to go for a year but he thinks that's what we both want and I don't know what to say. I don't want to crush his dreams but at the same time, the thought of leaving has already had me crying the past few nights and I don't think I could handle being away for so long.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I've never lived on my own before, never even been on a plane before and yet next Wednesday I'm flying 10500 miles away to live with an old friend for an extended period of time. I'm shitting myself to be totally honest.

The stress of everything has me so worried and I honestly can't stop thinking about that girl and I'm scared when I come back she won't be interested anymore. What would you people do if you were in my position?

Please if anyone has some advice, please please share. I really could use it. Thank you.

Edit: I forgot to add that my money situation really is quite poor at the moment and I definitely do not have enough money to go without working.

One kid a coupe years older than me introduced himself to my friend from home and we've both been hanging out with him, but I have trouble holding conversation or even speaking at all in front of him.

This hunger pains have always been weird, they would usually go if I'm ever hungry. I do have OCD, so that could be tied with this. But I don't know if this is normal.

Basically, it goes into a circle:

Firstly I worry, oddly, about being hungry or having the feeling again (specifically the worry)

Then I start getting pains in my stomach (most likely placebo, because I wasn't hungry before)

This brings on many side effects and makes my anxiety even worse!

It then starts again and again, creating even more anxiety over the worry.

As I said before, it has gone away after a month or two of thinking about it. But it has recently plagued my mind due to me going on a Rome trip.

307,"So I️’m a freshman at a very small college with roughly 500 students.  At the beginning of my first semester, a close friend of mine (also a freshman) started dating someone.  After about 2 weeks, they both felt like they had rushed things and decided to just be friends and agreed to not date for the entire semester.   This is where things started to get tricky.  After about a week, she went on a date with another guy and felt really bad about I️t.  To avoid confusion we’ll call this guy John.  So she called up my friend, (We’ll call him Andrew) and wanted to talk to him about the whole situation.   He was a little blunt and told her that he doesn’t think she’s ready for a relationship.  She cried on his shoulder for a few hours and they came to a good resolution and stayed friends.  Everything was alright.   

A few months have gone by and things have turned for the worst for her because of John.  He’s manipulated her into isolating herself from all of her friends, got her to basically move in with him, and pressures her into drinking so he can have his way with her. Now she is rarely on campus and never hangs out with anyone because “John doesn’t want me to”  and whenever someone tries to make plans she says “Only if John is okay with I️t”.  She’s lost her ability to think for herself.   Since the Spring semester started, we’ve been trying to help her out and get her away from John but it’s been of no avail.   John noticed this and forced her to go to the academic dean and accuse Andrew of harassment for their incident back in October.  She told them a completely different story and has made up bullshit lies.  The only reason I️ know this is because my girlfriend is her last friend and she told her everything.  She didn’t even think about accusing Andrew nor did she think I️t was harassment. John forced her into I️t. 

What I️ need advice on is how to prove Andrew’s innocence.  This isn’t going to be taken to court, but the college will punish him their own way by suspending or losing his scholarship (he is a genius and has a full ride). We have text messages between Andrew and her but the dean isn’t using them as evidence for some reason.  Another thing I️ need help with is how to get her to come to her senses and get the farthest away from John as possible.  Thank you for your help.

This girl’s boyfriend is manipulating her into secluding herself from everyone and is accusing my friend of harassment because he doesn’t like him.

308,"I'll be going to university this year and I've been looking at potential careers paths that may be available to me if I graduate. I'm going to be studying History with French but that's not all too relevant to the idea I came up with.

I've always had an interest in the Army and potentially enlisting - it was kind-of my backup plan for if I did terribly in my GCSEs but fortunately I made it to sixth form. I've got an unconditional offer for a university and this is an idea I've thought of. Please keep in mind that I'm relatively clueless when it comes to the financial aspects of the idea so any explanations as to why I'm right/wrong in my thought process would be very much appreciated.

The idea is this: apply for a British Army bursary to go to university, (hopefully) complete my degree, go to Sandhurst, (hopefully) graduate as an Officer and then serve as much as I need or want to within the military. The reasoning behind the plan is the bursary will go towards reducing the yearly fee I need to pay to the university (£9,250 originally, £7,250 with the bursary deduction). Also, a Second Lieutenant in the BA gets somewhere around £25,000-£35,000 yearly pay from what I saw on the British Government website. So let's say I served 5 years in the army following my graduation from Sandhurst. I'd have around £100,000 saved up due to not having to spend as much on housing, food etc. as I would if I weren't in the army. This would go a long way towards repaying my student loan and maybe putting a deposit on the house.

Once I've finished my service within the Army, I thought I might go back to university to complete a Postgraduate Certificate of Education so that I can go into teaching as a CIV. 

So, that's my plan at the moment. Also, as financially-orientated as this sound, I have always had an interest in joining the military so I really do think it'd be something I enjoy. I'd really appreciate any comments regarding the plan and any flaws it has within it, as I'm sure there is. Thanks a lot!",25Jan2018,2

I see one advertised for $3000 ( typical rate). Clicking through the pictures when my brain kind of glitches.

""00, that's the number my grandpa's car had, right?""
""That's the color scheme of my grandpa's car, right?""
""My mom has a picture of his on the race track just like this.""
"" That's my grandpa's car!""
The add has his sons name on it, to call.
I remember when I was little visiting him and him telling me all about, one of my most vivid memories of being little was being in his garage looking at the car and listening to the stories.  I convinced him to start fixing up another old car he had.
He had told me if I got a team together I could have the race car, that offer was retracted when I said I had a group of people ready and willing.
My family moved away from that side of the family partly because of the cars causing fights because people being given cars or promised cars then ending up being given to someone else. The other part is because they were crazy in general.

318,"Hear me out here, okay?

I now understand why people don’t always come forward when bad things happen, and I can’t explain how.

I am in a gym class with disabled people. I myself, am one too. But not physically, only mentally. My disability makes it hard to interact with other people. Most of the time I cannot look people in the eyes, or talk to them. This has made me very sensitive over the years I’ve had this, and when little things go wrong I break down and cannot respond to anyone.

So I’m turning to reddit for help. Because I know I react sensitively to many things, so my head isn’t always straight. 

So, Reddit, today one of my gym teachers, let’s call him M, told me to follow him and sit down next to him. He pulled a chair next to him and patted it, motioning me to sit down. So I follow, who doesn’t want to take a seat in gym instead of interacting? Me.

I willingly sit down, anxious by everything around me. My helper wasn’t there at the moment so I couldn’t do anything else. Not to mention I didn’t want to ignore M again. 

I’m sitting there for a few more minutes when another teacher approaches, let’s call him R. R approaches me angrily saying in a rude manner, “Get up. Get up. It is not fair to anyone else that you’re sitting down and they’re standing up.” I am shocked, I have never been talked to that way from a teacher, and immediately break down in tears, like said above, I’m sensitive. 

M never said anything about wanting me to sit down, so it looked like I pulled the chair out myself. Like it was my own idea. It was not. 

But R is not the teacher I am here to talk about. I was shaken and broken down, and tears were on my face, so I didn’t move. I sat there crying and showing my face into my hands, waiting for the school therapist to come get me and bring me to her office. Because that’s what they usually do.

I’m cringing at myself writing this. I feel so embarrassed for what happened next. 

Another gym teacher comes. Let’s call him Y. He approaches me angrily and says, “I don’t want to hear it. I don’t want to hear it. Get up.” Not to mention these teachers are specifically there to deal with disabled kids. So Y try’s pulling the chair out from under me, and I start crying more. A teacher had never done that to me. 

I would like to mention again that I am mentally disabled and have a tough time with situations. These teachers have known me for months and I think should know what I react good to and what I don’t, since I’ve had multiple breakdowns before. 

I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m overreacting, but just please take into account the paragraph before this. I am extremely sensitive. 

So I’m asking what I should make of this situation. ",25Jan2018,4

A month or so later he asked for his money back ($100 buy-in). We voted and again it was unanimous: No refund. Ironically, the one league member who was still on good terms with him won our league. He refunded the guy his $100 with his winnings. On one hand, it was his money to do what he wants with. On the other hand, the league took a vote and he disregarded that. Some members want him out of the league as well. Some are not sure. The guy who refunded the money doesn't know that we know about this yet.

333,"I love my girlfriend. So much. She's from a Christian background, so she's, or was formerly, abstinent. But eventually, one thing led to another, and we had sex. I thought it was great, but she was so guilty afterwards, it tore me apart to have seen her like that. We said we'd never do it again. But we do. And she always comes out of it the same way, which in turn makes me feel terrible. We almost ended up taking a ""break"" not too long ago, before talking it out, and once again saying we wouldn't do it again. But I suppose you can guess what happened next.

So, I don't really know what to do anymore. I don't ever initiate it with her, despite her complaints. She always comes onto me, and even then I tell her No, that she'll feel so bad, that it's not worth it, she always swears she won't this time. That she really wants it this time. Each time I say no more and more. But, sometimes, it is hard to resist a hot sexy naked woman. And even when I do manage to deter her, she ignores me, becomes pouty and upset. Won't talk to me. Which also hurts, especially when the day had been going so great between us.

I don't expect some super solution, but any advice as to how to maybe help the situation, to help me resist, or anything of the sort, or... I don't even know. Anything is welcome.

334,"As an animal lover, I never thought I would find myself in this position, but how shitty is it to ask my boyfriend to get rid of his dog? 
A little backstory: We have been together for a year and he and his black lab (3 years old) have been living with me for 8 months of that. When we started dating it was obvious that he and his dog were a little too attached, as in this dog has serious separation anxiety. So much that he won't even eat if my boyfriend isn't around, but whatever, I figured I could help turn their relationship into a healthy one and I love dogs.
I WAS. SO. WRONG. 
This will probably be easiest if I just make you a list:

He never stops growling. Not aggressively, and not necessarily at anything just low volume CONSTANT grumps throughout the day. Particularly if he wants affection from my bf and isn't getting it, but I cannot express enough how much this happens the entire day for no other reason than what seems he's just bored. 

He is uncomfortably sexually charged. This may just be me personifying his actions, but I am not even kidding when I say I (and our female roommate) feel incredibly uncomfortable around this dog. Whenever either of us give him attention or he's excited we're around, he starts aggressively licking himself and if you try to make him stop he just anxiously licks himself more. This happens multiple times a day. And when we have sex? We used to let him lay just about anywhere in  the room on the floor, like my dog who also lives with us, but shortly after we moved in he started licking himself then too, and if we try to lock him out of the room, he freaks the fuck out and starts shaking/whining if we don't let him in. We just stopped having sex....

I swear he is genuinely upset that he can't just be my boyfriend's girlfriend himself. If he is in the other room, and I walk up and hug/touch my boyfriend in general, he starts whining. Same for when we cuddle. Every morning as I am getting ready for work while the bf sleeps, if I walk on his side of the bed, the dog gets really defensive and starts growling. Again, not in a way that makes me thing he will bite me, but just enough to say "" what are you doing, I don't like what you're doing, go away."" 

Whenever we have friends over, the licking himself doesn't happen so much in large groups, he just nervously approaches each person and whines until they give him attention, only to immediately run away because he doesn't like people. He does this to everyone in the group over and over again until we finally have to keep him in the bedroom until they leave. (That happens about 10 minutes into their arrival)

Every single person that has visited and tried to interact with this dog has commented on how weird, crazy, or just shitty he is. And while all of these things probably seem really insignificant, I can not express enough that all of these things happen CONSTANTLY throughout the day when applicable. 

And now that I have explained the behavior, let me say that I have no idea what to do. Because I feel for this dog, he must be really unhappy to be acting like this every second of every day. Being this stressed out sounds like the worst life. But we've tried making sure he gets more exercise and establishing more boundaries and now it just seems like it's getting worse. At this point, I don't feel that guilty about making my boyfriend get rid of him, but I do care about where he would go. And there is no way we will find a good home to relocate him with this behavior. Even if we did by chance, I worry about him starving himself and I absolutely refuse sending him to a shelter. 

I love my boyfriend and outside of this very large problem we have a great relationship, but I have been dealing with this shit for way too long and I don't think I can take it anymore :(",25Jan2018,2
336,"Let me preface this by stating I travel a shit ton for work. I move every 3 weeks to 2 months and it is hard to date with my lifestyle this way. I end up usually just hooking up which is fine although deep down I yearn for something deep and authentic. 

So most of the men I meet are from the online world obviously. I put the whole dating thing on pause for awhile but decided I would look in the town I was headed for next since I would be there for a couple months. I do skim through craigslist personals although 99% of the time it’s not anything I ever make an attempt on. This time I came across a post in the dating section from a man my age with writings that totally spoke my language. He came across really insightful, grounded, deep, thoughtful and on the same frequency in terms of the kind of relationship that satisfies the soul. I was flabbergasted by his words to be honest. He was really clear about wanting a partner in life.  So I decided to respond with a well thought out message and lots of pictures of myself. He said absolutely, 100% yes so we exchanged numbers and started to converse a bit daily. It was so refreshing to talk with him and he did things that drew me in. Like send videos riding his bmx bike. Record himself playing piano and send it to me. Send me screenshots of the music he was listening too. That sort of thing and it was reciprocated. Now, this was before we had met in person as I was not in town yet. One night we’re talking, I know he’s drunk and he starts asking questions of a sexual nature. I entertain him a little but not overly then he just started sending me pictures of his ass and I was like woahhhh. Then he sent a  video of him jerking off. I immediately set a boundary and said I want to explore all this stuff with you in time but right now I really just want to get to know you. I thought that was the track we were on. Then he said he was sorry he just got out of a long term relationship and he was in a casual phase. I told him to get fucking real and that maybe he didn’t see a future with me but his post conveyed the complete opposite and I didn’t appreciate being lied to or messed with. He didn’t respond back but over the week continued to like my IG posts. Fast forward a week, I’m in town and decide to turn on the discovery future Tinder it up. Later that night I come across him of course and think how funny it would be it we matched. So I hearted him and we fucking matched! Hahaha. All day/all night goes by and I asked him if he was gonna nut up and say hello?  He unmatched us. No big deal moving on. Then later I decide I wanna find a fwb while I’m here. I make a casual encounter post with a mature, clear vibe of what I’m looking for. And guess what? Yeah, you guessed it. He responds and says “It’s me. Let me fulfill your needs whatever they may be. Choose me” I know it’s him because his email is attached to his response but my post/email is anonymous so I wasn’t 100% sure he knew. So I asked if he knew who he was talking to and he said yes. I feel like I’m in an episode of Days of our Lives meets the Twilight Zone. I’m torn between wanting to say kick rocks but feeling like the universe keeps delivering him on my doorstep.

With this transfer, the school is asking for a tax summery from 2015 of my filed taxes. I did not file and I sent in a request to the IRS so send back a letter stating so. Until I turn in this letter I cannot access my financial aid to pay off my tuition for the semester. As is, it's only $2000 but that's $2000 I don't have. I have the funds, my FASFA is filled out and fine and I had financial aid funds from my last school, I've been awarded enough to get me through this semester but this new school will not allow it to be processed until I turn in this letter.

It's been over a month and a half since I sent out two requests to receive a non-filing statement, and I've got nothing back. If I don't get this letter by February 2nd, I will be forcefully removed from my classes. I'm so angry because I've done everything right and my student accounts and FASFA information are all totally okay, I've been awarded aide and I just can't get it because of this stupid hang up.

I got married young (20) and shortly after getting married my wife started to develop severe depression/anxiety and was diagnosed with OCD. She didnt work and had a hard time adjusting. So just recently she started getting better after many therapy appointments and some meds later and she is now going to school and will be done shortly. As for me i have mainly just been working. Being the sole provider i didnt really have the luxury to not work and go to school. I didnt really go in a field i was interested in it was just about paying the bills and keeping us afloat. 

Now i love my wife, she is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me and i love her to death, i would never change that part of my life.
