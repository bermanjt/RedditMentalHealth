0,"A few girls on my floor in college residence asked if I would move in with them next year after they broke things off with another friend. I‚Äôm considering a few things:
- I‚Äôve only known these girls for a few weeks but I really like them
- I‚Äôm a pretty even tempered person, so I don‚Äôt see us having problems (but what if??)
- the house is farther away than I would like, but cheaper than my other options
- I‚Äôll be outnumbered by three people who have been friends for a long time - I‚Äôm worried about being overruled on everything

I work at a pub and a group of girls sitting and drinking and had a guy there with them too  and one stopped to ask me can they play music on their phones I said no we arnt allowed to play music and I said if it was up to me I‚Äôd let them but it isn‚Äôt etc and I walked off to get glasses from another table when she said something to her friend ‚Äúhe‚Äôs...‚Äù (but I didn‚Äôt hear what she said from there) who laughed and on my way back past  she looked back at me and said ‚Äòwhat time do you finish?‚Äô I paused a little and said ‚Äòoh....10pm‚Äô (it was 8:40pm at this time) and then she turned away and said ‚Äòoh so you don‚Äôt want to drink with us then‚Äô, is this a bad thing?

4,"Hello fellow fellows,

&amp;#x200B;

So a few weeks ago I've decided to ""put my shit together"", as elegant people say. I had been in a really bad state for two years, failing at university and all, and I managed to take it back in hand just before it was really too late.

My first improvement was to 100% stop video games, which I played all day long. Given that I could just uninstall everything from my computer, it was quite easy and did a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I have a other nasty habits that I am looking forward to quit, including masturbating too often and eating too much sugary stuff. This is much more difficult for me to take care of since I can't physically force myself to not do it.

On the other hand, I'm playing sports three days a week and I'm trying to do a bit of exercise the other days, but I really struggle to develop this habit.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I guess I'm looking for is, on one hand, tips for self-control and restricting myself; on the other hand tips to be more disciplined.

Thanks to all !",09Dec2018,1
5,"So basically I just started a new job, which involves me sitting behind a till with another girl for 7 hours straight. The problem is, this girl hates me. I have no idea why. At first we got on really well, but after 3 hours or so she just stopped talking to me and became a bitch. Its really awkward cause the shop is very quiet, so we just spend most of our time sitting in complete silence for 7 hours straight. Whenever I try to start a conversation, she gives one word answers. She tells me off loudly when customers are in the shop. She makes me so nervous when I'm serving a customer, cause she'll just watch with like a hard, judging expression. She's really weird about her sense of space as well, I wanted to get past her, so I put my hand gently on her shoulder and was like excuse me. She jumped back and was like 'Dont touch me just ask me to move next time' and she like snarled at me. And what's upsetting is that shes really nice to everyone else. Ive seen her with other workers, and shes super smiley and nice. I just dont know what I did wrong to make her hate me, but it's making me hate my worküò©",09Dec2018,1
6,"So my two roommates and I ( they're both dating each other) have recently have had a fight and decided to not be friends but to be civil since we have about 5 more months on the lease. Now we've all been doing our things and basically ignoring each other.

Recently one roommate who has some issues and can't let anything go has been doing little petty things to piss me off. One of them happens to have given my professional email to some website or signed me up for some spam mail with girls asking for sex and so on. I am sure he's done this because I used this exact email for the landlord for next year's lease but I am now in the process of getting a subleaser so I can sign somewhere else. Basically he has the email as it was sent to the entire group to keep everyone updated on the subleaser progress. So the first one I got was basically the night of our big fight which seems like quite a coincidence. Then, he's also talked about doing this to other people in petty revenge. 

So my question is how can I stop these spam emails which all have different senders but with basically the same messages because I don't want to ruin my good email account and have to make a new one? ",09Dec2018,1

Naturally, I'm somewhat of a nerd, but I did play a lot of contact sports in high school (hockey, American football, and rugby) and lift weights regularly, despite a relatively soft upbringing (upper middle class suburban neighbourhood). Anyways, I don't want to join the military because I want the action and I have a lot of entrepreneurial (and other) goals of my own (so it's not lack of direction or looking for discipline, I already have both). However, I feel a very strong sense of obligation that I should do a stint in the military and serve for my country. I can't really explain it, but I care about the country. I know rationally me joining will make next to no difference (especially since I'm in Canada) and it might slow down the rate at which I can achieve my entrepreneurial goals. Yet, it just feels like something I have to do. I've been feeling it for awhile, but especially after reading about President George H. W. Bush who came from an affluent background, but still served for his country honourably.

8,"Hello dear fellow users,

&amp;#x200B;

When I recently ""studied"" through the Internet, I found many vulnerabilities in a relatively well-known pornography website. I went through these gaps, which gave me access to user data and the website content of the page.

&amp;#x200B;

The security holes are serious and I am now in a difficult situation:

1. I could blackmail the users or operators of the site. (Which is out of the question due to my morality despite tight purse.)

2. I could easily build an alternative site using the datasets and provide more security for the users. (morally questionable)

3. I could secretly feed advertising in my favor on the website to make a profit. (morally questionable)

4. I could inform the users and / or operators of the site.

5. I could completely delete users' records to exclude further data leaks.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you can advise me and understand that I will specify for the safety of users and website no exact web address. For further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I don't have anywhere to live, I struggle making friends and my family are lovely people but I feel as if Ive just been a burden and a let down to them,

I'm not stupid or lazy I've just had enough of living, everything I've ever done has never worked out and I'm at total rock bottom,

For the last ten years I've spent Christmas alone as I feel spending time with family will just ruin heir holiday, This year being extra hard as I can't even afford gifts for them to show my appreciation for everything they have done for me

I'm battling hard with alcohol and drug abuse (I really don't want to go back down that hole it's taken me so long to become nondependant) This is really just a last resort message to the people on the forum to see if anyone can offer any help

I don't have any things or anyone to talk to and is basically just a goodbye message as I don't think I can cope living like this for much longer

12,"To people looking from the outside it seems like I have a great life. I have good grades, will graduate from college pretty young, and I'm involved in several different extra curricular activities which I do pretty okay at.

The thing is, I'm sick of it all. I just do the things I do because people expect me to. I have narcissistic dad and he scared me into choosing Civil Engineering because ""that's the only kind of engineering that makes good money"". I was 15 and didn't know better so I just did. That's how its been for most things in my life. Granted some of the extracurricular activities I do are things I'm interested in (chess, music, soccer goalie) but I really don't know how to explain when I say I feel ""forced"" to do them. 

Everyday I feel like I just want go crawl in a hole and do nothing. And just like, live there forever.

I'll be graduating in May and these thoughts always bother me- fine, I graduate, get a job, start making money, then what next? I'm not even interested in being in a relationship. I'm too 'lazy' to be in one and feel like relationships are just more stress and problems. So starting a family is out of it.

I avoid people in real life, on campus I live alone and don't really like it if my friends want to visit. I'm always making excuses so they'll leave me alone in my cave. I feel horrible when I do that but then I know I'm probably the worst company anyone can have.

Basically, I have no long term goals. Nothing. I don't want to become anything or really do anything. I feel like I'm just bored of life and buzz through everyday doing so many things I'm 'supposed' to.

Feeling like this everyday has got me wondering what life is about anyway. I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about suicide so many times. Except these aren't the ""sad"" kind of suicidal thoughts, they're more 'blank'. 

It also makes me feel guilty too because I'm relatively privileged and I know there are people who would actually live my life better if they were me. 

I wonder why I was born.

Right now I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or not. I just felt like ranting. And hoping maybe anyone could tell me what's wrong with me.",09Dec2018,1

&amp;#x200B;

G and I knew each other from middle school until about half way through college. We were really good friends up until the end; I helped him through his parent's divorce in middle school, he helped me through my struggles with anxiety/depression in high school. But summer before college things got a bit weird. 

He got kinda... clingy. Like he wanted to hang out pretty much every weekend, and got mad when I couldn't spend every single weekend with him. At first,  I ignored it because I figured he was just anxious that I was leaving, thought maybe I'd think I'd outgrown him 

 I would hang out when I could on weekends I was home, the more I had to pull away and focus on school, the more and more clingy he got. When I got into a medical school in my home town, he would not stop talking about us moving in together like it was already an agreed upon thing. I dodged the question as long as I could and finally told him I needed to live with someone who could understand what I was going through and would be as serious as I was, he seemed to get it and never brought it up again.  I ended up living with another medical student. 

When we would hang out... looking back I think he was trying to get me to show him I cared about him? Like on his birthday he asked me to buy him a stack of manga about $90 and I said no and got him one of the books for $10. Or any time we talked on the phone what should have been a 15 minute conversation turned into 1.5 hours of just BS.  

I kept the relationship going as long as I could, in spite of dreading being around him. I did what I could to make it work. I tried to pull back enough that I could maintain the relationship but he kept trying to get closer. 

Then the suicide attempt happened. He'd had some emotional issues for a long time, some anxiety/depression, family problems from a super ugly divorce/remarriage by his dad, learning issues from ADHD, and the one thing he had going for him was his job at Target. He called me and told me he was going to swallow a bunch of his mom's narcotics and kill himself, and when I tried to talk him down he kept trying to get me to come over and hang out. I knew better than that, and instead kept him talking while frantically texted his family members asking if anyone knew where he was. Found out he was at his mom's house, called the cops, they found him with a fist full of pills in his hand he claimed were narcotics, talked him into going with them and got him admitted to inpatient psych. 

BUT. Next day I found out that the pills were just some generic Tylenol or Advil or something, and not even enough to give you more than a stomach-ache or some mild liver damage. He absolutely KNEW that was the case, and he used the pills to fake the entire thing. I was so horrified by how far he was going for attention that I blocked him on everything. 

And now TODAY he emails me, claiming he was in just a really really dark place, that he never meant to hurt me and regretted everything, and wanting to try again now that he's been through therapy and is doing a lot better.

I want to be able to both be shirtless and show my face, but I'm worried about 1) what would happen if peers discover my channel, or 2) if a future employer discovers my channel (I want to become an engineer).**

Hey. So, I'm a male, 23, and am getting some stuff ready to start up an ASMR YouTube channel, because it's fun, and I want to make some extra money (yes, I know, it won't be a whole lot).

A lot of what people like to listen to in ASMR videos are people recording the sounds make when their stomach is digesting. People will show themselves laying down, with a microphone next to their stomach, sometimes baring their stomach, and the audio will be of their stomach growling or digesting. This is my favorite ASMR trigger.

However, I have a problem:

* If I show both my stomach and my face, then I could be identified by my friends, family, or worse, a future employer, doing this potentially-embarrassing stomach-growling ASMR trigger video. (*I plan to become an aerospace engineer, which has VERY high standards for professionalism.*)
* If I don't show my face, I feel like it would make my channel far less personal, and potentially hurt it.
* If I show my face but not my belly/digestion sounds, I would be unable to engage in my favorite ASMR trigger.

34,"Hi there everyone,

I am asking for advice or someone to suggest anything that can allow me to feel better. I am currently a sophomore at an ""anti-social, academically rigorous"" university in a big city. I feel like I have no friends. I sometimes talk to people, but just at face value, nothing beyond that.

In high school, I loved all the students and staff during high school, and I considered almost everyone my friend. I tried to make others happy, and they all definitely made me happy. I got along with everyone, I was on teams, was in clubs, and was a popular kid. Not *stereotypical I'm better than everyone* popular, but ""known in the school by people"" popular. I tried to be a 'friendly guy' towards everyone and by the time I graduated, I had some sort of conversation with everyone in my grade and even many younger students.

Now in post-secondary, I don't know what to do to better myself now that I am on my own or how to make friends. My school is considered anti-social and I am terrible at forcing friendships. I have *maybe* 3 'friends' I talk to during school, but when classes are done and I leave campus, it's just me and the city. I don't go shopping, I don't go and explore, I don't even do anything I liked to do growing up like play music or take photos. I go straight to my apartment.

I feel like I do nothing now, and I don't have actual friends. I sometimes text my parents back home, and they think I'm loving school. But honestly, I haven't loved school since high school. I was doing really well academically, and I'm still doing alright I guess, but I feel so lost and useless now.

Maybe I'm calling for a friend here, or maybe someone in a similar situation can give me advice on how to find things and people that make me a better person. I know I am capable, but I really don't know what to do, where to go, or who to talk to.

Thank you and love you all, HW",09Dec2018,1
35,"Basically: I frequently look at the social media accounts of people I'm no longer friends with or people that I know don't like me.

37,"I apologize if this is the wrong place to post this, I am a alcoholic/sex/addict. I have been struggling to battle with this disease for 11 years now. I put all of those diseases into remission together more than 7 times: 2 years, 4 years, and my most recent was 3 years.  Those missing years had quiet a few of either 3 -9 months, and albeit very important, they don‚Äôt add a lot to this overall story. It‚Äôs important to know that I took very little time to see WHY outside of AA NA and SLA mottos, steps, fellowship etc. because those are all great. 

The actual story is that I am in my heroin longest run of toxic destruction of 4 yrs. I‚Äôm not someone you meet in the wild and notice ‚Äúthat‚Äôs an addict‚Äô‚Äù I get presentable for work. I do most of my use at home after work, with maybe a bag or two during day if I started feeling lethargic. No one noticed  or said anything, not like my alcoholic/pot days. It was a tough roller coaster four years. More bad times than good if I‚Äôm honest, but the highs made me completely forget everything anyway! Total oblivion. 


I worked for a fairly small and pretty loose company that had access to some money. Even though I was being paid WAYYY too much, even in a semi-retail situation, after a few months of having my finances together, I found a way to blow though those weekly paychecks I then started to creep and take a $20 here , maybe $100 here and then nothing for 3 or 4 months. 

Of course as with any opiate my sickness was getting worse, I rarely took more than $40-$60 worth a weekday, would get less if I had to scrounge at the my store (which I hated). 

This past August was a breach into the stores vault. I was not there and I have no access to it, but we we were all dna tested and questioned with lawyers. 


7 months later and nothing had been heard about it. I It was a Sunday, was broke, low on car gas so I was gonna sneak into the store and grab 3 dollars. Before I can even enter it my boss comes into her car and asks me what I‚Äôm doing, ‚Äúoh I was just in the area and needed to go to the bathroom.‚Äù  

She saw right through that and for the second time in 30 years, she fired me. She said she‚Äôs seen me on the cameras taking money, but won‚Äôt press charges (even though almost all of it I replaces it). So I gave her my keys broken/sick/saddened/free. Remember those pending investigations on the safe though? Hmmm why am I getting calls from their police. Anyway, I‚Äôve been in a hospital for a week getting off alcohol ( so I don‚Äôt have to be forced bupenorphin). I‚Äôm dead broke now, an impatient is something I‚Äôve done twice and I find a waste of time, an out-patient I‚Äôve done once and it really helped be STAY on track since I know that stuff like the back of my hand. Either way though, no money, what do?

TLDR: I‚Äôm a piece of shit undetectable addict who lost his best job because he stole. Possibly looking at jail time but hasn‚Äôt talked to police. Doing one or two rehabs after detox

I met this guy in June. We hit it off really well one night and ended up having sex. He wasn't sure he wanted a relationship yet while I was, so we went our separate ways. 
After 4 or so months of failed attempts to connect with someone new (though I have slept with a few other guys...) we reconnect and he stays at my place one night and we have sex. He invites me to his place the falling weekend to hang out and to meet his daughter. It's a pretty big deal but we are just getting to know each other better before we decide of we want something official. 

Last night we sleep together again and we are laying in bed talking. I'm on reddit reading him posts and come across a post about STDs. He says to me ""I told you right?"" I say, ""Told me what?""

turns out, only finding this out recently is that she isn't in a relationship and has been feeling upset about being single, we always seem to get into conversations when ever we see each other at work and when i asked her what was wrong she straight out told me it. 

out of any conversation we've ever had this felt this most genuine, not as workers but as 2 people actually talking to each other for a short moment before she walked away. my mind begun to race and think of the possibilities of asking her out not for a date but as friends to get her mind of of things and see if we could make some sort of connection. only problem i face is that i am absolutely horrible at doing things like that and end up embarrassing myself in front of the girl i try to ask out, i get laughed at or made fun of. my lack of confidence for sure.

49,"Im a teacher who teaches abroad and I have watched this kid grow. I still stay in touch with him. I teach at school for the exceptionally gifted in this country where the top 2% of test scores in addition to a whole skew of extra curriculars are required for acceptance. But this young man is a different league in himself. At a young age he seemed to be light-years ahead in everything and the older he got the more it cost him.   He learnt to sail at 5, was captain of the swim team, the golf team,  was a talented Opera and Jazz Singer and violinist ,  and he represented his country and school multiple times in all those sports listed above. He started trading stocks at 14 and I have watched him make tens of thousands while sitting in my classroom. In Highschool, after  learning Chess for only a year he wiped the floor with the Captain of the Chess team and the supervising coach demolishing them 30-0 in consecutive chess games won. At one point he was more than 5 years ahead in Mathematics and knew so much about world history, that he could probably teach me and I was no slouch myself.   The problem is in all the years i knew this young man he had no friends. He couldn't fit in with nerds or jocks. The nerds were intimidated and felt threatened by his intelligence.  Many of the people who used to sit with him at lunch were accepted to famous schools like Cambridge, Caltech,  Stanford, U of Penn, Harvard etc and he made them feel stupid. In his conversations with the  ""nerds""  he was never disrespectful and he never resulted to Ad-hominem but the ""nerds"" were intimidated by his intelligence and they stopped welcoming him and flat out ignored him.  Among the athletic community it was even worse. In the team sports i watched him play, I witnessed him getting systematically ignored and teamed up on by his team mates which is probably the reason why he excels at individual sports.   The country i teach in also has mandatory military service eligible for minors.  This kid ended being a platoon leader. He was never succesffuly physically bullied. He was trained in Muaythai and when the captain of the Basketball team tried to shove him he through an uppercut elbow and knee'd him in the face. Soon in school, he was completely alone. When i have time off i try to chat with him but now his lunch break has been reduced to playing table tennis alone, chess against himself, singing and violin alone in the music room,  and doing heavy squats, deadlifts, dips, and pullups alone in the gym. No one one wants to talk to him, no girls want to date him, and he no longer cares about his academics.  In the end he graduated but he did not put in any effort to get into the IVY league or famous EU Universities. He ended up going to college in the US but not a famous one. He told me in one of our online talks that he found people to hang out with for the first 2 weeks by imitating the behavior of ordinary people.  He couldn't keep the act up and he was ditched by all his friends.  Most of his time is now spent mogul skiing,  stock-trading, and doing mixed-martial arts.  He hardly goes to lecture and when he isn't out doing these 3 activities he is always in his room.  I am scared for my student's mental health. I am concerned that one 1.  He will go insane from loneliness 2. He will never be loved, cared for, or appreciated  3. He might end up wasting his brilliance.    He's tried therapy but found it unhelpful when he knows more about psychology then the person giving him therapy.

As far as passions go, they're too fleeting to really have any true passions. I have no goals other than to land a job that makes enough money, as soon as possible, to move out on my own. I don't care about quality of life, because I'm already at my wits end, so anything is an improvement.

Looking for any advice really. Vocational school and all that I'd prefer not to do, just because that will just put me in debt and postpone everything by a year or two and I'm sick and tired of living the way that I am.",09Dec2018,1

66," My boss said he wanted to chat with me and it turned out to be a performance review. Basically on what I needed to improve on. He said some positive feedback as well so it wasn't too terrible. I have been doing bad all week admittedly, making mistakes left and right. My boss has shown me a bit of frustration this week. Ive only been at this job for a month. Technically three weeks because I went on vacation for 10 days (it was a vacation planned before I got hired). Him and I were getting along in the beginning it seemed. I was trying to help him. But its like when I came back, our relationship turned to be more professional. Which is fine I get it- He's the boss and I'm basically his assistant and he hired me. My anxiety went through the roof. I am not diagnosed with anxiety but I just felt extreme anxiety. To the point I cried after work twice this week. I cried because I know I'm letting my boss down. That's when the mistakes started. I also feel like I had crappy training. Only 5 days of it not even at the store I would be working at. The fifth day the trainer just used me to help her and not actually teach me anything.

Anyway, in the performance review he was talking about he said something that I can't get off my mind. That this is a ""fast paced environment"" and it's only going to get faster he said. It just dawned on me that he was probably saying that I'm slow or maybe he isn't but that's what it sounds like. The only reason I may be a bit slow/not confident in anything is I don't know it all yet. So I'm definitely gong to improve but does it seem like he's saying I'm slow?

Is this job not for me or like what is going on? I love my job internally. It is in my career field- HR- and I'm new to it, new to retail, new to this state, new to having a leadership type role where everyone looks up to me. It's crazy. I need some time. I'm adapting but I feel like my boss is starting to lose patience with me and now i'm feeling like is this the job for me? Should I just quit while I'm ahead? Im just frustrating him when I used to make him happy.

FYI- This is NOT me venting. I am literally trying to figure out if i'm right for the job, thanks.",09Dec2018,1
67,"My husband is away for the night and I‚Äôm in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood. I also live right next to a park. Tonight I was leaving my apartment to go to an event a couple blocks away and this white truck that was parked on one side of the park I live next to started up and then drove past me. I got this weird feeling and decided to watch it, and as I turned around I saw that it flipped a u-turn but stopped mid-turn, almost because I was stopped (and maybe I‚Äôm paranoid but I felt like they were watching me). I watched it and it stayed still for a bit, and then it completed its turn and then parked across the street from me after I turned around started walking back to my apartment.

It has stayed parked there with the lights and car off (and it‚Äôs below freezing where I am at so you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd keep the car running) for 30 minutes now and no one has left the vehicle. I can‚Äôt get a good look at it from my apartment because a treat is blocking my view.

I just think it‚Äôs weird that it left it‚Äôs original parking spot only to drive past me, stop, and then make a random u-turn and park close to where it originally was in the first place. My one theory is that maybe they were planning on breaking into my apartment but then changed their mind when they turned back??

68,"Hey guys so I made a throwaway account to ask you this as I'm growing more and more paranoid.

So a while back, about 8 months ago, I have hooked up with a guy and frankly it just wasn't too great.
We didn't talk for a while, but he kept sending me messages asking to have sex with him again etc. and I just ignored cus i wanted to move on with my life also I was meeting new people.
I ignored and blocked the number, didn't think much, but he kept coming back with an online generated number over the course of 8 months. Calling and texting me numerous times.
You might be wondering why I can't just straight up tell him to GTFO, but he has my nudes and everything which he insisted taking pics and videos of when we met (I was scared to say no). I don't know anything about this guy. Hell, I don't even know which one is his real number.
This isn't really a safe game to directly reject him because I'm afraid he wouldn't handle rejection well and upload what he has online. So, I changed my number instead, and today I found out he searched my old phone number on FB and sent a friend request.
This is scaring me a lot because all the detailed information is on there about me. Before, he only knew my number. Now he knows where my school is, who my friends are, what I'm up to etc.
I'm really desperately searching for a way to completely block this person from my life. Maybe reporting a case of cyberstalking?",09Dec2018,1

My dilemma is that I'm in grad school and I have finals this coming week. But because of how he's been doing, I've been visiting him quite frequently and have not been able to study almost at all. My finals consist of 2 written exams and a practical in which the only way to practice is by being in a lab going over skills with my classmates. 

He hasn't passed yet, but based on my lack of ability to study given the situation and no laboratory practice:
 1) What do you think would be the best way to go about this situation
2) Do you think I should email my professors now before he passes  and just reschedule exams for after Christmas break?  
3) or Should I just study what I can and suck it up because that's life... (Which is what my mom told me...)

72,"I want to keep this story short, but I have no idea where to start...

I have to run away, but I want to be prepared. I'm having some issues finding help. I've grown up in a complicated environment: a very harsh mother, too relaxed father, over controlling, fighting, screaming, beating, etc., and it has been deteriorating me over the years. Physical and psychological damage... There is so much to my story I honestly can't write it all. I feel depressed. I am very unstable, mostly because I spend a lot of time alone. I'm kept inside the house every day, always put down, doing chores for everybody (mom, dad, little brother and me. I have an older sister but I don't see her much anymore). I have to clean the whole house (two story house) on my own, including everybody's room, I have to cook, feed the animals, and watch my younger brother. I have to stay home and listen to my parents fight for everything and have my mom yell at anything I do and complain about what I don't. I can't go out with my friends (with the little I have sticking around yet), I only spend time alone in my room, and if I go out, it's because I have to go with my mother somewhere she needs. All I can do is study, go to school and figure something to do in my house. If the chores aren't done for some reason (like if I feel sick or something) I am the only one who gets scolded, even though there are three other people who live in the house...

I have outstanding grades, top of the class student, piano player, president of the class but nothing is acknowledged. All I get attention for is my wrongs in my house. It's exhausting and makes me very sad. I keep relationships over the phone. It ain't easy alone... I've talked to my dad about how I feel, but he chooses to ignore it. I've sent letters, but none of them have been responded. I won't go into much detail about what has happened, maybe I'll make another post explaining, but I need help.

Regarding what I want to do, I think I have a chance of getting better, and for that I really need to leave. A lot of things have happened in my life and are happening now that give me reasons to want to leave to college as soon as possible... College is an amazing excuse, but my mother is forcing me to stay. I don't think I'll be well if I wait much longer. In order to get away, I need a strong base, which is a place to go, a plan, and money. I have some saved, but it is not enough to cover my whole degree. I'm a US citizen living abroad and want to go study in Florida, a Biomedical Engineering career. I'll be graduating in December 2019. The university I want to go is public so it doesn't offer much that would benefit me.

I just wanted to ask if anybody here knows where can I apply to lots of scholarships so I can save money to go study away from home, and how can I prepare myself to leave. Please help. I don't know where else to ask for help. Thank you very much to reading this far, I'd appreciate so much the advice and help.",09Dec2018,1

75,"My friend of 10 years is afraid of intimacy. She's been with her SO for 5 years and she told him she wants to save for marriage. Last year they got married and they have not been intimate yet. She gave up a couple of months ago and texted me for advice. Our messages get synced to her laptop, which her SO uses. Basically, he saw his name and clicked on it (anyone would do that, I'm not blaming him for reading the messages) and read the conversation. 


She told me with details what exactly she is having trouble with. Her intentions were pure, and my suggestions were not offensive in any way. 

But now, her SO looks at me with disrespect, like I've invaded their private love life and I am now apart of the intimate life him and his wife want to share. I feel guilty and like my friend has put me in a place I can no longer pull myself out of. I want my SO to meet hers in the future and wish to double date but now, that's out of the picture. He feels like I'm an invasion and I can see why, I would feel the exact same way if I were in his place. There is no way I will ever confront him about this, his culture is different than ours, discussing sex is completely inappropriate, so apologizing to him would make the situation worse. My friend won't confront him either, if she does he would make the issue bigger than it already is.

86,"So I have been friends with this person for over half a decade, lets call him ""bob"".  Let me quickly explain what kind of person he is.

* Bob is 26
* Stoner (smokes at least 3 big joints a day)
* Fairly likes his drink and from time to time his drugs.
* Has a good heart (really cares for his friends and family)
* Has anger issues
* Just quit school (hasn't finished an education) 
*ADHD
* Troubling childhood

I have been fairly depressed for the last 7 years, I don't talk about it often. I learned to live with it and improve myself for a bit (even though that is going really badly). 

Around one or two times a year I have a mental breakdown after a period where I feel like shit. Last week was one of those. I recently quit smoking (cigarettes and weed) because I want to improve my life and do something. so I do what every insane man does and I bought a crate of beer and went to my friends house to drink my misery away (worse possible choice). In around an hour I drank 6 or 7 beers and was already quiet tipsy but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Me and Bob were talking about games, when we started to get into an argument. I told him that I think counter strike has a higher skill ceiling than FIFA. Gotta say, I don't really play FIFA, he doesn't play counter strike. This is imo a discussion topic and I like those, but instead of a discussion he started getting mad. 

This happens very often with a lot of trivial subjects and issues and normally I just fall back and calm the situation down but this time I was tipsy and felt like shit so I opened my mouth and furthered the discussion. Then he started to get really mad and told me he would smash my face in. 

We were just having a discussion and he went pretty quickly into that direction. He always says that friends always talk the truth to each other and don't back down of difficult subjects. But trivial stuff like this is making it difficult. 

After that happened me and another friend went to a party which Bob didn't feel like joining, and we drank a lot. Eventually we came back to bobs place while I was absolutely shit faced (not proud of it).

I started talking with no filter about the real reason I came, which was I needed my friends help. I wanted structure within my life, not that they had the best structure but they could help me. I wanted improve the overall quality of my life, stop smoking was one of them and I wanted to get rid of the suicidal thoughts I had. I was and am still done with living this way. 

And this is what I remember, the rest has been told to me by a other friend. Bob started go crack jokes where they were taking a piss at my state (drunk and depressed). I didn't feel like accepting that and I called it out which ensued a argument which I got everything that annoyed me out (bad I know). From his drug abuse (he doesn't see it and thinks it is medication for his ADHD), to his anger, to that because of all that I don't have a voice in the friendship and most likely some petty stuff. I ended up leaving and sending him a message that I'm done. And that is the last time I spoke to him. 

He send a few messages and called me a 2 times 2 days after and I haven't responded. The message was: ""cooled off already"" which somehow pissed me off. 

His girlfriend and I are great friends and I initially ignored her too because in previous fights bob has been he will get really protective about girlfriends and everything, which I apologized to her for but I am already blocked.

At this moment, I am waiting for at least an: ""What happened that night didn't go right can we talk about it"" or something in the line of that. I just don't want to go into a conversation with him about the night on his terms. I want something more than cooled off. As I did for him when I pissed him off.

Did I do the right thing? 

I feel like a jackass but also that it might be better this way.

Thank you if you read the whole thread.",09Dec2018,1
87,"My boyfriend (I'll just call him BF) and I are about to reach our one year anniversary in a couple days, but my step-mom (who we'll call SM) does not like him, and hasn't for our entire relationship.

I've talked to her about it, we've had fights about it, and I still don't have a real answer as to why. I've speculated, I thought maybe it's because BF smokes weed, and she doesn't like it? But so does my dad and so do I, so that's out. 
I thought, maybe it's our age difference. When we started dating, he was 23 and I was 18. She didn't care about that and never has. Out.
I thought it's because she likes my most recent ex, which she has denied, but commented when he got a new job that she missed him, and has asked me how he's doing (even though he's a piece of shit, so whatever), that is not out for me.
I thought maybe, is it because he isn't religious and they are? But my horrible ex literally said to my parents face ""God isn't real and you won't change my mind"" and yet she still likes him. That's out.

I've been to his house a million times, but he only ever came to my parents once, very early on. We spent our time in my parents ""game room"" in their garage - she wasn't home when he got there and when she got home she didn't come say hi. They made us dinner, we ate and left for a while. 
Months and months later, her ""reason"" why she doesn't like him is because when he came over, he didn't come upstairs and get his own dinner.
I WAS BEING A NICE HOST FOR HIS FIRST TIME OVER. I OFFERED TO GET HIS DINNER AND HE TOOK HIS OWN DISHES UP WHEN WE FINISHED.
And even after explaining that she said ""after that I knew he was a bad person"". To me, that's either a fake reason or just a really fucking stupid reason.

When I proposed moving out the first time, I planned on moving 6 months from then, and I was going to move in with bf and 2 friends. She said ""if you want to move out so badly you might as well leave now"". I ended up moving in with a different friend. 

She has told me that the thought of us dating is ""disgusting"" and ""makes her feel sick"". He hasn't done anything wrong to her or myself, but she completely insists that he's some kind of bad person. At this point, I hardly say his name around her.

BF and I don't understand. We know at some point she'll just have to accept it, and if she doesn't then she isn't going to be a part of anything, because we aren't breaking up any time soon. But it would be nicer if she at least gave him a chance, and didn't decide BF was a bad person after seeing him for 5 minutes and making irrational judgements. Any ideas at all?? Will she ever come around??",09Dec2018,1
88,"So I matched with a guy on tinder a few weeks ago and we've had some conversations and we agree on a lot, we share the same music, share some similar interests and style etc. It was all super cool but when I asked why he was on tinder he pretty much said to find friends and I said same because it was true (although I was still open to if anything happened) but told me I was pretty much the only person to try to talk to him outside of tinder because nothing else really worked out with anyone else. I haven't talked to anyone on tinder since I started talking to him. He invited me to go with his friends down to this music place and I said no because I still didn't really know him at this point and to be frank my anxiety is so bad right now because of this, and I'm already super introverted and I feel like I come off as the weird girl in social settings with new people. He was understanding and agreed we should get to know each other more and after that I just don't know. Like I'm not head over heels attracted to him, it kinda comes in waves if that makes any sense and he hasn't said or done anything that's indicated he's attracted to me which is fine, I can deal with just being friends although to me I'd be open to anything that might happen.

But even though I'm not super interested in him, I still haven't been *this* interested in someone for so long I forgot how shitty it makes me feel, my normally healthy self esteem and self confidence plummets and I just feel like a horribly ugly person with a garbage personality and I'm gonna end up alone because of it. It makes me wanna give up. We haven't talked in two days and I feel like he's losing interest, I'm too scared to open up a conversation to anything other than music or cringing about our past experience with different things we used to be involved in. Do I just shoot my shot and suck it up and hang out with him and risk my fears being actualized and he ghosts me or do I take this as a loss and just move on. I grew up not knowing anyone who was into the same things I was and I meet this guy and its really refreshing but I'm scared I'm gonna scare him off somehow.

The orange is gone, but now its a very bright, unsightly banana-yellow. The biggest problem is, the toner and purple shampoo still won't work on my hair and now I don't know what to do. At this point I'm open to two ideas; either continue the pursuit of ash blonde or go back to a warmer colour similar to what I had before.

Amy had a boyfriend aswell that she got with from our work, eventually they became part of my little group of mates I had, I never saw Amy more then a friend of mine for I really respect her they were a great friend that taught me so much,

But I don't know why but I don't ask them, just watch them fade away from me. I never saw them again after that, I did ask the boyfriend though if she's okay, but he doesn't know either, never asked him again after that

106,"This is my first serious kind of post like this. Sorry if it‚Äôs not all organized. 

I just turned 19 two weeks ago. My two older brothers are 22 and 29. The oldest does not live at home anymore so I‚Äôm not sure if he was a part of this conversation.

Anyway, I was in my room, normal Saturday night, playing on my Xbox with some friends, and then hear my mom and dad in the next room. They used to fight a ton, so I got a lot of practice of listening through walls to hear the arguments. I ignored this one at first but then heard my dad start to talk a bit louder. Not yelling, but frustrated. I walk over to the wall in my room that I share with my moms room and put my ear to the wall. First I hear,

Dad: What do you want me to tell you? Our kids are normal, this is how every kid behaves.

Mom: I‚Äôm disappointed in them. I don‚Äôt like how they‚Äôve turned out. I don‚Äôt like how they are. 

After this I hear the occasional ‚Äústop yelling at me‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not yelling‚Äù ‚Äúcan I speak?‚Äù A bunch of bullshit. 

My mom was saying how my brother that lives at home and I are ungrateful, disrespectful, and unhelpful in every way. 

My mom has major mental health issues that she has never gotten addressed. For context, she forced me into a hospital at a young age and when I begged her to do the same years later she refused, yelled at me, and called me crazy. Used the fact I was in the hospital against me. This story has too many layers.

My mom is probably the most manipulative person I‚Äôve ever seen. My dad is too in love with her to do anything about it. He‚Äôs too scared to lose her. 

My brother and I do so much around the house as she just stays in bed all day doing nothing. She goes out occasionally to try and save her drowning photography business which just puts our family more in debt. 

We have fights but whenever she is disrespectful to us or is just plain vile, and we retaliate with words, she seethes at the mouth like a wild animal and cries disrespect and respect your elders, and I just yell at her that if she wants respect she has to give it. 

What do I do. I‚Äôm scared for my brother and I that she may tell my dad we need to be kicked out of the house. I just need some advice, please.

108,"First Reddit post! I have always thought of this website as a good way to get advice from so I finally made an account! I know this is a pretty broad topic with some pretty broad implications -- there are a lot of options and a lot of paths I can go down, so please excuse me for the vagueness. I have a little backstory though:

&amp;#x200B;

I had a pretty sheltered childhood. My father was abusive and around age 8 that led to having to deal with Child Protective Services and the foster care system for a few years, both experiences really messing with my Mom and her willingness to let us be independent as kids. For years to come my mom would do anything in her power to ""make it up"" to me and my siblings by essentially spoiling us. Let me be clear: I am not blaming my Mom for anything that went down, as none of it is her fault, but I digress. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad was murdered when I was 11, so my Mom has been, my sole caretaker since. Around the time of his death was when I was heading into middle school. Throughout middle/high school I isolated myself from my classmates and refused to do anything extracurricular. Instead I chose the option of holing up in my room and playing video games for days on end, completing schoolwork only when I needed to. Needless to say, I was a pretty insular kid that really didn't take much time out of their day to learn how the world really works.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to now. I am almost two years out of high school going into semester two of my second year of college. I still live with my mom and siblings and hate it. I am not learning the life skills I need to be learning or should have already learned around this time and it is really taking a toll to my mental health. I really need to move out. I've decided that I am going to be taking the measures I need to take to find a few roommates and get an apartment near my college. I have considered dorms, but I am too late for the application for housing for next semester. I'm living with a lot of regret with how I carried myself during my middle/high school year, but I know moping around about my current state will get me nowhere and that I have to take action now if I want a bright future. I'm going to be starting a job at my local Starbucks full-time as well as hopefully getting a part-time job tutoring math on my school campus on top of my classes. I know it is going to be a lot, but I need to pay rent as well as further my experience in mathematics and teaching while getting my degree, since it is my plan to be a high school math teacher. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of social anxiety and BPD. Despite that, I really like making new friends and taking part in new opportunities!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I finally get to the question asking, I guess. Does anyone have any advice as to what precautions or preparations I should make before looking for a place to live, or on the apartment hunting process as a whole? I've done some research, but I feel as if I'll get the most raw advice here. What do y'all think? Thanks Reddit!!! xoxo",09Dec2018,1
109,"WARNING: GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION BELOW

I'm a shelter worker. I've only been in the field for a year. So I recently took on a new job position as a supervisor at a temporary shelter that has the capacity to hold 225 people (homeless, marginalized, people with addiction, mental health, whatever). At my old job I was also a supervisor and was there for about a year. I only switched jobs because of the pay; new job pays 28/hr and old job paid 21/hr. This new job is an organization that is well know, has multiple properties across my city and other cities and has great funding. Overall great company, or so I've heard. I do overnights Wed-Sat 9pm-7am My old organization wasn't as renowned but was still well known locally. Average funding and holds over 50 people sometimes 60. The people there are amazing, and it's been a week since I've left and coworkers text me they miss me all the time and wish I didn't leave. I made amazing relationships there, ones that make me think I can't find it anywhere else. I did wed-sat also from 11pm-8am

My dilemma is that at my new job, which I just started 3 days ago and had my first alone supervising shift this past Thursday, was chaotic. I had agency/relief staff instead of actual core staff from the organization. Had a fire drill and wasn't trained for how I was to handle that so I just grabbed a bullhorn and tried my best to evacuate 225 people, all the while handling shower flooding and 3 clients trying to fight my staff and security...all during the evacuation. I did all the referrals (when new clients come in) because none of the agency or relief staff had log ins to a system we use to do their intake. So while I handled the paperwork, de-escalating, and figuring out how to stop the place from flooding, staff were lazy af. Then the worst happened. I'm used to having overdoses from my other job, but when we found this man, he was in a pool of blood and unresponsive despite his eyes being wide open. My security broke down the washroom stall which he was in and dragged him out. He just stared blankly at the ceiling with blood all over his face. I'm used to blood, but not when someone wasn't blinking. I checked and he had a faint pulse. His neck was warm and his hands were warm. I shot him with 2 naloxone injections (instantly puts someone into withdrawal and wakes them up) but did not respond at all. Security and I began to do chest compression. My only training was back in swimming classes in high school which was 7-8 years ago and has expired since then. My staff started to say he was turning blue. I checked his vitals, no pulse, not breathing, and very cold, rigid hands. We kept doing compression until EMS came. All the while the man stared blankly at the ceiling, unflinching. EMS came, police came. I was there for the whole thing. It looked like a crime scene, police took pictures. I still had 3hrs of shift left, and tried my best to keep cool in front of the staff. They all said how am I so calm, i shrugged it off. Went home, cried the life out of me. Blame myself that if I had staff be more vigilant about checking the washrooms, maybe we could have intervened quicker. I feel ill equipped to handle the job and under qualified, wasn't trained enough for any of it, I don't the know the protocols for much of the things such as staffing no shows, death, evacuation, etc. At my old job, I knew it because there were protocols. And my overnight team there was consistent and solid, at this new job my staff would always be changing. It's never a consistent staff so it's hard to make stable relationships.

I miss my old job. I know this is a great stepping stone for me, but my old job also has a great reputation. I stress over going to work at my new job. I know I should give myself time to adjust but I don't know if I have the capacity to mentally handle it. I could easily go back to my old job since I'm still relief there, and they're opening a new location too. I can easily go for daytime shifts. But the pay will still be 21/hr.

114,"So last year was my junior year of high school, it was a rough one not the worst but rough. I just need a question answered from all the experts on women. I had a massive crush on one of my friends and she indirectly reciprocated some things towards me, playing a middle finger game and laughing at my jokes included. But the one thing that really stuck out to me was during the prom, I had gotten the balls to go up to her after finding out she already had a date(that nearly killed me at the time). Her friend told me ‚Äúname wants to dance with you‚Äù I said sure they looked at each other and I walked away. We danced during the third slow song, it was awkward asking her to because my voice was low but it worked out. When we were dancing we didn‚Äôt talk I just stared into her eyes and she started saying something. Then and this was the worst for me, my arms slipped down towards her breasts we continued to dance and once the song was over I left the dance floor talked to my friends and proceed to regular dance with her and a few of her friends.  Flash to the present day, were just friends but she says hi to me every day and still laughs at the stuff I do. I‚Äôve figured her out though flirting is In her natural personality, I‚Äôm gonna stay friends with her but now my question to the men, women and ladykillers of Reddit is what does all of it mean and is it possible that she will one day divert from her free spirited personality to one day find out that she has feelings for me? Could it be that given all this information she may have had a thing for me but her free spirited Nature and extra curriculars were more important to me?

Tldr: roomate took TV remote as 'some people in this house are working professionals' and need rest. We've only used the TV for a week. 

So background: I've lived at this place for about 4 months and haven't had a problem. I pay rent to a couple who live in the master bedroom, I didn't sign anything and I pay fortnightly. I assume all the roomates are the same. 
I've seen 2 people move on since I moved in, and we have a new roomate M who doesn't seem to work conventional hours and shes home during the day watching TV in the lounge. The couple doesn't seem to work either as they're always locked in their room chatting as they are very introverted. I recently switched to full time work as uni is done for the year. 

I recently had a guest over (Wednesday) as we were both hungover and didn't go to work, we stayed in the lounge watching TV on the opposite side of the house to the couple, M was in and out. When I dropped him home, M asked me where the remote went and we searched for a while but couldn't find it. We do have another TV in the kitchen but it's small and we tend to not cook when someone is watching as the stove makes heaps of noise. 

Anyways the couple sent us a text the following day saying that we are not to use the lounge TV and not to invite guests unless we ask them first. They said that we invite guests that stay all day and disturb the tenants who are 'working professionals' that need rest. The remote is still missing so I assume they have taken it. 

So, I'm asking for advice. I'm paying my rent to live here, I should have access to the lounge TV? Do I really have to ask permission for guests to come over? Am I the asshole here?

Ive personally noticed that, in social situations, i get anxiety. More so if there is silence. I think part of my problem may be related to that.

130,"I'm a perfectionist procrastinator, this issue started back in 7th grade when I moved to an IB school where my previous school was a total shit hole. The IB school wasn't hard, it just required more effort and as long as I'm concerned I wasn't ready for that. For my first year, I was doing great until 8th grade when it took a strong turn on me. Occasionally  I would stay up till 5 am doing homework or even studying for exams (btw I go to school at 7:30 am which gave me two hours of sleep only) and that's fine with me since I'm a ""Night Owl/Nocturnal"" but my parents weren't okay with that so they kept scolding me for it on every occurrence but they were always proud when my report came in. Another year passes by and I'm in 9th grade but this time it took an even stronger turn where I would go to with 0 hours of sleep and finally my parents started taking action instead of scolding me. First, they only allowed me to stay up till 1 am but I didn't listen so they went as far hiding my books and my laptop which pissed me off since I'm a nerd that gives a shit about school and that got me in a lot of arguments with my parents especially my mother (I know that she did this because she ""loves me and all that shit"" but she doesn't know that she's making it worse for me). With my parents' methods of stopping me from pulling allnighters, I went to school multiple times unprepared so I became manipulative, dishonest and a 2-faced bitch:

Manipulative:

I'm made fake vomit (sometimes self-induced vomit) to skip school (that worked in my favor since my mother couldn't fathom why I vomited so much so she took me to a hospital and they diagnosed me with H. pylori).

I intentionally ""corrupted"" a flash drive to convince my teachers that my flash isn't working so I can submit it at a later time.

Dishonest:

I would make top-notch excuses to my teachers so I can submit at a later time.

&amp;#x200B;

And another year passes and I'm now in grade 10 and still, nothing changed  so my only resort was to talk to my parents about this (which was hard because we're Asians(I'm Persian which counts as Asian so yeah) and we don't discuss our emotions) so I did talk to my parents and they agreed to allow me to pull all-nighters without intervening and I'm still on the same terms my reputation between my teachers was ....... and I'm made my parents argue a couple of times and my grades started slipping since I skipped on school on finals(first semester), I'm miserable.

I think I'm broken beyond repair.

I know I'm maybe milking the situation too much but I tried everything (time management, sleeping early, being on time) but I can't commit, I was compared so often to my cousin to the point of developing hatred towards him(that's on my parents though they shouldn't have compared us even though he's a nice guy and thankfully I no longer hate him since it's not his fault)

131,"tldr; Got one of my lower incisors removed to alleviate overcrowding while taking up a dental braces procedure. Now, constantly thinking about the long-term consequences of this action.

&amp;#x200B;

Detail:

I am 30y male, have had a set of 32 teeth. In a routine checkup, I was suggested getting braces to fix the inward sloping of my lower teeth which supposedly caused increased tartar deposition because some of the areas were too hard to reach with a toothbrush.

I consulted with my dentist (not the one who suggested it) and he said it was possible. He also said that I have a prominent lower jaw and as nature's compensation, my lower teeth are inward sloping. Also, that the lower row is overcrowded in the front (explaining the somewhat twisted formation of my lower teeth) and to make room to reorient the teeth, I'll need to have one incisor removed. I got it removed yesterday. But post that, I have been thinking about the long-term consequences of having an otherwise healthy tooth removed.

So, what are the long-term consequences (both good and bad) that I could expect? For example, I read that the jawbone could shrink a bit due to bone resorption and absence of pressure from that place where the tooth used to be (but what about other teeth realigning themselves in the space and compensating for the pressure).

134,"Hey all!

I'll keep this brief.

My boyfriend (of almost two years, who I have lived with for the past 14 months) and I are on a break. The relationship is tainted, but I love him dearly and want to continue my life with him. He's very important to me, and we work perfectly together. We had our hiccups in the past, but we had forged a strong bond and had fixed all of our problems. Then (excuse my vagueness) something happened that caused us to need a break. I still want to be with him. What happened isn't too important, just know it has cast doubt and caused a lot of hurt.

BUT

I have the opportunity to go live somewhere I have always wanted to, without him. It's somewhere I may never get to live with him, and it would mean starting a new life - totally fresh. I wouldn't have any friends, but I would get to be somewhere I've yearned for for years and years (Victoria, British Columbia - if you're familiar). 

I would likely never see my boyfriend ever again, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Sad, for sure, but I know I would be able to find someone else to be with (not immediately, mind you). I'm at a huge turning point in my life - a relationship in crisis, losing a lot of weight/getting fit, about to turn 20, and presented with this huge opportunity.

What do you guys think I should do? And no, this isn't as easy of a decision as it seems.

Thanks in advance!

135,"This is gonna be a long one btw....


So about a year ago, in 10th grade, there was a girl that I really liked. We'd hang out together during lunch and go out together basically things that bff's would do. We first met each other during 5th grade and we were both shy individuals that kept to ourselves, but slowly over time we'd talk to each other more and more. I never really had the idea of confessing to her so early because we were having a lot of fun just messing around.

We also transferred to the same high school together, which was a really great coincidence and I was glad I had someone I knew from childhood. During lunch we'd normally see each other, as I wasn't in the same class with her. I would smile at her and she'd smile at me, just the normal stuff.

During 10th grade me and my friends were talking about our crushes and discussing about random shit like which girl had the biggest ass or tits. Somehow, 30 minutes into the conversation, my friend was able to persuade me to confess to her in front of the entire school. So after lunch I asked my crush to follow me where all my friends were, there were facing her behind her back and I just blatantly asked ""Will you be my girlfriend?"" Thinking about it now that was a really bad way to confess, and honestly I did not know how I was able to do it. Maybe it was just peer pressure and I was dumb, after I asked her, she was quiet for like 10 seconds which was probably normal because she wouldn't have expected me to ask that, but after the awkward 10 seconds past she just said ""I have no feelings for you,"" and just walked away, while all my friends were like in shock and screaming ""WHY!??"" or ""NNNOOO!!"" like really loudly.

It was definitely a bad idea to confess to her in front of everybody, she would probably be scared out of her mind and won't know what to say. I didn't talk to her the entire year and now in grade 11 she doesn't even want to look at me, sure I'll throw her some small talk and she would reply as short as possible and walk away. Not normally how she'll respond to me last time, I really don't know what to do now, I'm fine being friends with her but I'm trying to make things less awkward between us, I kinda just want her to be comfortable around me.

tl;dr Confessed to crush in front of entire school she rejected me, and won't talk to me now.",09Dec2018,1

137,"Weird question.

Long story short, I have a student loan that's currently in a defaulted state, and I haven't made payments on it in forever. However, I see a value right next to ""current balance"", and assume that's all I need to pay. If I were to pay that off, would that bring everything back to normal state the second that's payed, or would there still be something left?

Would the fact that it's been defaulted at all keep it from reaching normality, even if payed for?

It's monthly, so I can also pay the months I've missed to bring that down to zero... would that do anything?

All I know is, I've been denied things before because of this loan, and have had a difficult time paying it off because of my current financial situation. As soon as the bill's paid, is that it? Is everything square?",09Dec2018,1

139,"Last year, I broke up with my best friend who was my literal social life. Since then I've isolated myself at home, crying and spending the majority of the time in front of the computer. 

I've been very lonely to the point of crying myself to sleep every night and dreading going home after school with no one to talk to or hang out with. I'm also not attractive enough to be in a romantic relationship. 

I've tried making friends at college, but they just feel like acquaintances and I don't want to force something that isn't there and make things awkward. So everyday I go and put on a mask and do my work and socialize on my lunch breaks, but once class is over, I see my ""friends"" go on to their more important lives and other friends. I think they've caught on to the fact that I'm quite lonely and don't have friends or a life outside of school, which repels them from wanting to speak to me outside of it. 

It's really hard for me to find a job because I have anxiety. If I do manage to get one, I break down because my spoken English isn't that great. The longest job I've had was minimum wage and for 2 months only, and my resume looks like I have commitment issues. 

So all I do is sit at home, go on Youtube, and stalk my acquaintances on Instagram, who lead more interesting lives than me. 

I'm literally going to spend the holidays alone and I don't know how to cope. It's been a year and all I want is supportive friends, family, a significant other, hobbies, and social plans to look forward to but I don't have anything except food and a roof over my head. ",09Dec2018,1

Second: It's implied that she wants us to ride together in her car. Thing is, she tends to harbor a victim or ""poor me"" mentality and can this be very taxing to deal with, especially for extended periods of time. I don't mean to sound harsh but I am trying to be objective and truthful.

She's had a really hard life and I don't blame her at all, but I've gotten to the point where I've limited my contact with her in general. Cutting off a family member is so hard to do, but tolerating toxic behavior should not be permitted.

144," 

F/ 26 working as a rookie in a competitive professional environment. Hate to admit but am incapable of conflict and have been reducing myself as a doormat who tries to be agreeable with anyone. I am SUPER UNHAPPY.

Ever since when i was a kid, i have had a hard time dealing with people when they are not nice. I was raised to be nice and to ""find the faults in myself"" when conflict arises. My feelings are never acknowledged / addressed properly. As an adult, I hardly spoke up when others were disrespectful to me and when my friend is not friendly / being manipulative. I would let others pushing my boundaries (sometimes I doubt if I have a clearly defined one) take it as long as I could without saying a thing and try to put up with them, until it finally blows out and I'd just cut it off / burn the bridge completely.

I am simply fearful facing conflicts. I don't know how to express my anger / annoyance as I was often told that it's ineffective / am overeacting. As a result, i have a hard time connecting with my feelings and let it guide myself. When my colleagues, my friends, and even a waitress was being rude to me, I simply don't know how to respond. My emotions were surging underneath and my mind would go completely blank, following with hours of self-beration / wondering what I have done to deserve this. Often times come to the conclusion that life is not worth it. Yes, it's that extreme.

Can someone please shed some lights? Honestly am getting nervous typing those words fearful that people might be harsh. It's irrational. I know all that. But I have yet to find a way to deal with it. Thanks so much.

 I'm a third year community college honors program psychology major student hopefully about to transfer to a 4-year university. I struggle with low self esteem and bouts of depression, to the point where I doubt I'll even have a future (even typing this, I still believe I won't have a future). I have a bad tendency to be my own worst critic which has both helped and hurt me in a sense that I get mostly As and at most 2 or 3 Bs during my three years in community college, but at the cost of my happiness (i.e., I am happy with my grades, but it took me suffering just to pass). Things have been hard lately, and it feels more that every day it's getting harder. Being in the honors program puts pressure on me in a way that professors have higher expectations for me, and one slip up and I'm automatically deemed someone not worthy of that. I'm taking an online course in developmental psychology in which we were to discuss cohabitation and intimate partner violence. I am always sure to research sources outside of our textbook to properly answer the questions and this one time that I didn't do as strongly (8/10), my professor, whom I have looked up to and admired since I was in her intro class as a first year,  leaves a comment of ""I expected more from you,"" which really was a huge blow to my non-existent self esteem. Having your favorite professor tell you they expected more from you would kind of hurt, wouldn't it? I just can't talk about this with anyone else because it feels like no one will get me and when I try, I'll just get yelled and lectured at by my mom (i.e., ""boohoo pity party of you""). I don't have many friends IRL either because of my social anxiety. I'm sorry if this is a burden, I do not know where else to turn to.

154,"I‚Äôm currently a grade 12 student who has my entire second semester off until I start university. My expected goals for the future is to apply to dental school once I get my bachelors of science and apply to a DAT. I‚Äôm doing pretty good in school and I‚Äôm definitely not under pressure by my parents since I‚Äôve got 2 older siblings who have already paved their way to a much more successful life and hopefully continue on doing so.

Honestly though, the only reason I‚Äôm hoping to become a dental surgeon is so that I can reach the same levels as my older siblings and have a prosperous life. My true interest is music/production, working with instruments to make beats, but mainly making my own songs. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I just think about it daily and fantasize about all the things I can achieve if I ever do get a lot of recognition and become famous. However, I always try to look at this through a pessimistic view and try to remind myself of the negative because it‚Äôs obviously not easy to make it big and it needs a lot of luck. What I mean by this is that I‚Äôm constantly trying to shoot down my hopes by accepting reality and realizing I‚Äôll never be anything.

The problem with this is that I have SO many ideas for music such as ideas for beats, lyrics, flows, etc. But I can‚Äôt put those anywhere, I just have a notebook and I don‚Äôt wanna use my sibling‚Äôs laptops for production either. I don‚Äôt wanna tell my parents about this passion I have because it just seems so dumb and unrealistic.

Once my semester is over I have 200+ days of a full break period so I‚Äôm planning on getting a job and buying a laptop for production. During this break I also want to focus strictly on music and see where it goes.

To summarize, I‚Äôm just really confused and feel stuck. I want to pursue my passion in music but at the same time, I just know it won‚Äôt work out, but if it does, that‚Äôd be amazing.

My question is, should I just give up on this whole music thing and use my break for a better cause, such as travelling or doing anything OTHER than music? Am I overthinking this? How can I get rid of this mentality that‚Äôs been running through my mind for the past 2 years?

163,"I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for quite some time now.

On a regular night almost 2 years ago, I [23 F] drove into my city to go grab a drink with my best friend [24 F] and her boyfriend [28 M] When I pulled outside the apartment they gave me directions to, they came over to my car and I realized they were hammered. They told me to come inside for a bit and that we‚Äôd eventually go walk into town. 

It wasn‚Äôt long after going into their friend‚Äôs apartment that my very hammered friend came up close to me and through slurred words said ‚Äúcan we kiss?‚Äù My first reaction was to laugh partly because I thought it was funny and partly out of being afraid she was serious. She got upset when I laughed and started to make a scene, continuously asking me to makeout with her. She threw herself against the wall drunk and was beginning to cry while asking why I didn‚Äôt want to kiss her. 

She then approached her boyfriend and tried getting him to convince me to kiss her. Keep in mind her boyfriend was an extremely bad influence, did basically every drug imaginable, had been in and out of jail, and manipulated the shit out of my friend for the entire duration of their time together. (I couldn‚Äôt stand him). The first thing he did was smile at me and hand me a bottle of vodka. ‚ÄúJust start drinking‚Äù he said. Being the light weight, slim and petite female that I am, I was drunk pretty quickly. She kept pressuring. I thought to myself, fuck it, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen. When I eventually told her drunkenly I‚Äôd do it, her eyes lit up brightly and I‚Äôd never seen her so genuinely happy and excited before, albeit her being drunk. I kissed her, and I remember hearing the guys in the apartment cooing at us, but I felt absolutely nothing and moreover pretty weird.

Fast forward and I am absolutely obliterated and shit faced in a room with her, her boyfriend and their friend, all making out on a bed and touching. This is the part that makes me even nauseous to remind myself of. We were all touching her specifically. I remember being so drunk but being aware that I was drunk and in a new experience and figured what the hell i‚Äôm not feeling that repulsed so let‚Äôs just experiment. I played with her tits and I might have even like sucked on them I think. I fingered her too. That part I remember thinking to myself like ‚Äúyou have literally hit rock bottom.‚Äù And I made out with her boyfriend, which apparently never bothered her at all. 

After that night I felt so, so, so traumatized. I needed space from my friend. she texted me the next day saying how much fun that was and that she would be open to doing it again sometime, but all I wanted to do was cry. And I did, for weeks. She kept trying to talk to me but I told her I needed her to leave me alone for a while. She didn‚Äôt understand. When she realized how genuinely hurt and fucked up I felt over it, and how repulsed I was, she no longer expressed positive feelings about the night and started saying things like ‚Äúyeah that was really messed up/weird.‚Äù

The thing is that I have always been straight and dated men. And my friend knows this. She‚Äôd always hung out for years with me and my boyfriends.

But I‚Äôm also pretty comfortable with myself I think and don‚Äôt feel weird knowing that I can find women sexually attractive. For me it‚Äôs a very particular type of feeling. I have fantasies only when I am hornet that are purely sexual and I don‚Äôt think I would ever feel the desire to enact them. I‚Äôve never had feelings for a girl and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for me to. I adore men so much both romantically and sexually. But that night, I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù because I was thinking hey maybe I‚Äôll learn something about myself! And I did, and that is that I can‚Äôt hook up with a girl.

My friend ended up asking me to makeout again while drunk on one other occasion later that year. I did it, but I was super drunk. I actually don‚Äôt really know why I did it again. It made me feel fucked up all over again.

Now my friend has been dating her ex boyfriends best friend for about half a year. In the beginning, I told her he‚Äôs definitely pretty cute. She said she wasn‚Äôt attracted to him like that, but said that they had sex. I was like what do you mean you have sex if you‚Äôre not attracted to him? and she responded saying she just really likes him as a person. I was really confused by this.

I guess what I want to ask you all is, do you think my friend is potentially gay? I could care less what someone‚Äôs sexual orientation is. But what hurts me is feeling like there is always a wall between my friend and I. No matter how many times we hang out, I feel like there is a facade, a wall, a fakeness, a secret, and it leaves me feeling lonely and like I am not worthy of a deep meaningful female friendship. I find that I tend to stay in unhealthy friendships and relationships and overall situations. It‚Äôs not my place to ask her ‚Äúare you gay‚Äù because that‚Äôs none of my business, but over the years I‚Äôve just felt like there are so many little signs (like never talking about men, telling me she wants a cuddle buddy and doesn‚Äôt care who it is, and talking about a mutual friend saying ‚ÄúI could have SWORN she‚Äôs gay, how does she have a boyfriend? She has to be gay‚Äù) that I seriously can‚Äôt help feel like she might like me. It‚Äôs just a hard situation. Thoughts appreciated. ",09Dec2018,1
164,"I‚Äôm a senior in high school and Wednesday-Friday I pick up my 7-year-old cousin from school and babysit her for a few hours until my aunt gets off work. She‚Äôs a good kid and I don‚Äôt mind spending time with her but she‚Äôs become very attached to me in the last couple months. Whenever I‚Äôm sitting on the couch she‚Äôll straddle me and lay her head on my shoulder and sometimes try to kiss me on the lips. Wherever I go in the house she‚Äôll follow me while holding my hand or the sleeve of my shirt. Sometimes when I‚Äôm walking she‚Äôll walk in front of me, abruptly stop and stick her rear end out so I‚Äôll bump into it, giggle and then run forward a few steps and do it again. There have also been a few occasions where she‚Äôs stripped down to her underwear and tried to snuggle up with me. When her mom came home she told her that she needs to wear clothes when guests are over and she threw a fit. 

There‚Äôs usually some kind of struggle when I need to leave for the evening. She‚Äôll cry and make me pick her up so she can hug me. She‚Äôll point to her lips for a goodbye kiss but I usually just give her a peck on the cheek. 

I‚Äôm probably overreacting but sometimes her attachment weirds me out a little.

So this goes back to last year, when a friend of mine, who we will call just Girl, began dating a friend of mine, Guy A. Now Girl and Guy A had a rocky relationship for a couple weels in October, and Girl always seemed to rely on comfort from Guy B, a good friend of Guy A. One day Girl reports to me, also a friend of the Guys, that Guy B asked for nudes of Girl whilst knowing her to be in a relationship. I sparled firther drama, beeliving Girl with a small amount of evidence, being a few screenshotted text messages. The two guys stop talking, and Guy Bs rep is heavily damaged. Skip ahead to the summer, Guy A is still dating Girl, introduce new character, Guy C, also friend of Guy A. So both Guy A and C are going off to college, Girl is not. Girl and Guy A break up peacefully, though still snapchat alot, allegedly as friends. Over the summer, Girl reports that Guy C, seemingly unprompted, tries to to kiss Girl. This damages Guy Cs rep, and ruins Guys A and Cs relationship. Firther down the line to nowadays, Girl dates Guy D, an innocent young lad, both make a very stavle and happy couple. Guy D is fromanother friend group, which I happen to also assocaite with. Introduce Guy E, loyal friend of Guy D now, who has a history of flirting with Girl, Guy E is good to his friend. However, Girl one day kisses Guy E and tries to place blame on him. Guy E does not go down easy, claiming Girl did so nonsonsentually, and friend group explodes. Rumors circulate, but in about a week, all is forgiven. Guy D and E talk and are great friends. Guy D is beginning to grow suspicious of Girl, but Guy E is good feinds with Girl, and wants Guy D and Girls relationship to last, so he tries to act as if nothing happened. One day in recent weeks, Girl goes to Guy Es house, and opens up about having been sleeping with Guy A, B, and C, as well as others which I do not personally know, and damaging reputations by making them out to be horndogs for her. Additionally, while dating Guy D, she often pipes Guy A, who makes routine trips home from college for the occasion. Girl also tries to fuck Guy E in the same course of events, but Guy E will not hurt his friend. Two weeks pass, and Guy E told no kne, until Wednesday, he tells our feiendgroup, all except Guy D, and that is where we have our advice. Everyone wants to expose Girl, except me.

169,"Need advice.  I'm an older, professional woman that has always made 2x what my new (7 yrs) and much younger husband does. We have an ""ok"" marriage - I mean as good as it can be when we disagree on every fundamental part of marriage - &amp; he has stepped up to support the household for the month I was looking for another job.  It put us in a deep deep hole, but the necessities got paid. 

Now I've been offered a job 3 hours away, in a field I adore, where I will again make more money - but now we will support TWO HOMES, in two states, w/me coming home only on weekends. The pay is decent, but does need to be a little more substantial yet the benefit package is exceptional, as is the company.  

But my husband since 2012 says if I take this job, our marriage is over.  Done.  He won't move.  

My husband has worked for the same company for 13 yrs.  He performs physical, manual labor for approximately $50k/yr.  His company has NO benefits, no insurance, no Retirement plan... This job takes a terrible toll on his body but he loves his job like I love the Industry I'm in. 

Husband says Im worthless to not take my big dog immediately because I can't until I find an apartment that will take him.  I will be staying with people that work with the company until I can settle in.   And he has taken to acting mean and in cruel ways toward the little puppy that I just rescued. 

I'm not leaving my Alabama home outright, my husband will remain and my brother is to move in while he goes through his divorce.  But leaving my dogs is going to hurt me immensely, especially since my husband's passive aggressive way of showing his anger over me wanting to take this job is manifesting in hateful ways. 

My friends say I'd be crazy to turn down this opportunity, and it's good money.  My husband says, ""bills be damned"" I need to find a job in our home town of 5000 even if it's less pay.  I feel I'm entrusting my future to him and honestly, I dont.  I feel I need this job because I can't count on what I don't have.  

We do have an issue(s):in our marriage that has made me think divorce 2x - he likes to smoke pot all the time, I hate it.  He drinks every single day, I drink 2x a year.  But mainly, our age difference makes me feel like he deserves better &amp; is likely to leave me anyway when he is a little more mature (when he's 30-40, I'm 50 now (long story there but basically we needed each other in that moment, now he is content with the security I provide, while I regret marrying someone who is controlling and spiteful). 

I dont know what to do.  I'm supposed to report in 10 days.  My husband has been angry and hateful since I told him I wanted the job.  He says he will NEVER move - even though my new boss got him a new job in his same exact field, making more money in the same city I will be working.  He says if I take the job, our marriage is over....&amp; Part of me doesn't think that's a bad thing.

173,"I've worked at the same place for the last seven years, and have always been a great employee. About two years ago, a new owner stepped in and has been running the place since. The week he started, a meeting was held for all employees in order for him to introduce himself formally to everyone. In the meeting, he brought up one of my family members who had worked at the same establishment many years ago, and ""set this whole place up for success."" After going on about how he respects this family member, he turned to me, in front of everybody, and said, ""but I dont owe you shit."" I kind of laughed it off awkwardly and assumed it was his sense of humor.  
   Things have been getting worse since. He held a contest one month and said that the winner would get a really great monetary prize. I ended up winning, and got $20. Whatever, he was bluffing, I didnt take it personally, but I was still salty. Even more salty when the next months winner, one of bosses buddies, got ten times more. He also insults me daily, including my hair, my style, and my ass on a couple occasions. This has been going on for months.  
  There have been multiple instances where he has berated me in front of coworkers and even guests. I explained to him that I will respect his authority and rules, but I requested that he respect me enough to not yell at me in front of everyone, and maybe pull me aside instead. I've gotten publicly berated every shift for my last three shifts. 
  The most recent bout arose due to my hair color. It's not technically natural, but I've had it since I started there seven years ago, before company policy changed, which was still two whole years ago,  and he told me that there would be consequences if I didnt change it soon because unnatural haircolors are against company policy. There are three other people that I work with that have way wilder color than I do, and he hasn't said a word to them about it. I honestly doubt he will.  
  I've done nothing for so long, and now I want to do something, but I dont know if i even have grounds to do so, or if i can afford to lose this job as a consequence. I can only take so much of this in a workplace that is already incredibly high anxiety. And it just sucks seeing him friendly with everyone else. I have no idea what I did to get him to hate me, and I've literally been called the ""best employee"" by multiple other managers, which I also think is kind of inappropriate as managers should in theory be unbiased, but in this case it just reaffirms that I dont deserve this.

174,"I'm a teenager in high school. I have a sister in her mid-20s who is married. Because of their work, they don't currently live together. The man she is married to was previously married and has a kid. Just a week ago, he spent some time with his elementary school aged  kid (and consequently ex-wife). He got back yesterday. Today we went to a party and he kept talking about how great of a time he had with his kid and how grateful his ex-wife was for him being there to help with homework and around the house. The husband will soon be moving to a different country for work and his flight departs from my state so he is staying with us for a day. My mom told me that my sister and her husband aren't really talking much and that she feels lonely and that they weren't getting along. At the party, I spent a lot of time near him (I didn't know anyone else). He was on his phone a decent amount. There were two text conversations that he kept going back and forth to. One was with the kid (or kid's name). On this one, it looked like there were no messages sent to him (at least recent). There was also a selfie. It's weird because his kid is very young still. I didn't think he would have a phone. The other one (which he seemed to look at more often) was that of his ex-wife. He kept checking this text conversation over and over. I get that you should keep positive relations with your ex-wife for your kid's sake but he was checking his phone all night (until it died). Also as his phone background, he has a picture of him, his kid and his ex-wife. All of these things may seem normal by themself but combined, it's at least a little suspicious. I'm the only one that looks at what he was doing on his phone.

Please don't dismiss me as paranoid. There are a lot of ""clues"" unfortunately. I care too much for my sister to simply not care. I obviously don't want to ruin their relationship (especially when I don't have any proof), but I would have no issue confronting him about it if there was proof. Why would he be more interested in talking to his ex-wife than my sister? Not once did I see him text my sister.

Tomorrow my mom and dad are taking him to the airport. My sister won't see him for a while (I would guess at least 6 months). I know my sister has been very depressed because she's been lonely. What, if anything, should I do?

175,"Hello.

Some basic info about my predicament:

The situation:

I burnt out in college this semester. Whether or not this is due to my home life or my own faults, I am not sure yet. I do know that a lot of underlying problems in my life, whether my own, or ones out of my control, caused me to just give up halfway through my semester. This led to several bad grades in my courses. I am by no means looking for any excuse or justification, and acknowledge that shit happens sometimes, and I can't change what's already happened. What I can do is plan for my future. I'm already talking with an advisor, and we have a plan in place that would minimize the negative effects and basically get me back on track within a semester or two. I would be dropping from slightly above a 3.0 GPA to slightly above a 2.0 GPA at the worst case, temporarily, and not at all in the best case. To anyone who wants more details, I would be happy to provide them.

The parent:

My dad is an extremely negative person. To give you an idea, I got a criminal speeding ticket, my first ticket in my entire life, earlier this year. My dad made it sound like I was never going to drive, ever again. He made it sound like my license was going to get revoked, I was going to be branded with a criminal record on insurance, that would make our rates skyrocket. He insisted on going with me to court appearances, and even the prosecutors/ lawyers we talked to asked why we were freaking out so much. I ended up getting the charge, a 250 dollar fine, and a \~10% bump in our insurance for the year. This is not an isolated incident, and he has caused me to freak out more times than I can count. To anyone who wants more details, I would be happy to provide them.

The problem:

I know my dad is going to explode if he finds out, without wanting any explanation whatsoever. He will quickly react by just taking away my access to my computer or something, thinking the issue is me using it, or by punishing me in some other way with little thought, and will use my failure this semester as justification to have more influence/control over my life. We have already had arguments about privacy and autonomy (I want mine, he doesn't think that I have any) and gotten into screaming matches (one-sided mostly, with him doing most) about what is and isn't respectful in our relationship and how I should respect his authority. He has tried to force me to give him college passwords, but considering he's tracked my emails/texts/calls in the past, I don't feel comfortable doing that.

**TLDR:** So basically, I'd like to bring the jar I bought from Goodwill to the house *clean* (it's the only cookie jar they have, and it's used for cookies, not just for display) before she decides to bake any cookies...which could be today, considering my moronic timing here.

179,"Hi,

(Context here )
I'm a 19 y-o male living in Europe, currently studying CompSci at a university, I also have a job in IT where I'm supposed to work once a week which pays really well considering my age and experience. Grew up with a good education and a great family, no history of mental illnesses / addiction as far as I know. I'm physically okay and socially okay too I guess/hope .

I think I can say that I more or less have everything to be happy, except I'm not.
I can't for fucks sake feel good for two days in a row, let alone an entire day. 


I have pretty much always displayed a lack of energy but now that I live alone it's really getting to me. I haven't gone to my courses this semester nor can I bring myself to go to work regularly (I'm lucky enough that they don't really care and that I don't rely on it to live). 

I don't think there's anything that passionates me as far as I know, there are some things that I enjoy but none that I really love.

Things I enjoy are mostly  :  playing games / chess / music / luxury watches.
I'm not sure that CompSci is made for me because I have no real interest for anything, it's just that I happen to know some stuff beforehand and that it will provide me with enough money. I don't think it's for me but I can't see myself doing something else either so meh.


I don't even think I enjoy being alive atm, I'm not saying that I'm suicidal but that I'm pretty indifferent to life, if I could just vanish I wouldn't mind it.

I don't have much of a routine, I just wake up, play games, watch some series or idk what, feel like shit, then go to bed and repeat.

What the hell is wrong with me  ? 
There's simply no motivation in me.

A few months ago, she found out that I have sent a text or two to my ex which was nothing but a few casual exchanges about how life is going on but she made a whole drama about it as if I have been cheating  on her. No, I honestly didn't. 
Last month I went with her to her parent's home to meet her family and meanwhile there she confessed that she slept with a guy who had been asking her out lately. I got furious and decided to break it up with her but  then she told me that all she said was just to hurt me back (for texting my ex). Okay I do have trust issues but I let of it thinking she might have not done what she said and only told me those to hurt me. 
So after that a few weeks later, I had to go out of town on some business and when I came back, we had a fight/argument over something and she again said that she slept with someone while I was away. Godammit!
It hurted me so much that I finally decided to end things and she again said that it was just mere words to hurt me and nothing else!
After all these, it's been good with her now but I am depressed thinking about what she said and whether it may be true or maybe not.  I honestly can't trust her anymore unlike earlier when I had a blind trust on her. She did it on her own, broke my trust for her and fucked up my mind.

183,"So I'm in a LDR, and have been for a year. We met on reddit, and are going to meet soon in the future. We've been going strong, and I love him. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, lately he's been doing subtle things on the app we talk/text on and it's been driving me nuts. I have an anxiety disorder, and some very mild abandonment issues, but both have been flaring up so to say because of these things. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean he's like, ignoring me or anything. But lately he's been avoiding calls from me. It's a little odd, and I've asked him about it but he tends to avoid answering it and I don't really understand why.. because he claims to hate texting. I don't think he's doing anything with another girl and trying to hide it or anything, though. It's not that big of an issue for me. But for the past few weeks he's been answering my text super quickly, texting me a lot more than he usually does(Which I'm happy about, but it's still unlike him), and has been more affectionate overall.  It's such a sudden change where, even though I'm happy with it, I feel like he's getting ready to drop off the face of the planet. And then the subtle things he's done with his account, like changing privacy settings so no one can see when he was last online, disabling his profile picture, ect. just makes it a whole lot more worse. But asking him about it - his answer is usually ""idk."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the reason I'm so worried is because back in March he basically pulled a disappearing act, and his phone was disconnected the entire month and I had no idea where was, or if he was going to come back. Really he hadn't paid his bill(Thanks T-mobile voice box), but when he came back he was acting a little different and wouldn't tell me why he was gone or what went on. Again, I don't think he was cheating, he still shows full interest in me. In fact just yesterday, I told him I loved him and he responded with ""Lye"" which means ""Love you eternally."" He's always there when I'm upset or down, and is pretty caring when it comes to me, but when it comes to how he's doing, how he's feeling, he's kinda distant when it comes to himself. I mean he still talks about what he likes and doesn't like, and will still share details about himself, but then in other areas about his life he can be kind of secretive and come across like he's hiding something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly am I just over reacting? Should I say anything to him about what I'm feeling? I'd hate to make him feel like I don't trust him. I'm mostly okay with the change, other than feeling worried he'll leave out of nowhere. What do I do? ",09Dec2018,1

I recently started back going to church and I decided to start volunteering at the youth event every week. Well, this week was my first week and I saw this girl there. IMO she was very pretty and seemed like a genuinely nice person. I saw a [F]riend talking to her and asked about her.

191,"I only really talk or hang out with three people in my school. They are all separate people in the way that they usually do not talk to each other until this year with they all have the same schedule except for me. Slowly as a square is going on, each one of them are getting worse and worse to me. This can go to random insults just for laughing, screwing me over with work, or just plain out ignoring me or excluding me purposely. I am very kind to every single one of them and I help / listen to all of their problems but I am not sure why this behavior is getting so. I came to the conclusion that I am very annoying and immature and I have tried countless times in order just to be quiet nothing bad happens. with this happening, and never goes ‚Äúwell when I break my own promise and I start talking. 

does anyone have any tips how to either confront or deal with this, can you find or make new friends, or how just suck it up and deal with it? Thank youuu",09Dec2018,1
192,"I'm a full time university student and also work part time (though lately I've been working full time hours). I moved about three hours away from home to attend this school, and have been rented a room from a friend for a little over 7 months. I knew their lease was up at the end of this year, and as far as I knew, I had until then to find another place to stay. However, while I was visiting home for Thanksgiving, everyone basically moved out and cancelled services in the house. At the beginning of this month, I was forced to move onto my school's campus because I was not given enough time to find a new room to rent, as I had originally planned. This gave me more time to find a new place, but I will have to move out by the 21st of this month. With it approaching the end of the semester, I have been busy preparing for finals, so I still haven't had much time to check out any places. I did find two rooms, but they both fell through.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now at the point where I have a week to find a place. If I do not, I will have to arrange to live on campus and move back home for a month. There are several problems with this. It doesn't give me enough time to give a two week notice at my job, where I am an integral part of the team, and don't see my managers letting me go that easily. Ultimately it doesn't matter what they want or say, I'm going to have to leave, but I don't want to tarnish my reputation quitting like that. If I had the time to look for a place, money is not an issue as far as renting a room. However, I just don't have the time to be checking places out right now, as all I have time for is finals prep and work. Additionally, I just don't think a week's notice is a long enough time to move into a new place. I also don't have any furniture. I really don't know if I should keep trying to find a place, or just prepare to (temporarily) move out of town. Any advice?",09Dec2018,1

As I got older I would just get extremely stressed and find it difficult to breath and cry but I didn‚Äôt have to be held down. At this age I still get that tight feeling in my chest but I just look the other way and even though my mind is making me think it‚Äôs going to hurt terribly the shots really don‚Äôt hurt much. I mean I tear up my hands and experience all kinds of pain in gymnastics so this should be nothing yet it stresses me so much.

The shots I‚Äôve gotten more used to but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever gotten my blood drawn and I‚Äôm so afraid of it. Just thinking about the needle going into my vein and then having to wait there for them to take enough blood scares me so much. My family says it isn‚Äôt that bad and doesn‚Äôt hurt. My sister has Crohn‚Äôs disease and her medicine is taken through IV monthly so she‚Äôs used to it and says it‚Äôs just pressure at first then you don‚Äôt really realize it but she‚Äôs also mentioned stories of how they miss the vein or don‚Äôt pick the right one and have to try multiple times. My mom says I have big veins and I guess I do but I‚Äôm still so scared.

195,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old female for reference. I just started college in September, met a great guy I‚Äôve been dating pretty much the whole time, and I finally figured out I want to go to PA school. I still live with my parents and I commute to college.

My mom got into contact with a former coworker from when she was around my age in the summer and they‚Äôve been texting nonstop ever since. I was suspicious for a while but Friday she lied about where she was when she was clearly at the bar with this guy and she refused to answer my dad‚Äôs phone calls. My dad had a huge fight with her when she came home and accused her of lying and they haven‚Äôt talked since.

So tonight I was talking to my brother (he‚Äôs 13) about it because I went out with my boyfriend after work, and we logged into my mother‚Äôs Facebook and... there was the proof. They text each other that they love each other every night and call each other pet names and I found out that pretty much every time she said she was with one of her friends she‚Äôs been with him. I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôve had sex yet based on what I read but even if they didn‚Äôt, this is bad.

It‚Äôs so close to Christmas and I don‚Äôt want to ruin things for my brother. My boyfriend already knows, and he was supposed to come to my orchestra concert and sit with them... I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll just tell him not to come. Unfortunately the university closes down for break and he can‚Äôt get a ride for at least a day so he was gonna sleep at my house, but if my house is in an uproar... he‚Äôs screwed. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if I should wait until after the holidays to do anything because I don‚Äôt want to ruin things for my brother either. He knows about it too now, of course, but as his big sister I know I hold the responsibility here. 

If I do anything, what should I do? And when should I broach this subject?

Also, what pisses me off more than anything is that my mom tells this guy all sorts of things about my life and my boyfriend and shit. It was just gross reading all that. And maybe I was in the wrong for that (her password was really dumb though) but I‚Äôve had suspicions for long enough. Another thing that pisses me off is that she says she has such a problem with me sleeping at my boyfriend‚Äôs house over break (when all we‚Äôve done is kiss really and like just explore our bodies I guess? We haven‚Äôt done anything that sexual although it‚Äôs gotten heated but hey, we‚Äôre 18 and we‚Äôre on the same page and we weren‚Äôt going to fuck over break)... but like... she‚Äôs been cheating on my dad this whole time.

198,"Hi, so this is my first post sorry if it‚Äôs not the same format as other posts. 
 TL;DR at the bottom. 

My title is pretty self explanatory, but I‚Äôll explain the situation. I work at McDonalds so not a really great workplace mostly based on pushing younger workers (15/16ys) than the effectiveness of where workers are placed due to them being paid less. Usually I would work in the kitchen no interaction with customers and I would cook a lot of the fried chicken hash browns etc. 

Lately because I turned 18 however, my job is slowly being replaced by younger kids and my ‚Äújob‚Äù is now to literally ONLY wipe tables and empty bins. So now I have to interact and be around customers all the time which is really not great as a lot of them treat you like a walking bin. 

Today I was working and about three-quarters of the way through my shift I was wiping down the booth tables. Now there had been some young teenagers on this particular booth who made a mess all the way up to the wall meaning I had to lean forward to lean it off. Behind me there was another table but it was like a high free standing table and two boys were sitting there who looked like they were about 15.  I thought nothing of it and started to go about my job but as I leaned forward I heard VERY distinctly and loudly a camera shutter behind me go off and instantly I wheeled around and saw this kid jump and hide his phone in his lap and looked me dead in the eyes and said nothing. 

I was so angry at this kid and confused I had no idea what to do while he just made prolonged uncomfortable eye contact. I‚Äôve never had this happen before and even though I was older than this boy I had no idea what to do so I walked away and I didn‚Äôt even tell a manager. 

I‚Äôm about to leave this workplace however and go into a much better workplace for 18 year olds but in this situation what was I supposed to do? What should I do if it happens at my new workplace? 


TL;DR. 15 year old looking boy took a photo of my ass while I was bent over wiping a table and me being older than him but never having any experience in this said nothing to anyone and walked away angry and confused.

204,"I'm 20, i go to university in a different country, and i have many friends of many different religions. My parents have grown up and lived in our home country their whole lives, which is predominantly Catholic. All their friends are catholic, they go to church every sunday, they go to all the events, are good friends with the priest, etc etc.

Since day 1 they have made me and my brother go to sunday school, attend mass with them and basically just follow them into religion expecting us to believe in everything the same way they do. I'm not sure about my brother as i haven't specifically asked, but it's been a few years now that i've realised that i just...don't believe. We were in a church youth group for so many years and watching other kids my age pray so hard and sing their hearts out in worship and i just never felt it, i never felt god you know? 

I'm not sure how to describe it and so i wasn't really sure how to tell my parents for so long. But now i'm pretty sure i'm agnostic? I don't want this thread to be people convincing me to believe in one thing or the other, i just need advice on how to deal with my parents.

You see i have a friend from high school, we'd gone to church together for god knows how long and one day he stopped showing up but his family kept going, i asked and he said he told his parents he didn't believe and they were understandably a bit mad but grew to be okay with it in the end. So i was thinking how hard could it be? I can weather the storm of a few days or even a week of them being mad as long as in the end they would accept it.

This morning, sunday morning, they were up getting ready to go to church as usual. I had just come home from university for the holidays, and i thought now was as good a time as any, so i told them. Mom, dad, i'm not going to church. I don't believe in god the same way you do and i don't feel that it would be right for me to continue going to something i don't believe in.

And they flipped. Oh man they flipped. ""Oh yeah all your friends aren't religious so you are conveniently not religious now?"" ""Oh it's cause you're in another country now that you feel you can give up your roots?"" and other arguments like that. Like yeah, i knew they wouldn't take it well, but from the sounds of their voices and just the way they acted, i'm not sure if i could ever get through to them.

I'm not trying to convince them to stop believing, i just want them to know that catholicism and tbh even christianity in general isn't for me. I'm pretty sure i'm agnostic and i told them this but they were not convinced at all.

So they've gone to church now and i'm left at home nervously waiting for them to come back. My brother isn't home from uni yet so i don't even have his backing or his opiniom of what to do. I have a hunch that he is in a similar position to me but just doesn't want to tell them. See i hadn't told them for years because i was afraid they would react badly, and now they've reacted badly i'm not sure what to do and not sure how to convince them to understand me.

I was wondering if anyone could possibly give me some advice on this. I feel like the answer is simple, and I know it sounds a little silly, but I just dont really know...

Its 4am rn.. I have really bad insomnia tn (it happens every once in a while). Usually it's not a big deal. It happens so infrequently that I usually just let it ride out, go to work the next day tired af, come home and just go to bed. But today:

I have plans with a friend who's visiting from out of town, around 11. Originally, she said she wasnt going to be able to see anyone because she was only here for the one day to go to a family wedding. But she invited me to get lunch with her and her sister. I dont get to see her often because she lives in another state, so I feel really bad about canceling. 

But I also want to get enough sleep because I have other chores to do before the busy work week, 

and I have a dress rehearsal a little later in the day, and our performance is this week, so I cant really skip it? 

What would be the best way to go about this? Lol

216,"A bit over a month ago my (ex) best friend and I broke up. We‚Äôll call him B. 

Back story: 

B and I have been coworkers for 5 years. Roughly 3.5 years ago, we became good friends. First day we hung out, he asked if I wanted to date him. I said no, but we continued to be friends. He fell hard, but never told me. A year and a half later I start dating another coworker, who I‚Äôll call L. B stops talking to me For a year and a half, without explanation or warning. I figured it was because he had feelings. 

Another year and a half go by and I reach out to him. We become BEST friends. We have a huge conversation about how he had feelings for me and was upset with himself that I didn‚Äôt have them back. We talk and we get over it, he says he‚Äôs good being friends again. This guy is my soulmate, but in friend form. I love him. We click so well. I wish I could be in love with him, but I‚Äôm not physically attracted to him (not that he isn‚Äôt attractive, but I just am not attracted to him). I think he has beautiful eyes and attractive features, and sometimes I‚Äôll wonder ‚Äúhmm is this attraction?‚Äù But i don‚Äôt think so. 

Anyway, a few months after us becoming best friends, L and I break up, very toxic relationship. B and I get even closer.  This whole time, we talk every day. I want to talk to him all the time. I‚Äôve never liked talking to someone as much. He goes on vacation and we don‚Äôt text (I left him on ‚Äòread‚Äô) for three days. 

He blows up when I message him on day 4- ‚Äúyou left me on read, you were supposed to message me. We go months texting every day and you stop.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou posted on Twitter that you went on a date with a coworker‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt even HAVE a Twitter, like I don‚Äôt even know his username. Other stuff comes up ‚Äúyou‚Äôve said you did nothing all day but your Snapchat location says otherwise‚Äù  ...errands ‚ÄúI expected a heads up about you going on a date with someone from work‚Äù 

It boiled down to him saying ‚Äúeveryday I have to choose being your best friend but hurting knowing that we can‚Äôt be together. Or I have to stop our friendship and become numb from how much I‚Äôll miss you.‚Äù 

I didn‚Äôt like how it felt he was trying to be controlling, so he said ending the friendship would be best. He deleted me off everything. We ignore each other at work even though he is an indirect supervisor and I‚Äôm trying to get promoted. 

It‚Äôs been over a month. I‚Äôm a mess. I feel so lonely and I miss him more than any ex I‚Äôve ever had. I messaged him asking where we stand, because seeing him every day and actively ignoring each other sucks. That id be willing to talk in person. I think he blocked my number. It‚Äôs been 2.5 hours.

So a little background: I currently live (with roommates) 15-20 mins from work, 7-14 mins from school. I‚Äôm fully ready, after 8 years, to live on my own. I‚Äôm a bartender, and the best (very conservative) estimate of monthly income I can come up with is around 2100 a month. Also drive an old beat up car (99 Camry) that might die at some point in the near future. Another thing worth mentioning: the neighborhood I‚Äôm attempting to move into is one of the most sought-after neighborhoods in my city and the average price for a one bedroom in the city is 950.

Though it‚Äôs probably really early to start looking for feb/March leases, I have found a place for $800 a month literally 2 blocks from work available feb 8. It‚Äôs a very cute English basement apartment (super common in the historic neighborhood I want to move to). There are virtually no amenities aside from central heat/ac. Water and sewer are included. No dishwasher, washer/dryer, no garbage disposal. And I happen to have a mutual friend with the person who currently lives there (and has lived there for 7 years). I‚Äôve spoken to her about what she likes/dislikes about the place, and her major complaints were that it‚Äôs cold in the winter due to gaps in doors and windows (but I‚Äôm thinking weather stripping could be a big help) and that there‚Äôs a fruit fly issue in the spring/summer.

218,"For the past few years, I've been working in a state residential juvenile program, doing behavioral treatment with teenage boys. It's been extremely rewarding and I've learned at least as much from working with these kids as they have from me. Over the course of helping some of them work through trauma, and make connections between their past trauma and their current behaviors, I've slowly begun to understand some things about myself better.

It all came to a head a few months ago when it hit me like a ton of bricks one morning on my way to work - I'd suffered repeated sexual trauma from a young age over the course of several years and it all came back to me at once.

Not only am I not sure where to begin to work through this experience that I'd completely buried until now, but it's really called in to question some other aspects of my identity - including questions I've had about my own sexual orientation for years that I realize now were actually blatant fetishization of my own trauma.

219,"Background: 
Single 33F here. Live in a small southern town (pop. 15K). Only child. My Dad (70) and my Mom (59 w/ severe mental illness) live 30 miles away. I am a young professional. I have an excellent career (7.5 years at my job). I like my job. I love my co-workers. I own my very own beautiful house and have 3 large dogs. I am physically attractive, funny, creative, likeable. (I think?) I have pretty severe, unpredictable depression from time to time, but on meds. I also have rheumatoid arthritis and metal in my leg from a severe break last year. 

I am lonely. Went through a broken engagement 4 years ago and rough breakup 2 years ago, and have dated off and on (guys 45 minutes+ away) the last two years which all end after a month or two. It's taken a toll on me mentally and I am so terribly discouraged. I've had difficulty meeting guys my age with enough things in common (career, intellect, health, common interests, political views, religion). I feel like I'm getting older fast and ""running out of options""...

2.5 months ago, I applied for a great job (what I'm doing now) that's 3.5 hours away in a suburb of a really cool, larger city (general area population 600K). 

Aaand, to complicate things... Since then, I actually met a guy here (local!) that I like. Great timing, right? He's 5 years my junior because any single here is younger. He doesn't mind our age difference. But he's also aloof, doesn't really talk about feelings yet, and hard to read. Because it's so very early I don't know if it's going anywhere. I certainly don't want to put all my eggs in one basket. 

I'll be honest, I'd love nothing more than to stay here and get married and start a family with a local to have our family support as well. But it may never happen. I feel hopeless when I'm not dating. When I meet someone new I like I get my hopes up and get destroyed. 

Of course, as it would happen, they interviewed me 2 weeks ago and offered me the job. 

(I told the new guy about it and he's kind of pulled back a bit since. I don't know why.)

It really is a rare opportunity as my job is highly specialized and openings don't come up often. I have a week to decide. 

So far.....

**Here are my cons of going**
Leaving my aging/ill parents 
Selling my house :(
Buying a new (more expensive) house :/
Actually physically (and mentally taxing) moving
Starting a new job is stressful (what if I hate it?)
My own mental illness is unpredictable
Leaving my job where I'm comfortable
Leaving my friends here
Leaving my co-workers (who I also love)
Very low cost of living here
Can use money I've saved (for move) to focus on self improvements (travel, health, home updates)
Giving up potential(?) in new guy
Giving up a compressed four 10hr day schedule

**Here are my pros of going**
Possibly meet my match to date/marry 
Not missing a rare opportunity to leave
Start fresh near a cool new city

Wasn‚Äôt sure whether to flair this as serious or family so I went with the first one

I‚Äôm just gonna start off by saying that I am older than 16 but younger than 19. Now, onto the main point of this post. 

Around 5 months ago, some accusations were made against my mother that she was cheating on my father. I still don‚Äôt know if these accusations are true or not but this is what started everything. After a few nights of fighting which eventually got physical, my mother moved out and took my younger brother with her, which I think was the best course of action given the situation. I was left to decide whether or not I wanted to continue living at home with my father or go out of town with my mother. I decided to stay in the city with my father but I made a point to make it clear that my decision was not me picking favourites or anything and that it was purely school related as I was already registered at the local high school. I‚Äôve been able to get by on that excuse but with Christmas coming up and fast, tensions have been running kind of high again and I feel as if both my parents have put me in a position where I *must* choose one of them. I feel like I can‚Äôt leave my father alone as he truly is alone right now, he‚Äôs had some troubles with his own family. I also feel like I can‚Äôt leave my mother because, well, she‚Äôs my mother. I‚Äôm sure this is a very classic scenario but this is my first time dealing with anything like this. What should I do?

tl;dr: I need to decide if I should go on to stay home and live with my father or move out of town with my mother ",09Dec2018,1
223,"So since turning 26 back in March I feel like my brain has been in complete turmoil. I know plenty of 30+ year olds who still appear young, beautiful and full of life, but I STILL can't get over the idea that thirty = ''on the shelf'' and no longer ''young''. 

I look and act a fair bit younger than my actual age, and to watch the people I grew up with getting engaged, buying houses and having babies is freaks me out. I don't want that stuff for a long time, maybe even at all. 

There is SO MUCH going through my mind. If I wait too long, will the man who was meant for me be taken and I'll settle for someone I don't love to avoid being alone? What if I get married and suddenly decide I definitely don't want kids and he leaves me? What if it's the other way round? 

I also suffer quite badly with mental health issues which I'm struggling to get help for. I worry a lot about my parents no longer being around - what if my mental health gets even worse and I end up homeless because of the times I struggle to go to work? 

I wish I could just pause life so I can focus on making my brain better.

My panic about getting older is so bad that I've literally paralyzed myself into achieving absolutely nothing. Literally, all I've done this year is focus on my career, because that's one thing I can semi do right. 

I so want to go live in a city again, travel, maybe live abroad. I always thought I was a badass - I literally jumped out of a plane on a whim - but I'm not brave at all any more.

This has escalated so badly that I can't sleep at night. I take a sleeping pill so I don't have to be awake. I honestly feel like I'm being slowly suffocated. 

I would really, really appreciate some advice from an older person who's already been here.",09Dec2018,1
224,"I have a feeling she will see this as she stalks r/opiates as if her life depended on it.
WHATTHEFUCKEVER , hi baby ;) anyway‚Äî- 

Long story short, actually, I‚Äôm not sure how short this will be...

I (26) just paid the LAST of my check on my roommate(25) (we‚Äôve known each other going on three years &amp; have dated in the past- our relationship is quite close - god bless being queer) for a plane ticket home from rehab. 
I am not ‚Äòwell off‚Äô I mostly live paycheck to paycheck so to me that is kind of a big deal. She is aware of this. 

She was there 29 days. She was advised not to leave yet, but tis the season &amp; daddi wanted to come home. 

I got off work early on Friday to pick her up from the airport. She told me she was going to her parents upon her arrival which was totally cool imo as they are supportive of her sobriety. So we get home she insists on ordering a Lyft over there, okay ya whatevs do ur thing boo. 
We had planned to go on a hike today (Saturday). &amp; she told me to contact her in the am. Following that plan I called - no answer.. then she text saying that she wasn‚Äôt feeling well &amp; needed a ‚Äòchill in bed day‚Äô. Okay cool take ur time adjusting back into the real world. I can understand that the transition is weird, so I proceeded to do what I was originally going to before bailing her out of rehab ( ~1000 miles away) which was go on my own hike at a different location. 

I went it was lovely. 
I am also freshly sober but off some different stuff.. 
this is how I get my fix these days. 

I didn‚Äôt have service up there but once I did again the texts started to roll in. She said that she felt better after eating n taking a nap &amp; was going to be hanging out with 3 people I had never heard of. By this time I had weird feelings about wtf was actually going on but trusted her word that she didn‚Äôt want to use &amp; these people were ‚Äòclean‚Äô. 
She told me she was going to be home.
She wasn‚Äôt when I got back, so I just did my thing, then they arrived. Two of the three people couldn‚Äôt look me in the eye (another red flag for me) upon meeting me.
They proceed to go to her room where they stayed locked up for the next couple hrs. 
We had all talked about going dumpster diving.
Never happened..
They went to Safeway &amp; then came back. Right to her room again. 
I figured it wasn‚Äôt gonna happen so I decided to lay down &amp; watch a movie. 
I started to smell pot, I honestly didn‚Äôt wanna believe it.
Then I heard the front door close. 
So I text asking if she was still home, her response was a yes. 
So I asked her about the weed, she answered honestly- yes there WAS pot being smoked. &amp; I thanked her for her honesty &amp; said nn 

Fast forward about 20 minutes I hear a kitchen drawer &amp; tinfoil being ripped. So I got up &amp; checked what was going on.
Caught her in the hall way with the perfect piece of foil for smoking heroin. 
Asked her what she was doing 
Her response ‚Äòwhatever the FUCK I want‚Äô 
&amp; went to her room.

I LOST IT 

Snatched up the foil &amp; went to my room 
I am not proud of this 
I proceeded to beat my bed with the foil probably being louder than I thought exclaiming GOD DAMNIT over &amp; over 

Before she left I saw &amp; had to deal with some very traumatic life or death situations, dealing with needles -the whole nine yards. Foils everywhere. 
I was an enemy in my own home. 

So fast forward to the present moment. 
I am beyond hurt. My heart is broken for this person &amp; I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do. 

She is the type of person who always has a get out of jail free card.

My resentments &amp; pain are telling me to call the police.
I don‚Äôt know. 

I do know I do NOT want heroin in my home, &amp; I don‚Äôt want a repeat of the past.

I did set my alarm for the morning &amp; plan to go to her parents if I don‚Äôt call the police..

But I‚Äôm so over all of this. &amp; it‚Äôs taking everything in me to NOT dial 911. 

&amp; I do really care for &amp; love her. I am at wits end here.

I‚Äôm sorry if this is hard to read. I am feeling pretty manic &amp; had a panic attack right after I saw the foil in her hand &amp; have been in &amp; out of that headspace since. 

Please help in any way. I‚Äôve tried calling multiple people but it‚Äôs late &amp; no one has responded.

229,"30 years ago almost to the day my dad was involved in a fatal car accident drunk. He did seven years for it, still keeps in contact with the parents of the victims, and is very repentant. He has not taken a sip of alcohol since the night of that accident when he was 20.
Lately a few things happened that upset the routine. His dad died, a miserable guy to be honest, and my dad always felt that his dad was miserable because his wife made him stop drinking and he always regretted it. I think the death put him in a really weak emotional state and also maybe caused him to think back on his dad‚Äôs sober life vs. drunk life. 
Then he gets a HUGE pile of work that‚Äôs all expected to be finished by Christmas and I can see he‚Äôs spinning his wheels a little. He needs help, but my brothers just aren‚Äôt really picking up the slack. I can see that further stressed him out and he has been coming home from work really irritable and combative. We have had a very good family dynamic for a solid decade, and this kind of combativeness is rare for dad.
Third, my mom and I drink (very conservatively), and my 21st is coming up soon so we‚Äôve been talking about it a little more than normal. But my dad has been really trying to show us that he‚Äôs alright with us drinking even if he doesn‚Äôt partake, so he‚Äôs been stocking the fridge and offering to take us out more than we would normally choose to drink. Friday night got a little out of hand, and dad plied us with alcohol until we were very tipsy. It was a good time, but more than normal drinking. 
Then tonight, dad leaves at 9 and says he needs to get some work done and can‚Äôt sleep. In the middle of the night my brother has a medical emergency and I take him to the ER, but notice dads truck isn‚Äôt home. I call, he doesn‚Äôt pick up. After little brother is all taken care of and stapled up, I call dad a few more times and he picks up and says he‚Äôs at his shop. He‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm there. He swears he‚Äôll be coming right out, but he doesn‚Äôt. Finally I see him walking up the street obviously drunk, stumbling back from the bar a few blocks down. 

Maybe I should start a conversation about drinking in moderation sometime, but it REALLY worries me given the circumstances and the fact that he chose to take his first drink in 30 years alone without telling his wife or kids. How do I approach this? I feel especially bad that he said ‚Äúyou and mom made it look like fun‚Äù ",09Dec2018,1

231,"Sorry again, but I seem to be stuck in a rather deep rut.   
22 Male, Full time worker.  
Recently I've been depressed and struggling to think as to what I should make out of this life.   
\- I want to migrate to another location  
\- I want to resume college (even though I still don't know what I want from it)  
\- I also want to invest my money into either land or houses  
but I still want to keep my job to be able to afford my car payments on top of other things I want. Which means I don't have time for school unless I want to borderline live paycheck to paycheck.   
I love my friends to death as we have known each other for about 12 years now, but they just aren't going anywhere in life and surely not setting up for a good early start either. They smoke pot all the time and work part time just enjoying the moment ( I don't mind the pot or in the moment) but they just aren't doing much like traveling, seeing things, going out to have fun, meet-ups. I don't want to ditch them as 12 years is basically blood at this point but I also can't be weighed down by the feeling of leaving them either.   
\- I purposely don't have a Girlfriend as I really feel strongly about migrating so I wouldn't want to play anybody  
I have so many roads to take and none of them are easy, on top of being able to decide which one to conquer first.  
**If I migrate:** I risk not having a job which in the end will destroy my credit and I wont have money/ being kicked out of said migration.  
**If I resume College:** I can't work full time, will borderline be living paycheck to paycheck, will inquire debt(I don't qualify for fafsa), won't have any time for myself as I will be working and doing school. Also won't be able to invest into something.  
**If I invest my money into real-estate:** Can't afford school as future savings will be drained, will inquire more responsibility, maybe getting money/losing money, will start my portfolio early as an investor.  
I don't have any money saved up as I have been just enjoying life since I boxed myself up for 2 years focusing on getting to a good point, and all these roads lead away to having friends, potentially not having an '*adult*' career, or leave me in debt with possible bad credit.   
I live my life simply, don't smoke too much pot, don't drink a lot, the occasional acid trip to '*discover ones self*'. Hell, I don't even own much by design.    
I don't have skills in anything as once I learn how to do something I get bored and move on - which I know is a bad trait to have but I'm more focused on trying to find something I like to do for a living rather than wasting too much time doing a single thing.   
Sometimes I want to move to Colorado or Canada ( more towards Canada) to learn more about the pot industry as it's new to the market and has yet to fully flourish ( which means a possible good investment to start a business).   
**Problem is:** I can only pick one thing as these are major, life changing choice in both good and bad.    
I need actual guidance, opinions, help, insight, maybe another angle to look at it from that can solve something.  
**P.S:** I have seen a few therapists for help and they straight up told me they couldn't, I don't have a chemical deficiency, I just happen to have a '*knowledgeable moral compass*' , I've even taken personality exams with over 600 questions in them.

I thought this was funny because about a month ago we‚Äôd had a talk about *exactly* what it was I do in there. I use a magic flight launch box to vaporize the thc from marijuana flowers. I showed him the vape and everything, when we had that talk, because he asked he same question then. Except then he said ‚Äúnah it‚Äôs cool dude. I‚Äôm not into it myself but I don‚Äôt mind when you do it.‚Äù So I went about my business, keeping my own hours, smoking at my leisure. Thought everything was cool and I never heard peep about it until about two hours ago (3:30 am ish?) now he had just recently come to bed ~2:30 or so, and I had gone out to the living room for a minute, then came back and smoked.  

So anyway after I told him I was smoking, he basically blew up at me. About how I was super inconsiderate and had kept him up ‚Äúevery night this semester.‚Äù

I'm currently doing nothing and making nothing. I have a bit of saving and of course my family to really support me.  
I don't really have any passion or even hobbies, all my life I was addicted to video games, tv shows and hanging out with friends?

I'm not bad looking myself, but my confidence sucks and I tend to stutter when I'm nervous. I've been working on that and trying to get better. I've talked to this girl a couple times in the past, even getting her number around the 1st semester I met her. It's been roughly 2 years since then and my anxiety made it so my only messages to her were, ""Hey, it's me from class."" and ""Do you have the notes from last class?"". 2 years ago, and in that time I've barely spoken to her much more. I sent her a friend request on facebook too but her page seems pretty dead and she hasn't accepted it.

She's actually talked to me this semester, but nothing huge, just once or twice after class she'd have some small talk with me about the major, where I'm from, etc.

The end of the semester is coming up and I really, really want to talk to her more in depth.

TL;DR;  I have feelings for my friend and think she might feel the same way but things are getting complicated.  That is I like her way too much, she has multiple partners, and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.  We also have a trip planned for Christmas, just the two of us with lots of alcohol involved.  It just seems a recipe for disaster if we don‚Äôt have a small talk about things.

Please read the previous post if you want to comment.

So, I‚Äôm thinking about just telling her, I have feelings for her, and I‚Äôm not comfortable going on a ‚Äúromantic vacation‚Äù with her given that I have feelings for her, and would be hoping for more. I think it‚Äôs better to nip it in the bud before things get too weird, and we have an 8hr awkward drive home.

1. Should I just keep letting things go as they are?
2. Tell  her we should end things completely since things are so one-sided, and I don‚Äôt want to become bitter (there is no reason to be bitter)
3. Ghost her, and just move on,, which would be really abrupt given we‚Äôre close.
4. Be more forthright and just go all in when she asks me back to her place again sometime, after we go out.

TL;DR: how should I proceed with my friend. I really like her and. I know things will be messy either way.   Letting things coast as they are seemed cowardly, and I may be missing out on something more.  I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

248,"Hey guys. So my 22 year old sister has always been fairly big but recently it‚Äôs been getting worrying. She doesn‚Äôt exercise nor does she eat that great. When we try and speak to her about it she gets aggressive? I‚Äôm her younger brother (19) who loves exercising and feeling well and eating well etc and I feel like if she were in my position it would truly change her life. How can we intervene? She‚Äôs a really lovely girl but the unhealthy aspect of her life hangs over her and the family like a storm cloud... Any suggestions?

249,"My sister recently moved back into my moms house with me and the rest of the family (im 16, shes 20-something).

I've noticed her being in the living room, constantly on her laptop editing some videos (for several hours every day). I didn't take much mind to it, until I realized ever since she came back my internet connection has been awfully shit. Which as someone who spends alot of time playing competitive games, this kinda pissed me off as it meant I  would randomly get booted off my games (often in the middle of them), whenever she randomly decided to upload these vlogs of hers.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to see what she was up to and searched her up on youtube. And I found the most embarrassing, cringe inducing vlogs Ive seen yet. Maybe it was because I knew her personally, but it was just so hard to watch. 

&amp;#x200B;

She claims the videos are meant solely for her husband. But then she adds things like clickbaity titles (such as ""I HAD A BREAKDOWN"" and the likes. Accompanied by clickbaity thumbnails, which often include emojis, excessive punctuation and close ups on her making an exaggerated face. She even has a poorly edited intro, and an outro telling people to subscribe. Just looks like a very sad and desperate attempt to become a popular 'youtuber'.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly I thought she had more self awareness than this, as this is clearly something shes ganna look back on, in 5 years and cringe at. And I have no idea what I should do. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand im pissed how she just randomly moves back into our house and screws over the internet, and the other hand im extremely embarrased for her.",09Dec2018,1
250,"I‚Äôm a barista at a coffee shop near my university‚Äôs campus. Because of this, I serve not only a lot of students but a lot of faculty as well. Over the years, I‚Äôve gotten to know quite a few professors on a first-name basis. One in particular‚Äîwhom I‚Äôll call David‚Äîhas taken somewhat of an inappropriate interest in me, always flirtatious and over-complimentary. Questions of professional ethics aside, I‚Äôve always loved the attention and certainly didn‚Äôt do much to discourage it.

Until recently, he had been just David, my regular customer. That changed when I found myself taking one of his courses this semester. I thought it might mean he‚Äôd stop coming in as often or maybe being less friendly, but the opposite was true. He even insisted that I continue to call him David‚Äîeven in class. 

I knew it was technically considered wrong, but his flirting was always so harmless. 

Then, a few days ago, I dropped by his office to pick up a graded test. He was busy helping another student and said I could take a seat at his desk and wait for him. The student left and walked up behind me, sliding his hand on my back as he walked across the desk and sat across from me.  That day some of his jokes toed the line between ‚Äúflirty‚Äù and ‚Äúblatantly suggestive.‚Äù He was asking about boyfriends and whether I liked going to parties‚Äîthings he‚Äôs never brought up before. 

Later that evening, I was working and he came in. hey He didn‚Äôt stay long and before leaving, gave me his personal cell number offering to ‚Äúhelp me develop my thesis some more.‚Äù As he handed it to me on the back of his university-standard business card, his hands lingered just a little too long on mine. 

After that, there was no longer any doubt in my mind that he wants to sleep with me too. And, to be honest, I think I want that too.

I‚Äôm just so worried about what the potential consequences might be. We‚Äôre both single, consenting adults and I‚Äôll no longer be his student in just a week so I personally think it‚Äôs a non issue, but I know better than that.

Still, I wonder what‚Äôs the worst that could happen. And until I figure that out I won‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôm willing to take. 

tl;dr - a customer (who also happens to be a professor at my university) has been coming onto me strongly since we met. lately he‚Äôs been even more forward, giving me his personal cell number, making lingering physical contact, etc. I‚Äôm not made uncomfortable by this and am actually very interested in him as well. the problem is that I took his class this semester and he‚Äôs still my teacher for another week.

I‚Äôm a very affectionate person so when I was invited to sleep in their bed I didn‚Äôt think twice about it. His girlfriend was in the bathroom at the time (and later fell asleep on the couch while it happened)

As I was exhausted from being up early, I went into ‚Äútime to sleep‚Äù mode pretty quickly. He and was next to me and started cuddling me but I was still trying to be pretty motionless.

I was in a car accident about a month ago that left me with minor injuries. The air bag hit me in the face and the injuries left me with vision problems for about two weeks and facial abrasions . This all healed pretty fast but the air bag basically burned off my eyebrows and eyelashes. I‚Äôm a girl and my eyelashes are pretty important to me, they make me feel more feminine . I had medium length lashes before ( pretty long in my opinion) but I‚Äôm seeing barely any eyelash growth since the accident. Also the texture of my lashes is more brittle , I figured that would go away because they were caked with blood, skin and pus for a while
But even now that my face is fully healed, they feel harder . My eyebrows have begun to grow back but my eyelashes haven‚Äôt , is there any way I could boost the growth and soften them again ? Also if anyone has had any experience with this, how long did it for take them to grow back? Also I had a tooth knocked out of place, which my dentist said should be fine.

253,".Just going to say it in the start, my english isnt the best. Allright so i (16m) have had a crush on this girl from my school for a while now (we will just call her Michelle as that would make this easier to write) and yesterday we went to a party together, and i was going to go for her. And it went really well we dancing and shit and i almost gone the whole way. I had to go to the toilet at some point, and when i came back my best friend (We'll call him Pete) was dancing with her. Pete knew i had a crush on her. I just pulled him aside and asked him why he did it and he apologized, so nothing wrong there. A bit later on the night she kinda rejected me out of nowhere. I got pretty sad as i really like this girl. I walked up to get some more alcohol, and when i come back Pete is dancing with Michelle again. I really didnt feel like confronting him at that point as i was really sad about it. So i just kinda sit in the corner for a coouple of minutes and goes over to ask him wtf he is doin. Again he apologized and said he would stop. I go to talk with some other friends. I come back and they are kissing. I Know he doesnt really like her as he has told me , that she isnt his type and other stuff. When the party had ended he came up to me trying to apologize a third time but i didnt wanna talk to him at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think Michelle rejected me because Pete was showing her attention and then she werent really interested in me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Michelle was pretty nice, trying to make sure i wasnt sad during the night, and she has texted me this morning. We are pretty good friends too.

&amp;#x200B;

Also i got bullied A LOT when i was a bit younger, until Pete started in my class and we became friends. He is the guy everyone likes. So i have changed a lot since then but because i got bullied i dont have a lot of friends. Basically just Pete and another guy. Im known in the town as ""that guy who is friends with Pete"". Pete has done stuff like this before, and it really pisses me off when he does it. I do want to step out of his shadow and stuff

I graduated high school in 2017. I grew up on the island of Kaua‚Äôi and I moved to the states a year ago. I live in a huge city and I honestly hate it. I waited a year to see if I like it and I just simply, don‚Äôt. I wanted to come out here and go to college however, I have a lot of anxiety over that. The community college closest to me and that I wanted to go too is in a really crowded area and traffic gets SUPER bad. Pretty much accidents everyday in that area and I just do not feel safe going to college there. I feel like thats a really stupid reason to not go to college but its how I feel. 

I want to go back to Kaua‚Äôi and go to the community college there but I want to get a degree in Zoology, and I‚Äôd have to move to Oahu in two years to do that. However, my parents aren‚Äôt giving me shit for college and I don‚Äôt get anything from fasfa. I keep applying to scholarships and I get nothing.  I am paying for this all by myself. I simply cannot afford to live on Oahu, pay rent, pay to live, and pay to go college but I don‚Äôt feel like going to college here is any better.

255,"so I first saw this a few months back now but it still irks me. My girlfriend has a list I her phone's notes of a bunch of guys who's dick sizes she knows. that alone is pretty odd, but since I saw it the first time a couple of months ago, it's grown (pun intended) by like 3 or 4 guys, all of whom we both know, by the way.

She tells me she's never actaully been interested in or done anything sexual with any of those guys and it ""just came up in conversation"" or it was ""just a random question"".

I'm really not sure how to feel about this. I love her so much, and it's probably just te paranoia and insecurity talking, but her keeping that makes me overthink so many scenarios where she's either cheating o me or wants to cheat on me etc. like, what reason could you possibly have for asking those questions and having a list like that?

256,"This has been worrying me for months. My friend met a man about a year ago. He is in his 30s and she is in her early 20s. They quickly became romantic and as soon as they started dating, she started losing a lot of weight. She was already skinny so this was alarming to the people around her. Then she got pregnant. I have been in contact with his ex and what she told me was concerning. She met him when she was under 18 and got pregnant real quick. She ended up having to run away from him to another city far away. So he does not have custody of his children from the previous relationship but my friend really believes him when he says that his ex kidnapped them.  

&amp;#x200B;

In general, he is very controlling of my friend. Goes to her job to see if she is really there. She is distancing herself from her friends and he does not really have any so they are mostly alone. I fear that he really makes her depend on him so much that she won't be able to get out. She is already very insecure and he keeps reminding her that other women are in love with him (he really uses that expression). Also whenever some of her friends say something bad about him, he just makes her think they are in love with him and want to break them up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our common friends are very concerned about her and are not sure how to handle the situation. The ex told me that her parents should talk to a therapist as she claims he has ""psycopathic tendencies"". I know her mom hated him before she got pregnant, now she won't really talk about him unless its about how sorry she feels about him and his past (most probably lies he told her to get sympathy).

262,"For context i am 26.5.

I worked retail/admin til i was 21.5. The retail company was great as were the people but i hated and sucked at the job. I lasted 3yrs. I got an admin job which paid appallingly and the staff and boss where horrible. So i tried stripping to buffer my mobey back up and i enjoyed it. I ended up getting asked to leave the admin job after 6 months for ""poor work ethic"" (translation the bosses best friend worked in the same department as me and hated my guts, i think i may have been up to take her job and the department was full of nasty gossips and drama, alot of former employees hold a very low opinion of that company. They used one staff member to trick me into stating my wages which was against the contract even though i dont think that was legally enforceable so they used that to get rid of me). IronicalIy my strip club boss thought i was wonderful and the hardest worker they had. I did the right thing got myself registered as a sole trader, filed my taxes, stayed away from the drug scene. I just wanted a house. Which i now have. 
 
I wasn't working other jobs but i was at university for the most part of my stripping career and was working in other states sometimes to change things up.
I got into law school but later converted to a business degree.

Last year i had a huge mental breakdown (age 25.5). Lets just say support in my life has been close to none (my regulars where my support even emotionally) and i was struggling to keep on top of everything. I jsut wasnt interested in engsging with customers and pretending to be happy and bubbly every night anymore and stopped making money.
I also have some pretty awful mental health issues, eating disorder and possibly depression so after a few to many bad nights in a row i just plain walked out and just studied for the past year and started to let my savings dwindle. Oh and blew a bunch of my savings in going to South America for 2 months.

I've been off the grind for a long while now and i really want to get back on it. Not to mention my financial situation is becoming extremely dire.

My business major is in logistics (and i was allowed to use my law credits for a minor) and someone ironically without knowing this suggested i get a forklift lisence and aim for a stock inventory management job. I'm fairly smart and have excellent people reading skills so moving up in due course shouldnt be impossible.

I am completely down for that though i expect i may need spend a brief amount of time in a process job/dispatch just to get my experience back up/ prove i can hold down a job with set hours, which is fine.

Now to the dilema. Obviously stripping still has a huge stigma for many people though if you ask me it was better for my customer service and work ethic, seeing as if you don't work you make nothing and you work hard you make more and if you build clientele and all the customers like you your job gets easier. 

How to gloss over this or should i just say that's what i did. How bad is the stigma around it these days?

Yes maybe i should have done things differently and just held some shit cafe job one day a week throughout but this is  what I did, where i am and my situation right now.

How would you approach it?",09Dec2018,1
263,"Hello all,

I'm not very good at making decisions so I am writing this post to ask for advice to as to which school I should go to for sixth form.

 So a few months ago I wanted to go this private school about a half hour drive away and applied for a entry. They have great facilities, connections to ivy league universities and they sort of generally were good. I did the exams and battered them, then I went and did the interviews, all of them went pretty well except for one where I had some arsehole guy who apparently didn't like me. Because of this I thought that I hadn't gotten in. I was a bit miffed at first but afterwards I sort of got to terms with it all. I had mentally accepted the possibility that I hadn't gotten in (despite having no concrete proof that I would or wouldn't get in). So I looked at my current secondary school and the more I looked at it the more I liked it. I know all of the teacher for those subjects really well, the students tend to do okay afterwards in terms of uni and they are about a 15 minute walk away from my house. I have been at this school for 5 years and I have actually got kinda attached to it. 

However lo and behold, I got a letter two days ago from that private school I thought I would be rejected by and I have been given a conditional offer based on my GCSE grades in June 2019. This is annoying because now I cannot decide between which school I want to go to, seeing as I will be the only student from my current school to go there and I can't just casually change my mind afterwards because they have a deposit I have to make in January which costs 800 pounds. Furthermore a good 75% of my friends are going to my current school's sixth form so I am torn between them, and after 2 whole days of trying to decide I am still stuck. 

Therefore in a last ditch attempt to reach a decision before January, I am asking for any of your decisions having weighed the different aspects of my situation.",09Dec2018,1

So there isn't much what i love to do not even allot that i like, but the things i do like no one supports me in it that i know in real life. People i meet online are there to help you they can't love you for how you look or hate you for how you look.

Now when ever someone ask me about my job my future, i cannot anwser those questions becouse i cannot see myself working like everyone else does. I sit behind my pc all day it is not a super expensive setup just basic verry basic and i like it that way. But then people call me spoiled becouse i do not work. I saved most my money when i whas young i do not go out or anything i do not have a job and i am 18. I only have to pay for my phone and insurence but soon i run out of money, and i have to go find a job even that my second most hated thing in life, school is number 1. Don't get me wrong i love learning i just do not love learning when people force me to it, i love langauge, i learn new sentences everday. But people always said i did it wrong becouse i wasn't like anyone else i have my own thoughs i don't follow people. I learned English on my own i learned typing with 10 fingers on my own. When i started learning english in school they asked me the question how do know its the anwser, i couldn't anwser how they wanted me to, i could only say it feels right i had the highest grades in my class and never did homework. Surprisingly there whas 1 thing i whas and still am really bad at, that my own langauge my native langauge. I do not feel like i below here, my sister steals a large amount of money from my parents and is all about getting followers and attention, my dad he doesn't see that my mom doens't either or they do not wanna see it. She works 2 jobs and steals money and my parents know about it but won't say it to her. She is in debt with them to and had to pay it back almost a year ago but thats not going to happen and they know it. Now she works 2 jobs 1 year older then me ask for anything she cannot affort just so she gets more attention. Now i do not ask anything from them i only live in with them and i told them ''if you want me out i'll leave just say it'' i respect that if they don't want me arround, but it feels so unfair that they all do not wanna talk to me ask me about what i do but still they know what i like the most, gaming. Yea i like gaming, but i like learning langauges to they do not know what langauges i speak what aplhabets i can read. They just asume i game all day. 

Now yesterday i had this dream i loved it but it whas unrealistic:

I whas listening to music laying on the ground it wat i do pretty often then i start dreaming, and i whas dreaming that i travelled the world without anymoney, just my phone headphones and a bag of clothing. So i whas sitting their on a bench all differnt locations, i whas singing the song over and over again, then a korean girl sits next to me and listens to me. Then she holds some strong liquor infront of me, and we drink we didn't say anything just looking at the start, i always though the sky whas something amazing anyone can see it, but still so mysterious and beautifull. Now i i woke up and fell asleep again for 3 times everytime went the same, i normaly never really dream but when i do its about travelling and really basic. This time it felt really strong and i wanna go and walk but i know thats not how its going to happen, i can't really sing that well i do not have any vehicle to travel with can't survive that long with the money i have, sooner or later i would have to work again, something i really hate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i question myself everyday what i wan't to do, twitch streamer seems fun but at the same time breaks allot of what i like about myself now, privacy not many people know how i look. I do not have any instagram or facebook with my own names, i have instagram just for online friends i meet. Not using any real names or photos its a blank account, just for talking and seeing pictures. But back to what i wanted to do i cannot see allot of what i like langauge teacher yea sure, go to school get a degree pay back debts, now there we go i do not like school becouse of how it works, in debt means i am stuck to working for a long time, it will not give me any freedom. Now i get it we all have to work, but whats the point of working if you do not like it, if i can teach english with what i know now i would. But i would have no idea how to explain it becouse i learned it all while i'm gaming and behind my pc. Now maby be a tourist guide, No that would be nothing, i'm running out of ideas, money and time. I really need some help, i don't ask for much if it comes to my future it would be verry basic not those fancy cars, allot of girls big house trowing partys, thats not me. When people actually ask about me then they are so suprised becouse i look like the typical party guy, girls like me becouse of how i look not to be a douchebag but people call me handsome. I do not gain any % of fat even tho i'm sitting a few month straigh on my chair not losing muscle either i just stay the same.

(THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I‚Äôm very quiet)  ‚Äòyes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?‚Äô (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she‚Äôs never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she‚Äôd in her early 30s.

She is constantly in student services, and the ladies at the desk + nurse try to help her, but she refuses to do anything but sit there. They're unaware that she gets bullied, as far as I know.

273,"This summer I really got into horseback riding and I was looking for someone who would like to share their horse with me for a good amount of money (20‚Ç¨/h and I‚Äôm a university student so that‚Äôs a lot for me). 

After making my research I found this girl on a website for horses and she lived close by which was great because I‚Äôm from a major city and it‚Äôs hard to find rural spots close by that are good to do horseback riding. We exchanged numbers and met up the following Friday but unfortunately she didn‚Äôt mention that we had to keep this a secret to the owner of the ranch because there were strict rules and he was very money hungry so if he‚Äôd find out that I paid her and not him she could get in major trouble and lose her spot at the ranch. I was really upset about this because considering that I paid a good amount of money I didn‚Äôt want to be scared to be caught every time and lie so I was really happy when I found this other option.

When I went to the dentist a couple days after, wearing my riding gear, an elderly man sitting in the waiting room with me asked if I was looking for someone with horses and if I‚Äôd be interested I could come to see his horses. My friend who happened to work at that dentist office told me he was super nice and actually her favourite costumer so I gave it a try. From there on every Friday this old man, let‚Äôs call him OM, and I rode the horses together and I got really attached to them. I loved to be there and he was really nice too and I even found out that he used to be a teacher back in the day and that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm going to university for so not only did he have horses that he let me ride for free but he also provided me with tons of advice for university and future internships. 

This weekend it rained quite heavily and OM asked me if I wanted to come by for tea and cake because he‚Äôs very upset that we can‚Äôt ride the horses and he enjoyed my company. I agreed and I felt very bad for him because I know he doesn‚Äôt have any family. When I got there he showed me around his house, it had tons of art and other old stuff and it kinda looked like a museum which was very interesting considering I study history (he even had a family tree that he made himself dating back to 1500 and wrote three books about it, it truly was a goldmine for someone like me). 

After he showed me around we sat down for tea time and he just stopped talking and stared at me so I decided to tell him everything I knew just so it wouldn‚Äôt be awkward. After two hours I asked him if it was okay if I‚Äôm leaving, telling him I was really tired when in fact I was extremely uncomfortable. He said that‚Äôs fine but before he let me walk out the door he came extremely close to me, it was almost like he tried to kiss me and I automatically stepped back. He told me he really liked me and he liked the way I was dressed and I couldn‚Äôt blame him because after all he‚Äôs just a man (I wore ripped jeans). He then asked me if I could imagine being with a man 50 years older and then confessed his love towards me. I told him that he was too old and he said he would accept it but he still wants to ride the horses with me because he enjoys my company and he promised he wouldn‚Äôt do anything. And as I walked out he yelled ‚Äûbut I wouldn‚Äôt mind if you did something to me!‚Äú and bursted out in laughter. 

I speed walked home as fast as I could and I‚Äôm so upset because I really love the horses and it‚Äôs my best option. It doesn‚Äôt cost any money and I could come as often as I want to but now I have to look for something else again I guess. How would you react in a situation like that? Just never contact him again? Or would you still come to see the horses at least? ",09Dec2018,1
274,I live in an apartment with my parents and my personal room has a set of sliding doors that also serve as windows. These doors are huge and are the only provider of sunlight into the room. During the summer there was a huge rainstorm in which a downstairs neighbor (I live on the second floor above a building) complained that water was leaking from above from my room. the land lord came to check it out and came to the conclusion that what was causing the leaking was my sliding door because it had a few cracks underneath where it connected to the floor. Therefore he put up a huge tarp on my sliding door/window which has left my room PITCH BLACK. he said he would fix it but has done nothing for four months. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore because it‚Äôs his responsibility to fix it but it‚Äôs affecting my mental health.

However, sometimes I feel overwhelmed with all the things happening. Sometimes I have a lot of work to do and also social gatherings with people from here.

Is just that when I receive them I am always like ""I will reply to that later when I have more time"" and then it never happens. It's reached a point when I am afraid of replying because I don't know what excuse I have and there are so many messages from different people.... I don't know what to do.

280,"I've always been a ""dynamic"" guy with a lot of interests, I like to read and experiment on every topic but in the last years I focused a lot on programming/ITC because It's a field where I'm very talented and I wanted to find a good job as soon as possible. Finally I found the job that I wanted and I'm very happy doing it, the company culture is great and the tasks are challenging and interesting but finding a job in IT even means that now I spend 40 hours/week programming and once at home if it isn't for work-related training or in order to help friends I want to stop almost completely programming as an hobby and find other things to do. I thought to start to learn the electric guitar and as soon as possible to volunteer at a cat shelter or to foster kittens (I love cats and even now I donate to the shelter and about once a month I enjoy to have a ""cuddle session"" there).

The problem is that here ""eclectic"" guys aren't well seen: here the ideal life path is to find an activity that you like when you are a kid/preteen and stick to it until you can: usually young people here tends to continue their extracurricular activities (sport/marching band) until they marry and then dedicate their life only to work and family so many find very strange that a 20 years old tries new things in his free time. To make things worse many are asking me why i don't devote every bit of my free time to study in order to get a CS degree to increase my potential future income but currently I don't care about accolades and income, since I'm quite frugal I'm happy even with my entry level paycheck and the last years were tough for me (in the past I had many great friends but when everyone started clubbing I lost almost everyone since I dislike clubs, since that moment I struggled to find new like minded people or fun things to do ""offline"" because before finding job I lived in a small town and the choice of thing to do besides was very limited) so now once outside the office I want to stay away from programming and to enjoy life, try new things and extend my currently scarce friends network in the process.

So the question is: I'm doing the right thing experimenting with new and different activities at my age or others are right and is better that I focus only on computers?

Before answering consider that for me money (I live frugal and I don't want kids so I don't need the big amount of cash needed to up bring a kid), job stability (I'm hired for 3 years and then I'll get a longer contract with a paycheck about 50%-70% bigger than the current that will allow me to live ""like a king"") and training (I receive training on the job and even if I'll stop to code as a hobby I'll dedicate some hours each week to train myself and stay up to date with the latest tech trends) aren't a problem I just want to know if I do so many different things in the long term my life is more likely to be enriched of experiences and social connections or once in my late 20s I'm likely to struggle socially and be seen as a manchild with too much time on his hands by peers?",09Dec2018,1
281,"Hiya. 

I recently started working for the first time in over 2yrs. It‚Äôs quite a difficult one to explain in a sense. I left my job of 9yrs via an mentally abusive manager and not having the support from the management team when I had to take 5 weeks off for stress related depression and anxiety. Okay so fast forward to now, I felt like I was in an okay spot to start looking for work. I had applied for a good 200-300 jobs and got barely any replies. Had a few interviews and trial shifts along the way that never worked out. 
I managed to get a job that would require an almost 2 hour commute into London several weeks ago. Now, I said to myself I‚Äôd never again work in retail. It culminated in me leaving my job of 9 years and knew what it could potentially entail again. I wanted to go back into education and do some online courses in the mean time so I could work on some A levels as I didn‚Äôt do well originally in school and work towards a nursing degree at the very least.
So I‚Äôve been in my current job for 3 weeks and it‚Äôs absolute hell. I‚Äôm on probation as standard for 3 months and I don‚Äôt think I wanna be there even a month. I‚Äôve almost all but quit this job as it‚Äôs made me question myself, how I deal with things and I‚Äôve been profusely crying on and off since I started. I just need advice if people have been in the similar boat at all. I wanted to go into social care and help those more at need than some pretentious customers and work for a company that clearly is still stuck in the century they came out of. They revered themselves on being inclusive yet I got told by my manager to ‚Äúlock my problems and my depression in my locker so it stays off the shop floor‚Äù. Sure, never thought about how that would help /S 

The only other thing I‚Äôm worried about is that my partner has paid for all but a small part of my commute into the city (a good few ¬£100) and I feel like I‚Äôm also letting him down. I care more about letting him down and disappointed over my own. 

I wanted to start working so I wasn‚Äôt relying on him. I still live at home with my family but wanted to move out into social living at least. I feel like a failure and like I won‚Äôt be able to hold a job down again. I‚Äôm at such a loss of what to do. ",09Dec2018,1
282,"So I have been in the restaurant business essentially all my ‚Äúworking adult life‚Äù for the past 15 years. Started as a dishwasher first then to a prep/line cook for two years, then with a catering business for a few years, then bartended for 10 years (the past 5 of them here in NYC). So I have extensive knowledge of this industry, as it is my passion and I really love the hospitality aspect of this industry.

Recently I have been offered (and I accepted) a management position in the current restaurant I work at which is where I have been bartending for the past 4 years, for a very globally well known chef. 

However, in my first month of this new position I have mixed feelings, and am not  ‚Äúseeing the light at the end of the tunnel‚Äù currently and am wondering if this is right for me.

First, I had to settle on less money in my new position than I was while bartending, about $15k less per year.

The hours are vastly different, I worked anywhere from 32-38 hours per week previously, while I work anywhere from 60-72 hours per week now, and my schedule is no longer as flexible in new position either.

The stress is understandably higher in the new role as I‚Äôm in charge of actual people and overseeing a majority of basic operations in the restaurant. The work itself I actually find rather easy and natural to me. The work to me isn‚Äôt the most challenging part.

I dislike the style of management my company uses, it prefers a more hands off ‚Äúmicro management‚Äù style where as I‚Äôm more of a lead by example and always be willing to do what you‚Äôd ask someone else to do type of person, and I typically prefer to manage with a bit more empathy than my coworkers.

And lastly I feel my company as a whole has lost the hospitality aspect of this business and strictly changed to the money making/cheap side. I know I know, this is New York and the restaurant business is insanely tough, and competitive, but seeing our PNL budgets and other revenue reports and watching this company be so cheap when it doesn‚Äôt need to be, especially with how little they pay managers and have such high turnover.

I have been getting sick a lot lately and just recently had to go to the hospital from the flu. My doctor told me my blood pressure is insanely high lately and that I‚Äôve been overworking myself (157/95 just the other day) and that I need to take it easy, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke(other than an occasional glass of wine with dinner) I try to live healthy, but my girlfriend claims I haven‚Äôt been eating as nearly much, or sleeping well/much, and I notice it too. I also just have no time for friends and family.

Sorry for the long rant but my anxiety has been real real lately. 

I know I can‚Äôt be a bartender forever, and would eventually like to own my own spot of some kind bar/restaurant/catering/consulting, so i am happy that I have gotten to learn a lot from this company over the years.

My question for advice would be, is it worth it for me to continue at my current job just for this company name on my resume, are the hours like this everywhere for this kind of position? Did I move up to this position too soon? Or should I try to take a little break(as I haven‚Äôt taken a vacation in a few years) and then try to find a job elsewhere. Any other advice welcome to help me be less anxious about my decision to take this position.

If you‚Äôd like more details or have any questions please ask, this is a throw away account just to be safe. ",09Dec2018,1

284,"So my best friend and neighbor, we will call her Donna, has an 8 year old son, we will call him Ben. 
She struggled to get pregnant with Ben, and he was the only child they were able to have. We have a son who is 7 and there are many boys in the neighborhood. They all play together. I sometimes have the unfortunate circumstance of babysitting Ben. 

We bought this house 2 years ago, and so did they. Her husband, Dan, owns the nicest restaurant in the city, and as such they have a lot of status and influence but they are nice people. 

But I noticed issues with Ben the moment we met them. He is extremely hyper, doesn‚Äôt listen, is CONSTANTLY testing boundaries, limits, and the patience of every adult he comes into contact with. If you are playing a board game, he will change the rules until he cant anymore then wreck the board so no one else can play. If you ask Ben to do something, he argues with you incessantly. I have attempted to talk with him only to have him get in my face and try to intimidate me, even just asking him if he wants a snack. He never stops jumping up and down. Just watching him is exhausting! He‚Äôs kinda scary, because he is so unpredictable. 

Yesterday we had my sons birthday party at the bowling alley, and Ben didn‚Äôt want to bowl because ‚Äúno one else was as good at bowling as he is‚Äù and he began whining and being rude to the other children and climbing all over things he shouldn‚Äôt climb on. I saw my friend Donna sit him down and attempt to discipline him and he got in her face like he was going to punch her! She backed down. Clearly afraid of him. He has punched and hit her before. They use video games and YouTube to babysit him and I think it‚Äôs making things worse. But I understand. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it 24-7. His behavior honestly falls in line with ODD and ADHD, I‚Äôve been around children a long time and he‚Äôs the worst I‚Äôve ever seen. Hands down. 

The father encourages some of this behavior, and is rarely home, but wouldn‚Äôt punish him anyway. The father encourages Ben to talk back to Donna a lot. 

I had hoped that as he got older, he would grow out of some of this behavior. But he‚Äôs gotten worse. Ben needs help. I know he gets in trouble almost every day at school, has no friends at school etc. 

Donna keeps attempting to talk to me about some these things. She is clearly overwhelmed, but I‚Äôm uncomfortable because I don‚Äôt want to tell her ‚Äúyes your kid is HORRIBLE‚Äù. Im afraid to hurt her feelings. I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs ready to admit to herself that Ben needs help. So I kind of gently guide the conversation to another subject. 

This affects me because it‚Äôs at a point where he bullies my son a little bit, he is just an asshole to him. 

So do I talk to her about this? How? 

TL;DR Friends son clearly has some sort of serious behavioral disorder, but everyone sweeps it under the rug. Should I talk to her or should I stay out of it? Everyone around them sweeps it under the rug but it‚Äôs just getting worse.

286,"Okay, this may be fairly lengthy, so apologies.

&amp;#x200B;

I started seeing a girl in may, we got on great, everything was going well. She was in a difficult living situation, suffers from aspergers and I'm fairly sure another undiagnosed issue, and was being harrassed by an ex. There are more details but that should suffice. At any rate, I was in a pretty poor flat as Id broken up with my ex a couple of months before. We were talking one night and I suggested we found a place together. It made sense, we both needed a fresh start, a new home, and we were getting on really well. 

&amp;#x200B;

We moved in together at the end of july. Wonderful home, nice and spacious, good neighbourhood, close to my new job. Everything was fine for a while. This place is pretty costly, so I end up spending all my earnings on rent, she gets a small amount from her disability which doesnt really help. She used to get more, but since we moved in that was reduced considerably. So now were struggling money wise. We keep afloat, but just barely. I asked her if she could get a job, even if its part time, just to help with costs. She initially refused (she has never worked a day in her life, has no qualifications and is 27) but after a few long conversations, i managed to convince her in september to look. Unfortunately, thats all she does, look. Shes very picky, wont do menial or laborious jobs, she wants to work with animals. I explained how her situation would prevent or severely limit that aspiration, and the best bet would be to find something simple, and go back to college to work on getting her basic GCSEs, and then start working towards her goals. Initially she agreed, then when she found out the courses were in the evening, gave some excuse about not wanting to be out in the dark. Reasonable, to a degree, the bus to the college is direct, stops right outside our house and the college. The college has excellent security and is well lit. I appreciate her fears, but besides escorting her myself (which i suggested) I didnt know how to solve the situation. So thats out the window.

&amp;#x200B;

Her jobhunting has become a facade to sit around on facebook all day watching cat videos. She turns on every device and doesnt use them. Lights on in the middle of the day for no reason. On days that Im at home, our electric usage is around ¬£1-¬£1.50 a day. On days that shes by herself, its 6-7. She eats the food I buy for both of us, and the food that I used to buy for myself for lunch. She leaves the flat in a state, wont clean, wont wash up, wont do any household tasks. Ive had to take extra hours at work to keep up, and still have to do the housework after. Im exhausted, im defeated.

&amp;#x200B;

My major issue is this; if I break up with her, I wont be able to afford the flat by myself, and the lease isnt up till next july. She wont help towards the council tax bills we owe, and Im going to have to manage that myself. I dont really have any friends in the area, so I cant get help from them. I am estranged from my family, so thats out the window. I simply cant put any money aside to pay for a move of my own into a smaller more affordable place. I already set myself back on food and essentials. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Ive tried talking to her, Ive tried getting her help via therapy, I've broken down and shouted at her. I dont want to be with her anymore. I cant afford to start my college courses next year at this rate. I want to get my life back on track, find a cheaper home, study and be happy again. I don't know where to turn to. My local GP has told me to refer myself to a mental health group that I can talk to, Ive been through their system before and it tooks 2 months to even start it, and even then it ended up being me dealing with my own problems (CBT, ended up barely talking to my therapist, just filling in sheets on how awful i felt). 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, please help me. Im slipping into my old ways of deppression, Im messing up at work, Im not sleeping properly, Im not feeling hungry. I dont want to keep going like this. I know this is my fault for moving in so fast. All I need is a fresh start by myself, and I know I can bounce back. Im asking now before I lose the remaining drive I have to keep pushing on and dealing with this. Sorry about the text wall, Ive even missed out some details, but I didnt want to make this too long.

289,"I (18, M) was going to a party at the end of school. Tried to talk to a girl I liked for a fewl years. Was too drunk. Made poorly attempts to explain my feelings to her. Too drunk to understand the ""Oh, I'm not looking for a boyfriend at the time"" statement to just fuck off. So yeah, I went on talking to her even when she didn't like to. Probably embaressed her infront of her friends. Told me the next day via text message that she wasn't interested. My answer was cheesy and cringy as fuck. So I'm probably doomed to be known for that shit around my home town... Well after that she understandably avoided me as good as possible. Did the same because I didn't want to bother her anymore... But it made me feel like I was like a creep to her.

Ffw a couple of months. Got a job and hanging out with friends occasionally. And even if I see some girl seeming to be interested in me I feel like I should avoid that before I fuck it up again. But it bothers me because I can't just stay single for the rest of my life. I think I should have this experience some time in my life. I should get myself to try at least but I don't feel like it would be a great decission most of the time.",09Dec2018,1

291,"I‚Äôve had nothing but problems with my cat and how he gets into everything. He has so many different kinds of toys it‚Äôs ridiculous, so many different cat scratches and nice big cat tree and many beds.

He constantly goes into our closet and rips shit apart in there and makes an absolute mess. We‚Äôve just recently figured out how to stop him from doing that, but now he‚Äôs bored and has been jumping up onto the counter (which has NEVER been a problem since we got him in July). 

I‚Äôve had enough of this already, he‚Äôs an absolute monster and everything I try doesn‚Äôt work. I try not to spray him with water because according to a lot of websites and Jackson Galaxy that shot doesn‚Äôt do much.. I‚Äôve put aluminium foil on my counters and all he wants to do is play with it or he walks on it and doesn‚Äôt give a shit. Tried putting regular tape on there and it kind of freaked him out but not enough to stop him. My boyfriend put duct tape on there to see what he does and when our cat jumped up on there the duct tape RIPPED OFF HIS FUR ON HIS PAWS. It alarmed both of us but our cat didn‚Äôt give a fuck, it didn‚Äôt bother him at all. Nothing deters him, nothing works! I‚Äôve only ever trained dogs, and I‚Äôm at my wits end with this cat. He‚Äôs already broken so much or our belongings and that was before he started going onto the counter. The counter was the only place he wouldn‚Äôt go and so that‚Äôs where we put all of our breakables.

293,"About a year ago, my boss met and later married a young foreign exchange student with a limited grasp of English. Since then, she has been employed at our firm as an ‚Äòoffice manager‚Äô. While I like her personally, I‚Äôm concerned that her lack of experience and work ethic is very bad for the company. 

She completes her tasks with a languid resistance. The office cannot function without a working printer, but she moves like a sloth and carries the toner like a boulder. Additionally, she pretends to ‚Äòtranslate‚Äô for clients (even when there is nothing to translate). But I can understand her first language, and she mostly spends the day gossiping with friends. 

I work in an industry with tight deadlines and long hours. People are always stressed, and this stress is compounded by her poor organisation. Even worse, my boss projects his stress onto other employees (but not his wife) when things go wrong. He is aware that these are things that she is responsible for, but never criticised her. 

I am concerned that the company may face professional negligence lawsuits if this does not change. How can I discuss this with my boss? He is an intelligent man, but has a blind spot for his young wife.

296,"Hi 

Sorry this may be a bit long.

I'm a sophomore in college currently rooming with three other girls. One of those girls is my roommate from last and who, up until recently, I considered my best friend. She went abroad last semester. She had a great time and met a fellow American abroad who lives near where we go to school and now they've been dating for a few months now. I have no issues with him since he treats her well and is a really nice guy. 

However, ever since coming back, she's changed drastically. I understand that getting into a long term relationship and going abroad impacts a person, but all my other friends who went with her did not change this way. She doesn't really make any attempt to acclimate herself back into campus life unlike the others. She's content just face timing her boyfriend and visiting him or him visiting her every weekend. She also doesn't ask us if he can stay over, she just tells us he's coming. I have no problem with him being here, it's just a respect thing considering there's already four of us living together. Last year we'd do all these fun things together and would be spontaneous and now she just complains about not being abroad and doesn't make any plans. It's always me inviting her to things and not the other way around. 

All of this I could deal with except she's randomly started being rude to me. We would snap, text, Insta DM each other, and now she leaves me on read every time. She also will go out of her way to compliment our other two roommates and friends but never says anything to me. I also went through a bad breakup and would've appreciated her being there for me because I would do the same for her, but instead she provided no emotional do nothing and even seen slightly annoyed that I was feeling down. 

Genuinely nothing happened for her to treat me this way because I would 100% own up to it and apologize if I did something wrong. I guess people do change and you don't stay friends with everyone forever, but I considered her my best friend and these changes are making me really sad, especially since we live together.

I was thinking of just giving her personal space. Wait for her to reach out to me if she wants but not doing it on my own accord. Thoughts?",09Dec2018,1

303,"So tldr: I stole a thing off my mate whilst very drunk at a party and gave it back to him the next day. I really appreciate him as one of the only proper friends I have in my uni and I want to get him a vinyl, but I'm not sure if that's a bit too much.

So, we had a big block party on Friday and I drank far too much. This was not a problem until I stole a thing off my mate at the party. The next day I had a terrible hangover, but it eventually finished. Just as it finished my flatmate knocked on my door and said we were going to have to have a bit of an awkward conversation. He told me that my mate had a thing of his stolen and that I stole it.

I  said that I had and that I would give the thing back to my mate, and I did so myself. My mate was very cool about the situation saying he just wanted the thing back. I said sorry and gave the thing back.

The thing is, I really appreciate my mate, as he is pretty much the only other person in my block (other than my flatmates) who is genuinly nice to me and always has time to have a small conversation with me when we bump into each other. When I realised what I had done, I guess it made me also realise how much of a good friend and guy he was, and since he has a great collection of vinyls I want to get him one.

I have written a small letter as well to let him know that I really appreciate him as a friend.

306,"Check my post history for the old posts. The basic rundown is Mariana was abandoned in my care while A, her mom, left to meet her new boyfriend in the states. B the grandmother is abusive and doesn‚Äôt want Mariana. C, the uncle, doesn‚Äôt have the finances to raise her. 

A is pregnant from her new boyfriend D. 

After Mariana was returned to CPS, A took her to the states. We tried to have C sue for custody of Mariana due to A‚Äôs neglect and dangerous lifestyle. I want to adopt Mariana but for now I‚Äôm just praying that C gets her and I can just be her babysitter. I promised C if he got custody I‚Äôd support Mariana financially. Whether she lives with me or with him doesn‚Äôt matter. I just want her to be happy. 

So here‚Äôs what happened since then. 

D dumped A, threw her out for cheating on him, and was charged for assaulting A‚Äôs lover. A then fled back to her grandmother‚Äôs. 

C backed out of the suit. He believes that he can support Mariana now that she‚Äôs back home. But I doubt it. Either way, it‚Äôs all over. A and B are gone, they moved and now I know nothing. 

I‚Äôm never getting Mariana. I‚Äôm never seeing her again.

309,"I'm 23 years old male from south korea. Long story short, I can feel that I'm becoming less valuable person every day. 
When I was elementary school student, lots of teachers telled my parent that I was probably some kind of genius. Some even suggested me to go to middle school year earlier. I was also pretty good piano player, and good english speaker (compared at that age). Everyone believed me that I'm going to be great person when I grow up. My grandparents often called me as 'Treasure of house'. I also had no doubt that I was going to be special person when I become adult.
At middle school, I was still great student. My score was mostly A, even though I was not called genious anymore but I certainly was one of the 'smartest student'. 
At high school, I had to quit my piano lessons to concentrate on college admission test. (It's real big national event in south korea. Even flights gets delayed or cancelled during exam.) But I didn't studied like madman' like other student. I believed I was smarter than others, so I just studied much less. Instead of studying literally 12 hours a day for years, I just studied bare-minimum to keep my grades acceptable.
I got fine score though. I got top 5% score out of 650000 students, and was accepted to chemical engineering major on fairly good college with full scholarship. I chose chemical engineering as major because you could get high paying job. That was all. I had no interest on chemistry at all.
College life was good. Drinking everyday, get wasted, don't have to study for 10 hours straight on same desk... Of course, like most of other student, I barely studied. And got shitty score. 
But I didn't studied at all, so it's okay! Surely, if only I study like rest, I'll get to top in no time. I'll just enjoy college life in freshman year, them I'll study.
In second year, I studied (kinda) hard. I still got shitty score. I got warning from scholarship department.
Everyone said 'It's okay, you'll get better score when you come back from army. Everyone does.'
So I got conscripted to army, and did my 2 year mandatory service, and came back to campus with all new determination. I studied hard, like rest of students.
I still got shitty score. Better than before, but not better than others. I lost my scholarship.
My parents doesn't know yet. I studied hard, but I just can't get any better. Every lecture I hear sounds like gibberish at first. I need twice more time to understand same thing. I often joked about those kids when I was in high school, and I became them. 
I was not a genius. Or at least not anymore. It's terrifying thought, that I will have to try as hard as I can just to be normal person.
I just can't think better future. I completely lost interest and determination on studying anymore. Why bother studying when all you get will be white collar job that you have no interest at all?
I got insomnia. I'm afraid of future, cause I know that I won't get any better as time passes.
I was talented piano player, genius, smart kid with big dreams. Now? I'm just a barely functioning college student with shitty grades with no goal at all.
I'm ready to kill myself before becoming worse human being. 
All that preventing me from hanging or jumping is my parents. They trusted me, loved me and devoted their whole life just to make me to person I dream. If they found me dead, they would be devastated. Probably live their rest of life blaming themselves. I don't want to do that.
I'm just so sorry to my parents that it came to this. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore.",09Dec2018,1
311,"Ok so quick background. I‚Äôm a 29 year old m, I moved back to my hometown on Long Island to help ailing elderly parents (mother 71 breast cancer 3 years ago when I moved back east, father 74 diabetic alcoholic with prostate cancer). I‚Äôm a typically a pretty outgoing dude, I‚Äôve had 3 long-term live-in relationships, and I cared for each of them very deeply. 

I‚Äôm here asking for advice regarding the most recent. She‚Äôs a 29 year old psychologist, and left me for another man after 2 years of dating. Now that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow but I‚Äôm not a total pussy, I‚Äôve dealt with things like that before, and have surely hurt people in a similar fashion. What‚Äôs freaking me out are these recurrent dreams I have of her. I swear on my life, if I dream at all, she‚Äôs the focal point. It started a couple months after the initial break up. 

As a proud person, upon hearing the words ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even know what to do, I was just going to ghost you‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt love you anymore‚Äù, I decided it would be prudent to delete all social media, block her phone number, and ask that she politely ‚Äúkeep the fuck out of my life and my business.‚Äù Within a month I‚Äôd already heard (against my will and wishes to stay as far removed from her a news of her as possible) from a friend that she and dude #2 were officially dating. At that point I dropped the bender and switched my diet from liquor and hallucinogenic mushrooms to food and doctor prescribed mood stabilizers, and for the first time since I was about 14 got totally sober. Now I think everyone has unhealthy relationships with most drugs; I‚Äôm a drunk, a friendly drunk but still, a drunk nonetheless. As such, all my friends are also drunks, and most spend way too much time blowing lines or gambling. So I begin drifting from my friend group, am sober, single, and profoundly sad. 
*This is when the dreams started, now this is why I‚Äôm looking for advice*

I started seeing her EVERY single night that I dreamt. At this point we‚Äôd been apart for about 2 1/2 months, this was in September. The dreams never stopped. in early November I gave up on the sobriety and loneliness to rejoin my degenerate friend group. The dreams still continued. Now I still haven‚Äôt spoken to her since the day she told me about the other guy, but I recently discovered she‚Äôs been in touch with all my friends, my family, and has been digging for information about what I‚Äôm doing.

All this would still be a minor inconvenience, unfortunately I am still desperately in love with this chick. I was deciding how to propose, I was accepting the idea of children, I was dreaming of a white picket fence, life was looking like something Norman Rockwell would‚Äôve busted a nut fantasizing about. 
These dreams have gotten more and more intense. Then on thanksgiving my mother fell at dinner and broke her femur. I spent the next 4 nights watching over her(FYI I hate my mother, always have always will, but still feel obligated to caretake), on the 5th day she was taken to a rehabilitation facility. On the 8th morning I walked into her suite, and in her delirious drug fueled fever dream she admitted to me that this girl came to visit her, then proceeded to ask about me for an hour. When I joked about it to a cousin she told me a similar story. 
I don‚Äôt know what to think 
I don‚Äôt know how to feel
I fucking love this girl
I don‚Äôt ever want to see her again but haven‚Äôt been happy since the last time I did
She‚Äôs obviously concerned, idk if it‚Äôs a mother bird thing, or if she‚Äôs interested in me romantically again: idk if I‚Äôd want her to be.

Don‚Äôt get it wrong, I always was and still am a pretty good time, I don‚Äôt wear this shit on my sleeves. At this point I want to reach out to her, at the very least I can get an answer as to why the fuck she‚Äôs still bothering my friends and family. I just don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the move I even want to make, I want to be with her, but I honestly do think I‚Äôm good enough for her. It‚Äôs why I let her go rather than manipulating her into staying. She deserves a good man, I want to be a good man. But I don‚Äôt think those train tracks intersect.

I was and still am a christian and raise with a high moral standards and ideals of life. And life was good until all this started I realized I only have one friend everyone else who called me a friend only need me when they could gain something they never wanted to just hang out and the only time they invited me for a non school event was for their birthday party. So I tested my theory when I said want to go hang out this weekend they dodged me invite after invite after invite and the only time they would agree was when I said I‚Äôll pay for everything.... every thing. And I just stoped hanging out with them and when they asked me why did I stop taking to them I told them and they said it‚Äôs not like that is just be like that sometimes and I told them we have been friends for over 7 years when have you once invited me to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù the only person who ever did that was my only friend but he‚Äôs in the military now he left right when we graduated so I rarely see him. So that started my trust issues deep deep trust issues. And to coop with loosing berthing I thought I had I made this mask where I would only be happy and tell as many jokes and make everyone laugh.

I tell myself every morning I wont drink again and every night I do. I'm stuck in a vicious cycle. Recently I managed to go like 2 weeks of only drinking on weekends and then fell back into it. I've come to the conclusion that I need to talk to a professional but I'm very scared. It's hard for me to even talk to friends and family let alone going into an office and saying I'm depressed. I really dont want to go to rehab for various reasons and I think I can do it if i can maybe work out my demons or get on some medication. I normally cant afford insurance but I'm out of work right now for the winter so I went on Medicaid. I'm not even sure if state (ri) medical covers mental health services. I plan on going into a doctor's tomorrow to find out but I'm scared I'm not going to go through with it and if I do they're going to tell me I have to pay out of pocket, which I obviously cant. If that happens I'm scared im going to fall deeper. It's pretty bad right now. I'm basically just wallowing. Self loathing. And I'm so sick of it. Any advice or even some kind words would go a long way. Thanks for reading",09Dec2018,1
318,"I tried posting this on a throwaway but it seems like Reddit is refusing to let me create or login to one. So fuck it, here it is on my main. If you know me and you‚Äôre reading this, welcome to the shitshow I call my life.  

Like the title says, I feel lost. I don‚Äôt know exactly how to describe it but I don‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôm the first to feel this way so hopefully someone can relate. 
I took a semester off from university because I fucked up my freshman year and rushed two fraternities. Because of my own stupid actions I almost failed 2 classes and absolutely hated many parts of the year. So I took a leave of absence and backpacked Europe for a month.
I was hoping I‚Äôd be able to ‚Äúfind myself‚Äù backpacking, but what I realized is that no matter where I am, I‚Äôll always find a way to feel like shit. I was in Budapest and I couldn‚Äôt find the motivation to leave my hostel for two days straight. In my mind it didn‚Äôt make any sense to me but it‚Äôs as if my body just refused to cooperate. I felt sluggish and tired. So even though my backpacking trip was supposed to last 3 months I cut it off early and went back home. 
Home is a tricky situation as well because I don‚Äôt really have a permanent home. My parents live in two separate countries (still a married couple, just work) and all my belongings are split between 4 countries. So for the past 2 months I‚Äôve been floating between countries just kinda doing nothing. I started going to the gym while I was with my mom but when I moved to live with my dad I quickly fell out of the habit. I also started doing math lessons online because I felt like I was falling behind other students in college. All of that fell apart and now I feel like I‚Äôm just wasting my time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm depressed but I feel like I‚Äôm a waste of space. Like I feel that I could do so much more but I‚Äôm lost in this limbo of not having a permanent home and not having anyone to really talk to. I even tried teaching myself some programming because I‚Äôm a computer science major and I couldn‚Äôt find the fucking motivation. I tried, I really did. I want to blame the ADHD that I was diagnosed with 13 years ago but I don‚Äôt want to use it as a crutch cause I know I‚Äôm better than that.
Now Im returning to school in January and I‚Äôm incredibly excited and terrified at the same time. I‚Äôll be a semester behind and I will have wasted an entire gap semester doing jack shit. My mom also keeps bugging me about applying to transfer to Harvard because she has a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù I‚Äôll get in. I keep telling her that the transfer admissions rate is less than 1% and that my grades are nowhere near high enough but she says I‚Äôm just being ‚Äúnegative‚Äù and letting the ‚Äúnumbers get in the way‚Äù. She makes me feel like the university I attend (which is not a bad school, top 50 in the US) is not enough. 
On another note I have to start applying for internships this summer and I don‚Äôt even know where to begin because I couldn‚Äôt program you a thing in python or java. I know the languages I just don‚Äôt know how to use them for anything worthwhile. I don‚Äôt have any job experience in CS. Why would a company ever hire me for an internship when all I could probably do is sit in a desk and twiddle my fucking thumbs. 

I know this is just a garbled mess but I needed to get something out. I feel like everything is slowly collapsing on me. Some days I feel fine and others I feel like utter trash. I don‚Äôt want to be a waste of life but I don‚Äôt know how to live. I want to feel like I‚Äôm actually worth something. I can‚Äôt see myself with anyone because I don‚Äôt feel like I provide people with anything. If anyone has felt like me, I‚Äôll take any advice. I just don‚Äôt want to feel like shit anymore.",09Dec2018,1
319,"Have my works Christmas party tonight and whilst I'm always a little bit nervous going out with work tonight we're going somewhere I've never been that have a Think 25 policy on letting people in and I'm freaking out.

I'm 29 but because my anxiety has always been so bad have never needed ID at all, never worked anywhere that paid me well enough that I could start driving lessons until now and in the middle of getting my license and passport but they just haven't arrived in time. When we were going out at the beginning of the year I was never ID'd at the door no matter who was in my party or if the other OBVIOUS over 25s in the group were so drunk they forced bouncers to look at their ID (I'm not kidding, it seems especially funny to them when they have the computer ID checker out for some reason) but I HAVE been ID'd by someone when I went for a lunch and asked for a cider not that long ago which has set up my whole going out anxiety again.

I just can't keep calm thinking I'm going to show up for our night out and not be allowed in. 

Like not even just not being allowed in on a random night out this will be being not allowed into a party in front of everyone I work with.

Looking for any advice on how people deal with that kind of anxiety or how to deal with being so embarrassed if I don't get in. Like I honestly don't know what I'd do if they don't let me in, I'll probably start crying if they even ask for ID. I was hoping to maybe show up with some of the older people but they weren't going and now are going but I think they've already kind of filled up their car with people who are working tomorrow morning. Usually these days drag but today is flying by and I'm starting to feel real sick which is making me more likely to flake out and not go at all which every time I do that I regret so much so made a deal with myself to always go out because I do enjoy it when we go out.",09Dec2018,1
320,"I have a 6/7 month old bearded dragon called Keith. I‚Äôve always wanted a reptile of some kind and since bringing him home I have loved him. 
He is currently impacted, which means part of his digestive system is blocked- its a very common problem. 
I have taken him to the vet, where they gave him lubricant, and this unblocked one side of the blockage, the problem is the other side hasn‚Äôt unblocked yet, despite another round of lubricant.
I have been advised by the vet that due to how large the blockage has now become, if the blockage doesn‚Äôt clear within a month I can either have him put to sleep, or essentially watch him die slowly. 
I‚Äôm currently very conflicted as I know he is impacted, but other bearded dragons who have had this issue seem to be in a worse condition than Keith, as Keith is still active and poos every 3 or 4 days (lizards are meant to poop every day and severely impacted dragons don‚Äôt poop at all).

322,"Not sure where to post this and I‚Äôm on mobile so I apologize in advance for any errors. 

I went through two years of being very very sick. It came out of nowhere and resulted in me having to take medical withdrawal from my high school, dealing with things the average person my age never would, and completely changing the way I see life.

I was an athlete and I‚Äôm a type A person. The mental battle I had was the hardest because internally I thought it was my fault for getting sick and my fault for not pushing myself harder to get better. Three times I would push myself too hard and would end up worse off because my body couldn‚Äôt take it. I‚Äôve learned not to do that anymore,  honestly I‚Äôve learned a LOT. 

Anyway, what I‚Äôm most concerned about is that now that I‚Äôm better whenever I try to talk to people about my experience or just think about it, I start to cry. I have become EXTREMELY afraid of getting sick, just the average cold can make me anxiety ridden and full of fear to the point I‚Äôll start shaking and crying. 

To graduate on time I got my GED and High School Diploma because I didn‚Äôt want to be behind my peers/friends. I knew that my college essay would tie around how I‚Äôve developed and become a better person from getting sick, but the hours it took for me to write that essay were filled with me breaking down and crying. 

I can think about my past of being sick, but if I go into detail and I really remember what it was like I start to cry. Talking to other people I start to cry too. I‚Äôm okay if I have ptsd but I haven‚Äôt been to a doctor about this and don‚Äôt plan on doing so. What I went through changed my perception of life and I‚Äôm a much stronger person (mentally) than I was before. So if I‚Äôm left with this small side effect I think I‚Äôll be ok. ",09Dec2018,1

Im 16 (M) never been in a serious relationship before but about 2 months me and an old friend (16F) met for the first time in like 5 years, at first i thought it was like a friend reunion thing, seems I was wrong since i started catching feelings for her. We've hung out 7 times or so since then.

So like 2 weeks ago i asked her how she felt about me and us, and to my surprise she actually said that she liked me more than as a friend, we both kinda agreed that we shouldn't rush it and just see where things go. The problem is that we've met like 8 times now and i even slept in her bed last night, but nothing physical has happened between us, well we've cuddled but i don't know if that really counts, you could cuddle as friends too, right?

So to the point with this mess. Should i be worried that she'll friendzone me? Should i just make a move or like talk to her about sex and that. Or should i just wait it out and be patient (like we said).

325,"This may have some length as I want to be as fair as possible to both sides. 

Ten years ago I met a person at work who I really like. We clicked as we were both 80‚Äôs kids and had the same twisted sense of humour. As is my personal policy I don‚Äôt become friends with people outside of work because I‚Äôve learned that can become messy. She left about five years ago and a few months later we became good friends. I did explain why I waited to connect and she totally got it. 

This year is that we both turned 50. She said to me let‚Äôs plan and we will do something special for your birthday. I don‚Äôt get out much because my son has a profound disability and I work full time and have a daughter as well. Basically I work, come home and look after my family. Which makes me happy - not complaining about my lack of social circle or friends. She works full time and has a huge social circle so she is a busy person. We talked/texted daily and I was there to nurse her through her many man centred blunders. She said call me the week before your birthday and let me know what day works for me to get a sitter. I called three times and each time she got a call on the other line from this guy and said I‚Äôll call you back. Keep in mind this was a guy she had been seeing for nearly a year so not a new romance. So I just left it figuring that if it was important to her she would get back to me. She didn‚Äôt for four months. Couple days ago she texted me saying hey miss you give me a call. I ignored it. Yesterday she texted me again saying give me a call. Now keep in mind her birthday is in a couple weeks.  

I texted her this morning saying that this year not one person contacted me to wish me happy birthday and that she said we were going to do dinner and she kept rushing me off the phone so I just left it. I said I hope her and her children are well and to take care. 

I have been a very good friend to this person. When she was out of work for almost a year I helped by giving her groceries, things she needed for her house etc. Upon reflection I came to realize she always took far more from the relationship than she ever gave. Essentially using me. 

I think I was fair. I was clear why I wasn‚Äôt talking to her, wasn‚Äôt petty or rude. Basically just disconnected after she left me hanging.

328,"**Hello Reddit.**

First, let me introduce myself. I am an age 13 boy, and I live in South Korea.

**Here‚Äôs the story:**

This story starts from 2013, when I was age 8. 

I was a member of an internet community. I shouldn‚Äôt have joined an internet community when I was an immature kid, but I did. Honestly, I was a harsh member. So harsh that the people on that community hated me so much. I eventually got banned from that community. But there was a one problem. I leaked my real name there. I did not know well about the dangers of leaking my personal info, so I did that. The members often called me using my real name.

I kept contact with those members by joining their sub-forums, but got banned there as well. I even got kicked out of their Skype.

3~4 years later, I searched for their forums on Google, and I noticed that they abandoned the old forum, and changed their forum page twice. Because of my curiosity, I tried creating an account on their forums, and tried asking the site owner if I can be forgiven. The owner said ‚ÄúAs a celebration to our 2 year anniversary, we have unbanned all of the banned users. Welcome!‚Äù. So I started activity on that community again. I did not have any problem in the forum.

The real problem came from their IRC chat server. A user of the forum made an IRC chat server, and most of the members were chatting there. So I joined, and chatted with them. I tried not to get banned at the same time. 

Some time later, I ran into some life problems. Because I was stupid, I broke my carefulness, and chatted in a bad behavior. The IRC admin saw this, and kicked me. Then I got banned from their Discord.

Then the site owner of the forum saw this, and decided to permaban me from that site, with the reason not written.

I wanted to know why I got banned, so every day I accessed their IRC with a different username, asking why I got banned from the forum.

The site owner ignored me for a few days, then noticed me one day. The owner said he/she will tell me the reason, if I uploaded a video of me singing a song, and if I included my face on the video. So I filmed the video, then uploaded it to Youtube, and set it as private so the people with the link can only see it.

I gave them the link, and the people looked me as a funny person. The owner said that I was ‚Äòa selfish idiotic prick‚Äô, which was the reason that led me to a ban, according to him/her. Then the owner said ‚Äòhe/she was just joking about the singing thing‚Äô,  and that ‚ÄòI took it seriously‚Äô.

Then guess what. I got banned from the IRC.

Few hours later, I deleted the video from Youtube.

Few days later, I searched for my username and my real name, because of the privacy checkup I do from time to time.  I noticed that my video was re-uploaded by a member of that community. It has 40 views, and it showed up on the bottom of the search results. The video title had my full name written on it.

I checked Discord using a VPN to see who planned this, and it seems a random member decided to re-upload it, and the owner has approved it. What the fuck?

I did not take this seriously at that time, so I just gave up doing anything.

Few months later, I searched for my username and my real name again, and this time the video was on the first result. I realized now that this can be a big issue, especially when my career gets big. Someone can double-dox me with this video.

I thought about officially filing an copyright/privacy claim, but I am worried that the uploader would deny claim, stating that I harassed most of the members of that community. If my claim gets listed as false, I would lose access to Youtube altogether.

What can I do at this point?

P.S. Duckduckgo is a problem too. Their results are hard to get removed.

P.P.S. I am unable to tell you further information about that community, because I also once told them my email address, and my home address. They might threaten me.

329,"On Monday my ex-boyfriend broke up with me after 3 months of dating and told me he wanted to break up and sorry for leading me on because he thinks he‚Äôs not gay. The furthest we got was hugging because we were taking it slow. Actually, he told me each time we did anything romantic he would feel nothing. I told him I loved him, which I know was too early but I genuinely do like the kid. I like him so much that I was willing to take everything slow and not leave after he told me out of the blue that he was sorry for leading me on. He told me he thinks he‚Äôs asexual but Idk because he was on a gay dating app and that‚Äôs how me matched.

I have thought about driving down there myself, but I can't drive for long distance like that due  to medical reasons.

I'm just looking for suggestions on if i should go there for the 3 weeks he is going to be gone. Or any suggestions for me to stay here until he gets back. Any advice would be great.

338,"I'm 17 and I work at a casual dining restuarant. I used to love my job, but management changed and now I'm not enjoying working there, but I'm unsure if I completely hate it.

Here's what's been happening:

‚Ä¢ We don't get any positive incentive or reward. Everything we're told to do is followed by a threat of losing our jobs. For example: http://imgur.com/a/Q4048mb

‚Ä¢ I started working in September of this year. I work part time for $7.50 an hour, a little above minimum wage. I was told I would get a raise once I learned all of the stations. I did a couple months ago. I asked if a raise was a still a possibility, they told me they would in two weeks. Two weeks later, they said another two weeks. After that two weeks, they said another two weeks. My other coworkers say they're underpaid too. I thought I just wasn't a good employee but the one nice manager (and ultimately the only boss) has said good things about me and that I work well and that he can count on me. Never directly to me though, I overhear it and my coworkers tell me.

‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, a girl younger than me who self-admittedly knows only half as much as me and most employees is making $8.25, because she said she ""kissed up to the managers."" She has worked here only a couple months longer than me. (By the way, I don't have a problem with her and I'm not blaming her for her pay.) 

‚Ä¢ We had gotten a new shift leader. I guess she had previous experience with this restuarant because she worked here for 2 weeks before becoming a shift leader. I think she is on a power trip. She suddenly started to tell everyone what positions they would be in (where previously we worked it out among ourselves so everyone enjoyed where they were). She isn't the boss but she started making notes, even when she wasn't working that day, the note would have what all our positions were supposed to be. No one follows it and we continue to work out our own position so everyone stays happy. One time, she got angry that a girl hadn't shown up and never called out. She doesn't have the authority to fire her, but she started yelling and screaming about how she's officially fired. The girl came in normally to work the next day and wasn't fired. This new shift leader has made about 10 new rules in the past 2 weeks. These are all new to us but the first notice we get of these new rules is a negative statement about how we're disgusting and don't have common sense and need to follow it.

‚Ä¢ I know the manager (my actual boss) doesn't like how she's acting, but I believe he is too scared to stop her. I think he has become insecure about his own management abilities. 

I came into work yesterday and just started crying. I'm an emotional person and easily cry but I don't usually cry from built up stress. I was just so unhappy to be there. 

Some of the good things are how I'm friends with everyone there, most of my coworkers are nice. Some aren't but it doesn't affect me too much. 

Also, something that confuses me is how the manager is always clocked in. It's because he needs to get at least 52 hours or something in order to make his salary, so he just stays clocked in 24/7. This adds to our labor percantage though, and then we get yelled at to bring it down. 

I am talking with a coworker about working for him as a car detailer (he has his own business). I also am a seller on eBay. If I quit this job then I'm planning on being a dog sitter. So I am not out of options but it is a bit unsure and I might lose a lot of income if it doesn't go smoothly.",09Dec2018,1

Here is the issue‚Äî I am fortunate to have a lovely family closeby, and friends I have had since childhood. However, it seems like there is always a plan coming up, an event, a wedding, a BBQ, a girls night, a birthday, etc. I feel like I am allowed to skip some of these just to spend a weekend without anything planned.

344,"So, hello. This might get really long, because it's a rather long story.  


Basically, I met someone in a Discord server, and we grew to become online friends with time. We would listen to each other's prefered music, talk about our lives and what we had been doing or done before. Help with each other's homework or studies, share drawings; he would sometimes vent sing during sad nights and I would hear him and support him.

Eventually, I developed quite strong feelings for him. I asked around my other friends, and him, and the general conclusion was that I would either have to confess or wrap them up and hope they don't consume me. I decided to go with the first, because maybe we had something for each other, and we'd been nothing but honest with each other so far. So I did. 

They told me that they also liked me a bit, but that they had been through two online relationships before, and didn't want to risk it again, and so only wanted to date people in his country and state. I understood his reasons, and accepted it as best I could probably could. I asked him if that didn't change anything in our current relationship (that is, being close friends) and he said no, he didn't think any less of me for having feelings for him, and that he actually kind of liked (in the sense of liking sharing his time with me) me more because of it. We just kept going as always.

The thing didn't hit me that bad until like some days later, and I kind of broke down completely. I was actually wondering why I didn't feel absolutely destroyed like people usually say they do when they get turned down. It's was then when I realised that my feelings for him were stronger than I originally thought. 

He then got a date, a mutual friend of ours, that happened to live 30 minutes away from him. I felt disgusted with myself for feeling sad about him, a dear friend of mine, being happy. I decided to take a break for a while in shame of myself but didn't told him. But after like a day or two, I was actually feeling worst by the second, it actually hurt me more cutting all communication with him than the rejection did. I decided to try something else. And asked him if he was up for talking about it, since I know it was kind of an awkward subject. He said he was totally okay with it, and that he was actually worrying about my sudden disappearance and he actually wanted me to vent to him. So I did. I told him everything I felt about him, and all my dreams I had with him, and basically discharged everything. He found it really sweet and heartwarming. And reassured me that he intended to be close with me for a life time if possible.

That was pretty much it, we decided to remove some interactions from a time, no ""kisses"" or ""hugs"" or ""love u, no/a bit/quit homo"" and talks about relationships. And we've been doing okay ever since. We've actually gone back to all of that, and we discuss about his current partner from time to times. I'm actually on good terms with his BF too. We sing together and play games together all three of us sometimes. We've even made plans to meet irl sometime when I can pay for a trip to the US.

\------ End of context ------  
When all of this happened, I went for the internet for advice. And what I kept reading and seeing was that, usually, if not always, the friendship stops forever. Or if it carries on, it becomes really awkward or the most interested party eventually blows up. And basically, that it's impossible to keep being close, and kind of masochistic for the rejected one to do so.

I admit, I still love the guy, and being his significant other would certainly bring me a lot of joy if it were to happen. But I accepted his decision and I figure that the way things are now, are probably better for him. His happiness is one of my priorities. And mine is his too according to him.

I want to know, could we last as long as we want to? be friends until one of us dies? are there things we should keep in mind in order to increase our chances of doing so?",09Dec2018,1

348,"I've been dating this guy for a few months. We both seem pretty comfortable with eachother. We see eachother maybe twice a week, the conversations are alright, the sex is great, however there are a few concerns. He has A LOT of friends, many of them women. So, normally his week is pretty busy with work &amp; his social life. 

Just to be clear, I don't have a problem with him being so social or having female friends. One of his ""best friends"" has a past sexual history with him. They apparently broke it off &amp; decided to be friends a long time ago. He occasionally let's her spend the night at his house because she drinks. I have walked in on them sleeping on seperate couches &amp; looking pretty hungover. He swears there is nothing for me to be concerned about, yet he understands why I would be concerned about this. 

He has never really introduced me to his ""best friend"" although he has said that he wants me to eventually meet so many of them. She refuses to make eye contact with me whenever I walk in &amp; realize she's there. She usually shows up at his place for dinner on Monday &amp; then shows up Friday for poker night with a bunch of other people. 

I'm thinking of showing up unnanounced on poker night because he reallly doesn't care who walks in. I'll be dressed as nicely as possible. I intend to spend the night after having a drink or two &amp; laying on the couch with him in front of her, so she gets the damn point. If we are exclusively he says, then he should not have a problem with me spending the night. I usually do multiple times a week.

I can tell she's intimidated because she doesnt acknowledge me being there, not does he seem to want us together. If I were in her position, I would try to respect my ""best friends"" partner. I would back off until the relationship had a bit more substance. 

He is an unconventional guy. He promised me he would let me know if any infidelity were to occur. I don't think most men or women want their partners spending the night with previous romantic interests. 
I don't want to lose him just yet.

349,"I have a friend who has been diagnosed with ADHD, as have I. However her psychiatrist is not seeming open to prescribing meds for it, saying that ""first we need to take care of the depression."" I too have depression. I take Zoloft for that, and Straterra for the ADHD and it's for me been a bit of a miracle drug combo.

My friend has been struggling with depression for her entire life, and meds have always had only middling success at best for her. She really wants to switch tacks and try to focus on ADHD instead.

Psychiatrist really doesn't seem to want to prescribe anything. We suspect she thinks my friend would become dependent on a stimulant, as she also struggles with alcoholism, and my friend hasn't yet had a chance, or maybe been comfortable with, directly stating ""no I don't want a stimulant, I'm looking at Straterra right now.""

Well, whatever you may think of this, the fact is I asked my friend if she would like a week's low-dose supply of my Straterra just to to try it out, and she accepted. And within a few days she was experiencing palpable positive effects. I had never mentioned to her, for example, that Straterra rids me of compulsive desires to overreat and use caffeine, but she reported that she was feeling the strangest complete lack of desire for alcohol, a thing she'd never experienced before. Most importantly, she's suffering no negative side effects.

So now we're wondering, though it started out as a very non-recommended and maybe a little illegal experiment, the results seem to lean positive, and is there a way she can tell a doctor ""look, I took this med without a prescription and it worked, will you please prescribe me?"" Or will doctors freak out about this and refuse to prescribe for some reason?",09Dec2018,1

353,"Sprint charged my debit card without my permission for my parents old account

So I woke up yesterday with a 3,041 dollar charge on my bank account, setting me very far in the negative. Not knowing why I have a charge from sprint, I called my bank and started a dispute and fraud investigation..


This is in Ohio in the United States

so after I got off the phone with  the bank, my mom tells me information she just remembered. So almost a year ago my mom and dad had an account with Sprint for a family plan for us three to have phones. but they made a billing mistake and instead of sorting it out or paying it, they just abandoned sprint altogether and ignored any calls or emails or letters or anything. Didn't even send the phones back or anything. Months go by with nothing happening whatsoever. At some point my parents switched banks and deactivated old  bank accounts and cards  so whatever card sprint had on file didn't exist anymore. 

Well come early November, my mom gets an email from sprint demanding $3,041 by 11/19 and the email says that if we don't pay, according to the terms and conditions, they can charge any card on file with the account. Well, they ignore this because as far as they knew , there was no card on file since that old bank account and debit card are deactivated.

However, it turns out that around some time in January, when my parents were our of work and struggling financially, I lent them my card to buy groceries. Well one time during that they bought a phone case at sprint and it somehow tied my card to the account despite the fact it was never used to pay a bill or sign up or anything. So technically, the charge is legal I think.

What's going to happen with the dispute and fraud report I made? Am I even more screwed because of that all because my parents bought a phone case or something? Or are my parents withholding information from me and used my card to help pay a bill at some point? 

Also my bank didn't notify of me the charge despite setting my account up to notify me of any charge over 100 dollars.

For reference, I never signed any contract with Sprint in any capacity and I in no way shape or form authorized this 3,041 dollar charge",09Dec2018,1
355,"I have a really really unique European Surname.  Like, I've never met or seen online anyone outside my family with it.  My first name is common though.  It's nice to have, but it's also a double edged sword.  No one knows how to pronounce it, let alone spell it.  Since the direct translation of the root word in my surname is a stupidly common English last name here in the states, how would I go about writing it on my accounts (Facebook, Google, etc)?  Just so it's easier to connect with people.  I don't want to kill off or legally change my European name (because of lineage and history blah blah blah), but it's such a pain for practical use.  I know a lot of my ancestral European immigrants would do this for this very reason.  My family never got the hint I guess :p

360,"I thought I had a relatively normal childhood. I had an authoritarian style father and mother who kind of sided with whatever he said. Lots of yelling, not a lot of love.

I moved out when I turned 18 and went to college. I lost a ton of weight and began to take better care of myself, I was actually quite depressed living at home. I soon attracted a boyfriend who was slowly more and more controlling and isolating. Luckily, that relationship ended and I moved on within a few months to a longer term relationship (two years) with a guy who was very nice but had some serious anxiety issues. He later cheated on me and I STAYED!

I ended up staying because I was afraid of being alone and friendless. I broke up with him six months later when I really began to find myself again and we were long distance. His friends were my friends, but apart from him I made my own friends.

I was single for three years and had casual dating relationships. I would get attached quickly and realized I couldn't do anything casually. I ended up in one with a very controlling person who turned out to be married (that was fun) and another one who became radically religious and said how he was commanded to be with me. I ran away.

However, the religious guy soon became a stalker and I finally put an end to it. My friends all wonder why I attract the crazies, but I really think I have a co-dependency problem and issues not standing up for myself. I think controlling type individuals LOVE to find me because they can walk all over me.

Plus, I'm a people pleaser, and I don't want anyone to be mad at me or angry because I felt like a majority of my childhood one parent was angry at me, would scream, and then ignore me for days.

I'm in therapy now, just started, but what else can I do? I'm going to start a new job soon and I do NOT want to be walked all over. How can I be more assertive and stand up for myself, while also making sure these controlling men don't think of me as an attractive target? I'm soft spoken as well.

He said I was abusive to him and that I was toxic and was asking for advice for how to get over me.

There's this guy that I liked a year ago, we were both at a party the other week and we were drunk and we started making out. Then, once we'd sobered up, we had sex. We then cuddled for the rest of the night and he told me that he wanted to spend Christmas with me and some other sweet things - bearing in mind we were completely sober by this point. 

The next morning comes and we talk about what happened. He says he sees himself catching feelings for me and that he doesn't regret it at all, he says he likes me and thinks I'm really lovely. I say I feel the same way about him. Now I used to have feelings for him a year prior to this and the events of that night really brought all those feelings back. He says he does like me in that way but isn't ready for a relationship right now, I say that's totally fine and he asks me to stick around until he is ready for something. 

Fast forward a week and a bit later, he got extremely close with this girl from Peru who goes to our boarding school. I don't know how close they got but people say they kissed etc. and he admitted to his best friend that he started to get feelings for her. When I asked him about it he said he only found her cute in an ""awh she's adorable"" kind of way and proceeded to tell me that just because he's not acting outwardly flirty on the outside to me, doesn't mean he's not feeling something inside. 

Yesterday, the girl from Peru moved back home (seemingly forever) as her time at the school was done, and the guy messages me and asks me how I'm feeling about the situation between him and me. I say I'm just chill and waiting for him to make a decision, he then tells me he's heartbroken about this girl from Peru leaving and doesn't know if he wants to make a decision any time soon.

This took a toll on my grades and relationships though because I wasn‚Äôt being myself and I was spending so much effort keeping up this ‚Äúact‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt realize that the real world isn‚Äôt like school and this behavior wouldn‚Äôt be acceptable. 

So after I graduated I was lost. Officially an adult, no sense of independence. No attention, not smart enough to get a good job. I see my self as worthless. I don‚Äôt have any friends because Im boring and I just drive people away.

377,"Before you say ""You're just looking for attention""  or ""Oh this is bs, another creepy kid who has no free time besides trolling online"" I'm going to explain myself. I suffer from anxiety and depression. I have epilepsy so I take medication but once my depression got so overwhelming that I overdosed on my pills. I've got no friends because all the kids think I'm creepy and annoying since well they've always found me annoying bur I once had a public meltdown in school due to my fear and anxiety, ( I said something like ""everyone judges me. !"". My grades which were once good dropped because I was in a clinic for 2 weeks and I couldn't catch up with the work. I have no friends or social life. The few kids who speak to me, do so because we sit next to each other. I've joined a club previously, but my parents constantly complained about having to drive me back and forth plus paying for uber so I had to quit. (I can understand why they wanted me to quit but now they want me to join a club again but it's too late since I'm a junior already). I guess you could say I was lonely. So I decided to at least be friendly with some people in the neighborhood and taking walks would be therapeutic. So I made friends with this old couple, this 4 year old kid and his mom, and this one guy whom I regret talking to. He's actually kinda the reason why I'm making this post. So I said hi to him one more just to be polite because I always do that with my elders. But he looked around 37-45. Anyways I saw him more often and he always started the conversation. Now I've been stopped by older guys in the past because I'm a 16 year old girl and I think all 16 year old girls have been hit on by older men at least once. But most of those older guys were 23-30 so I thought (like an idiot) that a guy who was around 40 would have no interest in a kid.(especially since I'm considered unattractive to my peers) But I began bumping into him more often. And this one time he yelled ""HI HOW'S it GOING"" across the street. He asked me once where I was going and I said ""On a walk"" (which I know is dumb, but I'm a depressed kid who just isn't in the right mindset, which leads me to think irrationally). I think he might have asked because he might have hoped that I was walking somewhere far away so he drop me off in his car. I mean what other reason would someone have to ask a kid in the middle of the street you barely know?? Though I could be just stressing myself out and he actually might be a nice guy. He hasn't touch me at all or pressured me to go anyways but sometimes he stares at me. I just get this bad feeling. Maybe I'm feeling bad because my school life sucks so much to the point I just rather stay home and cry alone.

379,"About a week ago, a 16 year old girl messaged me on quora. We're both trans, so I give a lot of answers and advice about the subject on there. She basically was asking about dealing with a transphobic father. The more we talked, it came to light that said father is abusive. 
I kind of took her under my wing, and I've been helping her go through the cps process of reporting it, dealing with and preparing for legal stuff, etc. I'm happy to give advice. I'm in an extremely similar situation to her, so I can relate. 
The issue is that she's got a crush on me. She flat out told me she loves me . I told her that I wasn't interested for a multitude of reasons, among them being that she's underage, we've just met, and that I need a stable adult who I can see regularly in real life, and that I only liked her as a friend and little sister sort of figure. She pleaded and begged, and I obviously didn't change my stance.  

She apologized the next day, saying she was okay just being friends. But she's still been trying to make moves on me. Calling me ""my love"", asking for graphic details of my sexual exploits, etc. Again, I haven't reciprocated or fed into any of these advances. I've been completely clear that nothing sexual or romantic will ever happen between us.  

If this were any normal situation, I'd probably cut contact because I don't have the energy to deal with high school level drama.  
 
But like I said, she's in an abusive home. And I'm helping her get out. I don't mean emotional support (which I try to give to some extent), but actual legal help and things like that. And since I'm the one who convinced her to call cps, I can't in good conscious just leave her to the wolves while she waits for them to decide if she's worth helping or not (there's not very good evidence). 
Given that I've been in her position, l know that she doesn't actually have romantic feelings for me. She's scared. She wants a person who she feels loves her and cares about her, because her parents don't.

382,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had severe treatment resistant depression for 10 years, and severe treatment resistant insomnia for 2 years now. I'm at the end of my rope. I've lost so much time just trying to make it through the days, I've basically wasted my whole semester, and I'm running out of semesters to waste. I'm studying music composition, and I have 3 more semesters of instruction before I go out into the world and try to make my money doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I waste my time because I'm tired all the time, I never have energy to do healthy things or my schoolwork. And that's because I never sleep, I'm writing this having not slept in a week. I feel like I'm 80 years old, my hands and feet feel numb, climbing a flight of stairs exhausts me even though my BMI is only like 20.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start running again every day and composing for at least 4 hours every day, right now I compose about an hour a week because I'm just trying to make it to the end of the day and try to sleep again.

&amp;#x200B;

But step one in this is to learn how to sleep. So, how do I sleep? I tried last night to knock myself out by basically overdosing on my meds, I took 60mg Remeron, 200mg Seroquel, and 10 mg of melatonin, went to bed at 10:30 and was awake until 3 am. What else can I take? I was planning on taking some Valerian root, drinking some chamomile tea, taking 20mg melatonin, 60 mg of Remeron, and maybe 300mg of the Seroquel even though I'm supposed to have stopped it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried everything, meds, CBT-I, I have great sleep hygiene, everything. I plan to kill myself if I don't sleep tonight, and I will also kill myself if I don't see serious long lasting results by a week from today. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this year, my husband and I have just had a second child and we are living on a teacher salary. I am a stay at home mom. We cannot afford to do gifts for everyone. We are not even getting each other gifts, and our toddler is getting one gift from us (a wooden train set that she and her brother can use for many years). 

We could use the credit cards to buy stuff, but we know better than to go into debt over something like a gift exchange. 

What should we bring to the big family Christmas exchange? And how do I not feel like a cheapo or the recipient of pity from my family for being so ""frugal"" as they say?

391,"Long story sorry.

Over the summer, a friend and I started to have issues. I got really annoyed with him because I had asked if he would like to hang out with my best friend and I, but never let him know I wanted to keep the group small, and he invited people to hang with us that I didn‚Äôt know. 

The day of the hang out I am really annoyed, he has just taken control of the event, and then on top of that he is annoyed with me because he is having issues with another friend, and is directing that anger at me. So I‚Äôm just not trying to interact with him, but it‚Äôs difficult because most of the people bailed and it was 4 of us. 

So we both realized we had to talk to each other to get passed it, and we scheduled a day to talk it out. I write down some instances where he had crossed boundaries and made me feel certain ways, eg; once ripping my phone out of my hand and putting me on blast in front of every one. He once planned an event at my house and set it up, without asking and just expected me to be okay with it.

When it‚Äôs his turn to speak, most of his reasons of being mad at me turn out to slut shame me. Which ends up leaving me feeling judged.

We then try to get passed it but we can tell there is still some lingering feelings. So we talk again.

I try and explain to him why I felt slut shamed, and sadly he doesn‚Äôt understand. He just keeps repeating that he‚Äôs never had a friend with different morales, he also mentions my cheating and says how once a cheater always a cheater. I stop him and ask if he understands that he‚Äôs basically passing judgment and if he can see how that would make me feel. He then explains that his mom got cheated on before he was born and that‚Äôs why it makes him feel a certain way. Which I understand but feel little sympathy for because it never happened to him directly. He then brings up how my whole friend group talks about me, which in turn I tell him he can‚Äôt say that because now he is trying to bring other people in and cause more issues, so either I have to brush that under the rug or come to them with the issues. (They has already spoken to me about my issues, but more as concerns than judgements). My friend then says I am trying to change him with the boundaries I was trying to set, and at that point I had to go back and repeat everything, and explain that I was trying to create boundaries. I did also mention how when other people upset him, he takes it out on me, which I also gave him 3 examples of. We end the conversation on a better note, but I don‚Äôt think we completely saw the others viewpoint.

Fast forward to now, he wants to talk again because I have just been sassy and I don‚Äôt put in much effort to really hang out and interact with him. I agreed to talk, but the text me sent also made me feel like he still doesn‚Äôt know why he is apologizing and what he did wrong. It ended with ‚Äúlet me know if you‚Äôre open and willing to talk, if you aren‚Äôt ready at this time in your life, I will wait since I am ready to move forward.‚Äù 

I just don‚Äôt know how to keep trying, I‚Äôve lost trust in him and I don‚Äôt think I can be honest about certain areas of my life. 



Tl;dr friend and I had issues over the summer, we talked I tried setting boundaries, he slut shamed me. We talked again, and it cleared some things up, but it made me feel like he never understood why I felt upset. Fast forward to now, he wants to talk again to try to persevere the friendship cause he is ready to. ",09Dec2018,1

This is a crosspost from [/r/amiugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly) because it did not gain much traction there

Hi Reddit!

I'm a freshman in college and over the past year, especially since starting college, I've noticed something of a common trend. I've been called ""cute"" by women a lot. I'm rather confused as to where this leaves me in terms of my standing. I think it's much more likely that they're referring to me in a sort of adorable dog kind of way instead of the sexy kind, as I'm more of a dorky nerd type (let me add that I'm 5' 4"", which puts me at around the same height as the average woman). This has happened quite a bit, and there's only one occasion in which I was told as such directly to me. In other situations, it's simply been in a group of people. One example was in one of the girls dorms on my floor, a couple guys were there and they invited me in, and shortly after I left one of them said that I was cute to the others and 2 of them agreed as well. I then learned of this later through the guys that were there. Another was with someone I met at a school club, who then told my friend that was there as well. I feel as if that since they all seemed surprisingly open about saying it, that it's something that doesn't really mean much to them, and more like non-sexy kind of cute. I will note that these girls who have said as such have all been quite attractive actually, definitely a good bit above average. Personally I don't think that I'm an extremely good looking guy, but I do believe that I have a look that some would like. Is this type of ‚Äúcute‚Äù, if I‚Äôm correct in thinking that is what it is, still viable in terms of being attractive? Sorry for the wall of text, but any opinions especially from other women on where this puts me would be highly appreciated.

Even the friends I did have kinda treated me like I was their token entertainment and would often leave me out or straight up call me annoying.

Because I was late into the school year the school assigned someone to show me around and get familiar. For safety purposes I‚Äôll call this guy Ty. Ty is a very tall and admittedly handsome guy. Ty was really kind showing me around the school and even offered me to sit with him and his friends during lunch. One day during lunch I noticed something from the corner of my eye so I decided to look over to what caught my attention. From across the cafeteria this really skinny and (what looked like) malnourished kid was looking over at me just staring. Trying to forget it I went on with my day. The next day walking home I get the feeling I‚Äôm being watched so I look around just for a bit and notice the skinny kid walking a couple feet behind. We will call him Cam.  I figured that he just lived close to where I live so I didn‚Äôt think much of it.  I started to notice that he followed behind almost the same entire way and I just assumed he may be a neighbor however when I got home he was no where to be seen. Not behind me or anything. Skip forward like two weeks and Ty and I become great friends. We would even sometimes hangout after school. That‚Äôs when the notes started. I started getting strange notes in my locker saying things like ‚Äú he doesn‚Äôt deserve you‚Äù or ‚Äúit makes me angry when you don‚Äôt listen to me.‚Äù I reported it to my counselor but she just said that it was probably just someone failing to confess or portray their feelings properly. But I always had a hunch. Fast forward about another month and I decided to tell Ty what was going on. He offered to walk me home from now on just in case. (I forgot to mention that I never saw Cam walk home after the one day).  Fast forward another 2 months and Ty asks me out. I say yes because I had been crushing on this guy for awhile. That‚Äôs when shit hit the fan. Ty started to get death threats and he couldn‚Äôt walk home any longer in fear that this person would come for him. A little later and he gets a car. He started driving me home every day. (My family can‚Äôt afford to get a car right now and they are constantly working so they can‚Äôt pick me up.) right now this is where we are at but I kinda just made this acc for advice. I don‚Äôt know if Cam is doing this but I don‚Äôt really have any other ideas.

413,"So I live with 3 people. 2 of which are a couple. John and Sarah. I also live with Miranda who has become one of my best friends. She used to be good friends with Sarah but they had a bit of a falling out because Miranda doesn't really think John is a good bf. 
Previously, John went back and forth between Sarah and another girl and it made Sarah suicidal. They got back together but then he spent the night with that other girl again while they were back together. Sarah ended up forgiving him and that was over a year ago.
Now Sarah is with her family, I am with my family and Miranda was supposed to be with her family but she decided to wait out the massive snow storm. John did not know this and had a girl over and they spent the night together. Miranda told me about it. Now my question is, what do I do? Do I tell her? Does Miranda tell her?

416,"I work at certain popular pizza chain as an insider. You know, making pizza, taking orders, prepping food, all that good stuff that insiders do at pizza joints. I started dating one of the drivers recently (we'll call him John, and myself Jane), around the beginning of November, right around the time we also got two new Assistant Managers. We'll call them Alex and Mary, and our General Manager will be Carol.

Now let me be clear here. Mary is on our side. Alex is not. A week after we went on our first date, Alex starts complaining to Carol. ""Jane isn't getting her work done,"" ""Jane keeps trying to get close to John,"" ""Jane and John shouldn't be working together."" All of this with no indication beforehand that there was an issue. 

After I heard of this, I tried to distance myself from Alex as best I could and John and I have been talking less and less during downtime. Still complaints from Alex. It kept going like this until yesterday when I almost completely ignored him being there except to bag up deliveries for him, which I do for any driver whenever possible. Alex said nothing to us about it yesterday. The district manager walked in for a minute, joking around and pretending to be the inspector to scare us, but joked a little. John's brother was also there in the lobby, and John, another girl, and myself were joking around with him while his food cooked. All 3 of us were. This is important. About 30 minutes after she left, Mary pulled me to the back, telling me Alex had complained again, but also explained that she had never seen anything like what Alex was saying from us. She also said that Alex had told district manager had commented on my behavior with joking around. Just me, even though all three of us were doing the exact same thing. John and I definitely found that to be fishy after discussing it when we were both off.

Today we are not going to not speak at all until Alex leaves and try to stay as far away as possible to see if Mary still has more complaints. If she does, and we are sure she will, what can we do? What action can I take to protect myself since it seems she is targeting me specifically with her complaints? ",09Dec2018,1

I'm writing this because I am not fully sure what to do in my current situation.

A little info for everything, I'll keep it as short as possible. So my mom moved probably about 6 or so months ago, my dad lives in another state as well. I have been living in the apartment that my mom and step dad had before they moved paying rent with a 'friend' that moved in but the rent is absurd even for two people. I am looking to move on my own without a roommate if possible but am willing to find someone else to live with since I can't stand living with my current roommate. For reference I live in northern/central NJ so the prices for living are incredibly high in my county and around here. I currently only make $13 an hour with options for overtime and double time sort of regularly but it is very inconsistent pay due to work not coming in constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the main point here is what to do, I have the option to move to where my mother lives now and basically start a new life in a new state (not too keen on it but might be the best option), find a place alone and see if I can afford it but I have been trying to gauge what I can afford and I don't think I can around here, find a new roommate or try to move in with a friend. If anyone knows the best sites or anything to find apartments/rentals /roommates/anything, I don't know the best option for that then please share them with me. I have been searching to find something cheap to no real avail. Legitimately just looking for some advice on what would be the best option as I have been trying to weigh everything out.

My mom got remarried in this new state, and then divorced, so we had to move to a new state again to live my grandmother (she moved states).


My whole life has been me being severely depressed. I mean severely. I don't know how I functioned. I barely could. All I could do was go to class to get A's, but I did nothing else. I never hung out with friends or did extracurriculars.

I ask this for one reason. My girlfriend has had the perfect life. Perfect parents, grandparents, been at the same schools, taken loads of trips, great friends, etc. 

We were talking about engineering, and it came up about her ACT score. She received a 29, and I received 26. She was really academically motivated in school, and I just managed to get by A's with my depression. I didn't care about the material or learning; I just wanted it to over.

432,"Dear Reddit,

I'm a 21 year old female, 1st generation Arab American. My parents are very traditional culturally, as well as religiously \[Muslim\] since they were both born and raised in the Middle East. I grew up extremely sheltered, never allowed to go over to friends houses (they always had to come to mine), no sleepovers allowed ever, no dating, early curfew, having religion shoved down my throat,  you get the idea. This only led to me to lash out and distance myself from my family as they're not supportive for me to be able to talk about how I feel. I developed depression and became suicidal throughout college from having to hold everything in, and always being yelled at and put down by them.

I'm currently an undergraduate in mechanical engineering at one of the top engineering schools in the U.S. I was ""highly encouraged"" let's call it, to pursue engineering. I had other passions. I'm at a point in my life where I'm just very unhappy with everything it seems like. I'm really struggling in college, mainly because I have no motivation to study and succeed in my classes because I don't even want to be an engineer. The problem is, they essentially have financial power over my siblings and I. They pay for everything, tuition, bills, personal expenses. If I so much as think about moving out before I'm married, it would completely destroy our relationship and I'd be out on my own financially.

Now I know a lot of people have been through college completely on their own, but never really having had to work for much didn't set me up to be the most independent person as you can imagine. Just recently, my older brother moved to Texas and is now in a town that has a good engineering school. 

My question is: how horrible would it be for me to transfer to this university in Texas and finish up my engineering degree (since I'm close to finishing it, and do find it interesting enough)? My brother went through a lot with my parents and gave me the idea to stay in his apartment and be independent. I know it'll be really hard with my family for a while, but don't I deserve to be happy?

437,"I'm a guy in university. Way back in September of 2017, I start chatting with a girl on campus that I was interested in and got her number. We text a bit and she mentioned it being hot outside and I end up making a joke about her feeling hot outside because she was wearing yoga pants but apparently it put her off because she ghosted me after that. She had actually posted screenshot stuff of some of our texting before she ghosted on her publicly viewable Twitter and then later replied to a friend who had commented on the posting and gave an update after she ghosted and said something about men being trash. Since she had apparently blocked my number, I messaged her on GroupMe and called out the ghosting and twitter posting, pretty extensively.

Fast forward to May 2018 and I go on an alternate Facebook profile I had and sent an apology message. That same day, I went to my dorm after a class session and I‚Äôm standing outside, talking to a friend on my phone. As I‚Äôm doing that, some people in the Orientation leader group that was walking over to the dorm next door start looking at me weirdly and I just keep talking on my phone. Eventually, police approach me and said they had gotten a report about me stalking females. I was surprised and told the officer I lived in the dorm I was standing in front of and ultimately I was told that I hadn‚Äôt done something wrong, that I had made some girls uncomfortable and there were no charges pressed and the police told me there were three girls who didn‚Äôt want me to contact them.

That whole thing bothered the heck out of me because it was so stupidly coincidental and such an overreaction. Me standing outside my own dorm while I‚Äôm talking on the phone and an Orientation leader group coincidentally walking over and some girls in it seeing me and freaking out doesn‚Äôt mean I was stalking them. It was a stupid coincidence that caused an overreaction and I reject the notion that I did something wrong.

Fast forward to November 2018, I go to a philanthropy event that had pizza and was for helping soldiers that the Secretary of an organization I was in had posted about on group's random topic FB group. When walking into the sorority house, I see a girl who looked like one of the girls that had freaked out about me back in May but I don‚Äôt pay much mind to it since I didn‚Äôt do something wrong then and I didn‚Äôt do something wrong by attending a philanthropy event open to the public. I pay to get in, eat pizza, ultimately get a free pizza because they were giving them out and leave. I reject the notion that I did something wrong there and reject any kind of claim or whatever came from that sorority that I did something wrong in my behavior, because I didn‚Äôt. 

People being unnecessarily skittish about me or freaked out about me doesn‚Äôt mean I did something wrong. Someone can sincerely feel something but that feeling can be incorrect or unnecessary.

Also, perception does not equate to actuality. Perception can be very subject to error or miscommunication.

Recently, I got kicked out of the organization by a unanimous vote by the Board. They mentioned a portion of the membership being uncomfortable with me at meetings and events and also mentioned soliciting girls online though wouldn't get into specifics or mention names. Sometimes I try to hit on girls over Facebook messages and I've had instances of calling girls out for ghosting if we started talking and they ended up ghosting. The weird thing is that I haven't pursued that many girls in the organization. I have a feeling the removal had to do with the girl who got freaked out about me. There's too many dots to connect and the timing makes sense. She's in the same sorority as the Secretary who posted about the pizza event, the President told me they had discussed stuff regarding me over the past few weeks and the pizza event was a few weeks back, they mentioned a different organization saying something about my behavior at an event (though I don't see myself as having done something wrong there), etc. Just too much adds up for me to ignore.

The President, who's been a pretty good personal friend of mine, said to me later that it hurt him to have to do that and it was difficult for him and that his hand was forced. I asked why they couldn't just have had a discussion with me and he said something about ""the damage is already done"" or something. I expressed to some of the people on the Board that, in my opinion, I end up being a sacrificial lamb in a big PR move for the sake of capitulating to and appeasing a bunch of sorority girls and that perception is not actuality and stuff like that. To me, this feels pretty unjust.

It's worth noting that I'm over six feet tall and a pretty heavyset guy. I don't like that my physique makes it more possible for girls to be skittish about me. Not every guy has bad intentions.

448,"John is 19, I'm 16. We only know each other online. He's expressed romantic feelings towards me and when I was 14 told me he was in love with me. I was very uncomfortable with this but too scared that he'd hurt himself if I left.

Now he's upset that I'm distant and don't show him enough affection and appreciation. I want to make him happier but I find giving him compliments uncomfortable because he's admitted to taking them as romantic at times.

What other forms of affection do you think I could show? I'm trying to ask him more about his life and talk about his uni work more, but is there anything else I can do that would be difficult for him to interpret as romantic?",09Dec2018,1
449,"This is going to be a very rambling post... so thank you for bearing with me!

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of work on self love and feeling ‚Äúenough‚Äù over the last year. Some recent events that seem to have a theme have brought out a lot of thoughts within me. It‚Äôs impacting me subconsciously big time and I can also see how it‚Äôs impacted me throughout my life and now. I‚Äôm going on a wellness retreat and hope to get some more of it worked through prior to.

I‚Äôm open to insights and suggested therapies. Thank you in advance.

I‚Äôll give the details of what I find pertinent and happy to answer any other questions!

The first bit of info I find pertinent is that my dad left our family when I was about 8 months old. So yes, daddy issues. While this has not impacted me in a way that I can ‚Äúget over‚Äù I do think I have felt abandoned because of this on a deeper level and it‚Äôs played a role in my relationships with men. Mainly, my need for approval from men.

I have a wonderful stepfather, but he was very harsh and verbally abusive towards me as well as once being physically abusive. I have fully forgiven him and our relationship is so sound. I honestly feel very lucky. He is a survivor of abuse and I understand that he often times lacked tools and emotional control.

My first boyfriend was incredible. We were together for 3 years. He was my first love and everything sexually. We had so much fun exploring sex and one another. He was truly my best friend. We were 14 when we started dating and having sex. We broke up three years later because of me wanting to explore other relationships and senior year of high school. There was nothing wrong with our relationship. Even at the end I still got butterflies when I saw him. We were about for about 8 months and reconnected. We confessed our love for one another and made plans to meet a week later on Tuesday. He died the day before on the Monday. This rocked me to my core and I did not start to release grief over this until just last year. 

I have a hard time opening up in relationships. I always keep a bit of a distance. I think when he died I felt again abandoned, but I also felt underserving Of having love again because I threw it away. 

I entered a deep depression, abused drugs and alcohol and became very sexually promiscuous. This continued for a LONG time. Probably until age 24-25
I THOUGHT I was really empowered about my sexuality (being promiscuous, emotionally unattached and even working briefly as a stripper) but it wasn‚Äôt long until I released I was entirely out of control and using this as a guide and trying to GAIN control.

Over the years I‚Äôve noticed I ALWAYS SEEK MALE APPROVAL. I grew up with 5 brothers plus my dad and I always just said I ‚Äúconnected with men better‚Äù as I was a bit of a tomboy for a while as well. 

Around age 25 I really cleaned my act up. I stopped using drugs and alcohol, I went on huge stints of being celibate (in the last 8 years I‚Äôve had sex with 5 people and the last bf I had we waited 5 months before coming intimate) and I threw myself into work (which I became addicted to) but became incredibly successful. What doesn‚Äôt help is that some of my career is because of my looks/body and so there is a lot of value placed there.

(Bless your soul if you‚Äôre still reading)

I had some health problems and so although I‚Äôm still very attractive and in shape, it was a massive change for me and I had to really learn to value myself for things outside of my looks although this is still a message that is reinforced often with me.

I‚Äôm a HIGHLY SEXUAL PERSON, but I feel I cannot express myself in this way (and don‚Äôt) because of the way that it is perceived. I also want to be valued for more and holding off on intimacy is a great way for my to allow the potential partner and I to connect on a deeper level.  My ultimate goal is to have another relationship similar to my first in the depth of connection in multiple areas. However, I cannot open myself up enough for that when dating and in regard to fun and casual sex I cannot seem to do that either.

Current scenarios...
My ex bf (33m) from 10 years ago and I were supposed to share an Airbnb in a foreign country as we both work remotely. I saw him one year ago (after not seeing him for 9 but keeping in light contact) and he asked for sex. I said no, that I didn‚Äôt feel that connection with him. We meet in the country, he asks for sex and I again turn him down.  Two days later, he leaves without saying a word and without paying his half. He won‚Äôt respond to me. This made me feel like he only valued our relationship for sex which was hurtful as I saw him last year when my family allowed him to stay at our vacation rental for a few days without having to pay for anything except getting there.

A few days after this happens, someone that I consider a mentor in my field who is about 20 or so years my senior professes their love for me. He is married and asked for a close friends with benefit situation. I was so sad as he has been my mentor for approx 4 years and I have shared some personal things based on our relationship and trust. He is married and I firmly told him no, that I respect his wife and marriage... this was just disappointing on so many levels, but also because if someone really loved me, I think they would want me to be HAPPY and deserving of a healthy happy relationship (not an affair!)

Oddly enough the country I am in is very very overt in their ‚Äúappreciation‚Äù towards women. I recently have discovered it‚Äôs a major turn on for me to feel ‚Äúdesired‚Äù (even prior to this trip)Interesting timing of it all.

Two nights ago I had a dream/nightmare that I was having a sexual encounter. It started off with a women and I was able to relax and start enjoying and then it flipped into sleep paralysis/hallucination where I was being held down by a man that was sexually assaulting me. This is obviously embedded deep into my subconscious.

I‚Äôve thought about doing reiki on the sacral chakra, looking into tantric practices and getting a ‚Äúyoni‚Äù massage.  I know my energy is highly sexual even when I‚Äôm not trying. A breathwork practitioner I once worked with told me she got ‚Äúsacred prostitute‚Äù vibes from me and that I‚Äôm sexually very powerful.

TL;DR So, I‚Äôve come to realize I seek male approval from men and that‚Äôs its crossed over into sex, I‚Äôve put up barriers around deep romantic relationships/fear them although I desire this deeply, I don‚Äôt feel I can express myself sexually because of how it‚Äôs perceived but also my own evolution and I‚Äôm overall feeling very lost in what this all means to me.

452,"Disclaimer: I am already in therapy. Psychotherapy. 

- When my flatmate‚Äôs come home I become uncomfortable. Not because they will do anything to me but rather because they will not speak to me or if they do their energy seems off. I am always nice to them but I mostly stay in my room because I found them to be ungrateful. When they close the kitchen door it makes me feel like they don‚Äôt want to interact with at all. My room is right next to the kitchen. If I walk in the ‚Äúhi‚Äù is sometimes okay. Sometimes you get nothing. Even if I say hi. I am not moving out btw. I found this flat and my rent is good. 

- When I meet new people I can sometimes be really defensive in energy. Not in word but energy. Why? I have low self esteem and whenever another girl comes I feel like ‚Äúgreat, I am definitely going to be ignored and excluded now‚Äù. Pretty girls have a history of excluding me. Most times it happens. Like, I joined a bible study and one of the guys just warmed up to one of the girls who also joined that day, they exchanged numbers etc etc. He done this with a couple of the new girls / boys and never to me. I don‚Äôt know why. But I‚Äôm no stranger to this. I‚Äôve now left his group. I don‚Äôt think I am jealous. Far from it actually. I just wished I was people‚Äôs first pick for social stuff. 

- Sometimes I feel like people dislike me without knowing me and I am seriously the nicest person. That my personality is too much for them. I once went to a bible study and the girls were stand-off ish. When I was praying, yes I am a good speaker, they looked at each other with a face. This made me feel so so low. One of them said I had a gift of prayer but I never returned again. I felt so bad for just being me. Same thing at my previous bible study where I felt like I was dominating thing just to keep conversation alive. I cried that day. I felt like shit. Going out my way to fill long periods of silence. Made me think, is it because I‚Äôm hear? Even my friend wasn‚Äôt listening when I was speaking. 

- No one calls me unless I call them. I‚Äôve ordered another phone. A private phone for just me. An escapism phone. It‚Äôs extreme and unnecessary. I may even return it when it arrives. But the thought of this phone makes me feel happy. It‚Äôs like a fresh start. I stopped calling everyone for a week and it feels empowering but also telling.

Well that‚Äôs all I can think of for now.

He always had something interesting to say and made the class really interesting! After that year, I followed him on Twitter and Facebook to keep up with his politics and studies. Every so often I would post pictures on Facebook of whenever I got a new haircut and he happened to comment on one saying something along the lines of ‚Äúnow you can get to class even faster!‚Äù Cause I mentioned in the photo that I no longer needed to brush or deal with my thick ass curls.

457,"About a year ago, boyfriend and I matched on Bumble.¬† We talked for a week, met for dinner, and started dating shortly after.¬†From the beginning he was laying it on thick - incredibly flirty and way over the top forward (almost too forward) about us getting together, dating, etc.


We've been together a year now and it's been the most fulfilling (least drama filled) relationship I've had. He drives 2 hours to see me every weekend and gets a hotel with no complaints and regularly tells me he can't wait to start a family and build a life together.¬†


Recently, he applied for a job out closer to me and in anticipation of an interview follow up email we're extra excited about, we've been checking his emails frantically (we have an open phone policy). At one point I googled some keywords to see if maybe it'd gone to junk/spam and while searching stumbled across an email he sent to his ex (girl he dated right before me) the day right after we matched on Bumble:¬†I miss you and think of you every single day. I love you with all my heart. My heart belongs to you. I hope you and the kids are doing great. I truly miss you all. I love you.


My heart just shattered. I realize I have no right to feel this way considering we weren't exclusive at this point and hadn't even met face to face. But I just can't help kick this feeling of ""If you say you were so absolutely sure of me right from the beginning, how could you reach out to your ex the day after we started talking? I feel like your Plan B, like you're only with me because you couldn't be with her""


For example earlier that same day he sent her that email, he wrote me, ""I want you to know if you end up wanting to be together, I am going to delete these accounts in a heartbeat! Because I want you and only you! There is no need to ever talk to anyone else. I am very old school in the sense that I talk to one woman and never would even begin to talk to someone else while I'm talking to someone.""¬†


He says he had zero interest in being with this girl and sent that message just looking for some closure as to why she would've just up and left him out of nowhere. I said ""Why not ask that then instead of telling her you love her?"" He said if he straight up just laid it out and asked, ""What'd I do, what was the reason for ending things?"" she'd threaten she's getting him arrested (background info below).¬†He said if he sent an email tugging at her heartstrings, maybe she would reply something that would clue him in on why she ended things.


(Some background info about his previous relationship - he dated this girl 2 months and she was all about him, wanted him to move in right away while she was moving her prior boyfriend out (her neighbor said she was like Baskin Robbins with a new flavor every week). So he gets a job lined up and starts slowly moving his stuff in.¬†

The week before he's due to move in, she suddenly starts picking fights over nothing. The day he's due to move in, he gets a call from the cops telling him she has requested he no longer contact her and if he does, a restraining order will be filed. This came totally out of left field with zero explanation from her.)


Does anyone have any constructive insight on this? Or been in a similar situation and have advice?


I should note that yes I have relationship anxiety and have had therapy for it for about 5 years now.¬†


TL;DR boyfriend messaged his ex the day after matching online with me (before meeting officially). I now feel like Plan B.¬†

So far I've had 5 lessons with her and am really struggling. We've covered junctions, roundabouts and bay parking.

If I was to try automatic, I know it would definitely be a much quicker process and I'd be driving a lot sooner.

462,"So I'll start by saying that I'm probably overreacting big time, but I need to ask for help anyway. I'm a college student, and  this weekend I went to a party, which isn't something I usually do. This wasn't a super open party, it was mostly for students who are in some of the arts clubs on campus, so I vaguely knew a lot of people going. It was BYOB, but I didn't have anything to bring, so I just came along with one of my friends. Things were okay at first. I ended up mooching off of some of my friends, and I felt super bad about it, since they didn't seem super happy (I did pay them later). As the party progressed things got worse. I get really anxious at parties, and it was hard for me to get into any conversations. I spent a lot of time standing around, and at one point I really just wanted to leave.

I decided to at least try to converse a bit more with people, and I walked over to a group of people I knew and ended up having a really good conversation. It was then that a couple more people I met at another party showed up. They were people I would talk to if I saw them outside, and I would occasionally text them, so we weren't great friends yet. The one girl was super nice and gave my friend and I a lot of her drink since she had been drinking most of the evening already. Things were much better.

So the one friend asked me if I wanted to make out with the girl who gave us the drink, and being drunk and out of it I said, ""Sure why not what the hell"". So he tried to set us up and everything, telling me she was down for it. We talked for a little and I drunkenly blurted out asking if she wanted to make out. She kind of brushed the question off and we moved past it, and I ended up going to talk to other people. The rest of the night was okay. She didn't actively avoid me or anything, but things felt maybe a little off. When I got home I felt horrible and creepy and stupid. This is something I would never do normally. I texted her today but didn't bring it up. I just joked around a little about feeling dead from the party and then thanking her for letting me have her drink. She responded at first but then left me on read.

I feel like I need to apologize, but I don't know if that would make things weirder/worse. I'm still not super great friends with her, and I didn't have any intentions to try and ask her out or anything. I don't want her to never want to talk to me again since she is really cool, and I don't know how to go about talking to her about it, or if I even should at all. That party was just not a good night for me, and I feel absolutely horrible about everything that happened. It also sucks because she's one of the only people I know who can buy me alcohol if we end up going to another party, but I know that is definitely not a major thing to focus on.

464,"(15F) I've been friends with this girl since we were both 10. We consider each other like sister. 

Shes really poor and lives in a small, rented house with her mom and sister. They cant even afford renting that house and are trying to downgrade to  Government-payed housing. 

When I met her at first, my family use to also be poor because my dad was still in school, and we were living in a small house as well. As time went on, my dad got his degree and a good job. In February of 2018 we moved into a big, 2-story house with a pool and six rooms in a nice neighborhood. I haven't told her or our friend group (who all happen to be poor as well).

Last night I slept over at her house for the very first time. My mom told me not to go because if I were to sleep over at her house, we'd have to invite her to ours at one point. I slept over anyways, but in the morning my mom and her mom were talking and my mom said that she was welcome to come over to my house at any point. Now I'm kinda panicking.

She always use to say ""I hate rich people"" and ""I dont ever wanna be friends with a rich person"" and I understand completetly why. She'd be uncomfortable trying to relate to me or inviting me over if she knew I live more luxuriously. 

My mom said that I should lie and say that our friend bought this house, but due to an emergency she had to leave to Iran, so she let us rent this house for cheap because she needed someone she trusted. My dad says not to lie at all. I'm so fucking conflicted. I dont know how she'll react. Shes such a nice person and we never disagree or fight or lie to each other, but I feel like this little lie could save our friendship from a little bit of tension? It's not like she'd stop being my friend if she realized I was rich, but she would probably view me differently.

I thought we were more than friends at this point, but over the past few months or so she's been seeing her ex again(she tells me for whatever reason), I don't know if they're just friends or if they're thinking of getting back together. They live closer to one another(a few hundred miles) than I do to her, just over a thousand miles for me, so it's kind of hard to just pack up and go for a few days, having school/work.

Do I assume they're just friends? Why does she flirt with me often if they're more? Why do they see one another this often? Do I tell her how I truly feel or is it a bad time? Do I let it go?

One day I noticed that 2 of the people won't sit with us anymore. I didn't care too much since I know I didn't do anything to them and it's none of my business why they decided to sit somewhere else. Also I barely know them. But the 1 coworker(John) was very upset that they wouldn't sit with us and he noticed that they ignored him completely as well. He knew them just as much as me but he considered all of us to be close friends for some reason. The 2 that won't sit with us told me that John is very annoying and childish, so they are done with him.

Now that they sit somewhere else, John only talks to me. I tolerated him before but that was because there were 2 other people to pitch in. He constantly shows me memes(old dank memes), videos of him playing video games, and complains to me about his personal life.

Don't get me wrong though, I like memes, games, and giving advice. BUT I don't want to see the same memes over and over again. I hate watching people play games. There is no reason to give advice if they aren't listening.

He will ask me for advice for finding a gf and then cut me off mid sentence to show me 5 min long video of him playing games. Then he will either ask me to repeat myself from the very beginning or forget what we were talking about. Also, our breaks are 10 mins long and a 30 min lunch. He also does this to the other 2 in our group but they are only part time so they are there for 3 days out of the week instead of 5.

Oh he has asked me about my personal life too but he would soon cut me off or I would notice his disinterest immediately. He would ask a question then look at his phone, I would stop midsentence and he wouldn't even notice. 

John is the same age as me(24). He still lives with his mom, pays no bills, plays games if he isn't at work, and has no friends.

I've been debating on if I should just try to tolerate him a bit longer(I plan on leaving in 4 months) or tell him that he is being a nuisance or just ignoring him like the other 2.

If you have any ideas and/or advice that would be very helpful. ",09Dec2018,1

This happened before and he disappeared for a week, said something about his phone being broken.. I don‚Äôt really know what to think?

476,"We (My mother and I) have a stackable washer-dryer set. We set our clothes in there, and then set for them to wash and spin. My mother left it for about 30 minutes, and came back in. It had stopped. Mom checked it and it had washed, but had not spun.

We tried all the settings, changed all of them, every combination. Nothing. It won't do anything, and it's definitely on. Checked the wires, and nothing was loose or out of place.

The dryer above it still works on all settings, and is happily doing it's job drying the now sad, unspun clothes. The washer and dryer are connected, so it can't be the breaker. If it was the breaker, the dryer wouldn't be working.

At first i was going here to school and everything was alright.But after a year i addicted myself to computer games, i wasnt going outside at all, i stopped going to school.All i did was sitting in my room, whining about my life ( as i do now D;) and well listening to music ( a lot).I was thinking about suicide waay too much, but i dont wanna die, i want to get back on my feet.The biggest issue however is that i hate deutsch , i swear i cant stand that language.Germany is amazing i have nothing but respect for that country, they have a lot to offer but im just not happy hear ( mostly because of language) . I always wanted to live in country where people speak english, US because of visa is impossible for me but so is UK because im from brokeass family.I want to educate but im afraid since i have no motivation to do it here in germany it will not happen.I had this ""amazing"" idea to become gay escort( it is legal here) for about 1 year or something just to make enough money to afford living in UK and educating there, but truth is i dont want to do that, i  know i will regret that in future, do i have any options? or will i just sit in my room , listen to music and someday just end it all, once again im sorry if i break some subreddit\`s rules, also sorry for wasting your time people ",09Dec2018,1

the main reason is my family, they‚Äôre the best to say the least, but it‚Äôs not like a level where i could take action, if you know what i mean, with childline and things like that

i just feel it‚Äôd be better to get out and be on my own as soon as i can

my parents are very religious and conservative and i‚Äôm closeted trans and bisexual and if i came out i know for a fact they wouldn‚Äôt accept it and would be angry

so i want out as soon as i‚Äôm an adult

486,"Hello people of reddit. I just found this subreddit, and I want advice on a relationship with a very immature friend. Warning: this will be a tad bit long.

I'm quite young, a high school girl. I've always been told I'm too mature for my age. I never really minded it. But these days, it's really killing me.

One of my friends, a male, is insanely immature. He never gives a second thought to how others may feel about his words and acts thoughtlessly. Even when we were on a group trip, one thing against his ""ideal"" fun and he'd just shut down. I don't mean he'd cry and break down. I mean he'd literally abandon us; if we follow, he'd ignore us and sort of... guilt trip us. If we don't follow, he'd complain about it at any instance. 

The thing is, the things we did were just including some more mutual friends into our group or going on a ride that he didn't really like(everyone else wanted to). I've talked to him about it out of guilt and anxiety many, many times. I've told him how his actions affected the rest of the people in our friend group, and how there are a plethora of more effective ways to communicate with us. However, the conversation always turns back to us not giving a damn about him. How none of us care. How he's unnecessary. And then he basically fishes me into saying ""no, we care about you, you're important"". 

I'm not saying that he isn't. He's a sweet guy, and knows how to have fun(sometimes). 

But I'm getting tired of it.

He never listens or helps. He always says to rely on him, and that I'm like family to him(he says this quite publicly, too). When I try to tell him something that upsets me, he'll always brush it off like it's nothing. And that just... really broke me, I guess. Maybe it's because I always have a smile on my face that he thinks it's okay to never treat me like a human being. Maybe I'm just a sandbag. 

I'd write more, but I'd probably end up writing a book lol. I'll end it here.

All in all, I feel like I'm putting 100% for a friendship with a person who isn't even putting 10%. What should I do?

We were literally married for 7 weeks.....how can someone go from what was meant to be the happiest time of our lives to not being in love. 

Im destroyed,she broke me......I am lucky that I am getting regular contact which was ordered by the courts. She is still trying to play happy family as many of my friends have called it.

So I am living in this room but can only still till new years as their landlord won't let me stay,don't know why,I work(part time) and have no debts but that doesn't matter apparently. So I am looking to be homeless by new years day. Another friend and his partner has offered their room after new years but I have a feeling they will go back on it.....

I know I need to find a full time job but nothing has come up yet as this time of year it is hard to find work. I can do overtime(and I am happy too) but my ex(?) wife is making it difficult as she is refusing to pay for childcare so that she can work aswell,so whenever she works I am looking after our daughter,which I don't have a problem with since I love my daughter and do anything for her(I'd even take full custody since my ex doesn't seem to prioritse our daughter but that would never happen). But I just feel like Im just conveinent for my ex wife,I have to turn down overtime so that she can work instead. 

Ive gained all the weight I have lost this year......in a month,since she ended things through eating rubbish and sitting around feeling sorry for myself.

493,"Hello! In August my best friend *Sarah* met a guy on tinder named *Ryan*. When they first started dating, we went to a bar and he met up with her there (she was very drunk). They disappeared and I didn‚Äôt hear from her until really late that night where she texted me saying she was with him. Well a few days later she calls me saying that she blacked out completely but apparently they had sex. I asked ‚Äúhow do you know you had sex?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúhe told me‚Äù and that she had found her underwear in the living room the next morning. She also talked about how the next day when they got high (weed) and started to have sex, she noticed the condom wasn‚Äôt on after she had told him to put one on. He told her it ‚Äúslipped off‚Äù. She was really creeped out by these experiences and I told her that the sex was non consensual both times and she should drop him immediately but she didn‚Äôt, they ended up being boyfriend and girlfriend. 

When they first start dating I didn‚Äôt like him at all after what she told me but the more I hung out with the both of them I could see how happy she was. I thought to myself ‚Äúmaybe I just have a stick up my ass‚Äù so I start to try and befriend this guy. Well fast forward two months later she receives a message on Instagram from a girl saying that Ryan has also been dating her roommate *Ruby* for the last two months. She sent screenshots of text messages between Ruby and Ryan where Ryan told Ruby about how he loves and misses her as well as photos of them cuddling on the couch. This was absolutely crazy because Ryan was ALWAYS with Sarah. He tried to tell Sarah that the girl in the pictures was his ex girlfriend. The Instagram girl then sent her phone number as well as Ruby‚Äôs and told Sarah to text or call them if she wanted to talk more about it. Ryan told Sarah that they were spam numbers that would ‚Äúhack‚Äù her phone. Needless to say, he was desperately trying to dig himself out of hole. 

WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THE TWO MONTHS HIM AND SARAH WERE DATING: 
He would tell Sarah that he was visiting him parents or with friends but he was really at Ruby‚Äôs apartment, he would literally fuck her then go to Sarah‚Äôs house and sleep with her too. He claimed to be a photographer and his IG was filled with beautiful photos but after they broke up we figured out that all the photos were stolen from other photographers. He claimed to go to the local university but he ended up never being a student there. He also claimed to be vegetarian (like Sarah) but Ruby said that he ate meat all of the time. He even lied about the name of his sister!!!! He is obviously a compulsive liar. Also I forgot to mention that he had gone on all of Sarah‚Äôs social media and blocked Ruby so the both of them wouldn‚Äôt find out about the other. 

My friend Sarah was completely heartbroken but Ryan had an entire other relationship behind her back, he lied about everything, and he had NON-consensual sex with her at the beginning of their relationship. He is an absolute piece of shit. 

Well a couple of weeks ago she told me that they had reconnected and that he was truly sorry for what he did and that he has changed. She says that he is being ‚Äúcompletely open and honest‚Äù with her and shares his location with her at all times. I am COMPLETELY against this relationship because he is a compulsive liar and treated her as well as the other girl awfully AND HE HAD NON CONSENSUAL SEX WITH HER. I absolutely hate him. And I have made that clear with her. However, she keeps casually mentioning him in conversation and even called him while we were hanging out on Friday. However she has stated that he basically raped her multiple times and that she knows she is being stupid. 
 
Here is where I need advice: am I allowed to refuse to talk about him and hang out with him or does that make me a terrible friend? He was so awful and I don‚Äôt support their relationship at all. If anything else had happened then I would have been forgiving (I don‚Äôt like to hold grudges) but after everything he did, I don‚Äôt think he deserves my respect. However Sarah keeps saying ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt date someone that my best friend hates‚Äù and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm being controlling. Should I ease up and let her talk about him as well as allow him to hang out with us? Or is it okay that I stand my ground? I love my friend so much and the thought of her getting hurt again breaks my heart and infuriated me.

495,"This is a lengthy post, so you can jump to the bottom for the tl;dr if you want.¬†

This last year and a half has been the most chaotic time of my life. There are multiple reasons why my life has been thrown into disarray in this time, so I‚Äôve tried to break them out below. I‚Äôm not looking for pity with this post; I just want some help, and I want people to understand where I‚Äôm coming from, and why I‚Äôm at where I‚Äôm at today.

**Passing of a close friend**: It started when I lost a close childhood friend unexpectedly last year, someone who could do no harm, and see no wrong in others. We‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúAnne‚Äù. Anne was one of my oldest friends, and while she had gone through a lot medically in her too-short life, she were healthy enough that death seemed like a distant possibility. It felt extra tough for me, because Anne was the first person I fell in love with many years ago, and I spent years pining for her, wishing I could spend the rest of my life with her. When I realized it would never happen, I foolishly distanced myself from her, in an effort to heal and move on. Thankfully, a year of so later, I reconnected with her, and it was like we hadn‚Äôt lost any time. I even wound up kick starting a relationship between them and another one of my best friends. However, this only added to my pain, as I too felt guilty for his loss seeing as I‚Äôd introduced them. I know the time they shared was some of the happiest either had ever had, and I know what happened wasn‚Äôt my fault, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling some responsibility for the pain my other friend now had in his life.

**First time moving from childhood¬†home**:¬†Anne‚Äôs passing¬†was around the same time I moved out of the house I grew up in. I‚Äôm someone who gets very attached to things, and the memories involved with them, so it was tough to leave the place that had always been home for me. It was difficult for me to try and detach the memories I had with the place I‚Äôd made them, and it felt like everything was in upheaval for several weeks. I moved in with my SO, and this was the first time I‚Äôd ever lived with someone else like this, as this was my first long term, serious relationship. I‚Äôll get back to this later...

**First¬†‚Äòreal‚Äô job**: A few months later, I began my first ‚Äòreal‚Äô professional job. I‚Äôd had a couple part time jobs before, but this was my first real career job since graduating. The learning curve was so steep, it seemed more like a wall then a mountain, and every day, I felt totally unqualified for it. With ¬†this job, I needed to also take courses outside of full time working hours. Not only did I spent all day feeling like I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, but I would go home and feel the same way there. The best part of my day was going to sleep, and the worst part was getting up to do it all over again. As time progressed, I got a bit better at the job, but I always felt like I was asking too many questions, and it never felt like I was retaining anything I learned. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm by far my biggest critic, and i never feel like I can do what I need to on my own. I‚Äôm not above asking for help, but it just never seems like it gets me where I need to.

**Passing of my¬†grandpa**:¬† A few months into my new job, my tight knit family found out my grandpa had terminal cancer, and had 6 months to live at most. He‚Äôd had various health problems for longer than I‚Äôve been alive, but it had never been anything like this. My family was devastated, and we tried to maximize the amount of time we had left to spend with him. Thankfully, he chose quality of life over quantity of life, since no treatment would ultimately extend his life by more than a few months. I had to learn how to juggle time spent with him on top of my new job, and this made me feel the most stressed I‚Äôve ever felt. It helped though that we had a great last Christmas with him, as he still had the appearance of health, and that made it enough to still feel like normal.

**The big breakup**:¬†A couple months later, while still trying to process what was happening with my grandpa, my SO of three and a half years dropped a bomb that we needed to breakup, and over the course of the next few days, the truth came out that she‚Äôd been cheating on me for 5-6 months, and she was engaged to the other guy. This had been my first real relationship, and we had planned on marrying each other within the next few years. Therefore, this was my first big breakup, and the biggest betrayal I had ever experienced. Of course then, it happened on an almost nuclear scale. My SO made up umpteen lies about the other person involved, saying they had sexually assaulted and threatened her, and that she never told me because she was afraid of him, and she didn‚Äôt mean for any of this to happen. Some of the accusations (which were total lies) were so heinous, we took her to the police to file a report against her alleged assaulter, and then to the psych ward of the hospital, as she said she had been feeling suicidal and had attempted to take her life (also lies). This whole time, she played the victim card, and I totally fell for it. After all, this was the love of my life, who I thought I knew inside and out, so there was no way she could be the one at fault in all this. But she was. She played me like a fiddle from day one, and I found out there were major things she had lied about to me from even the first few weeks we started dating. I‚Äôd never seen the red flags come up, because I guess they were always there from the start. The toughest thing for me to deal with in this was that I felt like I was mourning the death of her, because it wasn‚Äôt just that she had cheated on me; it was like the person I knew and loved was dead and gone. But not even that, the person I knew and loved never even really existed. This whole time, I‚Äôd given my love and life to an idea, a fraud that only sought to take advantage of me and make me want more.

**Time since**: That happened around 10 months ago. Shortly after the breakup, I went into the busiest work season of my life for several months, working 12 hour days, five days a week for three months straight. Yes, I know this is nothing for many people, but again, I‚Äôd never experienced anything like this in my life before, so it totally drained me. A week after busy season was done, my grandpa passed away. It was a mixed bag of emotions, for a number of reasons. After watching him suffer for several months, I felt relief he was now at peace. I felt grief for losing him, and for what the rest of my family was going through too. But I felt incredibly guilty too, because even though I grieved for him, I still hadn‚Äôt finished grieving the loss of my future with my ex-SO. I felt like I wronged my grandpa, as I couldn‚Äôt even properly grieve for him.¬†

Since all this, I‚Äôve tried getting back in the dating game, only to be toyed with, rejected, and ghosted multiple times. It‚Äôs left a bad taste with me, as I now question peoples motives all the time, because it feels like I can‚Äôt find anyone who genuinely cares about me, regardless of the effort I put in.

**The Point of all this**: I‚Äôve gotten some help from counselling when I was in the thick of the madness. I‚Äôve got a great support network between my family, friends, and coworkers. I have great (although personally frustrating) job, a roof over my head, a family and friends that love me. I have every opportunity at my fingertips, and in the realm of things, I‚Äôve had more experiences and good fortune than many people in this world will ever have.¬†

But for as fortunate as I am, I feel like I‚Äôm totally numb. I‚Äôve totally lost my drive. I certainly don‚Äôt feel suicidal, but I feel like my life has no reason at this point. I still feel like the point of every day is to make it to bed time. I have a couple exams coming up for my work courses that could affect the future of my career, and I honestly feel like don‚Äôt care about the outcome. I don‚Äôt know what my life‚Äôs future looks like, and as callous as it sounds, I don‚Äôt care. If it came down to me choosing a new job or career in order to be less stressed or happier, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd choose because I don‚Äôt care.

The biggest thing that scares me though, is that I don‚Äôt care that I don‚Äôt care. I know I need to figure out a way to start caring about my future and my life, but I don‚Äôt know where to start or what to do. I feel like I‚Äôve been through so much in the last year and a half that I need to do a system restart for my life, but I don‚Äôt know what that entails. I don‚Äôt want to just exist for the rest of life, but it feels like all I‚Äôm doing now is existing.

I know this has been a bit rambley, but it feels like its helped a bit putting everything down in words. Please, if anyone has felt the same way before and found some way to bring reason to their life, and to start caring about where they are and where they‚Äôre going, I‚Äôd love to hear what helped. If you‚Äôre still reading this, thanks for taking the time to hear me out.

**Tl;dr** \- I‚Äôve had a lot of bad stuff happen in my life in the last year and half, and I feel totally numb to everything now, and I feel like I have no drive to do anything anymore. If you‚Äôve had tough life experiences that‚Äôve left you feeling the same way, and you have any suggestions for what helped you start caring about everything around you again, please let me know below. Thanks everyone.",09Dec2018,1

497,"Went on a week long trip this summer with my buds to Panama City Beach. Everything was good. We hit the beach, hit some of the clubs at night and some of the local attractions. On the third day I wake up early and hit the beach. While I was walking the beach I met this beautiful girl and we started talking. When I say beautiful...it's not just your average beautiful. Everything was beautiful about her. Her smile, her personality, her looks. It's like when you meet someone and you just know...everything clicks. We hung out all day and part of the evening and we agreed to meet on the beach the next day. We met the next day and was catching some rays then we decided to jump in the ocean. We were splashing around having some fun then I decided to pick her up and throw her up in the air. I threw her up and as she was coming down and as I was trying to catch her...my middle finger went in her butt. It all happened so fast. She looked at me like a deer in the headlights and ran off. I slowly made my way out of the water and realized my finger was broke. The whole situation was weird and I never heard from her again. She never called or reached out and that was months ago.

499,"A few years back, I developed pretty bad anorexia and bulimia and was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. 

Food, exercise, and my body were all I thought about, so naturally that‚Äôs all I talked about too. I was absolutely the center of attention ‚Äî even though I was killing myself to look that way, my family wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how beautiful and special I was. My little sister, who was 13-14 at the time, was heavily exposed to that. 

Since then, I‚Äôve mostly healed my relationship with food, and even gained enough that I‚Äôm slightly overweight. However, over the past month, my sister lost 30lbs. She‚Äôs not overweight and she wants to lose 60 more. She‚Äôs very tall for her age, almost 6ft, so the idea of her losing another 60lbs is absolutely ridiculous. 

She‚Äôs also stuck at home (I live in another state now ‚Äî I moved away for college) with my dad, who‚Äôs a bad, bad, bad alcoholic, and my mom who works double and triple shifts 7 days a week and is absolutely miserable. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do or what to say to her. Our whole lives, it seems like we‚Äôve constantly battled each other for our shitty parents‚Äô attention, and she‚Äôs tended to follow in my footsteps even as I pushed her away. She takes everything I do and takes it to the extreme. 

I‚Äôm so scared for her, and I feel so guilty, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. She‚Äôs so young and brilliant and she has so much potential. Eating disorders are an absolute nightmare and my heart is breaking that she has to go through this to. 

Does anyone have any advice? Is there anything I can do or say to help? I feel so at a loss right now. ",09Dec2018,1

When I left to walk to my car, he came out of nowhere on his bike and started chatting to me. Asking me my name, how long I‚Äôve been a member etc. I was scared shitless because it was dark and no one else was around. 

I told him I‚Äôm 18, if he maybe got the wrong end of the stick and thought I was older. But he continued to talk to me. I felt really uncomfortable. I haven‚Äôt been back to the gym since.

Recently I've been spending a lot of time with a coworker of mine who is the opposite sex. 

It started out as just going for lunch together occasionally but recently we've been out a few times after work and on a weekend.

We talk outside of work most days as well.

I'm starting to like coworker, but here is the catch. There seems to be no flirting whatsoever between us. A few other of my colleagues have mentioned that they've noticed how much time we spend together etc and that they think she likes me but is in a confusing place as she has split with her boyfriend a few months ago.

For me, I wouldn't spend time with someone outside of work if I wasn't interested in making it something more.

Shall I just ask her what the situation is? I just don't want to make it awkward at work as we do 12 hour shifts together haha.

My celebrity i'm having a crush is different in many ways and she keeps it real unlike other celebrities meaning i love her personality too.
Sometimes i dream and put myself in scenarios that will never exist , like dating her or even meeting her. Seeing how most girls are today, only about money, sex and cheating, i doubt i will have a crush on them. And don't say my crush will pass because i know it will not.

Going from a private middle school to a huge public school 20 kids for 3 years to 2000 kids. I was unable to make any close friends for 2 years.

We were pretty happy about this and when she left my family noticed she didn't call or anything, next day we found out she was with this guy on his country on his freaking house.

We hooked up Tuesday and we DID NOT use protection, and he came inside of me. He even choked me at my request once. Seemed super into me. I don‚Äôt need a lecture I just need advice. Is this dingus with the good D worth pursuing? Is he even thinking about what happened Tuesday? The one time I reached out to ask if he was free for some good old deep throating he said he was at work! Am I crazy? We had talked about FWB before but I don‚Äôt want to push it...

Hooked up with someone and now finding impossible to get over the best sex of my life ",09Dec2018,1
532,"Some background before I get into this:
We met in middle school, at the time I was severely bullied through elementary school so I didn't have any friends. I met her at the beginning of Middle school and have clung on due to that. I was a pretty annoying child, I will admit, but she'd hit me and basically take any chance she could to insult me. I still hung around because I was desperate for any sort of friendship at the time, taking it anyway. This happened all throughout Middle school, but eventually only happened once or twice during my first half of my highschool year (I remember her saying that she ""broke me"" because I suffered from depression due to unrelated circumstances). I still hung out with her but have started drifting away from her during my sophomore year because of an instant of her threatening me by saying ""I know where you live, I know your breathing patterns"" when she got upset with me for hanging out with a new girl and she even tried making me feel guilty by saying ""I cried so hard last night because I thought you replaced me"" when I was sitting next to this other girl (I'm a guy who mostly hangs out with girls, I can't help it). But the final straw for me is when she told me that she only hung out with me, because one of my relatives that I live with works at the highschool I go to. 
So, my question is this. 
What do I do to get rid of her? I have class with her for two periods, and I sit next to her in one I'm having a difficult time trying to because I'm hanging onto I don't know what anymore, how do I make myself get rid of her?
And feedback and suggestions welcomed ",09Dec2018,1
533,"So my best friend is getting married in July , and she asked my to be her brides maid. Our family and her family are all really close friends. She informed me yesterday that my boyfriend of 2 years isn‚Äôt allowed to come to her wedding. But the other brides maids boyfriends are coming. I‚Äôve been feeling very hurt and confused on what to do. I feel like she has put me in a situation where I either have to choose her or him. Because if I listen to my boyfriend , and not go to the wedding I will ruin my friendship. Where if I go to the wedding and hurt my boyfriend in the process cause I know he will be upset he isn‚Äôt invited cause like I said were all friends then I will be choosing her. I know it‚Äôs HER day. And it‚Äôs her choice But idk what to think about this. Maybe you guys have been through this before ? I just know that if one of my best friends had a boyfriend I would never not include him in my wedding because I know that that‚Äôs her man and she would wanna dance with him and have her partner there  . Since a wedding is about LOVE. I just feel like she should be extending an invitation to my boyfriend out of appreciation and acceptance of my relationship. Sorry for babbling I‚Äôm just so upset !

538,"I need to know how to appropriately deal with this situation. I do not want to go to jail nor do I want violence to occur. So my neighbor let‚Äôs call him BOB about 60 years old about to fail out of this town deliver pizzas, been smoking buddies for about a year before, I hooked him up with a job doing security. Second day on the job he‚Äôs telling all the managers all I do is smoke weed( It is very important to me to keep my personal life outside of work), I‚Äôm a fucking idiot, etc. etc. (I heard from my co worker, thought it was shitty so I just kinda distanced myself, fellow employees started talking to me like i was an idiot after this because they all stereotype here. (They all treated me professionally until he had to tell everyone i was a stoner, about 5 months into me already working here) this man smokes 5x more ganja than i do(did),i actually quit a couple weeks ago) what happened next was kind of a shame on me but shows his true colors- Basically I drank a beer one my shift because someone left it unopened on he beach and I‚Äôm pretty unsupervised and he pulled up to me on the property I was working handed me a pipe and acknowledged the smell of alcohol and he was the only person i was within 5 feet of after drinking said beer...very next day my GM knows about it, little details about it and all, so I sent a text to him telling him to not communicate with me and I regret getting him the job, then he kept calling and i just let it ring. Old Bob within 5 minutes skids out of nowhere opens his door on me pushing me back ‚Äúyou got something to f*** say kid, I didn‚Äôt rat‚Äù over and over which I knew was a lie from two sources. So I called manager and said Bob is on my property when he should be at his and Bob sped off. I am very cordial with Bob to this day. My GM allowed me to grab a surf board in an abandoned building so I took it and the next day he was talking shit to my GF saying I‚Äôm a thief I should have been fired told on me to my GM for taking board as well (luckily didn‚Äôt get fired because I got permission from manager) but anyways now after all that all he wants to do is try to befriend me, but I don‚Äôt tell him anything about my personal life AT ALL since the beer incident so now he blatantly makes shit up and tells people he trained me, I‚Äôm not a real security guard, I can‚Äôt handle certain properties, I get on his nerves. Keep in mind i do everything to avoid the man while still retaining respect for him so i really don‚Äôt know what i do to make him put me down so badly behind my back that so many co workers come up to me, go out of their way to tell me he talked a great deal about me negativelyI have always been respectful to this man other than the one text I sent saying I should have gotten him the job and to not communicate with me after he blatantly tried to get me fired. The thing that gets me the most is this man is nothing but negativity, one of those people that CONSTANTLY complain but gets respect from everyone because he acts like he is a badass. He was an ex marine and super self proclaimed religious so that just makes it okay to talk like that? Keep in mind I am only 20 and have been living 17 hours away from all family for about two years. Do any of you guys deal with social underminers like this that will say and do anything to kick you while you‚Äôre down? I try to encourage my friends, not destroy them. Will the respect come with age? Does everyone start talking shit when they get older? Why are people so interested in my shortcomings, but not a soul is there to congratulate me when district manager praises me and gives a speech about my work ethic during a meeting, no one gives a fuck. When people talk shit I don‚Äôt even listen but I‚Äôve had four people in the past month give me boatloads of crap this man has said. I don‚Äôt know why the negativity doesn‚Äôt end, I make it look like I don‚Äôt care to anyone hoping he will move on from the hatred but they keep telling me and it makes me want to get revenge but like I said I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble. And all it comes down to is he doesn‚Äôt have to own up to his actions/disrespect. If he was capable of it I would be his pal. Have his back through thick and thin but for some reason older folk have a very hard time admitting their actions are wrong. He‚Äôs a huge hypocrite- our whole courtyard is filled with items he‚Äôs stole from company and he smokes weed at the job. He is so hypocritical I don‚Äôt see what I could do that pisses him off so badly when the things he bitches about he is 10x worse. If you guys can help me get this settled I know going forward I won‚Äôt tell that man a thing about my personal life. It took a year of friendship and trust building before it randomly turned very negative(I‚Äôm sure he talked shit from the start I just started finding out when people would approach me with the info) I just want to know how to appropriately deal with these types of people because my anger is building up Internally and if I don‚Äôt do anything to fix it now I‚Äôm going to run into more people like this and still get screwed over. Thanks guys- I know I wasn‚Äôt fully in the right on all instances here but that‚Äôs what makes the situation more difficult because if I were good the whole time I would have just gotten him fired for all the things he‚Äôs took, but I can‚Äôt get away from him because I walk by him twice a day to and from work and he still tries offering me like furniture and fishing poles really desperately trying to be my friend and when I treat him with respect the same night he goes and does all this.

Then every week something happens (I'm not taking responsibility I get it) Friday I'm out, right on schedule. Im ready to come down,  Lets Do This! And my guy calls me! (Fuck) Offers a trade for some pharmaceuticals Ive got. And I immediately say yes,  no hesitation, no doubt. My mind tells me *tsk *tsk *tsk but I just can't seem to give a fuck.

What good person does this? Idk. It's holding me strong right now. I'm crying in the bathroom alone, scared, lonely, feeling worthless. 
I can make a decision to get up, to be better, to establish goals and follow through. I'm a fucking mess, but I am an amazing mess. I care so deeply, desire so intently to help others, i am a loving, funny, sparkly, little ball of inspiration and fun. But I'm also the reverse. I'm selfish, and mean, I say things and believe things that are so out of line with reality .  ""No one loves me"" what a stupid thing to say. I know it's not true but damn it I cannot feel the love, I am not comforted or guided by it. Only the escape. It's the escape that allows me to get through, that makes life feel less heavy and heard to shoulder. 
Idk what I want. I want to love myself. I want to believe good things about myself. I want to care about my needs and derive my happiness from the joy I bring to others.

The dog looks pretty emaciated if you ask me and i don't think he and his girlfriend feed it nearly enough. I think they give him half a can of dog food (so about 6 oz) a day, but he's literally always trying to go to the kitchen and eat something. They keep him leashed up in our living room, because if they don't, he'll go steal food from the cats, or find whatever crumbs he can on the floor and eat them. If he has no other options, I've even seen him try to eat the cats' litter and dirt from the houseplants. I occasionally give him little snacks when my roommate and his girlfriend aren't around because I don't think he's getting enough food.

Sometimes I just think about my parents dying and how I'll be so devasted when they do die. I think about my own death. Either by a disease , nature causes or suicide . 

It's annoying. I've tried multiple antidepressants .I'm on Klonopin for gad  which my doctor and I agree to taper off of because I've been on it long enough and docs are cracking down on benzos anyways . I'm supposed to be off by the end of this month. I dropped my dose from 1 mg to .5 a few days ago.i take Ambien for chronic insomnia. That's another thing I've tried multiple otcs , melatonin, sleep hygiene. My sleep issues is chronic and Ambien was a last resort. I've been on it since 2011. I have no idea what else is there to do. I can't try medical mj because almost every job drug tests and in the field im in I can't even risk it. I have kratom which sometimes helps but I'm scared to take it everyday but yet I take Ambien every night 

Everything just looks so dark 1-2 weeks before my period. Nevermind the fact I live in a state where it's dark almost all winter . I use a lightbox. I crave the warmness and hate cold weather. I keep having thoughts and even nightmares in my sleep of running away which isn't surprising because I want to live in another state where it's warm mostly all year long and sunny. It's hard to save with bills and student loans. How much more can I take? I know it's mostly my hormones but I'm tired of dealing with this shit every month .

What ended our relationship was that he said I didn‚Äôt have enough time for him and it was killing our relationship. So, I let him go. 

Not long after this break up I found a guy who I just adored so much and he told me he liked me just as much. We dated for two months before he came to me with the same problems my previous ex did. He said he wanted someone who was wife material. Someone he could have kids with. I told him I did want to get married and have kids in the future though.

Can anyone tell me how I can turn my high resolution images for printing into lower ones with 72dpi resolution?

Any recommendations for software to add the watermark?

Also I have heard that part of Facebook's user agreement states that any images uploaded there automatically become their property, is this true?

553,"Last year, a really good friend of mine named Paul that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to face to face or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro with an E-Cigarette in his hand aka a Juul. And the regret I already have is why did I not go to his house that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers and meth(my mom told me my friend had a cocktail of drugs in his system). But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out and skate?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had depression or was planning suicide. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? I miss my friend. His decision to end his life just completely sent shockwaves through my body. And lately I've just been trapped in this constant loop of why did I not drive to his house that day? The thing is on Snapchat that day me and my friends (including the one who ended his life later that day). We wanted to go go-karting but then one of my other friends said that they were busy. But I said that I am free and my friend(who ended his life later that day). Then said ""If we can't hang out today then let's hang out on thursday."" and I said ok. I thought to myself, ok, we'll see each other on Thursday and then I went to go workout at the beach. But then that phone call came at 11pm and it still haunts me to this day. But the autopsy shows that my friend like how I said before had (XANAX, Painkillers, heavy doses of Weed, and Crystal Meth in his system). I am not sure if that caused a negative reaction and caused him to have negative thoughts and then end his own life. But going back. I wish I would've driven down to his house and hung out with him maybe he would still be alive today I am not sure. I am not a fortune teller. But my friend who ended his life also told me like 4 weeks ago that there are days where he just wants to be by himself. I did not see any warning signs or red flags that this was going to happen. I wish I could talk to him face to face if I only knew he would do something like this. I feel lost and hopeless in my life without my friend. UPDATE 9 MONTHS LATER: I still can't get over this. This continues to haunt me everyday school, at home, and honestly the crappy part about this is that I have to live with this forever until the day that I die. I am having trouble focusing on school assignments because I trusted my friend. We knew each other so well that I did not think that something like this would cross his mind. I feel depressed and hopeless I don't know where I will see myself in life in 5 years. Weekends are not the same for me anymore. My friend lived in a nice place by the beach and he had a motorcycle. Last year things were better compared to now. I hate dealing with this type of mental torture. I sometimes wish I was dead too. I am at cross roads in my life right now. People just don't understand the mental and torturous pain of waking up only to know that your friend isn't here. I still can't accept the fact that he did something like this. The thing that is helping me get through this is YouTube, Twitch, and my other close friends. But I really miss my other friend Paul. People just don't realize how much emotional pain I am in right now. Not gonna lie I've been lately having a more negative view on life because this continues to haunt me it's psychological torture for me. It is a vicious cycle of feeling regret and thinking what warning signs did I miss? For example we had a bonfire and I noticed that my friend was saying some weird stuff about how he is gonna be homeless and he refused to go into further detail he just stared at the fire with his hands in his pockets. And I wish I would've told his aunt about this. But I wasn't alarmed until after I got that phone call that he is in the hospital. I miss my friend and I wish he was here. I am struggling to find peace and accept this whole situation. I got into procrastinating on my school assignments because I can't stop thinking about my friend Paul.

554,"I'm a 21 year old sophomore/junior in college (slow, I know). I'm financially dependent on my parents for college tuition, housing, food/expenses etc. I'm also dependent on them for therapy which is necessary for me. I'm also somewhat emotionally dependent (am still torn apart when they're angry with me, take their words to heart, and don't really have anyone else in my life I open up to or can rely on). 

However, my mom is paranoid and unpredictable (as in legitimate mental/emotional issues, not just me saying 'mom is crazy'). She has very strict definitions of right and wrong, and wrong results in abusive behavior (nothing life or health threatening, just a lot of screaming/smacking/emotionally vitriolic rants). When my older sister was in college and dependent, she used to threaten to withdraw tuition or housing all the time (and almost went through with it multiple times) over little things like not calling her back, or less little things like my sister being gay.

Right now, my mom really *likes* me. I've been super ""well-behaved"" in the last few years, just do classes and work, no real friends/partying. The problem is I only appear well-behaved to my mom. In reality, I have many secrets that would cause her to lose it completely and possibly/probably withdraw tuition. (Can describe these secrets if people ask, otherwise I won't waste time explaining). 

I'm dealing with a lot of anxiety and panic that my mom could find out these secrets at any minute and I would lose my college, housing, way of life, and most importantly my (expensive) therapist. Although I could go to a state college and take out loans, work for a while before starting school again, I would be losing my security and way of life (a big trigger for depression in me). I would also be losing the only therapist who has ever been able to reach me. 

I just feel like if I lost my parents -- and I may well might -- I would have nothing left, and the experience would break me down enough that I wouldn't even have much of myself left.

‚Ä¢¬†How can I cope with the anxiety about potentially losing everything? Has anyone else dealt with this situation or these fears? 

‚Ä¢ Is it bad that I'm lying to my parents (keeping secrets) so that they still support me financially?

‚Ä¢¬†How much money should I have saved up? I currently only have about 2k saved up despite working as much as I could for over a year. I quit my job last week because it was too stressful and I couldn't manage it on top of school. 

‚Ä¢¬†Is there anything else I should be doing?",09Dec2018,1

558,"People pick up on it having seen me for two seconds. A lady I never even saw before in the homeless shelter stopped me and asked me to bring her some salt. From the front of the room. I did it. I didn't want to. And it was degrading. Everyone was watching. 

I don't carry myself differently. I don't look different or have weird mannerisms. I'm hyper aware of how I present myself and have had others confirm. 

But almost every single person I get to know ends up taking advantage of me. *Especially right now because I'm living in a homeless shelter.* 

I don't let people know I have a car. If they were to know, and I was to say ""No"" to them asking for rides everywhere, they'd get mad at me, there would be a fight, and then I would have to watch my back even more. 

People just see it in me. 

I'm angry, fired-up angry. And I am tired of people being willing to tread on me and talk shit at me. 

I'm highly intelligent. I have Asperger's. Again, however, I'm not twitchy, I don't slouch, I've learned to sustain natural eye-contact. My point in this paragraph is that, however, my vocabulary is pretty esoteric (see what I did there). That's an idiosyncrasy that I could see making me stand out. Turning me into a target, especially in a place like this homeless shelter. 

Advice? 

Any phrases or ideas you guys have told yourselves that helped you get over being everyone's doormat? Any ideas as to what extremely subtle things might be causing a recurrent issue even with people who haven't even *formed* an opinion of me yet, or even seen me for more than a minute? Maybe some advice on how to settle down, because I am in a MOOD and I'm too close to getting inti a shelter fight over here. I am fed up. ",09Dec2018,1
559,"Ok so basically if you don't know the world scout Jamboree is a 3-4 week event in which scouts from around the world partake in numerous different problem solving activities. It's pretty much the pinnacle of scouting and everyone I know that's been to one before said it was a life changing experience. It's the middle of next year and will be taking place on a massive activity site in West Virginia. To get into it you partake in a camp where you do different activities in which you are assessed. I went to this camp, but unfortunately wasn't selected. Thankfully for me though the local scout association opened up a trip for people that didn't get a place in the Jamboree known as p19. Project 19 is a 3 week expedition to the USA in which we will be visiting New York, Florida, Tennessee and West Virginia. I was very happy about this as it meant I could still go to America and have a good time. I signed up to p19 about 6 months ago and have been preparing for it ever since partaking in camps with the people I'm going with and things like that. However today I got an email saying someone from one of the units on the Jamboree has dropped out and they would like me to replace them.

562,"This is going to be a very rambling post... so thank you for bearing with me!

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of work on self love and feeling ‚Äúenough‚Äù over the last year. Some recent events that seem to have a theme have brought out a lot of thoughts within me. It‚Äôs impacting me subconsciously big time and I can also see how it‚Äôs impacted me throughout my life and now. I‚Äôm going on a wellness retreat and hope to get some more of it worked through prior to.

I‚Äôm open to insights and suggested therapies. Thank you in advance.

I‚Äôll give the details of what I find pertinent and happy to answer any other questions!

The first bit of info I find pertinent is that my dad left our family when I was about 8 months old. So yes, daddy issues. While this has not impacted me in a way that I can ‚Äúget over‚Äù I do think I have felt abandoned because of this on a deeper level and it‚Äôs played a role in my relationships with men. Mainly, my need for approval from men.

I have a wonderful stepfather, but he was very harsh and verbally abusive towards me as well as once being physically abusive. I have fully forgiven him and our relationship is so sound. I honestly feel very lucky. He is a survivor of abuse and I understand that he often times lacked tools and emotional control.

My first boyfriend was incredible. We were together for 3 years. He was my first love and everything sexually. We had so much fun exploring sex and one another. He was truly my best friend. We were 14 when we started dating and having sex. We broke up three years later because of me wanting to explore other relationships and senior year of high school. There was nothing wrong with our relationship. Even at the end I still got butterflies when I saw him. We were about for about 8 months and reconnected. We confessed our love for one another and made plans to meet a week later on Tuesday. He died the day before on the Monday. This rocked me to my core and I did not start to release grief over this until just last year. 

I have a hard time opening up in relationships. I always keep a bit of a distance. I think when he died I felt again abandoned, but I also felt underserving Of having love again because I threw it away. 

I entered a deep depression, abused drugs and alcohol and became very sexually promiscuous. This continued for a LONG time. Probably until age 24-25
I THOUGHT I was really empowered about my sexuality (being promiscuous, emotionally unattached and even working briefly as a stripper) but it wasn‚Äôt long until I released I was entirely out of control and using this as a guide and trying to GAIN control.

Over the years I‚Äôve noticed I ALWAYS SEEK MALE APPROVAL. I grew up with 5 brothers plus my dad and I always just said I ‚Äúconnected with men better‚Äù as I was a bit of a tomboy for a while as well. 

Around age 25 I really cleaned my act up. I stopped using drugs and alcohol, I went on huge stints of being celibate (in the last 8 years I‚Äôve had sex with 5 people and the last bf I had we waited 5 months before coming intimate) and I threw myself into work (which I became addicted to) but became incredibly successful. What doesn‚Äôt help is that some of my career is because of my looks/body and so there is a lot of value placed there.

(Bless your soul if you‚Äôre still reading)

I had some health problems and so although I‚Äôm still very attractive and in shape, it was a massive change for me and I had to really learn to value myself for things outside of my looks although this is still a message that is reinforced often with me.

I‚Äôm a HIGHLY SEXUAL PERSON (I don‚Äôt feel this is only because of my desire for approval and to be desired. I love exploring my own body, masturbating, reading about sex and sexual experience etc) but I feel I cannot express myself in this way (and don‚Äôt) because of the way that it is perceived. I also want to be valued for more and holding off on intimacy is a great way for my to allow the potential partner and I to connect on a deeper level.  My ultimate goal is to have another relationship similar to my first in the depth of connection in multiple areas. However, I cannot open myself up enough for that when dating and in regard to fun and casual sex I cannot seem to do that either.

Current scenarios...
My ex bf (33m) from 10 years ago and I were supposed to share an Airbnb in a foreign country as we both work remotely. I saw him one year ago (after not seeing him for 9 but keeping in light contact) and he asked for sex. I said no, that I didn‚Äôt feel that connection with him. We meet in the country, he asks for sex and I again turn him down.  Two days later, he leaves without saying a word and without paying his half. He won‚Äôt respond to me. This made me feel like he only valued our relationship for sex which was hurtful as I saw him last year when my family allowed him to stay at our vacation rental for a few days without having to pay for anything except getting there.

A few days after this happens, someone that I consider a mentor in my field who is about 20 or so years my senior professes their love for me. He is married and asked for a close friends with benefit situation. I was so sad as he has been my mentor for approx 4 years and I have shared some personal things based on our relationship and trust. He is married and I firmly told him no, that I respect his wife and marriage... this was just disappointing on so many levels, but also because if someone really loved me, I think they would want me to be HAPPY and deserving of a healthy happy relationship (not an affair!)

Oddly enough the country I am in is very very overt in their ‚Äúappreciation‚Äù towards women. I recently have discovered it‚Äôs a major turn on for me to feel ‚Äúdesired‚Äù (even prior to this trip)Interesting timing of it all.

Two nights ago I had a dream/nightmare that I was having a sexual encounter. It started off with a women and I was able to relax and start enjoying and then it flipped into sleep paralysis/hallucination where I was being held down by a man that was sexually assaulting me. This is obviously embedded deep into my subconscious.

I‚Äôve thought about doing reiki on the sacral chakra, looking into tantric practices and getting a ‚Äúyoni‚Äù massage.  I know my energy is highly sexual even when I‚Äôm not trying. A breathwork practitioner I once worked with told me she got ‚Äúsacred prostitute‚Äù vibes from me and that I‚Äôm sexually very powerful.

TL;DR So, I‚Äôve come to realize I seek male approval from men and that‚Äôs its crossed over into sex, I‚Äôve put up barriers around deep romantic relationships/fear them although I desire this deeply, I don‚Äôt feel I can express myself sexually because of how it‚Äôs perceived but also my own evolution and I‚Äôm overall feeling very lost in what this all means to me.

563,"I like her and want her to be happy but most of the time I don't feel like making time to go to her house. She lives sort of far for someone who doesn't drive and it just seems like a whole thing to go with her somewhere. I have to pick her up and then go to the place. If we hang out at her place we cuddle which is nice but I feel like we don't like any of the same types of shows. We met by going out and agreed to stay friends but the cuddling just stayed, she wants to be more than that but I don't. We also have a very different world view which turns out to come up a lot. She bases a lot of her decisions off spirituality and ghosts, gods, and even free will seem like delusions to me. I'm never sure how to respond when she says fortune telling is helping her to make decisions. This is also big for me, we don't joke around very much. I have a very bleak world view and it shows in the types of jokes I tell and jokes I laugh at. I don't really feel like I could or should say those kinds of things to her. I thought we'd make good friends because we share a political world view but in a strange way it's easier to have political conversations with those you disagree with. I've spent hours talking with friends in the middle or opposite side of the political spectrum and have a blast hearing opposing views, researching and responding. That gets frustrating to but it doesn't get boring as quickly. ",09Dec2018,1

565,So there was this event that my uni threw last week and i didn‚Äôt really have any plans to go until some of my friends convinced me to go. We all meet there and they then go off on their own to diff friend groups. So it was kinda just me in a crowded stressful situation and after 15 minutes or so I had an anxiety attack. I left in near tears. So thats not what really bothered me.  That may just have been miscommunication and I just assumed we were all hanging out there. What bothers me is they all know I‚Äôm upset as I mentioned my anxiety attack from the night when they noticed I left an hour later but no one cared to ask why or see how I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôve been there for all of them but one time I‚Äôm not doing great they‚Äôre nowhere to be seen.  So basically do I have a right to be mad and what should I do?

566,"This is copy pasted from a post I did earlier that got no responses. Hope it‚Äôs still acceptable.

Rant warning. TL;DR at the end.

Okay so, I‚Äôve never posted on this subReddit, and I‚Äôm not sure this belongs here, but I can‚Äôt think where else to put it.

There‚Äôs this girl, I‚Äôll call her S, who joined my friend group at the start of this school year (the rest of the group are R, who is my best friend, and E, who also joined the group earlier this year). I became friends with S because she was in my choir and I needed someone to talk to.

Things seemed to be going fine for the first few weeks, but the S started acting really weird, always talking about either herself, or her ex. Now, we knew that S didn‚Äôt have the best home life, but every time we tried to help her (which she wanted) she just completely ignored our advice.

R, E, and I could have handled this, we wanted to help her, and really liked her in our group.

Then the lying started. It started out small, with just little things said to make herself look better, that just didn‚Äôt make sense (mainly over exaggerations that were pretty obvious). After the lying came incessant bragging (one example is that R and I both do online writing, and when we mentioned it S went into a spiel about the story she was writing, and how unique and clever her writing is). Once again, we still could put up with this.

Then came the incident with E. Towards the beginning of the year I started to develop feelings towards E. Since E was in the group, I told R and S about my feelings, but told them not to tell. Both of them seemed really excited about this, and promised not to tell. Several weeks later, E said something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of being alone, I wish someone would ask me out,‚Äù After hearing this, I started really considering admitting my feelings.

Then a few days later, R was not at school so I was alone with S and E. We were having a normal conversation when S suddenly said, ‚ÄúOh Hamburrgergirl guess what! E isn‚Äôt lonely anymore!‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty good at hiding reactions so I just said, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs cool, E who are you with?‚Äù E didn‚Äôt say anything but S said, ‚ÄúGuess,‚Äù

You may realize what happened. S had asked E out earlier in the day and E had accepted. I was crushed. I have always struggled with trust issues, and knowing S knew my feelings but ignored them really hurt. Later in the day after I told R what happened she threatened to fight S for me but I didn‚Äôt want her to. E seemed happy so I went on with it (I did text S who claimed she forgot, also said something to R which contradicts that. I did end up dodging a bullet, since E broke up with S like a week later.

The past few months have been a bit of a struggle. S really likes us as friends, but still goes out of her way to put herself above us. R and I are on our last nerves and she keeps making it worse. 

Sorry this was so long I just really needed to get it out. I appreciate any advice, and feel free to ask for any clarifications or any questions at all.
