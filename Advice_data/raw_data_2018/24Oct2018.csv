0,"Hey, so I've been divorced for about a year, I want to start dating again. I signed up for an online dating service.


So, I have a question. I'm disabled, kind of, I have balance issues and use a cane to walk (I was in a car accident). I can't stand for extended periods of time eithere, unless I'm leaning and holding onto something.


I mean, I'm relatively young, almost 40. But I walk with a cane.


Here's my dilemma. Is seeing me walk in with a cane a major turn off for women? I worry that they'd lose interest once they see me hobbling into the restaurant on a cane.


Is this something I should worry about? Should I tell any potential dates about my issues?


I was thinking of just arriving early and hiding the cane before they arrive or something but I don't know.


I mean, be honest. If you were on a blind date and you saw them enter using a cane, how would you feel? Would you lose interest?


I mean, I feel like an old man having to use a cane, but I just don't know.",24Oct2018,1

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

5,"Hi guys, a few years ago we moved into a home and the previous owners left some things behind in the garage, an entire box of old cards included.  I just gave them to my little brother who has been sitting on them; he doesn't care much for pokemon either so we have decided to sell them. The majority of them are from 1999, few are from 1996. There are so many, **I don't know where to begin.** maybe visit a few local game stores for estimates? Im uninterested in store credit though.

8,"Hi everyone, the title pretty much says it all. I got my first undergrad degree in film studies but I was so depressed it didn't seem real, and I didn't feel like I got much out of it. (Didn't make many lasting friendships or networking connections, didn't attend graduation, didn't even go to a Real College Party, etc.) I'm extraordinarily lucky and privileged in that I was able to talk to my parents and we agreed that I could go back to school for a second undergrad degree, to pursue my love of art and writing, so I've been double-majoring with Art and English, and it goes pretty fast when you don't have gen eds to worry about.
I'm coming up on about eight years in college, and I feel like I've gotten stuck into the same schedule, the same problems, the same part time job. 

I'm worried my parents would think of me as flaking out if I didn't finish these degrees, or throwing away all that time and money if I just left after this semester and began searching for a job. I want to start saving up to help me move and possibly to start living with/near my partner, who's in another state.

Sorry for the wall of text. :P
**tl;dr:** I want to leave my second undergrad degree unfinished and begin a more 'adult' life. Should I finish what I started, or will that keep me stuck in a rut?",24Oct2018,1

I go to appointments fortnightly  with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm an ugly loser....or something like that. Need a 2nd opinion...I did need a shave which maybe why :/  she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

12,"I’m currently in university, and I live at home with my parents, grandparents, and two dogs. A general day for me is going to school or work and going home immediately afterwards. If I want to hang out with friends I plan it so that it happens at a time when I’m already out of the house or so that they come over to my place. 

Whenever I’m not at home for any reason other than having class or working, I always feel enormously guilty. I hate hanging out with friends after I’m done with classes for the day or even going to club meetings. 

I feel like I’m neglecting my family or not spending enough time with my dogs when I make other plans. Any advice on how to not feel so guilty would be much appreciated bc it diminishes the fun I have when out with friends. ",24Oct2018,1
13,"I work retail. I moved from a mall location, where I was working double that, was on great terms with my co-workers and always gave 1000%. I called out sick once in two years. I transferred to another store to live with my bf in MD. IF I get scheduled, I work 3-8 hours a week because the store doesn’t get much foot traffic.

I have reason to believe my store manger hates me. I had a situation when I first started working there when the manger left me on two separate occasions, alone in the store. That is a HUGE issue in this company, you cannot leave a sales associate (me) alone. My old store manger heard about this from another employee, and I got in contact with HR. This woman was fired.

I also have noticed a lot of weird issues with this store. The schedule gets sent out later and later through out the week, because apparently only the store manager knows how to make the schedule. There are other small issues with how the store is run, that I know our district manger would flip out over.

Current issue: I was not scheduled to this past week, and ended up going home (45 mins away) to help my mom out, she got hip replacement 6 days ago. 

My boss asked me if I could come in for a shift, which I said I could not since I was away helping my mom. She started talking to me as if I had to always have my schedule cleared so I can just come in when she wants me to (we do not do on-call shifts btw).

Should I wait to report all these issues after I leave? The only reason I would want to report them is because I’m sick of dealing with them and getting made to look like I’m a shit person.

Does anyone have advice on how I can deal with my boss going forward?

14,"This person I've known for quite some time (6+ years) has me at my wits end with his behavior. I struggle to call him a friend at this point because of how he's been acting lately for the past year or two. Basically, this person is a complete asshat to me. He constantly calls me names (not jokingly, I have other friends who do that and they know their limits and how to properly do it), tears down my morale, and has brought me to the verge of tears several times with how he has shamed me around my other friends (one left his company around 1 year ago, and is not planning on seeing this person again because of how he acts), and the only person in the ""group"" who really hangs out with him now is my other close friend. 

While we are all rather young (16,17), I don't feel that has too much to do with the situation at hand as I've met plenty of people younger than me that act way more mature than he does and just as many adults who'd put his ""selfish behavior"" to shame with their displays of immaturity. 

I really don't know what to do at this point. My other close friend that I mentioned earlier still hangs out with him, and since we don't all go to the same school, we hang out on Discord. He'll join  a call with this aforementioned asshat (who he doesn't have much trouble with mind you) and prefer to stay in there with him for most of the day until he has to go do chores or work. Unless I purposefully drag him out because I don't want to be around the other guy, he'll have a jolly good time with him (this close friend and I still hang out a lot, but he just bats an eye at the situation currently happening, and doesn't take a side in the arguments, he just stands to the side not saying anything. I don't want to force him to take one, I just wish he'd notice when it goes too far). I don't have much issue with him liking the asshat ""friend"", but he is one of my only close friends left and I don't want to have to be around the other guy when I do end up joining the call. I'd really like some advice on how to properly deal with this please.

Notes on the asshole guys behavior:

• Picks on me for what I say (generally I'll just be speaking normal conversation, will mock me or attack me).
• Will verbally attack my personal life, parents, pets, and myself included if things don't go his way (i.e. can't hang out that weekend because of transportation issues, calls them ""petty excuses"")
• Will attempt to shroud any of my enthusiasm or small achievements with his own.
• Will randomly call me out in front of other friend/s and then begin to berate me.
• Will try to argue louder in order to shut me off whenever I defend my point or standing.

What I've tried:
• Cutting him out (didn't work because I was dragged back in)
• Talking to other friends about it (worked with the friend who left because he was also attacked by him, but my close friend who still hangs with him doesn't  take it too seriously for whatever reason of his own)

P.S. When I cut him out from my life for a period of 2 or 3 months, he tried to get back into contact with me several times. When I tried to talk to him about it, he'd just shut me off by trying to make up the excuse that ""I'm acting like a tard"" and that ""I should stop being so sensitive."" It really pissed me off when he then decided to put the blame on me and that I was the one who was making fun of him ""all this time.""

They are acting like little BABIES compared to my brother and I; we get into stupid ass fights and make-up on the same day, even within the hour cause we know it's pointless. But my parents can't do that, which is ironic considering they taught us to not fight with family.

To start off my girlfriend and I have been going on 2 years. Nothing is really wrong with it she seems happy and I’m happy enough, but my issue is that I have a high sexual appetite I think it’s starting to be an issue. 

To give context, in the beginning we used to do it at a couple times a week. Then it just started dwindling to a couple times a month. And now we aren’t doing much of anything. We go on for months and maybe we would do it once every 3 - 4 months if I’m lucky.

We have talked about it multiple times, she says there’s nothing wrong with the sex, she enjoys it as much as I do. However, she says she doesn’t have a very high sex drive and that’s understandable. After it started to die down things just get a bit awkward and now I don’t even know how to approach her about it. 

I don’t believe she is cheating, and it’s just frustrating me. Every time it’s brought up we get into an argument and I’m just tired. I don’t want to be selfish and I’m not asking to do it every day, but I feel like we are becoming a couple that is in their 60s rather than their 20s. It’s starting to kill my sex drive, and it makes me a bit depressed and leaves me feeling as if she does not want me in that way.

33,"So for some reason my iTunes sometimes decides I need to put in my credit card information all over again and since I don’t have a credit card I rely on VISA gift cards with like .50 on them. If I don’t happen to have a VISA card (like right now) then I can’t update apps or download anything. 

Everyone I’ve ever asked about this says they’ve never had the problem. People have even told me they don’t have any kind of card on iTunes. I’ve been told maybe it’s because I spent the money on the card or something, but I really haven’t. In fact, the VISA card that I had on there has about $30 on it, but I can’t find it because I’ve just moved. 

Just wondering if this is normal or not and if theirs a way to make it stop or not. It’s a pain in the ass for me. ",24Oct2018,1
34,"I have an older brother who is 31. He's got a personality that leaves something to be desired (argumentative, controversial). As a result, he's never been able to hold a job. I stopped counting a while ago but he's probably over 75. 

To top it off, he's a severe alcoholic.

For the past 7 years, he's worked hospitality positions in remote places while preparing for bike tours. He has bicycled over 10,000 miles and that's great and all but it hasn't allowed him to create a future for himself. 

He recently got a job doing public transit which was surprisingly a good fit. The bad part, he just failed a drug test today for pot. As a result, he was fired. 

Now he has nowhere to go, no job, no money. My parents won't take him in because it's a huge strain on their marriage. Last time he was home, he promised to be sober but drank to a stupor everyday. He got that public transit job and left. 

I'm his younger brother by 7 years but he looks up to me because I have my shit together. I've helped him in the past with money or references but that clearly isn't the help that works. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm about to lose my brother but I don't know what else he can do. I don't know what path he could possibly take.

Idk where else to post this. Throw away account for obv reasons.

Backstory...I began flirting with a cute female coworker possibly half a year ago.

We always sext and talk dirty to each other during work and sometimes after just for fun as a little tease. We have never once actually done anything physical. I have been married for a year and a half and have an infant baby boy. She has been married for 5 years and has a 2 year old son.

She truly does not get along with her spouse. My problem is my spouse just causes me stress but I do love and care for her (I know it seems like I dont because of this situation but I really do). I just have a high sex drive but will never truly cheat so the sexting is just like a small release. 

Anyways...im super anxious because I texted her on a weekend and said something sexual and her husband saw and supposedly said some hurtful things to her and im sure they had a huge fight.

She told me the next day it had to stop and I understood. A day later he began calling my cell phone and I didnt answer since I didnt know who it was. He began texting me to come to the lobby of my office. I never responded and was freaking out. I began trying to message her and figure out what was going on and she told me he wanted me to come downstairs....im sure shes just as anxious that he came to our work.

He began calling our reception to get to our floor and the receptionist asked if i was expecting someone and I said no. So he wasnt able to get buzzed up to our floor and get access.

He kept calling reception and my cell from multiple numbers trying to get me to come down. He saw my picture and name on my coworkers linked in page...so thats scary. I have a feeling he waited in the lobby for awhile for me. He called all day and my wife picks me up from work daily so Im freaking out now.

I dont want my wife to find out and I esp dont want my job to unravel it by him saying something and both my coworker and I get fired....please what should I do

I know Im a piece of shit for putting us both in such a shit situation. And now she is so upset and stressed she wont talk to me to figure out a solution",24Oct2018,1
36,"I met a girl (Sara) at the gym a few years ago and thought she was really attractive and cool. We seemed to hit it off, but I never made a move. We just hung out with mutual friends in group settings. 

Flash forward a year and I move across the country for work. Right after I move multiple of our mutual friends sent me messages that Sara missed me and has a big crush on me. 

I travel back to my old location for work once a month and the last time I was here I told Sara I was into her but it couldn’t be anything with the distance. She agreed, but then proceeded to start flooding me with messages, future plans for visits, pictures of her self, and phone calls. I was pretty flattered and went along with it. Really seemed over the top with how much she said she wanted to see me. 

Then she started going hot / cold. One day telling me how much she missed me and then 3 days of passive aggressiveness. Finally she went silent and I ignored her thinking it was over. Well, it wasn’t. She texted me right before my latest trip back and brought up old plans. She was super enthusiastic to see me and invited me to a friends party on Saturday/ told me that I could sleep over after. She was pretty flirtatious at the party and on the way back to her home we kissed and made out for about 5 min. All seemed great. 

Once back at her spot I went in for another kiss and got a head dodge. She then told me that I could sleep on the couch. The morning after I heard her on the phone with her bf (confirmed that she has a bf after). I left shortly after and haven’t heard a word from her. I know this is over, but I just can’t figure out what happened. I totally respect her decision, but I feel really hurt / rejected. Do I just ignore her? It feels like there is stuff left unsaid and I’d really love to know what happened, but I doubt I’ll get that.

39,"So here's the backstory: 

I am 23 years old. When I graduated high school I went into college immediately for neuroscience. While I did well my first year, I realized that the loan debt would be too much for me to handle and that I couldn't do college for another 7-11 years. I then went into the military at 19 for Intel for roughly 1.5 years but was given a general discharge due to being sent to a psych ward twice for depression and suicidal thoughts (currently doing ok now). After that at I got a job at a computer repair shop thanks to a friend that I have been close with since middle school. Problem was that the only people who ever advanced in that company was himself (operations manager) and the lead programmer. Everyone else just got like a dollar raise every 2 years if they were lucky. After 2 years of that and being sick and tired of living paycheck to paycheck I left for a pest control company. I quit 1 month into it after realizing they lied about how long the hours were and just the utter cluster-fuck that was management. Found another pest control company that I worked with for 1 year. Was always a temporary position as I intended to move out to DC with my then girlfriend this December. Things didn't work out. I stuck with the company until last Friday when I finished my 2 week notice. Yesterday and today I worked at a cabinetry place. Was interested after the boss, that was 1 of my stops on my pest control route, talked to me and made it seem like there was plenty of room to grow with reasonable hours. TL;DR for that: I get paid $15/hr which is what most of the office guys in their 30s-50s make and that are in charge of sales are making. NTM they have been there for years. Went out into the field installing and worked my first 13 hour day. Guy that trained me said that while not all days are like this, it is still fairly common. He also mentioned that he make only 45k DESPITE putting in like 30 hours of overtime each week (they also occasionally work Saturdays). Needless to say I felt lied to again and realized there was nothing for me there and quit tonight knowing that those long of hours would spiral me back down into my depression again.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after all that, I am now looking for a new job. At 23 I still have no idea what I want to do in life. I have no real passions or desires. The only things I know is that I want a job that has a 40-50 hour workweek and, after time of course, could lead to a 75k salary. I see no point in college for myself as I feel that due to a lack of interest I would be wasting my time and money trying to decide what to become. Wanting to apply to a plumber union for an apprenticeship this upcoming year when it becomes available. Possibly an electrician too. But as I said, beyond some IT stuff and pest control, I have no experience in anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I will begin the job hunt again, but was hoping someone could give some advice in terms of what to do with my life. Whether it be a specific career, actually going back to therapy, toughing out whatever job I end up with next, actually going back to college, or something. I'm honestly afraid at this late in life I will never be able to find a decent career and will be just like the old guys in that office scraping by only to have some new, young kid make just as much or more as I do as a result of my stupid life choices.

43,"I went to Planned Parenthood on Friday for birth control. All was going great until yesterday when I got a call saying I tested positive for chlamydia (had my phone on the audio system in my car and the lady who walked by looked horrified haha). 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for five months. After feeling ready I let him take my virginity. Before we had intercourse I made sure we were both tested and safe and sound. We both cane back negative and I read over our information. 

I never had sex with anyone else or shared sexual devices with another human. I do not want to assume that he’s cheating but I don’t know. Chlamydia is asymptomatic so I thought maybe from a past relationship of his, but that was over a year ago and he was tested since. 

I don’t know how to confront him about. I do not want to act on temporary emotions, but this hurts. I was tested again today and should know my results in 1-2 days. I am hurt, I do not want to assume he cheated, maybe something went wrong. 

I JUST AM HURT, not upset. i feel betrayed, i feel like crying.

44,"I recently moved from Nashville to Detroit, it was very sudden, less than two weeks notice from my roommate (crappy of him I know but not the issue). I had a few packages from WISH that I had just ordered and as you may know they can take upwards of a month to arrive. I very quickly changed my mailing address with USPS but forgot to change it within the WISH app and contact the vendors I purchased from. Actually I wouldn't even say forgot, I didn't even think of it because I figured my mail and packages would be forwarded to my current address. Wish seems to usually send packages by ""China post"" or something similar. Fast forward to a few days ago I get an email saying my packages have been delivered. Well, they weren't delivered to me, here. They must have gone to my old apartment. I contact customer support and they say there is nothing they can do as the packages have been delivered. I normally don't spend much on that app and only get trinkets but this one time I got a large wall tapestry that cost a pretty penny.

Is there anything I can do??

49,"Hello all, this isn’t my usual account because I don’t want anyone to find out who I am.

TL;DR:
I’m in love with someone I’ve known for 6 years but I’m engaged to the father of my children who I’ve been with for 4 years and don’t know if I should follow my heart or my instincts. 

I’ve been with the same man for almost 4 years, we have two beautiful boys together. I love my SO, but I’m just not happy any more and haven’t been for a long time. I’ve given chance after chance and I’m just so over it all. He’s controlling, rude, and just overall is unattractive to me anymore. I met someone online almost 6 years ago.. and I instantly fell in love. But we never got the chance to be together or even meet for that matter due to a lot of different situations. At first he was in house arrest, then I started seeing someone else, not my current SO. The guy I was with tried to kill me and was so abusive. The man I love is the reason why I finally got out of that relationship. He helped me through it, even though it wasn’t physically. I told him I wanted to be with him and we started talking as more than friends but then I ran into my current SO and I was in awe of how much he reminded me of the other man. 

Three months into our relationship I found out I was pregnant. I thought was in love with him... I think I was. But idk. I know I’m not in love with him anymore, and I wanted to be but anymore I just don’t know. I don’t want him to hug me or touch me, I feel so irritated when he’s too close to me, the only thing he does is work, once he’s home he goes in the basement and plays on his game until he’s ready for bed. He asks me to do everything for him, get him clean clothes, cook, even shower him and clean his ears. He’s fully capable of doing everything on his own but he always asks me to do everything, and I feel pressured into doing everything because if I say no his attitude changes very quickly and even though he isn’t always “mean” about it, I can just sense then he gets mad. I’m a stay at home mom, I do everything. My little brother has also been in our care for a while now so it’s like I have four kids instead of two. I very rarely get to go anywhere without the kids and anytime I ask him to watch them I feel like he gets irritated to I hate asking him to.

I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even want to talk to him or be around him, I’ve been trying so hard to fall back in love with him but every-time I tell him how I’m sick of how he treats me and how he never helps he gets a bit better for a week or so then it’s all back to how it was before. Today he got off work early and we took the kids to the park which was a huge surprise to me because he never want anything to do with us. But I didn’t even want to, the whole time I just kept thinking about how I just don’t care anymore. It’s just too late.

I’ve been putting in applications everywhere to try and get a job and I feel like once I do and I get a car and everything I need that it’ll just be the end for or relationship because there will be no reason to hold on anymore. That sounds terrible but it’s honest. I have wanted to make things work for so long and it’s just not happening.

The other man I was talking about I’ve known for almost 6 years. We don’t talk much now that I’m with my SO but he’s still my best friend.... he’s my soul mate... we’ve actually been talking for a few days and he really opened up and told me how he feels, how he still would marry me in a heartbeat, and how he’s so upset that I’m with someone who doesn’t deserve me, and just... idk. He shot down every excuse I had as to why I’m still with my SO and why I should be with him.... 

A few months ago I told my SO that I’m in love with someone else, and I told him that I wanted to be with him and I want tone in love him but he makes it so hard when he doesn’t try, so things got a bit better... then back to how it was of course...

Now I feel like I need to just get on my feet and leave my SO... I’m just scared to do it, I’m constantly thinking “is it just my depression making me think this” “ am I being dumb” “would I regret this”.

But when I talk to the other man I feel so... happy. GENUINELY happy, I look forward to hearing from him, his pictures make me blush, he gives me butterflies. We never get bored when talking... he still has all of my pictures saved on his computer from when we first started talking to each other.

There’s so many reasons as to why I’m scared I’ll never be able to be with him though.
He lives 2 hours away and doesn’t like where I live because it’s a black hole... and he’s right, it is. He has two kids of his own that are a little younger than 10. I’m only 21 so I’m scared they would never see me as a step mother. And my two kids plus his two kids.. that’s four kids. I know how expensive two are... he has a personality disorder, depression, anxiety and I have PTSD, bipolar 2, depression and anxiety and when others are depressed or anxious it makes my disorders act up. I have no car, no money, nothing. Everything I have my fiancé bought.

I jut don’t know what I’m supposed to do... I don’t want to continue being miserable all the time... but I’m so scared of risking anything.

53,"Hey,

For context I am a 19 year old who was attending my state university, but during one day during winter break, I impulsively decided to leave college since I was fairly stressed out about being in my hometown. I left a great social group along with a girl that I began dating for a month, and really beginning to like her. But I made my mind up, and I left towards the beginning of Spring semester 2018. I bought an SUV, and drove to Oregon/Washington, and was on my own adventure. I learned a lot during this trip, and I ended up working the best job I will ever have which was a photographer at a summer camp. At the time, life was looking really good, and I was really happy, I was growing both mentally and physically, and then towards the end of the summer, I learned that my Dad was diagnosed with early onset  alzheimers at age 59. It broke me. I knew some medical diagnosis was going to come around when I noticed him declining during my Junior year, but it's one of those things that you hope you are wrong, sadly I was right, Im still hoping it's a false diagnosis but we must wait a year. Anyway summer ended, so did my job, I drove immediately back to my home state to go to school in a town around 4 hours away from my hometown. With this I was going to school, and I was closer to my Dad. I was planning on staying up in the northwest till who knows how long, but my closest friend practically my brother said something like this ""As someone who lost their Dad as a kid from an unexpected heart attack, you will regret not being close to your Dad in his final years."" And I took his word incredibly seriously, so I moved back. It's been a few months, and I am going to the community college here for nursing. I am doing the best I have ever done academically (Im really proud of myself), but man I have been struggling with loneliness. My only friends I have are my roommates who are grad students, and their dog, but I haven't met anyone here who wants to hang out with me, and I am always by myself, which has been an important experience, I am growing in terms of what I want from life, but at the same time I am partially falling apart without any social interaction, I really am, and I miss my friends back home a lot, I miss that day to day fun or grabbing food, and making those memorable experiences. At the same time, it's hard for me to move back home, I love being independent, and where I am currently it has fantastic year round outdoors which I would like along with it being a smaller city, but as time goes on I am realizing how lucky I was to have the friends I was surrounded with. My closest friends tell me that I should try waiting it out, but if you decide to come back, we will be incredibly excited as we miss you a lot. This is a large wall of text, but I am trying to seek out help. It seems with writing this I have made my mind up about going back, but I haven't. I feel like I have a future in this new town, I have great housing, great roommates, and it's one of the nicest towns in my state, but I just haven't found a group of friends. I have joined clubs today, and I will be going to one meeting today, but before I left I had to get this off my mind, and see what other people think. If anyone needs clarification for why I want to stay here, let me know. I really want to get some help with this issue. Thanks for reading if you did

TL,DR: Moved to a new town in my homestate after going on my own adventure for new things, but now I am struggling with lonliness and trying to make friends I can hang out with.

55,"So my current college class is quite enjoyable for myself, it's an introductory computer science class. The class is split into two groups, a ground who has prior experience with computers in any manner, and the other half doesn't know ANYTHING (which is okay) because of this it makes our teachers job challenging, as well as our class discussions/ lessons. I find that quote often most people would rather sit in silence after our teacher asks a question rather than ask something. This bothers me, we're Here to learn, not sit in silence for 3 to 4 minute periods because people don't wanna be involved or voice that they're confused. So my decision in this situation was to take a more hands on approach as a student,(we were told to simply speak out, no raising hands that wastes time) so I would speak my mind whenever something happened, but I got the vibe near the end of class that people were upset with me, and quite frankly that just pisses me off. Why did I pay all this money to suffer in class because people are slow? I'm not talking challenging questions either, I mean questions like ""what problems are there in our current year? Could programming solve some of these issues?"" ""In what situation is there a many to many relationship in real life/ non programming applications?"" I get it people may be confused, but they can't just sit there WASTING time because they're scared to voice they're opinion. I didn't pay what I did for that experience, teachers job is to help people he can, for example there are SOME few people who ask for help when they're confused but its  like 3 or 4 people out of 25

To sum up my attempt, I've been commenting more to help move our class along faster and to possibly help other people see its not so hard participating and voicing your confusion, but I'm getting the vibe I've put a target on my back/people don't like me

We didn't date, but she often gave me signs that she liked me. I only saw us friends and made that explicit to her. When I dated other people she would get moody. We were really close but as time got closer to me going off to college (she's staying in our hometown) she became more depressed and bitter about me leaving. One night this August I had a going away party with a few close friends including her and made an ""edgy"" joke, to which she responded by cussing me out and storming out of my house. She later texted me and apologized, but it was half-assed and put most of the blame on me. I told her so (in a nicer way) and said I was sick of her being rude to me for no reason. My 'friend' then tells me how careless I am about her and other people's feelings and how I'm low-key racist, misogynistic, and homophobic. We had had debates all the time about these issues, and so I asked her if she had felt that way about me the whole time, why would she be friends with me? (because *I* wouldn't be friends with someone who I thought was all those things). I told her then maybe we should rethink being friends. 

I left for college without saying goodbye to her and we haven't talked in two months. She likes all my posts on social media and has tried to reach out to me on Snapchat, but I've been too pissed to respond. The problem is that we had a great connection before this, and I miss our friendship. Should I reach out to her or am I just prolonging a toxic relationship?",24Oct2018,1
59,"So I'm in a sort of class thingy with about a dozen other people and there is a cute guy in it who I would really like to get to know... ok if being honest I find him really attractive and have a crush. (I'm trying not to get weird about it in my head). I am a full grown basically 30 year old adult woman but I've been in long term relationships since I was 18 and basically don't remember how to flirt: I've never been good at or prone to making the first move or showing interest. Like I know how to flirt and show interest when I'm in the conversation/situation already but I don't know how to get it there. 


I already feel/know I should get to know him and just try to ""make friends"" with him (I'm not that great at that either) because a. That's normal and b. Trying to start a flirtatious or dating relationship while we have to meet twice a week in this mandatory thing for 2 more months could get awkward. 
Basically I just want to get to know him, maybe flirt/make my interest noticeable and super hope that he like wants to date me by the end of it?!  I seriously just need like advice on my own headspace I think. I would hate to come on too strong but I would also hate to seem cold and uninterested. Basically I want to telegraph ""I'm available and interested in you"" so that I can get feedback or ideally he would just be like ""I like you want to go on a date?""

There's not much opportunity to talk during the meeting thingy, we have assigned seats so we are close enough that I can make a general comment that he would hear and vice versa. I've chatted with him after as we all walk out - (no one hangs around) but the walk out is short (like 1 minute) until he goes a different direction than me because he walks and I drive.  I don't want to seem obviously making an attempt to talk to him too much and I have a hard time making chit chat with people I'm interested in cause I get all awkward. Also sometimes someone else will be having a little convo with him or me on the way out. 

I could enlist the help of a lady and girl who I'm sorta friends with in there but I don't want to make it a thing.  Also I don't even know if this guy has a girlfriend but I haven't gotten that vibe. 

All my lame ass friends are married and like LOL IDK.  BTW I am not a totally socially retarded weirdo. I used to be cool and now I'm weird and awkward 😂😬😎.  Advice, pep talks, etc. much appreciated. 😳😳😳",24Oct2018,1
60,"I supervise three administrative assistants. They all work in the front/reception area of our office building. Between the three of them, the front desk/phones always need to be covered. When one needs a day off, they’ll check with me to make sure no one else has already has the day booked off. 

Two of them don’t get along at all. Apparently they had a big falling out about 6 years ago, before I started. Employee 1 was apparently tracking the activities of employee 2. She was keeping notes regarding how long E2 was on the phone for (assuming the calls were personal) as well as tracking time spent on coffee breaks, browsing the internet, etc. (all making assumptions about whether it was work or personal). 

E2 happened to be standing near E1’s desk one day and noticed the book of notes that E1 had been making about her. She alerted their then-supervisor, and E1 was reprimanded. 

Now I’m their supervisor. If one of my employees books a day off, I write it on a calendar in my office. It’s a flip calendar with one page for each month. E2 has already booked off some time at Christmas so I wrote her name on the applicable days in December. 

E2 was answering the phone at E1’s desk today and noticed that E1’s calendar was flipped to December. E2 saw “E2 off” written on all the days she’s taking off in December, so she told me about it. The only place E1 could have gotten this information is from the calendar in my office - she didn’t ask me or E2 about it. 

I was on maternity leave two years ago and the same thing happened. E2 phoned me at home to let me know, and my replacement at the time didn’t want to deal with it. By the time I got back to work months later, it seemed too far gone to bring up. But now that it’s happened again, I want to address it. 

E1 is clearly sneaking into my office and flipping through my calendar after everyone has gone home to find out when E2 has booked days off. This information is not confidential in any way - it does affect E1 if she’s looking to take some time off as well. She could ask me and I would tell her. But it’s the fact that she’s sneaking around and still seems to be too concerned about E2’s activities. One of the days actually said “E2 off! :)”

It makes me wonder if she hates E2 so much that she just wants to know when she’ll be off so she knows it’ll be a good day. She didn’t record any of E3’s time off, so it doesn’t seem like her motives are about coverage at the front. I do think she has issues with depression/paranoia, so I’m sensitive to that. 

So how would you address this?

TL,DR: I found out a subordinate is sneaking into my office after hours to keep track of another employee’s days off. This is information I would give her if she asked me for it.

61,"Hi guys, I'm a junior in high school and my dad just got a job overseas. He and my family will be moving over there starting next summer (before my senior year), but they have given me a few options. 1st, I could move there with them and be with my family, but most likely never see my friends again, and the international school there has no classes I have not taken yet. 2nd, I could stay at home and graduate from my current high school, as they have a boarding program for international students, however, it is extremely strict and my freedom would be limited to small outings every couple weeks with people who speak a different language. (we have no family in town, and my close friends already have to share bedrooms with their siblings). The third option is I go board for my senior year anywhere in the world, and while that seems attractive at first, that proves to have the downsides of both the strict lack of freedom of a boarding school and the never seeing my friends again. I will turn 18 right before my senior year start, but I cannot afford myself to rent an apartment where I live (cheapest apartment I can find starts around 800 a month without internet, phone, etc.). My parents are extremely hesitant to rent me an apartment (rightfully so, I am a high schooler, even if my grades wouldn't suffer). Money isn't a factor when it comes to the apartment either by the way.

She’s manic though, and ever since we had gotten down here we fought every single day. I didn’t even see arguments coming half the time and I felt like I was walking on glass around her. Everything I did pissed her off and it got the point this morning she gave me the ultimatum that I either had to change my ways or to dump her. I’ve been trying to change whatever ways it is that bothers her for 8 months to try to make her happy, and tonight I just decided I can’t do it anymore, I’ll never make her happy like she wants, and I said that it’s best we split apart.

She didn’t say another word to me as she went and packed her stuff. She took the dogs, including one we adopted together and split the cost on, and didn’t even talk to me about what she’s going to do about her part of the lease (we both signed lease documents for a 1 bedroom apartment)

68,"(Note I am not a bully and I have never said anything mean to this kid and I do not tolerate bullying) Now let me get started with the beginning of this whole situation... So way way back in elementary school their was this one kid named Aidan. (I’m not going to say his last name for obvious reasons) but Aidan was my friend we played Xbox together we hung out and we were pretty decent friends. Our parents knew each other and we hung out quite a lot. The came middle school, he went to one school and I went to a different one. Over middle school we stoped hanging out but we still played Xbox together online. But I noticed something that he began to sound more and more miserable about middle school. He would always talk about kids bullying him and stuff. Same things happened to me people made fun of my shoes, my clothes, my hair, my face, my glasses. Note; I had like 3 friends and I was kinda weird. Yeah it sucked but came 8th grade I became somewhat a cool person. I gained a lot of friends i changed how I dressed for example ripped basketball shorts to khakis. Changing my appearance to no longer look like a little kid but to look like a mature young adult. I was changing I began acting different caring about school more and began talking to girls. It was lithe next step in my life. I was on the right track.


But then came high school... I felt ready for high school, I got new clothes, some new Jordan’s, and just a whole new attitude. And high school is great my grades are not terrible and I’m doing good. It was ignition day (like a week before school the freshmen got to go through their schedule and play games) At the end of the ignition day I was hanging out with some of the cooler kids I guess someone would say. But then comes Aidan... I hardly recognized him at first but I was kinda shocked. He was like a 6th grade version of me. He comes up and starts talking about Xbox and the time we used to play Minecraft and it embarrassed me in front of all my friends. I thought he did this on purpose to be funny, but he was dead serious. I thought nothing of it, I kinda told him that I don’t play those games anymore I’ve moved on. So then comes school and it’s the first lunch of freshman year. Me and my friends pick a table to sit at and we sat their and had our lunch. We are all laughing and talking and Aidan comes looking for a seat near me. It didn’t even cross my mind that he was going to sit by me. So of course I felt kinda bad but I told him to go sit by his other friends there is no room, and I am not giving up my spot with my whole table of friends just to sit by someone who I’m not really friends with. But guess what he does instead of find another table... He just stands their eating his lunch standing. My friends began making fun of him and telling him to go away. But he didn’t! I began to realize he has no one else to sit by.

So through the first quarter I realize this kid has 0 friends. No one to talk to, and no one to sit by. Me and him have nothing in common, he is like actually annoying. I’ll be waking down the hallway earbuds in minding my own business and he just comes and starts talking to me. But he talks about things from 5th grade times we played laser tag times we played with legos and stuff. But it’s freshman year and no one brings that up that’s how you embarrass someone. He does that in-front of my friends and they all hate him. They call him names and stuff which is wrong but he bothers them. If someone tells him to go away he will say make me and then just still stands their doing nothing. My greatest fear this year is if I’m talking with a girl or someone I have a crush on he will come up and ruin the moment. I am afraid to tell him to tell Aidan to make new friends what if he takes it as an insult or something he will tell his parents he is that type of kid. His parents know mine and I am for sure going to get in trouble if I tell him to go away. 

But here comes the real problem. Right before the first day my mom tells me every Wednesday he has to come home with me. My brother drives me to school and back. But on Wednesday Aidan has to come home with me. But when he is at my house it’s fine, we just play Xbox he can’t embarrass me in front of anyone and he is pretty chill. But he stays after school for around 3 hours. Now yeah if your hanging out with a friend that is like really short but Aidan is boring, all he wants to do is play Xbox and that is what we have done all school year so far. I dread Wednesday because of this. He leaves around 6:00. Tomorrow is a half day, so school is out at 12:30 and it is a Wednesday. That means I have to bring him home at 12:30 have him stay at my house for just about 6 hours. That is double what we normally do and what do we have to do Play Xbox with him for 6 hours. No way! This is possibly going to be the worst day of freshman year. Half days are fun but having Aidan over is more like a chore than fun. It’s hard to tell him not to come because his parents and my parents force him to come. I never asked if he could he just has to. If me and my brother leave him at school he is there till 6 and my parents would kill me and my brother if we left him. My brother doesn’t like him ether. It’s more like baby sitting than hanging out.

Please someone tell me what to do. Someone tell me how to get him off my back what to say to my parents about the problems I can’t be mean to him but I feel like I will have to resort to that. I do not want to be his friend, at least not his only friend.",24Oct2018,1

70,"I'm a LMT (massage therapist)  I've been working at this specific location for almost a year now. I work weekends and Mondays (I knew starting out in massage therapy I'd be working weekends, no problem). I've been wanting to change my schedule recently to further suit my lifestyle and needs. Personally, after being in the field for 3 years I should have enough experience and confidence to ask my boss... however, any time I've gone to my boss asking for a day off/ switch shifts with someone/ or was sick (like actually violently ill) and needed the day covered or off she would act like the world is crashing and burning.
 I completely understand how hard it can be find someone to cover already existing  appointments (we only have 4 therapists. 3F, 1M) when we each have set schedules and regulars. But at one point she threatened my job because I was very sick and could not make it that day. This whole year I've asked for maybe 3-4 days off, every time I'm told how inconvenient I am and that no one has called off so much in all the years she's been open *eye roll* okay. 
Anyway, I need advice on what to say to her. I have never had a boss I was this nervous about talking to. I know it's not an ideal work environment but I rarely see or speak to her anyway so it doesn't affect much.  I've had a note in my phone I've rewritten at least 10 times trying to make my demands less...demanding but also I want to come off strong and not scared. Below is the note I have but haven't sent yet. Any pointers would be great! Thanks in advance!


Boss,
I wanted to discuss my schedule with you. I am very happy with Fridays and Saturdays, most of my clients and regulars come those days. I’m looking to remove Sundays and substitute it for a day during the week. As for Mondays I was hoping to work 12-6, shorter hours on Mondays would work much better for me. If these days and hours don’t work well for you I am willing to further discuss different options.

71,"For context, my job involves teaching and frequent interaction with children. Today, one of the little girls was upset about being left and kept asking for her mom. She begged me to call her, and although I didn't have her number, I pretended to call the mom just to reassure her and calm her down. I told her mom would come back to get her soon and she seemed content with this.

She ended up being picked up by her grandfather and started bawling because 'the teacher said my mommy is going to pick me up'. She refused to go with him at first, grandpa became annoyed, and angrily asked why I would tell her such a thing. Then the situation got worse when the little girl blurted out that I ""called mommy"" to which grandpa replied ""you called her mom?! Why?!""

I tried to explain that I had only pretended to call, to which the little girl cried harder, yelling that the teacher lied to her, grandpa got angrier, and it was clear it was time for me to shut up.

74,"While In highschool I was popular, everyone knew me and was generally liked. Although I had a lot of friends, I never really considered them much more since I just didn’t really care about them that much. I had a tight but group of close friends, where we all hung out and it was great. 

I eventually dated one-of them who I knew for a long time. Eventually I broke up with her because she was emotionally abusive, but I still had my group of friends who backed me up after she started drama, and life went on. By senior year, two of my close friends, let’s call them jinx and xiam, had a falling out and it caused a bit of a tear since we all couldn’t hang out together,but I managed to balance out hanging out with them. 

I ended up having a falling out with jinx aswell since I figured out he was talking behind my back, and I just went back to hanging out with xiam full time, but a couple months later xiam and jinx became friends again and xiam completely replaced me with him. Around this time I became friends with the girl I dated back sophomore year, she admitted her wrong doings and we became friends again, until jinx started a rumor and it caused issues between us but later resolved, she told me that  she now won’t talk to him because what he did. Even though xiam cut me out we still talked. 

Now I’m in college, and eventually xiam cut me off completely, and my best friend started dating her. Jinx and the girl I dated became friends again and She also cut me off.

75,"I'll try to keep this as brief as I can while still giving context.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends, I'll call him P, has been having a rough time lately.  He struggles with pretty intense anxiety and it really interferes with his daily life.  About a year ago, he, another mutual friend I'll call O, and I moved to a big city together (O and P live together, I live elsewhere in the same neighborhood).  

&amp;#x200B;

Since we moved here, P has cycled through 3 different jobs, fired from each for anxiety-related reasons (missing work, anxiety-related outbursts at work, etc).  P is turning 26 soon and has been stressed about this because he needs a job for health insurance, etc.  

About 6 months back, P had a severe mental breakdown and lost his job over it; he was unable to go to work for several weeks and eventually got let go.  After several weeks of P spending all day every day crying and panicking, O and I convinced P to let us take him to the ER.  They were unable to help him and O drove P to his parents' place out of state, where P was planning on getting checked in w/ some kind of inpatient treatment.  P ended up just spending a few days at his parents and returned to living with O a few days later without getting any treatment, still very distraught.

P was unemployed for a few months and got a new job, but was recently fired again.  P is extremely upset over this which I totally understand.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another layer to this is that I lost both my boyfriend and best friend to suicide in the past 2 years, and dealing with emotionally distraught people in this capacity is really difficult for me.  I am currently in therapy for PTSD because of this.

   P is an extremely emotional person and often calls me sobbing, leaving voicemails of him crying if I don't answer.  Or he will text me that he feels hopeless or about how awful he feels.  I really want to be there for him, but this type of thing is a big trigger for me PTSD-wise, which makes me feel really guilty.   I feel like he is really in a bad place and I want to help him feel better but I don't know how to do that! I'm scared that if I set boundaries he'll take it really personally and react strongly.

79,"So I own a retail business. Rent is very expensive in my area so our physical retail business isn't that big. We have inventory and consumables squirreled all over the business. We have to order pretty frequently because we just don't have the space to store long term levels.

I don't like the clutter and I feel it looks bad (some is visible to customers) in the store, and I don't like my workspace cluttered. My home and office are very special, clutter free, and organized.

Most of the inventory is stored in the employee area and I feel like we are constantly bumping into it and it makes our workspace smaller. Staff agrees inventory everywhere looks bad to customers and it gets in our way. I also feel mentally a cluttered business detracts from my ability to do my job. When we accept deliveries they literally get dropped off in the store and me and staff are scrambling and tripping over them to get them checked in and put away while we are dealing with customers.

I'm looking at nearby space to store inventory. I don't know if I would consider it an investment. I don't think we'd make more money or save money by doing it. I can't figure out how much a space would be worth it to me. I know it would make my job of inventory management much easier and make my life less stressful. I could order months worth of items and have them on hand. I also have items we assemble in the store before we put them out for sale. I'd be able to assemble these items during slow periods weeks and months ahead of time and have them stored and ready to sell rather than having to assemble them while we're busy. We could accept deliveries there and have a staff member deal with it there rather than being a bother in the store. Another issue is because we have stuff squirreled away all over the shop stuff can't be located by staff and we might lose a sale or when we are doing inventory we might not see an item in stock or see that an item is out of stock because it's so disorganized.",24Oct2018,1

I am 20 year old full time college student that was working full-time at my old employer to make ends meet. I live alone and I commute an hour to classes four days a week. Looking at the schedule for my job, I noticed it seemed off but I put it past me. Upon walking in, my boss decided to let me go. I didn't overreact. I shook his hand, accepted his letter of termination and left with only a few tears being shed. I've never been terminated before and I always thought I was doing a great job. I slowly moved up position and at this point, I was a manager who people looked up to. Or, at least I thought. 

What do I do now? I was convinced I was doing a fine job. I learned from my mistakes and I had a great relationship with the staff. It seemed like other leaders, particularly one, was out to get me but I never let that bother me. Earlier last week, I found out that someone was spreading a rumor about me ""cursing"" out another employee. This rumor made it all the way to the boss and eventually he called people asking about it. Given, I've gotten in trouble a few times but every time was for things I didn't know about (seeing as my boss just got a new location and the store is completely different with more than the previous location). 

Another big aspect is that I absolutely LOVED my job. I loved everyone I worked with and I loved leading/managing. My parents moved away at the beginning of the summer and I opted to remain in the place I am because of the great boss I had and all the friends I worked with. 

How do I recover from this? It came as a shock. I literally stayed knowing my closest family is 4 hours away. I planned a part of my life around this. 

I've spent time with friends who are consoling me (and quitting from the same job) and I've looked for jobs but I'm kinda in shock and not sure what else I should do. 

It hurts :/",24Oct2018,1

87,"I was conceived via sperm donor and I recently took an Ancestry.com DNA test and I found my half sister. I was able to find her through her grandfather. I've messaged both of them on multiple platforms (as Facebook messenger doesn't tend to work) asking them to contact me.

88,"Hello, long time lurker, random ranter. The summary here is that I'm married but have moved around a bunch and am looking for ideas for an activity to get engaged in. Mostly for friends. I do have regular daytime job but just dont seem to connect with those guys. 

Additional pretext, if it's not obvious, I'm not a social person. Also this is Wisconsin, so it's cold here. I realize it may help to include interests. I like working with my hands and games (sports, card, board, or video).

89,"I’ll start by saying that I am a junior in high school. I take fairly high level classes that are challenging and require quite a bit of time to prepare for, that being said I also just recently got my first job which also takes up quite a bit of my time. My problem here is that last year I was a member of my school’s speech team, I did very well for a first year but now, it being a new school year- everyone is expecting me to do it again, but it takes a tremendous amount of time and I am completely unmotivated to put the time into it. I do not enjoy doing it and I feel like I need some time for myself to pursue my own aspirations. I realize that it sounds like I want to quit but I would like any advice of someone who went through something similar. Thank you for your time",24Oct2018,1
90,"how do I even start this

I started a new job a few days ago. Alls well ends well, co workers are sweethearts, I feel welcomed and even protected, I’m enjoying my daily tasks as an apparel associate; what could go wrong. 

Well, before I say the rest: I’m a goth. I shave my eyebrows. I have no eyebrows. I draw them on. I also shaved my head, out of impulse because of depression (??). I wear a black wig (it ain’t cheap). 

Literally everyone thinks I have cancer. One of my co workers, let’s call her Bean, pulled me aside and asked me if I’m okay. There’s been a rumor that spread like a wildfire that I have cancer. NO one ever came to me to ask. All the guys who work freight or warehouse look at me for an oddly long time when I walk past. I noticed that literally every lady co worker or manager treats me like I’m a baby. My main manager CONSTANTLY reassures me, asks me if I need her then just get her, if I have questions, and tells me when she’s going on lunch every single time and that if I need her she will be this place. She doesn’t do this to ANY other new associate. And I don’t look lost; I’ve done this job before, and I’m dedicated and have proved my strong work ethic in these just few days. 

A warehouse co worker pointed at my mother in laws car, when I was leaving work today after gone grocery shopping with her (my job is like a sams club). He pointed at me. And I know he was because I made eye contact with him and he watched me walk the entire way to her car. 

Am I over thinking this? Ever since Bean told me everyone is worried about me, I feel insecure as fuck and that all the attention is on me. I don’t have cancer. I’m just a fucking moron who looks like an alien boy with no makeup because I felt suicidal one night. Is my worry just amplifying what’s actually going on around me or is the stuff I’m noticing actually a thing going on

92,"I know it's immature so I don't want something like ""haha you smell"" just a little class with an underhanded ""get fucked m8"" tone. To be clear this dude stole my from me, pretended he was injured for an extra month so that I wouldn't get on his case for being dirty. He lied to my face when I asked him if he had touched my things (which he did) and he even went so far as to get so pissy about me telling him to clean, that he swept dirt and threw trash onto my carpet. Also he has no respect for anyone and not to sound like a white knight but he played this whole ""I love my girlfriend, she's the best thing that ever happened to me, we've been together through so much"" and let me tell you, this girl is invested in him, they're starting a company together, she has invested her money and literally all of her time and worked tirelessly to get it off the ground. This goes without mentioning that she has some array of illnesses landing her in the hospital once a week. While she's dealing with all this, my roommate is eating takeout every night with her money, skipping class to get high, and fucking girls off tinder. So I'm a little pissed he could be that cruel to a person. Anyways maybe some underhanded remark you may have in mind? Or maybe a devious action? I know he keeps the door to the room unlocked all the time and lost his key (maybe tell a grifter on the street) I also know where he hides his drugs (tell campus security???) Or perhaps get in contact with his girlfriend, let her know what's up. What do you think?",24Oct2018,1

I've never hurt any other animal in my life I have a beautiful pitbull and never laid a finger on her, I've had hamsters, Guinea pigs, snakes, bunnies, but never a cat before and it constantly attacks me I feel nervous around it because I feel like I'm going to kill it, I came close today and I feel awful! This is totally out of my character I don't have any mental health issues other than anxiety I've been seeing a therapist but I'm afraid to tell her what I feel about this cat. I don't want people to think I'm going to turn into a serial killer because I won't. I also don't want people to think I'm a bad person I'm really not I'm a just a good person who is doing bad things to this poor animal but I can't help it!

94,"I’ve never had a job since leaving college years ago. The only job I’ve repeatedly thought of doing is joining the army but never have.

For a few years I’ve been practicing guitar(5-10 hours a day for a few years), I was in a band that started doing well but it fell apart recently.

I don’t spend money on anything for myself, I just give my dad what he needs and end up saving.

I’m full on when I commit to something I’ve just never found anything I’d like to spend time doing that would reward the amount of effort I’d put in. Even then money doesn’t really interest me.

I have a job in which almost 90% of the people are the age of my mom. It is frustrating to the point that every time I want to make a joke, I have to tone it down, or not say anything at all. Where I live, most people are in their 30's and I've tried but nothing. All this makes me feel like there is no place for me anywhere. I cannot move, because of all the stuff I have going on here (job, child, marriage, etc.), and feel like I'm in a socially deprived hole I cannot get out of. Any advice on how to socialize?

* I showed up while the repair men were working on the place and they knew her and were taking instructions from her. 

* I saw it in person and she let me take as much time as I needed looking around. 

* She gave me her full name. 

* I looked up the property tax records and the name matches. 

* The tax record showed her current address and it matched up with the area she told me she lives in!


When I meet her to sign the lease if her ID matches what she says her name is I feel 100% confident she’s legit. 

Is there anything else I should do? Should I ask her to produce her copy of the tax records, or is that silly because I have what I need? Did I just get an apartment for an insanely good price???",24Oct2018,1

I know that he does feel love, and I do know that he is interested in me at least a little bit considering he still talks to me. We’ve been talking every single day at least once a day for 40 days straight now. Yet, any feelings he has, he pushes them away because he doesn’t want to get hurt again. This isn’t me asking how to make him fall in love with me, if he doesn’t love me then that’s how he feels and that’s fine. I’m asking how I can get him to stop pushing love out of his life when it shows up. It’s not that he doesn’t feel love, he just doesn’t want to feel love. Is there anything I can do to help change that? I don’t want to see him keep pushing it out of his life.",24Oct2018,1
103,"I recently moved from Cleveland to Atlanta and I feel like an outsider.  I don't wear makeup and was living a very minimalist lifestyle in Cleveland.  I had a car from 16 to 21 but now I do not.  I really enjoy walking everywhere and have been spending a lot of time (and money) at this place called Ponce City Market near by.  I don't have any friends here so I probably look like a weirdo sitting alone there but its nice to just go out and see other people having fun.  I have spent $600 this month buying clothes there, trying to look like I fit in.  I don't have a job and have also used the shopping opportunities to get applications to stores I like there.  Today things got weird and made me feel down.  A security guard followed me around and they seemed to be radioing each other about me.  I'm a 22 year old blonde (no makeup) and purposely bring the smallest purse possible so they don't think I'm stealing.  I don't know what to do I feel like I look like such of an outsider that they don't want me there.  The anxiety about it is just compounding like one of them always looked at me weird and it escalated into me feeling uncomfortable in front of all of them.   I'm scared of guns and generally bad at eye contact so that may have made them think I'm like a suspicious person.  Am I paranoid?  What should I do?  I potentially want to work at this shopping center.

I have no motivation or passion for anything at the school and I'm currently failing my classes. I find myself enjoying the time I spend working much more than the time I spend at school, the problem is the job is minimum wage not full time, I still live with my parents and they will be supportive of whatever I chose but I feel if I drop out there isn't much future for me. I don't see the point in paying for school and forcing myself to go to something I hate, working minimum wage with no real plans for the future is not ideal for economic reasons, but I know I will be happier at least in the short term. There is always the possibility of returning to school at a later date once I find some passion in life.

105,"My friends have noticed this for the past two years. I used to smoke weed a lot in high school (basically spent 3 years of my life high 24/7) so that might have contributed to the problem. I'm not sure if I'm just really an asshole deep down and don't care about anything they say, or if I have an attention span problem and just space out all the time, but whenever we talk I legitimately like hearing them vent about their problems and stuff. I respond accordingly and give them advice. It's just that if they bring up x thing they said x days ago I have no recollection whatsoever of what they're talking about. We usually joke about me having amnesia but I am legitimately concerned and wonder if there's something wrong with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's interesting though because I find that I tend to remember written conversations a lot better than oral ones. This happens in school as well - whenever I have a class, I have to write things down or else I forget them. If I don't study while writing by hand I can't remember absolutely anything unless I repeat it until the point of exhaustion. It's super weird and I've looked into auditory memory problems, but I really have no way of knowing if this is something real or even if I suffer from it since I'm not an expert.

I sometimes bring this up with my shrink but he doesn't think it's important.

I've read about people having the 'forget-everything' response after a traumatic event, but in all honesty my life has been very good so far and the biggest problems I've ever faced were having friends turn on me, become isolated or be bullied in middle school. Other than that there is really nothing that could trigger this sort of response. This has been eating at me for a while now, and I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. ",24Oct2018,1

107,"Sooo I have been wanting to study abroad for a pretty long time and I was always planning for it to be the fall or spring of the year I'm currently in (sophomore) because there's so much flexibility this time in college since you don't necessarily have to take all major specific courses. Clearly I didn't go this semester, so for a few months I've been planning to go in the spring, but heres an issue. My older sister and I are really close and she met a guy over the summer and took us all by surprise when she said they're planning their wedding for next June. I was shocked because it's not a really long time to know someone. Nonetheless, this post isn't about her decision to get married so soon but about my decision to leave. In all honesty, a huge reason I want to study abroad is because I desperately need a change. My mental health and social life are so shitty and I want the opportunity to study abroad to get out from my rut. I could definitely go my junior year, but something inside me wants to go now because who knows what might happen my junior year. I could not even be alive by that time lmao. It just kills me that I would be missing my last few months I have with my sister (she's moving states after the wedding). I know the timing to leave and live somewhere for a few months might never be right, but something feels wrong about it now. I'm incredibly sad that things are going to be changing and I won't ever really get to spend time with my sister like I have the chance to now. I will also be gone for a portion of the wedding planning, which I would love to help with. I know that some of you may think that it sounds like I want to stay home but in all honesty I really don't know what I want to do. If I don't take the chance to go abroad now, I don't know if i can go later because what if even worse circumstances arise. I am still waiting to hear back on a scholarship and if I don't get it, i'm definitely not going but if I do get it I'm gonna be torn about this. What do you think? What would you do?",24Oct2018,1

114,"Long story so I'm doing my best to summarise... I'm a young buck, 18... turning 19 in a month. I've been with my GF for 2 years, I know her from high school, we graduated last year. Since then I got a full time job (starting after school) and we are both at uni, I moved in to her house, which was fine with her mother (her dad is out of the picture). The reason for moving in was that we both knew that me getting the full time job would mean we'd see each other alot less, and with uni, I'd be wanting to study most weekends. It was sensible, we where mature about it, and had house sat a few times together previously for a week or two each time. We are compatable to live together.

If I look back 12 months to school, we'd walk home to her house and root before her neice got home from primary school. We'd do that most days of the week, I was living the life. Today, living together since January, it's nothing like that...

We still love each other very much but that chemistry has died out, and I don't feel excited to the fact that I'm going to see her when I get home. I spend a day or two most weekends at my family home and ocassionaly a day or two in the week.

Flash back to the start of my last year of school (year 12, I'm an Aussie) I'd been dating my GF for a few months and made friends with a girl in a couple of my classes, lets call her Anita. Anita and I just got along perfectly, never getting our work done ontime cause we where just joking around like kids, it was pretty flirty sometimes, from both her and I. My GF was in one class with me and Anita. So, my GF saw we got along and didn't approve of it. I kept sitting between my GF and Anita cause she was my friend and I loled sitting with my GF too... Anita and I ended up becoming really close, Anita has helped me with personal issues I've had with my GF and famoly and is still a close friend today...

I'm so fucking attracted to Anita, have been since I met her. I think she's intrigued by me and there is definatletly oppurtunity if you're picking up what I'm putting down. I'm not one of the guys who'd thrash and dash, if anything, I'd want an intimate relationship with Anita. That being said, I'm loyal to my GF and would never screw her over, she is my priority. Anita and I have never met up or gone out, excluding social events like school parties and what not. So no dates or anything like that.
At the end of year 12, the results came out and there was a big party. I got pissed, my dad had to carry me out to the party to the car at 1:30am because I'd passed out from having to much grog. Earlier that night I'd tried to kiss Anita... I was really really drunk. I don't feel bad that I tried, I just regret getting that drunk. Anita wasn't fussed about it, I appolagised the next day when I was sober and all was good. My GF still doesn't know to this day, I don't think she has to know or that I have a duty to tell her as I was literally so drunk I passed out at the party.

Here I am now. I'm talking to Anita still (snapchat and messenger sometimes) and living with my GF most days, so I have to hide it when I snapchat her Anita or whatever (I'm not one of those look at my dick kids, nudes are skanky). I had a small party when my parents went on a holliday, my GF didn't want to go cause she doesn't like parties or drinking which is fair enough, I never pressured her into coming. I hadn't seen many of my mates for about 5 months cause I'd been so busy with work, uni and my GF.

My GF nearly broke up with me because I invited Anita... I know that's not right and she shouldn't do that, but I just wanted to catch up with everyone and have some fun. Anita came, I told her that my GF was upset that I invited her (we still talk about that precious stuff) and she was really helpful. The party was fun and it was a good gathering. I made it up to my GF, it took me a week before she'd be happy to talk to me, then I tried to talk about inviting Anita and she just forgot it happened and moved on like nothing happened. I tried to bring it up and she refused to talk about it so I left it.

This is relevant cause my birthday is next month. I'd like them both to come to my party but if Anita comes I may lose my GF.

Should I not invite Anita and just take her out for lunch oneday or catch up, or do I invite her, wait til my GF blows up and dump her??? Savage I know, but I need an excuse to get out of this relationship soon, my attraction to Anita isn't deminishing...

117,"I am a 22 Greek F studying international relations since 2014. Fyi Greek universities don't have a time limitation/deadline to finish, but the studies usually last 4 years (as does mine). Therefore you can assume that I have now supposedly finished the course and I have some resittings to take and I will get a degree. But that's not the case. After the 1st year I stopped attending classes and taking exams altogether. There are 64 modules in total (8 per semester) and now entering my 5th year, I have only passed 16 of them. 
When I stopped attending classes I got involved in theatre aaand depression. Got through some difficult times as I prepared to audition for drama schools which I failed and sunk back into severe depression for 6 good months of not stepping outside and smoking huge amounts of bad weed. I managed to slowly make some baby steps by getting a job as a sales assistant and preparing an application for History Of Art to British universities, which I never sent even thought I was motivated by an admissions manager that I had a chat with.
Anyways as you can imagine the pressure from my family to finish this degree is real. Apparently is the only way I will achieve something in my life. But everytime I try to study - and I did the last semester- I hate it even more. When I asked for this university I had no idea what I was doing or what I liked. I only thought it would help me change the world but I've found out that it will just make me a part of the systemic narrative.  Oh well. Maybe I am too much if an idealist. But I can't suppress my artistic side. 
I promised myself that I will attend lectures this semester - they started a month ago. But instead am taking an online fashion history course and I'm making sets on polyvore. I also plan to take on a sewing class. 
And when I go to bed I get filled with compunction and I toss and turn and have wierd dreams. Or I stay up all night and post about it on reddit. 
Is it worth to finish this fuckery of a boring and crazily annoying degree just to prove that I did it? To convince myself that I can accomplish it and also shut everyone else up? 
I feel like I had a chance to drop it but I got very depressed when I failed-never actually got out of it, it was just a 3 month break in perspective, trying to grasp on something.
I'm also feeling lile an ungrateful lil bitch to my parents that support me do shit.

Since I've moved in it has been literal hell. She refused to move the massive amount of expired food from the cupboards so that I could put my stuff there,  so I moved it.

Also the food I had set on a shelf that was apparently hers was thrown on the floor when I got home. 

She REFUSES to talk to me in person. After about a month I contacted her for the first time via email (wtf?)
Most of the emails I send to her get ignored. Yet she sends me a small book every so often demanding that I clean something or accusing me of using/breaking her things.

All she wants to do is argue. Any time I try to settle a problem she brings something else up. Any time I ask her to contribute she says no and then accuses me of not pulling my weight.

Any. Little. Thing. That happens I hear about it

122,"Idk there was this girl I liked for a long time. I add her on SC, she adds me back. She added me on FB too yesterday so idk what’s up. She lokey knows I like her too, and by that I mean she does.

Thing is, whenever I message her on SC she takes a long time to respond, like 12-24 hrs on average. At first I thought she was just busy. Then I notice she was liking posts on Insta hrs after I sent the message. Same applies for her SC score which went up. She’s literally using Snapchat, but not opening what i send. 

Best part. Today, I send her something at noon, and she has yet to reply to it, but she liked me updating my profile pic on FB.  Like, there is no way in hell she doesn’t know about this. She’s done this before with my story but she like replied right after so idk whether or not to count that.

I just don’t get it though. If she was ghosting me, why would she do that last part. She knows I’d notice. Maybe she wants me to get the hint idk, but like that is a huge dick move, and out of character (yes, I know her enough irl  to say that at least). 

How should I go about this. What does this even mean. Is she playing games w me? Blatantly ignoring me to get me to get some hint? If so, what should I do about it?",24Oct2018,1
123,"Hi. My name's Tammy. 
Throughout my life I've gone through multiple types of emotional trauma. Severe confusion, deliberate manipulation, and being scared for my and others life many times. I went through many narcissists throughout all my friendships, and recently got out of a relationship with the most horrific psychopath you can imagine. Mind games, delusional mind games, manipulation, gaslighting, planting ideas, setting up traps, borderline sexual assault, emotional abuse, mental abuse, you name it. 
I left my friendships and relationships and home traumas scarred. I am now afraid of everyone and everything. I can't trust anyone and am on constant vigilance.
Last week, my therapist told me something that made me upset. She said, ""when you feel this way, practice visualization. Visualize yourself at the beach."" 
She's never said anything like that, and it makes me feel like she's given up on me. I'm always paranoid, afraid of sex trafficking and kidnapping, I think everyone lies, cars are following me, people are trying to hurt me etc. I take a low dose anxiolytic for anxiety.
Are some people unfixable? Does therapy only help to a certain degree of mental illness? Is there anything I can do to help myself? Please help. I don't know what to do and I feel stuck, exhausted, and scared. 

Thank you.

TL/DR 
My life has been extremely traumatic and resulting paranoia is ruining my life. Think my therapist gave up. Are some people unfixable? Any advice?",24Oct2018,1
124,"All right, before you say anything. Yes I'm shit for saying this about my sister but I really need some help. Anyway, I'm 16 years old and as you saw by the title, my 11 year old sister has ADHD. It drives me insane regularly. The things she normally do drive me insane and makes me angry most of the time. She pees on the bed, jumps and runs around all the time, screams and speaks gibberish, and sometimes just being a brat. I barely get a moment's peace with her so I try to stay away from her as possible. My parents try to get me close with her but even if I try my hardest, I just can't bring myself to be close to her. I tried to but I just can't. Also, I just don't seem to love her. At all. And it scares me because my parents expect that after I finish school, I will take care of her. I wouldn't really care if she disappeared and never came back, and I just think of her a a waste of space in the house. Of course I don't tell anyone about this. I'm also jealous of my cousins and friends who have normal relationships with their siblings as I would really love to experience that. 
So right now I've basically given up. I'm just staying in my room all day to avoid her. And yes I am a piece of shit brother who deserves to die for thinking about this, but I tried okay. I've tried anything just to make me love her but I can't change it, and I'm pretty sure I don't want it to.",24Oct2018,1
126,"I’m a senior in college. About two months ago I moved into an apartment with a friend I know pretty well. When we were searching for apartments I asked her if it would be ok to look for a cat friendly apartment as I wanted to bring my cat. She said that was fine. We ended up renting a place that is a little pricier than I’m used to, but I figured I get to live with my friend and my cat so it should be worth it. 

About a few weeks ago I noticed my roommate was getting pretty grouchy. This wasn’t really surprising as the semester is getting more difficult and we’re all stressed. My cat would start to run away from her and hide when she came home. Which was kinda strange but I figured he could just sense her negative energy(idk cats are weird) and didn’t really think too much into it. This weekend I had a friend stay over. She was visiting from out of town. Saturday I was out with my friend when I get a text from my roommate that says “your cat pooped on the counter” and then another that says “he needs to go”. I was pretty shocked by it. We hadn’t had any problems at all with the cat in the apartment. And he’d never done anything so extreme in the past (he’s 6 years old). But it wasn’t totally impossible....

I got home shortly after to check it out and maybe talk to the roommate, but she had left and there wasn’t anything on the counter. The whole thing seemed kinda off to me. I expected it to smell when I walked in, either of cat shit or cleaning product but it didn’t. My roommate had moved a few things off the kitchen counter but not everything, and the counter didn’t look like it had been wiped down or cleaned. And of course no shit. 

I had been talking to my friend, who also has a cat, and she agreed that pooping on the counter seemed really extreme. We’d speculated that maybe the roommate was confused and the cat either threw up or had a hair ball. Which would still be weird for him to do, but seemed more plausible. I, being a crazy cat Mom, decided to look in the trash to see if she disposed of it in there. If it was in there, I could figure out exactly what was wrong with my cat. There were a few paper towels that I thought were from the incident. I opened them up but they weren’t dirty. Strange. But still I figured she wasn’t lying. Maybe what he did was too small to cause a big mess that required the counter to be cleaned? Maybe she flushed the shit down the toilet? Idk. 

To make it even weirder, my friend, who was staying over, said she saw my roommate get angry at the cat Saturday morning and give him a little kick. She said it wasn’t a hard kick but she was surprised my roommate would do something in front of a total stranger.

Not wanting to get rid of the cat before I got to the bottom of things, I decided to call her Sunday.  Initially, she did not seem to want to talk to me about it. All I had heard from her that weekend were the two texts. I convinced her to call me (She was on campus I was in the apartment) so we could talk about it. I just started the conversation with “tell me what happened yesterday”. She seems confused, responds “I don’t know. Your cat got on the counter and pooped”. And I’m like okay... but what else.... like where were you? How did you discover it? Stuff like that. Response “I don’t know. he pooped. I cleaned it up.” Ok, I tried the same sort of questions again. Response: “I don’t know. I don’t know. I just don’t like the cat being there anyway.” Along those lines.

Of course, it dissolved into an argument where I blatantly told her it was hard to believe her story if she couldn’t give me any details. She told me to check the trash if I didn’t believe her. Of course, I had checked the trash already...

I ultimately decided to take the cat home to my parent’s house as we couldn’t resolve the conflict and I didn’t want it to get worse. But now I’m almost convinced she’s lying about the whole thing. 

What should I do moving forward? I’m so sad and hurt by this. I loved having that cat around and she knew it. I’d tell her all the time how happy I was that I could bring him to school. I also thought she was a friend. I have the option of subletting my apartment next semester and moving out. What should I do?",24Oct2018,1

129,"Six months ago, I got hired from the hospitality business for my first sales job in a completely new market (Asia). The company is quite small (5 sales people) and we import &amp; distribute wine. From the beginning, I've been trying my best to build a good relationship with my manager and really show the team that I'm willing to hustle regardless of having zero contacts and not knowing the market at all. I've managed to build up a solid customer base during this time, but there is still tons of room for improvement.

What bothers me specifically is that I have no target, nor did I receive specific training. I was thrown into the job to swim alone and even though I tried to connect with my colleagues and learn a few of their skills, they've remained pretty closed down. I spoke to my manager several times about the targets and additional advice, but every time he tells me to ""just keep doing what I'm doing, the targets will come in due time"". I'm getting really paranoid as I don't feel that I'm contributing as much as the rest of the team, my numbers are significantly lower and nobody has given me any feedback on my performance since the day I started (except the owner, who gave me a tap on the back a few times for some restaurants I got in).

I spend a ton of time on the internet, its really hard for me to do anything. One of the main things i do is try to run a sports team group. Ive done this for 8 years and over the years ive had everyone turn fake on me except a couple people maybe. Ive been really talked about in a bad way,and women dont think im attractive either and i have trued for women online too and its caused problems with my sports group.

So ive been trying to invite whoever i can into my group and majority of them will join after i send people the link on my sports teams fb pages. But my group has the same 10 people id say that will talk here and there. People just dont get into it.

So what gets in my way is im more focused on this group then my life,and my life is bad and i need to worry about my life more. And get stuff done. But if i not show up every day in my group and look up material to post, the members will dissapear probably more and more. Theyll say the group sucks and leave. So i want to continue the group but i dont want to spend all my time on it. And i cant really find any admins i can trust that will not run people off,or get the big head and think its their group more then mine. So what would you do in my situation. It sounds stupid but seriously its a big problem for me in my life.

136,"On my way home from school today, I was crossing an intersection and I didn't see the car coming at me, he slammed on the breaks, honked his horn and called me something (couldn't quite hear him.) I kept driving and flipped him off. Well he flipped shit, followed me, so I went down a random street that happened to be a dead end. He sped cut me off and was yelling at me. (I still couldn't understand him.) He motioned for me to get out of the car, which I did with a can of febreeze and a knife hidden in my hoodie (just in case some shit went down.) He was an overweight middle aged redneck with a very southern accent. He walked over to me, shoved me back, got in my face and said ""You really gonna throw that finger up at me you fucking faggot? What are you gonna do? Huh? Nothing. You fucking pussy. You're a goddamn pussy you fucking faggot."" He shoved me again, called me a pussy and got back in his car.

137,"The current teacher I have is a substitute who's new to the school (permanently.. just a new teacher I guess at this point) since the one we had before was retiring due to personal issues. We recently took a midterm for the class, and I missed the day that we took the test so I scheduled to take it a few days later in the library, all she had to do was give the test to the librarians and I'd take it after school. 

I talked to a few of my friends about the test, and they said something along the lines of ""it was pretty easy, all multiple choice. I got a 90%"" or something along those lines. I know I'm not supposed to be talking about the test with others before taking it, but I wasn't asking for answers, only how hard they thought it was. (I get nervous for tests a lot). I immediately noticed there wasn't a single multiple choice on the test I was given, so I panicked. Turns out my teacher gave the librarians the ""retake"" of the test. I don't know if she was told this or not, but she's using our past teacher's tests and our past teacher told us he intentionally made retakes hard because you had to prove to him you were ready to retake through lots of homework + you got to know what to study for (since you had taken and most likely failed the previous test). I can vouch for this because I've retaken a test before and the difficulty difference was insane. If I hadn't had the chance to know what to really focus on when studying I would have most likely done much worse than I had.

I sent my teacher an email that went something like this, 

""Hello Mrs. Y! I would like to preface this by saying thank you for helping me out by finding a good time to take the test, I appreciate it.

I would also like to say that I am not trying to imply that I don't deserve the grade I will get. I acknowledge that I could have studied a lot harder, yaddayaddayadda.

However, I think there might be an issue. The test you gave me to take after school was the ""retake"" version of the Midterm, (and then here I explain to her that our previous teacher intentionally made these a lot more difficult due to all his requirements to retake).

As a summary, I want to put emphasis on the fact that I'm completely fine with the grade I get on this test. However, I just wanted to ask if you intentionally are giving the ""retake"" version of the test to kids who missed the test dates, because if that's the case then I'll definitely know not to miss any of the dates of the test in the future because I wouldn't want to take a more difficult test.""

This isn't word for word, but it's pretty much what I sent my teacher. I don't know.. I was coming off the backhand of taking the test and I was extremely panicked because this is one of my harder classes and I worked really hard to get a comfortable grade in the class, but I could just tell I did doodoo on this Midterm. I didn't want it to sound like I'm trying to talk down to the teacher, or tell her I don't deserve the grade I'm going to get, but reading it afterwards it really sounds like I am in my opinion. The email is already sent so I can't retract it, so I'm asking for advice on what I should do. 

I won't be seeing her tomorrow as I don't have her class tomorrow, but I could email her or try to stop by before school to talk to her if that's the best course of action.

**TL;DR: I sent a panicked email to my teacher after making up a test I had missed the date of, asking if she understood the test she gave me was intentionally harder than the actual one due to it being a ""retake"" although I never took the actual test. I didn't want to come off as a ""iamverysmart"" student or an asshole but I feel like I am in the email. What should I do?",24Oct2018,1
139,"One of my biggest failings as a person is buying into the belief that there is a right and wrong answer for everything. I see right and wrong as two sides of a coin, life being a constant string of flips and trying to catch as many rights as possible.

Whenever I hear people say that they simply let things go without processing their moral implications, my brain basically shuts down. How is that possible? If you don’t have rights and wrongs, if you simply live your life as you want, then what’s the point? Everything simply becomes a series of grey points, some lighter or darker but pretty much all muddled together. Just thinking of that makes my head hurt. I need some order in my life.

140,"I was gonna make a new account for all my illness stuff but #$%&amp; it. I don't have the energy for that.

Over the past 3 months, an issue that started as me just being really #$%&amp;ing tired all the time progressed to me becoming very seriously ill.

**I can hardly leave the bed and I only leave the house when it is absolutely necessary.** When I do go out, I'm usually completely wiped out when I return home and am even weaker, sicker and more tired than usual. I'll have to rest for days just to be able to return to the (piss poor) level of function I had before.

I'm extremely sensitive to light and noise, especially and absolutely when they are combined. As such, I tend to sleep through the day and am only awake during the later evening and night.

**Because I am awake during the later evening, I can attend the nightly family dinner almost 100% of the time.** But...no other meals happen at night.

**I got around this by using the microwave and microwaving food at night.** I had lots of healthy foods that I was able to just toss on a plate and microwave without much thought, energy or prep involved. (The people I live with are surprisingly noise tolerant. Well, at least they are upstairs, where I sleep.)

**However, the upstairs microwave is now broken.**

There is a microwave downstairs. But, long story short, I can't use it. I'd wake up those sleeping downstairs at night, and my Brother sleeps downstairs. And he's not afraid to punish me for crossing him. Not physically just...he does things that make being ill like this even worse, like dumping my belongings all over my bed so I can't sleep on it when I need rest.

**As it is right now, I've been whittled down to only one meal a day. Not bad, right? But not ideal either.** The less I eat the more ill I get. The more ill I get the longer it'll take to recover from...whatever it is that's wrong with me.

**To Recap/TL;DR:** I'm seriously ill! I'm only awake at night! The microwave is broken! I can't prepare myself food that requires any more than 3 steps, 5 at most! And I need to eat to maintain homeostasis!

Some things about my background,  I'm around male around 30 years old, hold a steady job, make a solid 6 figure income, in good shape, wear nice clothes.  I'm in a management position so it's not unusual for me to talk in front of hundreds of people, most people I've met tend to describe me as ""nice"" and ""smart"".  I did date back in college, but after heartbreak after heartbreak it burnt me out and I just stopped for a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

When I decided to give it a shot again, I worked such long hours and never really naturally ended up anywhere I would meet any women, I tried all the dating sites for years, I always tried to be honest, and follow all the advice given on how to properly form a profile (multiple pictures, etc).  Most women I contacted never responded at all or stopped after a few messages (pretty normal I'd gather) and the others fell into very few categories.  Moms with children pretty much looking for a new ""dad"",  or that want kids desperately and feel they can change my mind. (I'd pretty clearly marked that I wasn't interested in children now or ever), or the desperate women who try to pretend to match what you're looking for.  After a few years of this I was so sick of it I closed every account I had, and in the end all that I got out of any of them was a few hundred dollars a year less in my pocket, so I took another break.

Fast forward to today, I really want to try again, I've been lonely for a really really long time now, but have absolutely no idea how to meet women at my age.  I know my job doesn't help as it's in a very male dominated industry, so there's practically no chance for me to meet anyone new that way, and honestly this is one of many factors that's pressing me closer to quitting outright.   I know this seems simple to most people but It's something that's baffled me for years now, I had no problem when I was young because college itself was a pretty natural meeting place and the classes acted as a pretty natural filter for people of similar interests, post-college there's just nowhere like that anymore.

I recently started college and am making a lot of friends, which is great. I have gotten especially close with another girl who I really like, we get along and I feel like I’m making a real connection with her.
However, she has horrible body odor. When I first met her, I really couldn’t tell. We were always in a public setting or something like that. But as I started spending more one on one time with her I realized she had really bad smell. It’s not just sometimes, it’s all the time. It’s in her dorm room as well. If we go somewhere in my car, it will smell for a day or two after. I know she showers, we just went grocery shopping and she bought body wash. She keeps her clothing clean. I am not sure if she uses deodorant or not, but I’m guessing no considering. 

My main issue with telling her is that she is fairly overweight. I’m worried that me pointing her body odor out to  her will only make her upset and angry, like I am trying to hurt her feelings. If someone were to tell me that, I would feel so exposed, embarrassed and sad. But it’s gotten to a point where it’s hard to be in public with her or introduce her to new people. Also, the more time I spend with her the more I feel like I’m smelling like it. How could I tell her in a way that doesn’t sound like I’m trying to be condescending or hurtful? ",24Oct2018,1
152,"My husband generally drinks with his friends 4 or 5 times a week. Sometimes excessively, sometimes not. For example tonight, he is already too drunk to drive home and its not even that late.. He has to stay the night at his friends house now and won't be coming home until the morning. I personally find it strange to drink quite frequently as we are both college students and have responsibilities. Im not saying his drinking is interfeering with his school, but he is failing almost every class. This, however, could also be due to his ADHD. I get very frustrated because he goes to hang out with his friends and has a few drinks and I am sitting at home like a loser. Am I overreacting? Do I feel this way because I, myself don't have much of a social life? I have been there and done that I guess. I do not want to waste anymore  time with things that seem so unnecessary. I really don't mind him hanging out with his friends but does there always have to be alcohol? I just don't get it. Also it would not bother me nearly as much if he was doing better in school. He always tells me he knows what he is doing. Clearly not if he is failing classes. Im not really sure how to handle this situation.",24Oct2018,1

He once made Time orgasm

He has literally heard time talking to him while doing whippets, it I unclesr whether this has happened to him sober.

He thinks his muscle spasms and twitching (a sign of B12 deficiency from his whippet use) is Time communicating with him

He also thinks Time communicates with him though music (all the time, not just on drugs)

156,"I recently ended a 6 year relationship. I was the one who got dumped. It was only 3 and a half weeks ago. I have been going through a hard time but I’ve generally taken the breakup pretty well so far.

At a Halloween party last Friday, I was dancing with a guy from our school (we’re law students) and I randomly started thinking about how I would rather be with my ex boyfriend. The guy asked if I wanted to go home with him, and I said no and excused myself to go cry. I was a little bit drunk and disoriented. 

Unbeknownst to me at the time, best friend then took selfies of herself with me crying. When she sent me the pictures the next day I was shocked and upset. I looked awful in the pictures, obviously very much in pain, trying to wipe away my tears. I was embarrassed that I looked so ugly and stupid in the picture (it was a Halloween party so I was dressed in a costume). It looked like I was just so drunk that I was crying, but I was crying for a reason! I told her the reason too! I was crying because I was just so struck with the reality that my ex is gone and I’m single and that I don’t like being single. She was smiling in the pictures. She thought it was funny that she’d taken them. 

I told her to please delete them. I said that it was mean. She just said “sorry I was drunk.” So I tried to just move on from that incident. 

After I was done crying at that party, I started to feel better. I had another drink and was more drunk than before. I eventually started dancing with the guy again. Then at some point I went back to check on my friends. I told them “I’m going to kiss him! Maybe it’ll make me feel better!” I didn’t mean I was going to just walk up to him and stick my tongue down his throat! I would have initiated the kiss but not forcefully. I was going to try to let it happen naturally. 

My friend then forcefully grabbed me, causing me to drop my phone and wallet and basically put me in a chokehold! I was frustrated that she’d do that! I didn’t like being restrained that way. I let it go.

Today the guy I was dancing with texted me and was being sweet. I told her and said “Aww you should have let me kiss him!” Then she said “I thought I was helping you by stopping you. Plus that’s technically assault.” 

I replied saying I wouldn’t have just gone up to him and forcefully kissed him. I said I was sure he wouldn’t mind since we were dancing and he’d wanted to take me home. 

Her reply was “what if a guy rapes a girl and says it’s okay because she wanted to go home with him earlier.” I said “that’s not the same thing. I wouldn’t have raped him! And I wouldn’t have forced him to kiss me!”

She said “I know I’m just giving you a hard time.”

Then I said “why?” She didn’t reply so I launched into a text saying that while I know she struggled with a breakup the past year, I was still struggling with my own. I said ending a 6 year relationship is harder (I should not have said this but she always brings her relationships and her breakup into it to compare it. Her longest relationship was only 1 year). I said that my ego is bruised from being dumped and that I’m probably much more sensitive than she was going through her own breakup. I said that I needed her to take it easy. I said that the pictures of me crying and now this comparing me to a rapist hurt me.

I should not have brought up her relationship or breakup and compared it to mine! I regret that. I said it because I thought she’d say “I wasn’t as sensitive as you during my own breakup.” That was a shitty thing for me to do though, regardless of the reason. 

She has not replied. Did I just ruin our friendship?

How should I make things right?

TL;DR: I’ve been going through a breakup. My friend took pictures of me crying and then said other mean things later that week. I told her I’m sensitive right now from the breakup and to take it easy. Now I think she’s mad at me.",24Oct2018,1

The only problem is, he asks too much personal questions and I'm not even that close with him to share my secrets. There was a time when he was pushing me to confess about something. I didn't answer him, instead I asked him why was he asking about it. He said something along the lines of, ""just for fun"" and ""curiosity."" He keeps trying to get information out of me just so he can humiliate me in front of others. He's done this before and for different reasons. He calls my name out that I'm this and that, tattling about how much of a loser I am. I don't understand why he's like that, and he makes me extremely uncomfortable whenever he's around. I have anxiety and when he just subtly hint that I'm like this or like that, I would just want to curl up and die. I can't deny his accusations, maybe because of my poor self-esteem, and I'm still working on that confidence part. He's an asshole and he knows it, probably even proud it.

I think the guy thought I was still working and keeping it undercover like what my managers did to see if he was clearly stealing , and he was and has been for the past year, I just wanted him to finally get caught so I had let my managers know prior to the incident and they kept watch until they were being called to help out with the store. So he started to panic because i don't think he's ever been caught. And he normally steals bikes , electronics , tools , and clothes and etc.... And I knew whose been trespassed before and he wasn't in it. He was already known to be aggressive but I just waited again for a friend while watching him to waste time and he was mouthing""FUCK FUCK FUCK and having a conversation with himself because he was getting upset and furious I wasn't moving so he circled around and was approaching me in a threatening stance with his cart near him and ""his backpack"" , but i had gotten my pepper spray out and hid it in my bag in case he was going to touch or hurt me in any way but I got the phone and paged the manager that was free and he got scared and said "" Oh my girlfriend is waiting for me"" and prior he said it was his backpack but he had left it so when the manager got up she got the back and got a picture of all the shit that was inside. And let me tell you he had clothing , a drone , a vintage car toy , a surveillance cameras , an axe clearly on top of it all and some other junk like tools all hidden in pockets and the cart. He never payed for anything and left very very angry. And I know that some of the employees have gotten a knife pulled , ran over and attacked by shoplifters and such so I'm wondering if I could report the store lead for risking everyones lives....?

So yeah, I'm worried. I don't wanna be ""overbearing"" but I am confused. We only decided to be officially together, labeling our relationship, a couple weeks ago. He told me specifically, you don't ever need to worry, I like you and just want to talk to you...like, idk, just before we stopped talking. 

Some more context for why I should be worried: he has a lot of issues, or did in the past, and owes his parents money for those issues. I worry that he got back into hard drugs; or maybe he was arrested. Or maybe they took his phone away, as he currently lives with his parents. My mind just goes there sometimes. 

I don't know if I am just being ghosted or whatever, it seems out of nowhere judging from our interactions, how people close to me perceive him, etc. I don't want to ""move on""...I know there are plenty of fish, guys flirt with me at work every day but I genuinely like him. I just want it to be okay.

168,"I’m a 23 year old who has recently wanted to get into a relationship. I’ve dated around and had my fun, but it’s time for me to seriously start thinking about finding somebody to keep around, but there’s always the same reoccurring problem I have when I want to get serious with somebody: they are always more emotionally invested in me than I am in them.

For example: I just started seeing someone exclusively about a week ago (mind you this is a long distance relationship). We had our first date a week and a half ago and started dating exclusively last week so we rushed things a bit. This person is always checking up on me, asking me to send pics of myself (which I haven’t been doing because I’m not comfortable with that), and asking me to visit even though this person lives over 4 hours away. With my busy schedule, it isn’t ideal for me to visit as much as this person wants me to. They’re also very open with telling me all the deep feelings they have for me. This stresses out because I feel pressured to reciprocate those same feelings because I don’t want to hurt this person, but that would be lying because I don’t feel as strongly about this person as this person feels about me. This is really stressing me out.

So you could say I am asking two questions: what would you have me do when it comes to this person I am currently seeing? Should I try to find somebody else and explicitly tell them I value my space before we start to date exclusively? Should I be honest with this person I am currently dating and tell them I need some space? 

And my second question is is it the type of people I am dating that is the problem (being more emotionally invested than me), or could it be that I don’t quite know the amount of emotional attention I should give in a relationship and it’s me that needs to change?

With being in school, working, volunteering, and being apart of multiple clubs, this dilemma doesn’t help my mental health. I’m open to any suggestions.

169,"So for a bit of back story I’ve had the worst luck when it come to renting, frankly even the shiftiest shithole of a place aside from apartments and the like I’ve been rejected from constantly without rhyme or reason, I don’t go for apartments or the like because I live in a fairly small town, I have a dog and I prefer my privacy but every step of the way even the most run down slum houses that have obviously (considering the sweet burned plastic smell) been used as crack houses and more before I’ve been rejected from despite nothing being wrong aside from it just being myself on an application for a house that I probably shouldn’t be trying to pay for. 

So with that out of the way let’s go with backstory, I was at the end of my rope and quite literally about to be homeless with a full time job, had exhausted my friends and family and I was out of options, found a place privately rented and went for it, the place was overpriced and advertised falsely since the landlord considered a barely attached study as a fourth and I’m their paying a massive rent for a barely maintained place. 
This place goes up for sale, the landlord is dying hard and like the rest of his places goes up for a pretty small sum, around 200k two years pass and oh so surprisingly no one is interested. 

My question is,considering this is an old plot where a good amount of space is available and the land is so stupidly cheap, not to mention mortgage repayments are over a hundred dollars less a week  then the rent I pay, would you try to either get a home loan or force a rent to own policy with your landlord knowing that the equity on a place like this can be quadrupled within a few years or just find a place that better suits your needs already?",24Oct2018,1

173,"So some background. I am 18 years old and my brother is 23. My brother got an apartment for himself about a year ago. When I was 17, I dropped out of school because of reasons with my mom. My brother let me live with him because my mom was moving to a different state and I didn't have anywhere to go. I lived with my brother for a while then he got me a job when I turned 18. I made some money and spent it on things that I wanted and sometimes helped him pay bills.

He never forced me to pay bills or get my own apartment or anything. He was pretty chill on letting me live there. We talked about getting a 2 bed room apartment but the timing was off so he decided to just renew his lease about 6 months ago. His lease ends in November and he decided to just let it auto renew again. Well the office just told him that they will not renew his lease because he violated his lease.  They didn't specify what he did to violate the lease or they did and he didn't tell me. I didn't read the letter they sent him. But now he's getting kicked out because I was living with him when his lease was only for a 1 bed room. I just feel so horrible. I dont know what to do.

I feel extremely burned out and I can't seem to keep motivation for my classes and homework as well as finding it difficult to become involved on my campus and find friends. I suspect I may also be dealing with some depression and anxiety too, which I think may be impacting my ability to concentrate and retain information in classes.

Him and I hit it off right away, talking about Super Smash Brothers. Him and I were huge fans of it and we basically saw each other every weekend. It was amazing, this guy made me feel more open than anyone in the past few years.

Fast forward to a month later, which we had finished up a date. He kissed me on the lips, which I was head over heels in love with. So I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend. He told me he didn't want one right now because he was focusing on himself. He also had a rough previous relationship, similar to mine (both our exes cheated on us). 

So we kept hanging out as friends, seeing each other on the regular. After a few more times of kissing, he told me he didn't want to anymore because he didn't want to get me excited.

After a few days passed I told him via text how I felt. He said he didn't have the same feelings as i did. So we kept being friends.

Fast forward to June, and him and I finished up a SSBB event, and after he was driving me home I told him I still had strong feelings for him. He told me he needed some time to think about it and he would get back to me.

A month later, he told me he couldn't find the feelings for me. So we took a break as friends.

September comes around, and I see him at another SSBB event. This time I pulled him aside and told him I didn't have the strong feelings but a few still resided. This time, he said ""Maybe in the future you and I could be a thing.""

So here we are, in October, still friends but I keep thinking about him, in fact he might just be the one. He is super nice and caring and he would do anything that I ask of him for me. My question to Reddit is, do you think him and I could possibly be a thing in the future?

178,"So, I grew up in a family with my three sisters in a big house but as soon as I started going too school, I noticed that I wasn’t like the others. 

I’ve always been an outsider in school never having any true close friends in my class so in the beginning, I always hung out with my older sister’s friends and then later moved on to some toxic friends all throughout junior high. I left those toxic friends in ninth grade though but ended up alone for an entire year and now I still have no classmates that talks to me and instead talks to my underclassmen where I also have the feeling that I do not belong. It doesn’t really help that my body is physically of a 12 years old when I’m actually soon to be 17.

In 6th grade, I had my second crush that I was convinced that would make me happy since the first one turned out badly. He gave out a lot of signs that he liked me too but he soon began to physically abuse me up until 9th grade where I swiched school and was left extremely depressed and selectively mute up until a few weeks into 10th grade.

So, during the summer between 9th and 10th grade I went to the summer camp I’ve gone to every year since I was around 8 years old because that’s somewhere I felt like I could be myself. It’s my favorite place in the world. This was my last year as a camper and there I got a crush on a younger guy that looked exactly like my previous one. Who rejected me and made me feel like shit too.

Because of that heartbreak, a friend that I’ve known for a really long time started to chat with me every single night up until the next spring which made me feel like someone finally cared about me. We were best friends for a time period that talked about everything with each other and he made me so happy that I got feelings for him and this time was when everything would turn to the better for me, I thought. He stopped texting me everyday and now it’s only a few times a week. He doesn’t even treat me like someone he cares about anymore now.

This summer was when my parents got divorced and I was forced to live with my mom who rarely ever comes home or cooks dinner while my dad lives with my younger siblings. I could still talk to my friend though but it took up to two days for him to respond. I still decided to make myself happy by working at that summer camp this year since I was old enough now and this was something that I’ve always wanted, but during my first week I was told by my boss that I wasn’t good enough and could only work there for a week. 

Now I’m back to the failure I was two years ago and I don’t even know If my life even is worth living. Things doesn’t seem to turn out good for me and it never has so why should it be in the future? I don’t even have anyone to talk to anymore and failed at keeping the things that made me happy. I hate being me and it would just be better If everything ended.

180,"I live in the Seattle area. My family has been targeted by stalking and electronic mind control and harassment using directed energy weapons since as early as the 1960's. I'm the last of my family line and have no siblings and no cousins in the U.S.. The torture and mind control that I and my family members endure is done primarily by UAVs operated by the USAF from Joint Base Lewis-Mcchord (JBLM), UAVs/drones that are being utilized worldwide by governments to target their own civilians. I'm subject to microwave attacks on a daily basis that heat my head and brain and induce near-instant psychological effects that include major depression, agitation, anxiety and fatigue. The charged particle emitters that these UAVs are armed with are also used to induce physical pain in my heart and painful headaches. U.S. Army Intelligence out of Ft. Meade Maryland are running a voice to skull (V2K) PSYOPS program on my family and I through which they harass and threaten us on a daily basis. They also use V2K to issue orders and real time updates to gangstalkers in the area (which include people who live in the immediate area. These spherical UAVs are positioned 1000 ft. or higher in the air and redirect microwaves from cell phone towers to hit targets with. They are not very big and their propulsion system is a gyroscopic inertial thruster (GIT) which allows them to maneuver incredibly quickly. These UAVs/drones feature three long spikes that protrude from the exterior. These are used to emit a glow that surrounds the craft in order to hide the fuselage and so that they're mistaken for distant stars or satellites in the night sky. This is a video of one of them malfunctioning (they have failsafe mechanisms in place to keep them airborne in case of this).  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRWRfW-Qvj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRWRfW-Qvj8)  


These UAVs are killing people worldwide using charged particle emitters house on the bottom of the craft to remotely induce heart attacks, strokes, aneurisms and to redirect microwaves to the CNS which can induce suicidal depression. They are responsible for the alarming rate of deaths among celebrities as well since the late 2000's. They have been used to murder people i've known, including family friends and even two of my family members. There are currently up to 100 of these craft above the Seattle area at this time. Many of them form groups of three in a perfectly triangular formation to be able to hit moving targets by linking their targeting systems and locking onto an individual or vehicle. There is also a distinct ""V"" formation comprised of 5 of these UAVs. These formations are clearly visible in the sky on any clear night over western Washington. I am asking for advice as i'm running out of options on how to deal with this threat. The CIA is controlling this program and others like it nationwide and it involves every agency (FBI,NSA,DHS, all brances of the U.S. military) all the way down to local police departments. I have tried reporting to local police, ACLU, and even FBI multiple times since 2013. This year USAF UAV pilots cut my phone call while I was providing info to the local FBI field office and was stonewalled by 4 different intake employees when I tried to call back. It has gotten to the point where my mom is being driven off the road by stalkers sent by these people and I am having guns pulled on me when outside. If anyone knows the best way to keep my family safe through this please give me some ideas.  


This is my youtube channel. It clearly shows the UAVs themselves in motion, footage of me being tortured in my home using directed energy weapons, U.S. Army Intelligence personnel used for V2K's voices being piped through my radio, stereo, stereo systems of nearby vehicles and loudspeakers on nearby businesses. It also provides personal accounts into how they operate and how this program works. This is not a joke or a hoax, this is actually happening right now to people in the United States and across the world. Please, even if you can't help by giving advice, please watch and if you can, share this. I love you. Let's do what we can to expose this before more people are hurt.

181,"So, I’m in a job I thoroughly enjoy. I’m new to this whole salary negotiating thing or even really “knowing my true worth” whatever that truly means in a capitalist society. 

Anyway, my 6 month probation ends in January and providing I pass it, I wanted to ask for a 20% increase and didn’t know quite how to word it or what the formalities are when it comes to requesting a pay review/pay rise. 

I also looked online and saw that the average salary for where I live and what I do is actually 20%-22% more than I am currently on.

Are pay rises something companies automatically bring up/give you after probation periods or will I always have to ask? I have a figure in mind, but what if they give me a raise of less than this figure? Do I shut my mouth in gratitude, or say “thank you, but I was actually thinking of salary X”?

Thanks. ",24Oct2018,1
182,"While this isn't *quite* advice, this is the closest subreddit.   
In the spirit of remaining anonymous this account is a burner.

So some background, I'm a 20 (21 in less than two months) male in Queensland and I've recently been thinking back alot on my childhood. I was born 3 months early with no heartbeat and as you can imagine spent most of my early life in the hospital more often than not. I was a very sick child who'm the doctors regularly gave little to no change of surviving (I even have needle scars on my hands and scarring through my lungs and nasal cavaties due to pulling the tubes out so often), this combined with the fact that I have high functioning autism and have never exactly been a normal kid probably put alot of strain on my parents. Even with that however i'm beginning to think that what my parents did to me over my life is not ok. 

My parents have never been the most loving parent to myself or my 3 sisters, mother is a neuroscientist and father is a network engineer so very grounded unemotional people, this doesn't mean they didn't love us, I think in their own way they did, but my sisters and I where forced to grow up very fast due to this. At 5 we each made our own breakfast, lunch for school, started doing our own laundry, cleaning around the house and learning to cook dinner. By 7 or so we where doing all the dishes and regularly cooking dinner for the family, this seems fine to me as we never had any issues with this and my mother was studying at the time with my father working 3 jobs to support us (we never had alot of money growing up). At 4 years old my parents where told I was a ""child prodigy"" after I built a remote control car out of a kit and some spare parts in the shed, they where also told I probably had autism and would struggle in life, my parents chose not to tell me or anyone else as they never wanted me to use it as an excuse, they wanted me to live a normal life, however they still made decisions based on that ""diagnosis"". 

As I recently found out my parents sent me to a normal school rather than an accelerated one for two reasons, the money (as mentioned earlier we didn't have alot), and because they wanted me to get bullied so I would be forced to adapt rather than everyone coddling me (I got beaten up in school, they didn't care too much). While my sisters believe i'm the smartest out of all of us (albeit certainly the most eccentric), I was never the one to do great at school, it was too slow and boring for me, so generally I was a B grade student, as you can imagine my parents where not a fan, often praising my sisters over me since they where more academic focuses whereas I preferred my little projects, building robots and computers, reading books and figuring out how things work by taking them apart. Over time I just gave up on school never trying as I started to believe nothing would be good enough for my parents (turns out I was right). As every child does, I thought my parents where harder on me than my sisters, I spent probably 70-80% of my school life grounded off computers and book for doing something wrong (people at school would even say, ""oh what did you do this time""). Normally it was things like spilling a bucket of water while cleaning the kitchen, building a brick house at the back and not realising that you need to stack the bricks differently so it fell on me, and so many more tiny things, honestly I can't remember most of them as they became pretty routine, do something dumb because I wasn't paying attention, get a lecture from my father, get grounded, go to room, rinse and repeat. (I was a clumsy absent minded kid, the kind who rides his bike while holding onto the rail near a storm drain, forgets to let go and falls into the storm drain). 

It wasn't until I hit my teens that things started to get worse, at this point I started wondering if my parents weren't harder on me, I thought that every kid must think that so I assumed I must just be fucking up far more than my sisters (around this time my little sister had started stealing money from the family, chocolates from the fridge and other things, she eventually got over it i'm happy to say). At 14 my parents institute a rule, pocket money stops being paid (we got paid a few dollars a week for chores, though into a bank account as we weren't allowed to spend it on food), and you have to find a job, if you don't have a job you're out handing out resumes looking for a job. After months of being yelled at and grounded because I couldn't find work I finally got a my first job, I made pizzas at dominos. My parents said finally and moved on, unfortunately the dominos shut down a few months after I joined and so began a long repeating process of me finding work, losing work, being yelled at for my parents, being forced to spent all my time looking for work, rinse and repeat. I will admit, due to my obsessive tendencies, clumsiness and being incredibly bad at repetitive tasks and sales, I lost quite a few jobs over the course of high school, some of them my fault, other ones due to me starting to get too old, not that my parents cared. 

I graduated from high school and went to university where I was top of my class, I had found something I loved and something I had been teaching myself since I was very young, In my first trimester I got high distinctions in every single assignment bar one. My parents said good, keep trying (my mother was top of her class and graduated with honours at a prestiges university). At this point I was the only one who went to uni, my two older sisters who graduated before me weren't interested (which causes issues between them and my parents), eventually I lost one of my jobs and as normal my parents made me go out there in the 40 degree whether applying for work, they even set a curfue and started tracking how long it would take for me to get home and if I arrived 5 minutes late I was scolded, I was cooking dinner every night for the family and doing all the chores, all the while getting yelled at from my class mates because I never had time to do any of my group projects. It causes my grades to take a pretty hard hit. Shortly after I managed to find work and also met the woman who would become my first girlfriend, unfortunately that ended pretty badly after a month which sent me into an emotional spiral downwards, my parents just told me to ""get over it"" and ""grow up,"" after a while they wanted to send me to a psychologist so I could get ""drugged up and stop being annoying"" I never accepted and forced myself to get over it. That period was one of my lowest moments in life, seeing myself as a failiure for ""letting something as simple as a girl affect me this much,"" due to my parents insistence on emotional strength and being yelled at every time I cried as a child I saw it as a weakness which simply made me more down. 

Finally I graduted uni, in which my father said words I will never forget, ""It's just an arts degree""...   
He doesn't have a degree, (my degree was also 3D animation, I wanted to go into the film industry).   
Shorly after I was given a month to find work, now for those of you who work in the creative arts industry, you'd know that's insane, but my parents where convinced I could do it, 9 months (an incredibly short time for the arts world, it's very hard to find work), went by before i found work, some of the worst 9 months of my life. 

My parents did not believe me that it was hard to find work, and so I had my phone taken off me, my computer taken off me, forced to sleep near my parents bedroom so they could make sure I went to bed at a certain time and woke up at a certain time, they took the clothes I liked away from me, I couldn't talk to my friends, wasn't allowed outside the house unless I was handing out resumes which they eventually stopped and got me to apply online using an old laptop ( I was also reeling because I had just found out my two older sisters are my half sisters). My father wanted a report each night of what jobs I had applied for, how I applied for them, the progress on the application, and what time I applied. I applied for over 250 jobs in that time...  
After some time of not finding work my parents would lock me out of the house during the day, I was forced to renovate the house, painting, sanding, filing on holes (my parents where going to sell), then during nights I would cook, clean, do the dishes, then sit on the couch, no music, no books, and spend the next 5 hours or so applying for jobs, go to sleep, woken up at 7 in the morning to repeat it all over again, 7 days a week for roughly 6 months straight. The punishments didn't stop there.   
I love my hair, I spend 15 minutes each morning styling it with a blow dryer then hairproduct getting the perfect quiff, so as a punishment for not finding work, my parents shaved my head, then scolded me when I cried, it was one of the most painful memories of my life, the last thing I had that I loved, the thing I thought they couldn't take away from me, they did.   
Shortly after I finally found work at a local studio where I discovered as it turns out, I'm a whorkaholic. I was doing 12-15 hours a day and loving it, I was also away from my parents, but I didn't escape them entirely. I still had no phone or computer, and my parents forced me to put their bank account down as the account my pay went into, my first full time job and all my pay went into my parents account (I was 19). After working there for two months I changed my account, and moved out, my parents didn't help, I hired a truck, loaded my stuff, and moved into the city. Unfortunately shortly afterwards I lost the job at the studio as I was casual and they had run low on clients (as I learnt is normal), I eventually ran out of money to pay rent while I looked for work and had to break lease, my sister let me live with her while I tried to find work as my parents refused to help me at all. Eventually I found work, and for some reason I just kept chatting to my parents like nothing happened, still with the lectures from my father and being ignored by my mother, I thought it was perfectly normal. 

Then my sister said something that made me start to think, she said that our parents where always harder on me, I asked my other sisters and they all agreed, meaning that I wasn't imagining it like I thought, and maybe I wasn't the issue. Since then I started to think more about what my parents did to me growing up, some honourable mentions being my father calling me broken when I found out I was considered high functioning autism and claiming they had to be harder on me to make sure I could function, refusing to admit I had moved out since I was ""living with my sister"" (I pay rent myself and have payed back all debts), claiming I tried to sabotage my sisters relationship because I was ""jelous"" (mentioned a friend of hers that had come over to her ex, thought it was a mate from work looking for him, turned out to be my sisters ex), claiming I was an ungrateful shit for negotiating for higher percentages in a business deal (he wasn't involved), and so much more. The final one finally made me block his number, that was a few weeks ago and I haven't unblocked it. 

All in all i've started looking back and realising that maybe I wasn't the problem, that maybe i'm not broken, and that maybe I shouldn't be constantly looking for my fathers approval (something I don't think I'll ever get). I still don't know why, could be the autism, could be because i'm the only son or my fathers first biological child, could be that my father was beaten by his father (who he hasn't talked to in over 15 years) and so he doesn't know how to have a son, I don't know and to be entirely honest I don't think I care. I wanted to know what you guys think, get some views from people who don't know me, now I know you're only seeing one side, so the argument could be quite biased, don't get me wrong my parents certainly did alot of good stuff too, they generally where supportive, bought me bionicals and magentics when I asked with my pocket money, let me use parts from the shed to build cool stuff and other than wacking me on the head or smacking me they didn't beat me, plus i'm mature and that's something, but is it worth it?

tldr: Had what I think is a tough life, thought it was perfectly normal, parents shaved my head because I couldn't find work and never supported me, father blames me for everything and mother doesn't care much, thinking about dropping them from my life. ",24Oct2018,1

185,"Hey, I’m going to try to keep this post short since I have a tendency to write way to much, so sorry in advance if this ends up being way too long.

Basically, I was popular in highschool. I’m attractive and although awkward at the begging I became super social by my junior and senior year. Despite being popular and having a lot of friends, I always kept a small group of close friends. There were falling outs but usually we made up, until senior year when a good friend was talking behind my back and since I had self respect I dropped him completely and my friends backed me up, but later they all talked to him again and some cut me out for him. My best friend began dating one of my close friends but she turned out to me a manipulative snake and cut me out in favor of the asshole friend who was talking shit behind my back. She twisted my best friend and his personality is just an extension of her now. The before mentioned asshole also spread rumors that I was quick to clear up but it caused a rift between another good friend who is my ex, she was emotionally abusive and overall bad news, yet I wanted to be friends with her since we known each other for such a long time. 

I’m in college now, and I have no close friends anymore other than my best friend, and despite him changing I can’t drop him because we have been through way to much for me to give up on him. All of my old close friends are really scummy people who have wronged me, and I refuse to be friends with them again since I am to prideful and know it’s bad idea. Despite this, I miss them we used to have so much fun and seeing them all be happy while I’m alone is killing me, I have major trust issues now and I have trouble making good friends because of it, I have no motivation or energy for anything. Even getting up is a drag. Why do I miss these people even though they all hurt me? What can I do to fix myself so I can enjoy life again?

193,"So I (22F) met this guy I’ll call him John (31M) through friends a year ago. He’s never been creepy to girls. He’s super respectful and has very liberal views. When we first met we were both living near a big city. I asked him if he would want to go to dinner sometime and then on for five months things were perfect. We would hangout nearly everyday.



We both love cinema and have a dark sarcastic sense of humor. In bed he was always super focused on my pleasure. He would talk to me about my emotional issues and always have a sympathetic ear. We have the same mutual friends here and they all like him.


He has a very cynical world view though. His parents were both doctors. In high school he had a 4.0 gpa and got nearly perfect scores on the SATs. He want to Colorado state because that’s where most of his friends were going. His plans were to become a high up political figure or a lawyer. Everyone in his life was saying that’s where he was going. He hated all his general education classes, his girlfriend from high school broke up with him sophomore year, and his grades started to fall.


He flunked out his second year and worked retail jobs. He met a girl named Rebecca(30F) who his friend used to date. She was his only crazy ex, the rest he has not much bad to say. She would throw things at him, get mad if he was looking at celebrities in movies to long, accused him of using her for sex ,and would break his things. They dated for five years.


During this time he had periods of depression that started when he was in college and made him fail out. Where he would spend months not working and having suicidal thoughts. He has nihilistic views about the world, he thinks things are meaningless and random. He was never bullied, never had any abuse, and came from an affluent family.


A years before I met him he was doing therapy for depression. At 28 he went to a residential treatment center but said it was a scam and took his money. He spent five months there, it’s an expensive reputable treatment center. He saw no change. When we met he was working as a bank teller for a year.


I’m a full time student at a university here. I don’t go out partying, I have no debt, I don’t drink, and usually don’t want drama with my friends. I don’t like to say negative things about people and usually avoid it. I have a good group of friends here. I have a great relationship with my family who lives in another state. They help support me through school. I go running every other day and hiking once a week.


After five months he started to become depressed. He started complaining that rent was too high, that his job had become mundane, and he wanted to move home for cheaper rent. He quit his and we planned to stay together but he “had to leave because he was being screwed over for rent money”.


So he went home to live with his parents. He’s had no job for a year. He doesn’t pay rent, he does SOME chores, he takes care of the dogs, and most days watches movies, reads the news, and reads books. He says his depression has made him feel so negative he can’t function. He stopped going to therapy once he left and said his parents told him they were done paying for mental health treatment. So he has gotten non.


After eight weeks of leaving he told me he was suicidal and I said talk to a professional and stopped talking to him. He says he can’t open up to me now because of that. I talk to him a lot about my insecurities because when he left I felt very alone. I’ve tried bringing up that maybe something happened in his childhood he doesn’t remember. He said that was stupid.


I’ve lost my temper with him. Since we met I have an ex I’ve know since I was 16 for six years. Even though I haven’t seen him in 2 years, he keeps sexual photos of me and contacts me every so often. It’s to the point if I ignore him he sends the photos to me saying “remember these:)”. I feel like I can’t block this ex because he’s been aggressive in the past and knows where I live and my family. John always rolls his eyes when I tell him about it now.

He says there’s an easy solution block him. I try to explain that if I make a hard choice and piss him off I have a got feeling he’ll do something. I’ve blocked him in the past but he’ll find ways to contact. I compare johns and his relationship with Rebecca and how he stayed so long. He said I try to compare two situations that aren’t similar and that I’m bad at arguing.


He says that I’m shallow because I was bullied in high school badly and now really critical of my looks. He says I’m emotionally immature and a liar . Ive never been called that really before but he says it comes from things like me lying about taking the last cookie or like if I smoked my roommates cigarette and they asked if I took one I’d say no. I try not to do this often but I’m anxious and don’t like confrontation. 


I’m in Chicago for my birthday with all my friends. He’s in a grumpy mood. I try to call him and he doesn’t want to talk. This is a common theme throughout the past year I just want to talk how normal friends would. Like a couple times a week or once a week. But he won’t do that sometimes and if I try to keep trying to talk to him because I worry he says I’m annoying and needy.I try couple days later and he says we aren’t dating ,we don’t live in the same state, I don’t have a future for myself or you. I am upset. I say he’s never cared about me , that he’s a constant pity party, he’s a loser and that he’s selfish.


We don’t talk for two weeks and he send me like a text that was like 700 words. Saying how I’ll find someone, all my good qualities and talking about his own issues. I felt a simple sorry could of been enough or phone call. I felt patronized. I told him I didn’t read the whole thing and deleted it. He was pissed that I couldn’t be bothered to read it. And ignored me for awhile. 



He’s very unemotional and acts like I’m hysterical. I apologized a couple weeks later he says he doesn’t see what he could of done differently in either situations. He said that I was mean and just throwing things in his face when I was criticizing him. He said he thinks the things I say but ten times worse.That he was being objective and logical. I said I know I need to work on my anger issues.


Am I a mean person? Am I acting crazy? Should I cut contact with John?

195,"Me and my now ex girlfriend had been together for 9 months. We moved really quick too. Due to personal reasons for me she let me stay with her for awhile so we were living together pretty early on. We got along so well with one another early on. Which we both thought was odd because were both so different from each other. 

Different senses of humor, different music tastes, types of personality (I’m much more of an introvert and she’s extrovert) needless to say we were both very happy and living with one another went fine.

One thing I never knew until a little later on into the relationship was she’s been through a lot. I don’t want to put it all out there on Reddit, but she’s from Africa and she escaped to the US because her life was in danger. And through that process she went through quite a bit.

She’s bipolar, has PCOS, and is anemic.
And for me, I have heart issues at 24 years old. Stress is very dangerous for me because if my blood pressure gets high it can end bad. Which leads into our biggest issue which was arguing with one another.

Her attitude can flip on a dime, half the time I didn’t even see it coming and she’d be attacking me about something. Or worse, she’d let it simmer and I could always tell it was going to explode out of her later.

I made the first mistake in the relationship and tried to leave without confronting her. I was afraid what the arguing might lead to, and more than anything I didn’t want to end up in the hospital because of it. But because of the way I walked out on her, without any confrontation, I really hurt her. 

She argues a lot with me yeah, but she loved me so much and I could tell. I asked her to take me back and she did, but because of what I did her feelings before that moment never recovered. The arguing got worse, the personal attacks began of us trying to one up the other in whatever stupid thing we were arguing about. 

But then we’d go a couple weeks back to being the couple we were in the beginning, loving each other unconditionally and accepting our faults without being at each others throats. And I always did my best to make sure those moments lasted as long as I could, but it slowly just got worse and worse. 

I had never been with a bipolar woman before this, and it was so hard to handle at times. She’d throwing the meanest remarks and to avoid arguing and potential health issues, I’d just be a punching bag at times.

I could never get as mad as wanted at her though, because I knew how she felt about her mental illness. She hates being bipolar and I knew how hard she was trying to control it and take medication for it.

But even if I didn’t say it, she could tell I was felt like I was walking on glass around her even so. And I think that really got to her because she thought I could handle it.

Last night and into this morning we had the biggest argument we’ve ever had. And it got bad. I didn’t recoil this time and yelled back about all the things that was getting to me. And she gave me the ultimatum finally that she was just going to leave me, or I needed to change my ways.

I didn’t even know what ways I needed to change. I always tried to listen during her yelling at what I potentially did wrong and what I could do better, but it was never enough. I just couldn’t make her happy anymore and told her I was done. And I was not ready for how bad those words hit her. 

She didn’t say another word to me until she left (we had our own apartment together at this point) she ignored me the entire time, but was also crying majority of the time. By the time she left and when the door closed, I broke down in tears. I didn’t cry at all while she was packing and gave her the silence she wanted. 

She’s driving back home to Kentucky which is a 16 hour drive and I’m worried sick about her. She won’t talk to me and I feel like I made a mistake. At the time when I told her I was done I just felt like us being together was causing so much strain and we both needed to step away. And now idk if I made the right choice.",24Oct2018,1

We used to talk to each other during the day, play games together, wish each other a great day and also compliment each other. She legitimately saved me from causing any harm to myself, has been a great pillar for support and is truthfully just such a lovely person.

I lost 30kg over a year, got pregnant and put on 50kg.. the weight is slowly but steadily increasing.

203,"Yeah, that title. I’ll make it short and bitter. I met the love of my life three years ago. We were near perfect together. I hate saying stuff like this, but it was like she was my soul mate. I am young, and before that had had a relationship of three years with a girl through most of high school. She hadn’t been as nice you could say, so meeting someone that genuinely cared about not just having me as their partner, but about the world and everyone else was very special. Like, it’s amazing how amazing some people are and others just aren’t. Let’s just call my late SO “B”.

I’m sorry, some details are really hard to write over again. I’m intentionally being vague on some things. But long story short she died in a roll over driving home. I have lived a hard life, but losing her has been tough. Tough on me and so many people. She was just a gem, a gem for me and her best friend, we will call her T,  

T is and always had been a close friend of my late lover. T grew up with her, and eventually I was in the picture and all three of us were like peas in a pod. 

Over the years B and I moved elsewhere, but we were still close with T. We had always shared the same bed, all three of us. Laid together and cuddled. But never was there anything sexual with T, besides teasing from her and B about sleeping with two beautiful women. They know how guys are and they gave me a hard time. That kind of thing. Friends, really. 

When B died it devastated everyone I know. T and I spent some time together, but shortly before this B and I had become estranged in a sense. She left me on this earth on bad terms, and I think at first T had a tough time seeing me. 

But we started talking again, as if B was never gone. I just said hi. It started feeling like more than friendship. We stayed up to wait for each other when one worked late. We would either just call or go on rides. Or we would visit Bs grave or the site of her wreck. 

Eventually we kissed and that was intense for both of us. We cried. She had recently left her boyfriend. Basically we are a mess. But that kiss was so nice. She looked at me and wanted to kiss me so bad I could feel it. I’ve never been kissed first before. I loved it. It felt like home. And then guilt. 

I just think of B, and I told T that. Somehow that ended up in us sleeping together. I hate that I liked it. I hate that I like kissing her. I hate that I want her. 

I get that people developed bonds in time of hardship. But this feels so wrong. What if Bs parents knew? Or her siblings? This is a very close group of people. It’s crazy. All my life I wanted a real family and I found them and now this. Now my B is dead and I love her grieving best friend. What the hell is wrong with me? 

What would B think? What could T possibly be thinking? ",24Oct2018,1

208,"Hey everyone, hope your day is going well :)
I want to share a story, and it's one I have never been able to get over, and I finally want some help finding the way forward.

I'm in year 11, which I think is the same as grade 10 (I'm 16).
A huge change recently happened. I have previously struggled in social life, but I can fully say I have bloomed and my confidence has grown immensely. I had a popular, amazing friend group and we were so close, often having long deep chats about life. Suddenly, weed was introduced. Legit everyone in my group started smoking, drinking and doing cigarettes. They have quoted that being sober is shit. I didn't really like it, so I didn't join. In response, I got kicked to the curb. I was removed on all of their instagram accounts, blocked, and new group chats were made. They ignore me, and it's hard for me to comprehend because we were so so close and the whole kicking out thing happened in a week, which is so so fast. I now have 2 people who I can truly call my friends, an (almost) girlfriend, and things in theory are happy. But I still get very very down from the whole situation. So here's where I need advice.
 I don't know why I got kicked out, or what to do from now on. There's one person in particular who gets me down, and he makes me so mad but I don't know how to handle him. I only have 2 more years of high school, so is it all worth it? I have talked to them about it, and most say yea we just have different interests now, but I don't see that as anything. And the one frustrating guy just gets super super pissed at me and it hurts hahah. So any advice on what now or what happened would be great, I hope you all enjoy your day :))",24Oct2018,1
209,"Please excuse this is my first post, and I’m on a mobile. 

Ohhhhhhhhhh fricking boy, where do I start with this, I’ll try and make this short as I can, but be warned it could be long.

We have house mate number 1 = hm1
We have house mate number 2 = hm2 
And last but not least we’ve house mate number 3 =hm3 
And myself. 

*bit of a backstory* 
Hm1 and myself have lived together for 8 months on our own. When we first moved in, we had our ups and downs but we sorted it out pretty quickly and have been pretty peachy since as we had a 12 month lease. At the 8 month mark, we decided to get someone else in just so the rent was a little cheaper and we had some extra cash. So hm1 asked her work friend if she wanted to move in who is hm2 and she then asked if her boyfriend hm3 could move in when he moved over from the other side of the country.  

Now this brings us to the current predicament hm3 is a very awkward person, who suffers from anxiety, depression and has also been diagnosed with a disability. This is his excuse for smoking weed (not medical), constant drinking and just making everyone uncomfortable with being awkward in the house. Since HM3 hasn’t got a job, he sits at home gaming online all day, doesn’t help much around the house and never really leaves him room on the odd occasion for a smoke or a blunt. At first we we didn’t have a problem with the weed as we thought this was going to be a thing that wasn’t so often, but it is becoming so bad that we are worried the people who live around us are going to complain as sometimes you can smell it halfway down the street. There are also quite a few kids in the street, as well as the constant online gaming this has caused the internet to lag. HM1 and I feel this is unfair to be paying for if we can’t even use it. 
NOW 
HM1, HM2 and I agreed that instead of moving a month before Christmas we would sign our current lease for 6 months. HM3 isn’t on the lease and before we re-signed we just wanted to iron out a few kinks with the wifi and weed and just have a general chat about helping out with the general house cleaning. 
Now, since HM1 &amp; HM2 work together, HM1 told HM2 that we needed to have a sit down and sign the lease and she mentioned about the internet and how it’s unfair, we’ll this has now snowballed into HM2 telling HM1 that HM3 feels as though I, dislike him. *insert mind blowing scream* I actually spend very little time with these people as I study, work, gym ect and don’t really feel the need to spend time with them, I am not a cuddly squishy person and I do not feel the need to speak to them every 5 mins, and keep to myself HM2&amp;3 have been told this on many occasions from myself and HM1, now HM3 like I mentioned is a VERY awkward person, so this is in his head. 
All that was wanted was to sit down, talk and try and resolve the issues at hand, but this has turned into house mate against house mate, and the tensions are incredibly high, as HM2&amp;3 don’t feel they need to have a sit down as they don’t want to, and are worried HM3 will become more awkward and not leave his room more often. 
HM1 and I are unsure on weather we try and sit down and resolve the weed issue and try and explain him being awkward is making us uncomfortable or just ask them to leave? ",24Oct2018,1

So Here's the story. (sorry if I'm breaking  any rules. Just wasn't exactly sure where to ask this on Reddit because  it's such a big place.)

So, a few years  ago, my father in law, who was 82, got a horrible cough. He visited the  doctor and they sent him home with meds. A few days later, they had to  call an ambulance because he was having problems breathing. They brought  him out on a stretcher while it was raining. They let him sit soaking  wet until the ambulance could back up close enough (which took almost 10  minutes.). He remained soaking wet for the ride to the hospital. They  didn't change his cold and wet blankets.

We  got to the hospital and they gave him some meds. No real diagnoses. A  few days later, his wife drove him to the hospital, where he was  promptly diagnosed with pneumonia. He was kept there for several days  until he was getting better. Then he took a turn for the worse. They  couldn't figure it out until I asked them to run a test for MRSA.

He  was infected with it. We all know that it came from the hospital  because there was an outbreak of it at the time. (Goddamn doctors not  washing their hands). Anyhow, he chose to come home to die, and he did.

Do  you think that the hospital was at fault, you know, for the MRSA? Or is  the ambulance team at fault, for making him sicker? Keep in mind, this  was NH rain in November...",24Oct2018,1

The main place I want to move to now is southern downtown LA. They seem to have cheap apartments and hey it doesn’t hurt that it’s near the beach.
Second, money. I plan to make a good amount of money right after I leave college so that I can start renting an apartment and can pay my bills when I reach LA. What do you guys think would be a safe amount to save up? I was thinking 6,000 would be good as long as I get a job immediately when I moved. 
Third, also money. I realize California is very expensive. My worst case scenario, which to me is doable, is working Monday through Friday, as well as having a job on the weekend to make extra money. All this while I work on my amazing YouTube career!

232,"I work as a housekeeper at an assisted living facility, where security is high because a lot of our patients have dementia/ Alzheimer’s. We have a guard on duty 24/7 who monitors the cameras around the building, buzzes people in, etc. 

About a month ago, a strange thing happened between me and him. I got to work as usual at 6:30 am. I have a little office/supply closet where I spend a lot of time in if I’m not cleaning. I usually get to work, get my supplies together, and finish my cup of coffee in my office until about 6:45. At about that time, I hear someone wiggling the door knob vigorously, trying to open it because it’s always locked, and I’ll tell you it scared the ever loving shit out of me because it’s very quiet around here in the mornings, and office is in the (dark, often creepy) basement. I had a swig of coffee in my mouth and it went down the wrong pipe so not only did it startled me but now I was half choking on coffee as well. 

I gather myself and start breathing normally , (about 5 seconds) then I go to open the door and see who needed me. I see it’s this security guard, kind of shuffling away really quickly. (He is not supposed to leave his station unless someone can sit in for him, bathroom breaks, anything like that, a replacement would have to come and sub in, and that happens at specific times. This was not one of those designated times). 

I thought it was weird, but still called out to him and said “Hey! Sorry I didn’t get to the door fast enough, am I needed somewhere?” He turns around and says “Oh, no, just seeing where you were hiding out, I didn’t see you on any of the cameras”. I said “oh, yeah, I just usually am slow at finishing my coffee in here and gathering up my supplies but I’ll wake up here soon!” Something like that. 

I shrugged it off as maybe he was just new and extra concerned, I’m not really sure. But then the past couple of days anytime he is in he asks me very personal questions that I don’t really feel like is appropriate for work. First, he has asked me if not 10 times since I’ve met him, “did you say you had a boyfriend?” And things like “where do you live? Oh, what’s that by? I’ve been near there”. Also asks me if I would be willing to clean his apartment sometime, which I politely declined because I have a second job. 


Yesterday I finally felt creeped out enough by his questions that it’s starting to make me feel uncomfortable and creeped out. He said to me “so are things serious with your boyfriend, do you plan on marrying him?” I said confidently “yes, if he asked me I would definitely say yes!” His response - “ah, I see.” 

I am a polite and talkative person so while it makes sense to ignore him at all costs I have to pass by him frequently and I’m not one to tell people to fuck off that I work with. I don’t know if maybe my feeling here is irrational but all I know is he makes me feel very uncomfortable, and I always feel like I am being watched. there are cameras everywhere I turn, and I find myself avoiding clear views the camera has because I just feel so uncomfortable when he’s working. 

I’m not sure if this is enough to mention to a supervisor that’s why I’m asking you guys first. ",24Oct2018,1
234,"I just downloaded this app so I could talk openly about some things.
I know that some people fake depression and suicide because they want the attention. I'm not trying to do that. This topic has been on my mind for ages now and I dont know who to talk to.
I am also aware that there is a helpline and stuff but they wouldn't understand.
My circumstance isn't very major. But things build up and I cant do it anymore.
I am only 12 turning 13 on Tuesday.
Yes I am young and probably too young to be talking about this.
My dad left my mum when I was a baby and my brother and I kept seeing him until I was six.

Again, I know. Most of you would be thinking. ""So? I dont have a dad either."" 
My mum has this horrible partner. He is an abusive retard and I HATE him. I hate my mum for following him like a little puppy. Not speaking up to him. He literally told me that he doesn't care If I starve. Thats okay I thought. He isnt really considering of the fact that I have anxiety. But Im not sure if I have depression or bipolar.
A year ago, he got my mum pregnant and she has his child, so hes basically stuck in our family now. Theres nothing I can do.

He scares me. I cant speak up for myself or tell him anything. I cant tell my mum anything either.
I just dont feel loved.
Nothing makes me happy anymore. Once when I had a depressed phase, he and my mum told me that I just have an attitude. So I have been keeping my attitude to the minimum at the moment.  I have some friends but I don't feel like I can talk to any of them. 
I just cant do anything to escape him. I just want my dad back. I miss him even though he doesnt love me. Anyone is better than Scott.
I used to see a psychologist but nothing worked. At that time I just had(I still do) anger issues.
Ive stopped seeing her. 
The only people in my family that I love is my grandparents, my siblings and my aunty and uncle. I also get some racism at school and overall just not happy with my body. Im not going to eat anymore since I want to be a model.

Anyways Ive tried to cut myself and hurt myself but Im too scared for the pain and if anybody notices. So ive thought of using sleep pills many times but I'd need a prescription. Im too scared to stab or suffocate myself. Im also considering getting run over by a car.
I honestly dont care about life at the moment. 
The only thing that I love the most is BTS. I wish in the hole entire world that I could see them. 
Their smiles and just Aaaaaa. I really really love them. 

So thats my over drammatic story. Again Im not doing this for attention. Im genuinely scared and confused. No one will probably read this but If you do, these arent my final words. These are just my thoughts.

Thankyou.

235,"Apologies in advance for the long post, i just need to get this out there and i hope someone can help me.

So as the title says, i think i smell bad. This all started about a year ago when i made a new group of friends and on the first night we met, one of the guys in it drunkenly told me i smelled like shit. It turns out he thought i had been nasty to him through a misunderstanding, and he took it back the next day and said i didn’t smell like shit and he didn’t know why he said it. Then a few weeks later another guy in the group who i had become pretty close to started making these jokes about my smell. I could never pin down what it was he was actually saying i smelt of, because one joke would be about my feet, another would be about my vagina, another would be about BO. He would also sometimes walk into a room i was in and say it smells like shit in here. I was always too embarrassed whenever he made these jokes that i never actually confronted him about it, and after a while i realised he was likely a sociopath (for other reasons) anyway and stopped being friends with him. 

All of this essentially confirmed my worst fear. I have OCD and anxiety and have always had a specific fear of smelling bad. Thanks to my OCD, I have perfect hygiene - i shower (and scrub every inch of me) everyday, sometimes twice a day, wear deodorant and perfume, wash my clothes after one wear, etc. I’m also a healthy weight. Before this i had never had anyone hint or say anything about my smell other than to compliment me on it. No one has explicitly said anything since this all happened either, but my confidence is still at rock bottom - i barely leave the house, basically stopped going to class, and overanalyse every interaction i have, looking for any indication that i smell. I also keep noticing people sniffing around me and it’s making me so paranoid. I’ve asked my family and they say they have never smelt anything off of me. I thought they might just be used to my smell but they said if i smelt bad they would notice it after not seeing me for a few weeks since we don’t live together anyway. My mum thinks i’m crazy, and says i need to see a psychiatrist. I told her about what those guys said and she thinks they were just trying to get to me, but I see absolutely no reason why anyone would tell someone they smell bad if it wasn’t the case. I’m too scared to ask any of my other friends out of embarrassment, but some of them are very “tell it how it is” people and i feel like if they thought i smelled they would say something.

Whatever is causing this smell, i don’t think it’s constant because literally the day after that guy told me i smelt like shit, i hooked up with this beautiful model guy who actually told me i smelt really good. I’ve also had a couple people tell me my room smelt bad, and then had other people tell me my room smelt amazing (including the guy who made jokes about my smell). Like wtf?! I’ve not got consistent evidence for either smelling bad or good and it’s making me feel completely crazy. 

The only thing i can think it could be is i have had IBS for years, and around the time this all started it got worse and i became more constipated and had horrible smelling gas a lot of the time. I wonder if the gas was leaking out of me and making me smell? Or the constipation somehow causes a smell? Surely if it was gas, people would just be like “you farted” rather than saying i smelled bad? Either way, i’ve been to the doctor several times (without actually mentioning the smell), tried different medication, changed my diet, took supplements, but my IBS hasn’t really responded to anything i’ve done. So if that’s the cause then it’s obviously still an issue and i must still be emitting this horrible smell sometimes. People here are probably going to tell me to go to the doctor but the doctors in my country are extremely unhelpful and will probably dismiss me, especially because i have a history of mental illness.

I need advice. What could be causing a smell that i can’t smell myself, and only some people can smell it some of the time? I feel like i can’t go on with this problem anymore. It’s completely taken over my life.

236,"One of my friends has been dating this guy for just over 2 years now. It started off as sweet and innocent, puppy love kinda. As the months went past and they grew more comfortable with each other, things started to go slightly off for them. In the middle of last year the guy attended a party with close mates with out her because she had a curfew and couldn’t go out. She trusted him to behave himself while out and felt no need to worry about him. But of course something had to happen for that trust to fade. That night resulted in him cheating on her with one of the girls we go to school with. A week later she found out and went ballistic. He was her first everything. First boyfriend, first sexual partner, first love. I could see the life being sucked right out of her body and she broke down. This is something I will probably never understand but she took him back and gave him another chance despite the pain and anger he put her through. Fast forward to the the present year, ever since that night he has been super and I mean SUPER over protective of her, and not in a good way. He’s extremely controlling over. He threatens to bash any boy that even slightly glances at her, calls her names for what she wears if he thinks it’s too revealing and even physically hurts her. She knows the way she’s being treated is unfair and horrible but she still stays with him? I’m trying to help her leave him but I can only do so much for her because she’s the one that really needs to take action and actually break up with him. This relationship is rapidly breaking her down and I hate watching it before my eyes. I came here to seek advice on what to do because honestly I feel so helpless.",24Oct2018,1
237,"**TL;DR Life sucked, worked hard. Achieved OK degree of success but then stopped to focus on other priorities (health). Now that health is solved, I'm struggling staying motivated for business 'cuz I'm too comfy where I'm at, even though I'm not financially free.**

This isn't going to be your typical post. I want to hear from people who have studied ""the greats"" or are very successful themselves how they pushed past the ""things are good"" phase onto greatness.

Here's my situation: 

Things in my life were completely messed up 2 years ago. My health was horrible, social life horrible, and I was in debt due to owning lots of medical bills. I was clearly unhappy AF.

I hustled my face off for a year straight and started making some money online as a freelancer. That some money turned into a bit more, and then into 2.5k-3.5k per month revenue. 

Because of my health issues, I struggled working long hours. I then shifted the focus from increasing income to reducing hours so that I could focus on improving my health. 

Very quickly I achieved about $2k-$2.5k per month PROFIT working 10 hours per week. I could work when I want, where I want, how I want, and sometimes I worked as little as 5 hours in a week. 

I stopped focusing on the business because my health was a priority- in fact, I was in so much chronic pain I was suicidal. I decided if I couldn't cure myself in 5 years I'd end it all. 

Well, I did cure myself. I studied wellness all over North America &amp; Europe. I spent the majority of my time in extremely cheap countries such as Bulgaria. In fact, I now love Bulgaria and would consider it my home (the fact that my $ goes 3x farther is a huge bonus). 

Now I'm at a point where I'm making $2.5k-$3k profit working 10-15 hours per week, and my health is great. Note: when I say 10 hours I mean 10 FOCUSED hours, not 10 ""bla bla"" hours. When I work I WORK, nothing else. 

I have no more excuses as to why I shouldn't be going for my original dream of developing extremely valuable products, and helping the world out (and getting rich as a by-product). 

The problem is I struggle working long hours and I'm too lazy/comfortable where I'm at. I've kind of lost touch with my dream and feel purposeless. 

The motivation isn't there because the pain isn't there. I also don't have many (or any?) entrepreneurial friends here in Bulgaria. 

My sleep cycle has also been really messed up due to some relationship issues &amp; too much time zone shifting recently also which is probably another reason I am so lazy. 

My question for you is: how do I get off my lazy ass and start hustling again? How can I escape this ""good comfort zone"" and move towards that greatness I always wanted?

244,"PSA- before you read this you should know that I understand the effects of mental disorders on friends and people being that I have multiple friends who have them aswell as having ADD myself, and I understand the effects of depression and self harm being that I've experience both of those things first hand.

So for full backstory, I used to date a girl in 8th grade (lets call her amanda) and we dated all the way through my sophomore year of highschool and then she broke up with me. There was no doubt I was in love with her, she helped me with so much in life and even though I was a sophomore and it was most likely naive but I felt like she really could make me happy for the rest of my life (and still partly feel that way). It just felt horrible not having her in my life because she was also one of my best friends.

Anyways, now I'm a junior and after a couple months of therapy and space were finally on talking terms and were really good friends again and I'm kind of able to move on now that I'm in a new relationship. 

Amanda (currently a sophomore) has always been a really nice person and cares alot about the people in her life like her friends and family, and she recently became very close friends with someone and found out that they had multiple personality dissorder (let's name this girl sarah whose currently a senior). Sarah was in this really abusive relationship before hand, physically and mentally, with lots of manipulation and the entire relationship was basically fueled by sex. All of this rolls up nicely into a blanket of Sarah experiencing self harm and depression and a whole array of shitty feelings. She refuses to go receive help because she thinks shes fine, so nobody can really prove whether or not sarah really does have multiple personality disorder, but it should be stated that it is equally likely that Sarah could have the disorder and not have the disorder. 

After amanda spent time with Sarah after a while they became close but Sarah would do shit to her that would make her just feel like garbage, just because Sarah put alot of her problems on their relationship as friends (which is the main reason amanda even broke up with me) and it would always make amanda really upset, and now that were in good terms again shes been coming to me for advice and I've been trying to help her because at the end of the day I just want her to be happy and if something is making her upset ill do what I can to help her. Sarah also has been very manipulative with amanda, almost flat out telling her how to feel or what to do. This also isnt just me noticing, its alot of other friends she has that are concerned for amandas well being because most of us friends feel like Sarah isnt healthy for her.

So now, after a whole ordeal, Sarah and amanda are now dating and I'm extremely concerned for Amanda's health.

Everything that they do together is just completely what she goes against in relationships. For the entire length of our relationship we were always niche about pda, which maybe that will change, but you can see that amanda just let's Sarah go all over her in public and amanda doesnt give anything in return. It's almost as if you can tell shes uncomfortable but shes too afraid to say no. They also isolate themselves from everybody in the school. During social events or band events you can see Sarah dragging amanda away somewhere not letting her talk to anybody but herself. And I can just see everything crashing down on her and I dont know how to tell her that I think shes making a terrible mistake. 

It should also be said i am NOT homophobic. I could care less who you date as long as you're happy, but I can see this relationship really getting to her head and ruining her just like our relationship did. I would tell her all of my personal problems and I wouldn't let her leave me alone because I was too upset to deal with them by myself and it got to the point where amanda physically couldnt handle it anymore and she just had to get out of the relationship. I wouldn't be too scared of this for this relationship either, but I'm afraid she wont be able to do anything about it because of how much Sarah manipulates her.

So now I'm at the point where I dont know what to do about this because I just want to tell her how I feel and that shes making a mistake, but it's also not really any if my business because it is her relationship. My therapist also told me it might just be best to let amanda figure this out on her own and she can learn something from this but I just feel terrible sitting aside and watching her do something that could possibly get her hurt.",24Oct2018,1

252,"Hi. I want to start by saying, I am diffident person. I can't talk with people that I want to be friends with. For instance, there was a girl I liked for almost 10 years and still I am thinking about her(I am now almost 21). If it wasn't for her, I would never, never tried to get any attention in school. I did hilarious stuff in classes, such as, making fun of others and words and everything that came up in my mind. I didn't do stuff that would upset anyone. I tried to be as positive/neutral and not-hated. I did all these stuff just to get her attention. I was the kind of person, who wanted to go back to school, not for studying or be with my classmates, but to be there with her. It made my day to see her smile and I never did anything 'funny' when she wasn't around. From grade 2 to 9. I kept doing silly stuff. Until of course grade 9, I little by little became more self-conscious. I realised that all these 8 years. I was doing nothing. I had no meaning in my life. All these years I just got shit grades, because I didn't go to school for studying, and I never listened to my parents about school. And I never got closer to her that I was trying to impress all these years. It felt and still feels like shit. I got yelled by two people who really made me come to my own mind. One of them **threw his fucking shoes** at me in a class and one classmate said some stuff. Those two really made me think about myself. So, yeah. I was suddenly the whole ninth grade the quiet one. I was somehow popular 8 years. Then at ninth grade, not so much. At ninth grade, I looked around and I basically knew none of them. Even though we spent 9 years together. I realised some were just selfish bastards, even though I want to say that to some of them, I can't or won't. I even supported some of them, but they never did the same, but rather gossip and say shit behind me.

 After ninth grade, all of them knew what they were doing in their life, at least it seemed that way. Some of them went to vocational school, some to high school including the girl. I went to 10 grade in hopes of also getting to high school. Not because of her, actually I tried avoid to go into same school as her. Because I getting shy being around her and some other stuff. 

One year in tenth grade, I made it to high school, barely. I grinded the last three months so hard. I know ""grind"" isn't the correct word. I made it to high school. I am aiming to be a doctor something. My four and five years after 9 grade has been as equally shit. And I haven't changed a bit. I kept playing even more seriously games. I was completely out of my mind. I didn't care about anything. At age 20. My father just keep telling what the fuck I am doing. I got mad and broke the table with my fist, I avoided breaking the laptop. I got seriously mad. Now I am done with video games also. I am trying to face my life and its problem like man should. Now I am attending some courses again. Trying to do some stuff differently now. 

I am just facing some problems here. I don't know how to make friends anymore, or I never were able to make friends. I wish that if I saw her again, I would be able to go to her and start talking like she has already done to me. Just a casual conversation. One time she came from my behind and started to have conversation with me. And you can guess how that  affected me. Well, first of all my legs, it stopped working, I couldn't move them properly or my mouth and voice. I was.. somehow able to play it cool and she even freaking hugged me at the end of our conversation. Such a blessing girl, good lord. It seemed I couldn't get over her after all. You may ask me, why I didn't ask for her phone number, well. Me being retarded, I thought we would see each other again and I don't want to ask for a phone number when she came to me. I thought I should've started the conversation otherwise I am no good for her. So I didn't ask for her phone number and yes, three years and nothing, lool. Shit, I am so lame. Of course, she liked my profile picture on my facebook, which is actually pretty good, considering, that I am not even good for any sort of likes because I despite the way I look. Like why, some people that I have seen and talked for years didn't like the photo, but a great looking and blessing girl as she is, suddenly likes my photo. I mean, I know for instance, here where I live, Finland, a like means a lot, and you don't give them unless you know each other. She liked my profile picture and such a small thing as that is, made my day. It was blessing. 

I want some advice how you would do in my situation, how you could become confident and social. I am not confident because my father has pretty shit self-esteem and always talked about his nose being big and ugly, suddenly I too look at my nose. Takes these to consideration, I am from Kurdistan, I do not have any relatives here in Finland, and I got no friends. Only my beloved brother and sister. I don't think I am good to become friend with Europeans for whatever reason. I have lived here for a 18 years. I know the language so and so. Good pronunciation. I prefer to be friend with more European like, I hate our culture. ",24Oct2018,1
253,"I work in a very small office with only a handful of people. We all get on extremely well and enjoy working as a team. I really like my job and I feel like it's a big part of my life. Even though I've only been working there for under a year, it has helped gain confidence in my abilities and encouraged me to come out of my shell due to the supportive environment in the office. 

My sister, along with many of my friends, have recently been finding it difficult to get a job. Wanting to leave the sector she currently works in and get a more stable job she often asked for advice and help. My boss repeatedly asked if we knew of anyone interested in working with us so once my sister asked if we were hiring I felt obligated to tell her we were. This feeling of obligation came from my insistent need to help those around me (probably a narcissistic people-pleasing satisfaction). 

I relayed this information to my boss and he was more than happy to consider her for a temporary position. She basically had this job once I asked. My boss asked if I thought she'd be interested in the same position as myself. This is what got to me and my pride. When I got this job I saw it as a big achievement and from then on every praise and advancement within the job filled me with pride as I saw this as the beginning of a career. It's a given now that she will get the job for the same position as myself.

Growing up myself and my sister weren't very close. Thinking back I consider how she treated me near psychological bullying, often spreading rumors and constantly trying to embarrass me in front of my friends with a strong feeling of malice that I never understood. How she made me feel, embarrassed and small, returns rarely but has done in certain situations growing up. I was and am closer with my brothers, with a certain level of mutual trust and similar interests but I usually only take my sister in small does, not often and far between. 

My fears are that she will change the culture in the office  from being a fun-loving, understanding, and supportive environment to a cold, pretentious, judgemental atmosphere in which I will not feel comfortable and I will once again experience those feeling of being embarrassed and small in a place I've learned to feel the opposite. As well as this, I have a selfish feeling of not wanting to share, as I know she will not appreciate this opportunity as I have. And of course I also have the feeling that she will steal my thunder in this job. 

This latter fear I understand more and feel more confident in dealing with but I'm not so sure about the aforementioned ones. I know this is long winded but if anyone has and advice they would give or have been in a similar situation, I would very much appreciate any thoughts or suggestions as I haven't been able to talk with anyone about this.

254,There’s this girl that I’ve just getting to know and she’s told me that she thinks I’m funny and nice and I don’t know what to reply to her. I want to keep the conversation going while still getting to know her. Any ideas of my reply??,24Oct2018,1
255,"When I was 15 (now 22) I got a message from a woman on Facebook claiming to be my half sister’s mother.  She told me that they both wanted to me meet me. Until this point I thought I just had my one younger brother that I had grown up with, so obviously I was a bit confused and surprised. I asked my mom about this and she sat me down and confirmed that I do have a half-sister. Turns out my dad had a child with another woman before I was born. He’s now a drug addict living his messy truth somewhere in a nearby state and I havent seen him in several years. But it turns out everyone knew about this except my brother and I, even my cousins had been sworn to secrecy as children for reasons I have yet to understand. 

When this woman messaged me she told me that they both wanted to meet me and my brother, and invited us down to their house to stay for a few days and get to know each other (they live one state over). But being the 15 year old that I was, I never really followed through because I was nervous and anxious. A couple years later I was at the mall with a friend and suddenly ran into my sister. It was an awkward meeting, and only lasted for a few moments. I felt bad for her because shes known about my brother and I for years, and yet we had no idea she existed. This was all a lot to handle and stirred up complex feelings that have to do with my father and his absence throughout my life. 

Fast forward to when Im 18/19, my half-sister gets married and pregnant. At this point Im working full time and living on my own. They ask me to come down again, I say that I would like to come, but then never follow through for the same reasons as before. Later after my nephew is born, I text my sister and pour my heart out to her and try to explain why I havent come to see them and that Im so happy for her and her husband even though I dont know them that well yet. She never responds. 

Now, Im 22. This morning I checked instagram and saw that she is 8months pregnant with another child. Her son is adorable and I always like her pictures of him on instagram. I don’t do facebook anymore so I never saw any news of her being pregnant again until now and now I have this overwhelming feeling that time is passing us by. I don’t want my father’s mistakes to influence the relationship I have with this person and I want to reach out and get to know my sister. My brother and I are both older now and would like to meet her and our niece and nephew and her husband.

My question is, should I reach out again? After she ignored me the last time, I was worried that maybe it was too late and she didnt want to complicate things for her and her family.  We also live very different life styles, she a southern girl with all the stereotypical southern girl trappings, and me, a young gay artist living in a city. I want to know more about her but Im worried that the ship has sailed and it may be too late. How should I handle this? ",24Oct2018,1

He also posts on his story of him playing all night with his friends and idk, I know it sounds like a dick thing to say. But I was immediately rushed with jealousy. I’m just so angry and jealous and sad and idk why. Just feels like I’m loosing my best friend. I don’t even know if he considers me his best friend, probably not.. just fuckin upsets the shit outta me and I don’t know why. Also I’m mad at myself because anytime I’m around my crush I’m always too nervous to say anything and it pisses me off how hyped I get before I see her then as soon as I see her that hype turns to nervousness and anxiety.  Plus I don’t think it’ll ever work between us. She’s always so busy with school stuff, and I feel like she’s too good for me. She’s smarter, cooler, just better then I am.

258,"So this just happened less than an hour ago. My best friend and I got to school, and my other friend (our mutual friend I guess) started talking to me about this test we recently got back. She was really upset about it and told me about her meeting with the teacher. She told me her letter grade. Then, she told me specifically not to tell my best friend. I agreed because it's not my place to tell other people her business, especially something she's so upset about. When we finished talking, my best friend was already kind of pissed and kept asking what we were talking about. I told her we were just talking about the test we got back. She already knew that, but she wanted details. She kept prying and asking exactly what our mutual friend told me. I told her that it was just the test and how it went badly and I couldn't say anything more. Then, she got EXTREMELY mad at me, saying I never tell her anything and how I was being a terrible friend. She said that from now on she won't tell me anything anymore. I didn't want to tell her that my friend told me specifically not to tell her, so I just told her that it's not my place to tell her other people's business.

Recently I got a call from a company if I’m interested for an interview and it’s for a finance position.

Also, I did not apply for the position directly (There is this website where I just set up my profile and CV all those stuff and I only apply for engineering position)

262,"Fair warning, this is a bit long..

           So I work in a factory, a food factory. We have to follow certain rules, procedures, policies the company has, blah blah blah. When I got hired on to this company, I already had eyelash extensions. No one noticed nor asked. When I signed the contract/orientation I guess I signed a paper agreeing that I wouldn’t do things like paint my nails, wear acrylics, no facial piercings, and no fake lashes. I wasn’t sure if extensions counted as the strip eyelashes, seeing as they are literally glued to my lashes. 
          I get lash extensions because of my struggling ED. I have very small, almost non-existent lashes now that are very brittle. I guess it’s only cosmetic, but they make me feel immensely better about myself.
          Fast forward to a couple days ago, a woman asked if they were real, I thought she was just like interested in getting some? So I told her about how I get them done because I don’t have much/many eyelashes. Well this lady instantly snaps and tells me I can’t stay for my shift or job if I don’t “take them out/off”.. so I get upset and have a panic attack. I disclosed to one of my fellow employees why I was so upset, bc my ED causing me to lose lashes and I’ve spent a lot of money on them. Well he tells my supervisor. Supervisor asks me, I start crying. Supervisor says he’ll take care of it. Then I have to explain about them and why I have them to our quality person, then my plant manager, and HR. Word even got out, so now other/most of my fellow employees know about my ED. (I cried every time I explained why i didn’t want to get rid of them) 
Then I’m given 3 options:
1. Go to a different section of the plant (I’ve befriended everyone in my group)
2. Get them removed
3. Wear goggles (they’re not sure if I can but if I can I guess this is an irrelevant post)
4. Quit
           My supervisor said he’s going to try to fight it.

So I text her the next day to tell her I had a great time with her and she texted me back the day after that to say she also had a great time with me. then we did a little light texting for a week, nothing much neither of us are big into texting.

He contemplated putting it in storage and then ultimately decided he was going to donate to Salvation Army, only he never did. I got so tired of seeing it that I asked my dad to bring his truck and took it upon myself to take it to Salvation Army. 

He will often leave dishes out right next to the sink, in the sink, or even right above the dishwasher even when the dishwasher is not even close to full. 

The most recent instant was him leaving some clothes in the common living room. They have been out there since at least this past Sunday.

266,"Hi, I'm 23 male, before the age of 19/20 i used to be very extrovert, have loads of friends and talk a lot about anything, make people laugh I always knew what and how to say stuff. I also used to drink and get drunk maybe 2 times per week between the age of 14-19. I was above average in school, for me it was relatively easy to learn any kind of new stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I feel that my brain capacity is going down like every 6 months. It begun to be more difficult for me to write and express myself (even on this post); 

Almost every film/ tv series episode I watch, i struggle to remember it even the next day, like i feel like i would only remember the main idea, sometimes if i watch it while high on weed, after a week from watching it maybe i could even re-watch it again and don't even realise i've seen it!;

When i'm in social environments at uni, with friends and we talk I feel i'm acting awkward and that i'm struggling to talk to them/ to have a saying, like they would talk to me and i would only reply with simple answers, being it hard for me to say something interesting or to think on how to phrase my response (like wtf i used to be extremely confident and had a lot of mental agility when it came to these things)

I am having arguments with my girlfriend and when i try to prove my point stating why she's wrong i can't remember even if there are things she does on a weekly basis.

&amp;#x200B;

The only lifestyle changes from me at 20's and me now at 23 is that now I barely drink and go out, maybe I would get drunk once a month or so (at best) but drink frequently on small quantities, such as 2-3 glasses of wine/beers a week.

However, I have started smoking weed, i smoke around 0.5g a week (usually only during friday and saturday as a rule) and I'm starting to get frustrated thinking that this is what makes me stupid but is it really?  

Being ''average'' in any way (professional, academic, personal) scares the shit out of me and i feel i am slowly going to that direction and because of that I aknowledged the fact that i feel my brain capacity is not what it used to be 2-3-4 years ago so I started doing some basic meditation, keeping a journal and doing some research on how to improve my issue but i didn't find much and I don't feel what i'm doing is working out.

The job actually pays decent and they give a lot of bonuses and options for time off but I just can't deal with this anymore.

269,"So about several weeks ago, Ima comment I made got pinged because the mod interpreted as racist. I then messaged him essentially explaining to him what the comment meant the guy bans me for 60 days from the reddit, the ban claiming that my racist comment led to it. Thoroughly annoyed by the stupidity of the sotuation, I messaged the mods asking to explain how stupid this contraversy was. Same guy pops in and tells me that me messaging him got me banned due to it it violating the ruleseven though there was no mention of it.

So, let’s take a step back here. So essentially mods on that page can ping your comment and you can’t defend yourself or get it appealed or you get banned. But that’s not the issue here, the issue is I got banned for 60 days over something as petty as messaging a mod. 

Now since I liked the subreddit, I decided to just wait it out since calling him out or anything similar would do nothing. However I would like advice to know how to react when something like this occurs again which I know it will.

275,"I’m not sure if this is the place for this, or if there would be somewhere better to ask, but I’m starting to get uncomfortable and frustrated with my dreams. I have always had (what I felt like were) overly realistic dreams, that are sometimes hard to separate from reality, and take a long time to come down from. Now, they’re not just strange/bizarre dreams, rather, they’re taking on similar apocalyptic/deadly themes. Every time, there just this awful nauseating feeling knowing we’re all going to die.

It seems as if these dreams are getting more frequent and more intense. Here are the three most recent:

Dream 1: Standing in the top of a sky scraper and looking out at the sky. Seeing what is the sun, but looks like the moon, and it’s kind of dark-ish outside. Suddenly, poof, it looks like the sun implodes, and then there’s an immediately impending feeling that we are all about to freeze to death.

Dream 2: Outside in a desert type area. Fire ball comes out of the sky and lands on the horizon. Out of the fireball, this rocket rises up. The top part opens like a flower and a large cylinder is angled from pointing vertically to horizontally. Machine gun type fire ensues and is sprayed while the cylinder rotated in a circle. Cut scene to somewhere in a town. I am a child and my mother (who doesn’t actually look like my real life mother) tells me co call 9-1-1. I call and a robotic voice answers and says, “Thank you for making us aware of your location. Someone will be with you shortly.”  I know it’s too late and we messed up. My mother has my climb down into a floor access in the bathroom, which happens to contain another identical carpeted bathroom, to hide from the alien/robot things when they show up. The entire time though, there’s just this sick feeling that you know the world is ending.

Dream 3: Somewhere in an open, flat area. Hear this deafening sound and this surge of jets fly out from a small circle spreading outwards. They begin flying all over the place, and (similar to the previous dream) machine gun fire begins. They’re shooting everyone, and these planes are able to hover over vehicles, nose down, just unloading rapid fire into them. All I can think, as I stand by watching, is how we are all going to die.

280,"So wall of text incoming...

A little over two years ago my (M/28) girlfriend (F/26) broke up with me. I was head over feet about her, she was everything to me. Prior to her coming along I had basically avoided women and relationships because I had this deep down fear of abandonment and of a girl basically just leaving me in the middle of the night without any reason (this happened to me my freshman year of college after a ~1 year relationship). But she was everything to me, and everything I look for in a mate, and of course she broke up with me. She broke up with me by ghosting me basically (7 month relationship) then finally breaking up over text, never stating a reason, just that “maybe this is over between us.”  So my worst fear basically came to fruition. 

In the past two years we’ve actually maintained a decent friendship despite the fact she ducks and dodged the topic of our past relationship, so I still don’t know what happened to end the relationship. But I still love her and still care about her even though she’s given me every reason not to. People have told me to distance myself from her, I tried. And it made me feel even worse and made me miss her even more. 

Anyway I still love her, and I’ve tried dating. Been on 10+ dates the past 2 years, talked to dozens more women. For the most part they’ve been great, women who I otherwise would probably have no problem creating something serious with. However my feelings for my ex prevent me from feeling anything about these other women and I usually end up calling things off before things get even more serious. At one point it was because I’d held out hope we would get back together, now it’s simply because my feelings for my ex prevent me from forming a bond with any potential mates. I put myself out there, I’m confident in myself and have a decent personality, it’s just the fact that I can’t get over the fact I still love my ex. 

Add to fact that all of my best friends are now in serious relationships, leaving just me to myself. The friend who I’d normally talk to about this stuff moved about a year ago and we never talk anymore. My father who normally gives great advice, can’t say anything more than “it’s been 2 years, move on”. I can’t, it’s just not as simple as flipping a switch and moving on. Like I said I’ve tried cutting off contact with my ex, but that only intensifies how I feel about her, and drives me insane. I’m to the point I’m actively avoiding any women that might show the slightest hint of interest because I don’t want to hurt them or lead them on in anyway.

Lately things have been really REALLY bad. 

she’s yelling at me for small stuff (like leaving a box on the stockroom floor, one time, that I’m almost 90% wasn’t even me). She tells us to call her whenever we have questions and every time I call to ask a question she starts yelling at me about something else, completely unrelated to what I asked (like a box on the ground or the “lack of communication because I have a thick skull”). 

She blames me for EVERYTHING. Seriously. 
We had a big project to do that someone cleared out of our system and didn’t leave any notes so I didn’t know to do it and there was no where to find it, and I’m the one who got yelled at. 

My coworkers have seen that she will call me and berate me so bad that I start crying (like when I call for advice on a reset and she starts cursing saying that I should be further along). 

I was homeless at 16-17, slept in my car a lot and couch hoped. We were talking about something that happened in our area and I hadn’t even said anything rude and she said to me, in front of EVERYONE, that if I was ever “really homeless” I would understand. No reason why she’d say this as she knew that I was. 

I have already decided to pursue a new job but until then I’m at a loss. It’s getting so bad everyone is noticing it, even new hires who have only worked a shift or two. 

It is hard for me to even WANT to work hard for her whole I am here or to even come in. I am getting verbally attacked every day. 

Help. Idk what to do. 

tl;dr- boss hates me for whatever reason and yells daily. hurting my will to work and live at this point.

I think it's also worth mentioning that me and her went to the club in the same group. She came with her friend and I came with a few of mine.  We danced around each other for most of the night but I never got the vibe that she was interested in me at all. Towards the end of the night she made a move in me and we ended up making out for quite a while before she gave me her number and left. I messaged her the day after and we ended up having a casual conversation just getting to know each other better, nothing out of the ordinary. About 2 days later I find out that she's been talking to her friend about me and she seems to really like me. After that we just continued having casual conversations for several days before making plans to meet up. It was obvious to both of us that we were both interested in each other at this point. Long story short we started making out and it seemed to be going further from there until she just suddenly stopped and seemed to lose all interest. Just like that any kind of spark between us just vanished. I messaged her a day later and sure enough her feelings towards me seemed to have changed. Now I realize this is probably just due to a lack of experience but I'm having a hard time wrapping me head around why exactly this went down the way it did.

 ex: They would speak ""Hi"" , i would speak back then they'd ask ""hows your day"" and i'd respond telling them how was it. instantly, they may respond with one word i don't reply, what can i reply to that tho.

 long story i'm a very cool person i love to have conversations not much in person bcoz im shy but i would if i see u are a great person, but especially through text im very hook on to conversations i like to help others and try to give advice but not with everyone i have to feel that you are worthy of a conversation or help

anyways many guys tell me i'm very attractive i say ""thank you"" because i dont want to be rude and leave them on seen"" but i talk to ""guys"" on social not girls bcos girls don't talk to me or be in my inbox lol. so all i have is guy followers and guys in my inbox and some of them guys makes it seems more than what it is it, when we are having a normal conversation nothing sexual or anything. they just ask normal questions (Some do) , we talk about regular things bcos im a very nice person but im mean at the sametime if that makes sense. 

anyways i love to text and have conversations but every guy i talk to instantly catch feelings as if we agreed to dating or they make it seem like we are a thing but we never ever agreed on it. so i tend to leave some of my messages unread bcos guys catching feelings and they take my kind conversations as if we are together and they call me baby or say i missed u. ""I dont know what to respond to that"" again i dont want to be mean to everyone i try to be friendly and i want to show my followers love by interacting with them, but they take it to an extreme. where to if you was an outsider looking in you'll think i dated all of these guys. but im single, and im looking for someone but i dont move quickly into a relationship. i love to take things slow i love to start off as your friend or while im single i want a guy best friend but i meet some guys they want sexting if i dont give it to them they leave, i talk to guys as a friend he start being affection so early on in the talking stage and hes assume we together when we aren't, i tell them i want friendship than if turns into something more fine

 When high school came, we had to go to different schools because there are 2 and location decides where u go. During the football season we both didn’t talk as much, due to lack of time on both ends. 

Whenever I would ask him to hangout on weekends or breaks he would always make excuses not to hangout with me Ex:Don’t feel like it, Tired, Don’t really like hanging out (in general). But then he hangs out with friends from his school. He still likes playing games with me but won’t hangout. 

///Something to note is that since we’ve played games together I’ve always had money to buy games I want because of the fact that my parents have paid off my house, their car, we don’t own a cottage boat or anything like that,  and my parents had a rough childhood so they like letting us get what we want (within reason obviously). 

I am in my second year of high school and it has been along time since we hung out, but if I suggest a game we should get he usually says “if you buy it for me”,  and I say no so we don’t get it.    He recently got an Xbox and convinced me to game share with him so we could play a. Game together I own.  His reason why I should was “we could play together” and along the lines of that and has been arrogant and ignores me a lot. He is also cool sometimes too and normal but there are some days where he’s just an asshole. I have other friends to play with, but I also want to play with him.

Our honeymoon phase was naturally very romantic and even after we got comfortable, I would still occasionally surprise her with flowers when she came home from work, write her poems, draw her comics (I'm a cartoonist) or carry her around princess-style. 

However, as our relationship goes on, I'm noticing that she is becoming increasingly impatient and now it doesn't take much at all to make her angry. She says she has always been a naturally angry and impatient person, so I figure this is just her true nature slowly coming back. However, due to this, we fight much more often now and things are noticeably less romantic between us. The surprise-flowers and poems have gradually slowed until I now rarely do these things, because we're always in an uneasy mood with each other.

This upset her because she enjoyed the romantic stuff, but it's hard to be romantic with her when she's so irritable that she turns any little bump in the road into a big fight. We had an argument recently, in which she told me that she wants to have things like putting her head on my chest and hearing my heartbeat speed up, or to hold my hand and see my face blush. While admittedly romantic, I can't help feeling like all the romance fiction and shojou anime she watches is giving her these unrealistic ideas of how relationships are supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Such trauma include:

* A problematic relationship with my mom who disapproves of my homosexuality and is on the bible-thumping spectrum (we used to be extremely close until I came out to her in my teenage years)
* Coming to terms with my sexuality (more of how my mom made it seem that being gay would lead to a live of unhappiness, lack of success, misery, etc.)
* Religion/spirituality: I used to be very spiritual and pray a lot, but ever since my mom said I was going to hell, I kind of lost touch and felt distant from my initial beliefs. She also forced me to attend a bible-study group, that ended up just giving me a weekly dose of extreme anxiety
* Hung up over a boy, who broke up with me out of the blue 10 years ago, and now has a girlfriend (he probably cheated on me). Said boy wants to stay in touch ""friends"" but it ends up triggering and bringing back the depression he made me feel when he left me.

Nowadays, all I do is take naps in the afternoon, turn down invitations to hang out. I want to try going to the gym but I'm too scared/anxious about it. I've never dated in over 10 years because I still feel damaged from my last relationship.

Didn't mean to be melodramatic by sharing all this, but I am genuinely trying to get my life together, and I feel like most of my battles with anxiety stem from that which I have mentioned. I don't think I'm suicidal; I've never attempted it, though there have been a handful of days where I seriously played with the idea of killing myself. Never followed through.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, given all of this, I am unsure on which kind of doctor I need to seek help from. I cannot determine whether I am actually depressed or suffering from clinical anxiety. Or maybe I just have a lot of childhood trauma that ended screwing me up.

309,"I moved out of my parents’ house a few years ago because my mom essentially kicked me out. She didn’t like that I was partying all night and never liked my friends. After moving out, I stayed on my own for about 2 years. After that time, I decided it was time for me to get my life together, get myself into law school and all that jazz. So I moved back into my parents and I told them I would be out within a few months. Those few months turned into about 2 years. During that time things were ok in that I got my shit together, got into law school, got my finances in check (to a certain extent given that I’m a student again), etc.
 
For a year now, I’ve been toying with the idea of moving out. I’ve been wanting to move to my parents’ downstairs ground floor apartment because I don’t want to stay too far away from them because 1: theyre old; 2. My dog is old too &amp; has health issues and 3. I still will need some of their help (car, meals, etc). However, the people downstairs aren’t leaving any time soon and my parents don’t seem eager to push them out. I can’t really force them/it either.
 
Before I continue, here are my two main reasons for wanting to leave:
1. I want my own space. I miss having my own kitchen, my own bathroom, decorate how I want, etc. and
2. I need to refine my daily routine, more specifically, a work/school/relaxation balance that at home I can’t manage to do.
 
So for the last 2-3 months (since ive been in law school) my mother’s been bugging me a bit more than usual and my dad is too. Essentially, without getting into too much details, its that im beginning to become easily irritated by them (at minuscule things) likely due to too much exposure, lack of sleep, more stress. Also, ironically, when I moved out, I felt that they respected the fact that I’m an adult and not a child anymore.
 
Here are a few things that have pissed me off as of late, in case you did want details: 
 
1. The last 3 weeks ive been studying for midterms. HARD.CORE. I was working 9-5. Going to class 6-10 (which is my normal routine) but I would also go to campus (in queens) on the weekends all day and stay till 3-4AM and on the weekdays when I did that, I’d get up at 7am to go right back to work. It was brutal! I would sometimes stay in my office till that time too to get studying done and papers done. Unfortunately, these are things that need to be done when you’re balancing school AND work. So after some time my mom texted me and was like… “oh I wanna talk to you about getting home late and never spending time with us.” Im like BRO. im STUDYINGGGGG. I’m not out hanging around getting wasted or partying it up, I too don’t want to be at school till late at night, not getting enough sleep and going to work right after that. Im physically drained and mentally drained. So I had to stop her in her tracks and said, look im not out partying im studying. Quit it. But that shit annoyed the fuck outta me. She was like… “oh I stay up late waiting for you.” Who told you to stay up late? And who told you to worry? Sheesh. 

2. This Sunday I was taking a shower and I noticed my conditioner was missing in it and I asked my mom, while in the shower, did you take it? Shes like yeah, here you go. Im soaking, getting out of the shower to get it from here and I grilled the SHIT out of her. Normally, I wouldn’t be mad that someone took my things but at that moment I was like… I gotta move. It’s the little things that pile up and one day we’re going to go back to square one. Where she’s going to be fed up with my lifestyle and I’m going to be irritated beyond belief with my parents and its going to be toxic all around.

After the shower, I started looking on craigslist for an apartment and I FOUND A GOLD MINE! I found an adorable apartment and its $1,200 no realtors fee (that’s almost impossible to find nowadays in my area) and the guy seems to be soooo nice. I’ve spoken to him a few times and he seems like he likes me a lot based on the fact that I’m working full time, go to school, I’m not married and don’t have kids (the place is small) and bc he knows I’m coming from a family nearby and I’m not an irresponsible kid going to mess up his place. 

Thing is that the place is available November 1st but I’m not ready for that, that’s wayyyy too quick. That’s next Friday! So I told myself, im going to ask him to move in dec 1, if he says yes, then its clear the place is for me because he said hes been getting a lot of inquires but people are weirdo, or they’re trying to fit in like 4+ people in that small place and he just wants the right candidate. So I spoke to him last night and he said yes!! That makes me think.. yeah this place is meant for me and it gives me 2-3 more paychecks to save more money for emergencies. 

So here’s my dilemma, somehow, Im kinda nervous and I can’t pinpoint why. It’s a mixture of now being 100% financially independent and leaving my parents on their own and my dog too. Although I paid rent at my parents they cut me a break from time to time and I was able to be a little bit more lax on money. Also, I feel bad that my parents (although they refuse to admit it) depend on me and im going to be leaving and I also know my dog can be a burden because she’s got tons of health issues that I pay for and deal with too but my mom’s the one that does most of the hard work with my dog. 

I think im feeling nervous because last time I didn’t have an option, I was basically FORCED to leave so of course, I did and made it work. I also am nervous because I feel like I folded…and didn’t stay on my own throughout, instead I came back and it kinda feel like I’m a failure. But more importantly, I don’t want it to happen again. 

But this offer is too hard to pass up and it seems like its time due to my home environment and I luckily can manage financially. I tell myself, if not now, then when? I’m going to be 30 in 3 years, I gotta get it together. I also need to have my own space, not just a room! I need/want my own privacy and my own routine and studying area (not a house where people are loud and inconsiderate). I’m super torn but I’m leaning toward moving out and just making sure I stay involved with my parents, going over as much as I can and keep an eye on my dog and stuff, doing/going to family dinners. Etc.

Thoughts?
 
Thanks for reading… I know it’s long as hell! 

TLDR: I was kicked out a few years ago, was on my own for two year, came back to my parents to get my life together and did. Now I want to move out but am torn and nervous. ",24Oct2018,1
310,"I'm 27M, however due to a lot of poor decisions on my side, I'm still on the last semester of university, therefore I still receive money from my parents and they still have a say in my affairs. This is important because this last year I have been partying a lot, especially when I reconnected with an old friend of mine I hadn't seen in a while. I've been going out almost every weekend, usually on Saturdays, but on some occasions Fridays as well. At first my family was chill about it, however in time, although they have never denied me permission to go out altogether, they have started making their discomfort visible in many ways. As of lately, almost each time I announce I'm going out, I'm met by pissed faces and constant complaints about when I'm going to slow down. I'm doing OK at school and work, and while I sometimes arrive wasted to my house, I usually just go straight into bed, I don't get into fights, I don't do stupid things, it's just that my parents, especially my mother, have a very conservative stance on alcohol, made especially worse by the constant reports about crime in the news.

There are other points of contention besides partying though: I'm overweight (208 lb, 5'6 guy) and I have been dealing with pressure to lose weight as there is a history of diabetes in both sides of my family, but I have a strong suspicion the real reason (or at least a reason as big as concern for my health) is that they suspect I'm gay (which would be unacceptable to my parents), since I haven't ever had a girlfriend, or, should I say, any kind of success with the opposite sex whatsoever, and they want me to lose weight because they think that once I lose the weight, if I'm still not able to get a girlfriend, then that's it.

So, they came up with apparently the perfect way to force me to stop: I have an untreated toenail fungus, and they have started pressuring me a lot to start the treatment for it, which involves giving up alcohol entirely for at least 3 months. I have been able to stave off the pressure until my birthday, which was recently, but now they have asked me in a very serious manner that I start the treatment NOW, warning me that they allowed me to wait till my birthday and will not wait anymore. Seeing I have no choice, I got my lab work done yesterday, and it turns out that I'm prediabetic as per my glucose levels. I'm yet to see a doctor and figure out what this means exactly to me, but I know that it will probably involve giving up drinking, and therefore giving up partying. Which leaves me very sad. I have only started partying a bit more than a year ago, and my social life went from 0 to 100. I still don't have many close friends, but the ones I have mean a lot to me, and I still manage to meet amazing people in each of my escapades. I have had so many great experiences, started to feel young again in spite of the fact that I'm almost hitting 30, and now, all of a sudden, I might be forced to give it all up and become a homebody again, which would make me depressed. However, I realize that health comes first, but I still don't know how to cope with all this. Any advice will be appreciated. Have a nice day!",24Oct2018,1

[Alternate account]

I’m an 18year old who recently finished high school and i feel i’ve messed up a lot, and im kinda lost. I know there are guys who have it much harder but i just wanted to sort out my thoughts and share a bit.  

TLDR: Lost my passion for basketball/music, can’t study a whit, grew reclusive and socially in-adept. Im avoiding everything. 

Around 9-10th grade, i think i was doing okay. I loved basketball, had good friends, was really getting into music, drums, was progressing with my crush and hated studying to the bone. Normal stuff, i hope. 

Only now do i realize but at some point i started to distance myself from everything. I broke a few bones, and i gradually lost my passion for basketball. I started losing my drive for any musical pursuit too. Had gotten to the point where my crush liked me back but then i stopped talking to her. Never learnt how to sit down, focus and study but rather mastered putting things off for later. Grew more and more introverted and reclusive.

These past two years, 11-12th grade (junior/senior year, a-levels), my grades kept plummeting. Kept repeating to myself, “next time” and yet i ended up playing video games or binge reading comics (manga), ignoring my studies. Stopped going for basketball practices and eventually dropped from the team, grew more disconnected from my teammates who mightve been my closest friends. I guess i didn’t actively approach people, constantly declined hanging out with others. Skipped school, missed deadlines, didnt communicate much. instead i racked up thousands of gaming hours and read thousands of manga chapters. 

Then i took a gap year believing id improve and apply next year. Tried interning for a few weeks and only lasted 4 weeks in a gym. Dived into more gaming and distractions. 

Deadlines for college applications are in sight now yet i havnt even started my essays. On top of that, im repeating my exams because i fucked up last year. I’ve got an exam tomorrow yet here i am. fuck me and my habits. 

My thoughts are getting messier. I guess i just want to ask 

1. how do you buckle down and get work done
2. whats considered a proper friendship. how do you get there. 

I’m a lurker and don’t write much. i don’t expect much from this post but i think ill try to write down and voice out more optimistic thoughts later this weekend. im just a bit confused, kinda frustrated and lost. Um thank you for putting up with my incoherent rambling.

324,"This is probably the most prominent problem in my life which is probably tied, a cause or the effect of other problems in my life. The only place i feel ""safe"" is at home, and i put that in quotation marks because when i'm alone with my thoughts, they are usually not pleasant ones.

At work, my shoulders hurt, i can never relax. I have allways been a loner/social outcast, whatever. When i'm talking to other people i allways automaticly choose to say what will please the other person, i can't say no most of the time, like being extremely afraid of confrontation or someone disliking me. I just work, not talk with anybody (Or when someone engages with me in a conversation i just do what i mentioned above) and rush back home.

There is a girl at work i like which i have been rejected by, and i've taken that so badly that i look forward to the days she is not at work so my anxiety levels don't have a reason to be even higher due to seeing her talking with another guy or something. (Worst part is being rejected, accepting that i've been rejected but having my mind still bother with it).

I start things and promptly abandon them because i'm bored or because i feel like i didn't start right, and when i say things i mean even the tiniest things such as a little bit of exercise, eating just a little bit healthier, cleaning a little bit more. I can't keep focus on one thing and push through no matter how boring or dull it gets.

This allways keeps me down, my self-esteem might aswell be non-existent. No matter what a friend might say about me, no matter how positive, it allways rubs off. Whenever someone tells me to relax, i just get angry. It's like telling the fat kid to simply stop eating food.

I live alone, the times that i'm at home distracted by music are probably the most pleasant ones i have.

I don't want to involve friends with my problems, because more people knowing about my problems is not what i want.

325,"A little backstory. During high school one of my friends had a ""cool mom"" that would buy us booze, sell us drugs etc. (And yes, it's true that the ""cool moms"" are actually just bad moms and you don't realize it until later on in life). At that time we would only drink when we would have a party at said friends house, which was maybe once or twice a month. Being a real lightweight at the time, I would buy a handle and drink a little bit of it that night and take the rest home. I just really loved the feeling of being drunk. I've always had pretty bad depression/anxiety and grew up in a household where the thought was ""oh you're depressed? You must not be reading the Bible enough"". I started drinking nightly when I had liquor available which wasn't often, so I never really craved it at the time. It was just a nice escape that I looked forward to. Then after I graduated some friends got an apartment and would host parties almost nightly. I would almost always be there and would ALWAYS get hammered when I was. It just got rid of all my anxiety and depression and made me sociable, funny, and pretty much everything I wanted to be while sober. I would still get friends to buy me alcohol since I wasn't 21 yet so it wasn't always available to me but when it wasn't I started to crave the feeling it gave me. Then I turned 21 and oh boy. Now I could get it myself. Since then I've been drunk or at least had a drink almost every night for the past few years. I'm about to be 24 and it's turned into a habit. I go through a handle of whiskey every few nights. It's not helping me at all and I've just been getting more depressed. I really want to stop I just don't know how.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 28 and my fiance is 26. We both recently moved from Boston to San Francisco not because of work, but because we wanted to experience at least once in our life what its like to live on the West coast. Ultimately, we will move back to the north east (NY/CT) to be closer to our parents to take care of them but for now while they are healthy we are adventuring out. Our move to SF isn't a long term move either. We are leaving after end of next year.

Both of us are architects. We haven't had trouble finding jobs here either. We don't have a wedding date planned due to some family drama.

When I was studying architecture, I always wanted to live in Japan to work for one of my favorite firms there who does disaster relief projects. However I fell in love and sacrificed that dream because I don't want to drag someone with me. We have been talking about spending at least a year in Japan to work but are unsure when is the best time.

Right now, we both miss our friends and family in the East coast since moving to SF. My point I try to make is that lets do the Japan thing sooner rather than later to rip of a band aid instead of slowly pulling it off. Her point is that we should move to NYC after SF and be closer to people. And that we can retire to Japan or go when we have kids or something, but my argument is the health of our family, and right now they are healthy.

I’m in an argument with my SO and I really don’t know who is right here. I created, yes just me, a PlayStation account a couple of years ago. My girlfriend bought the PlayStation because she was tired of me owning literally everything in the apartment. So I put the account in her email. I made the username and have paid for everything since. I pay for most the services (HBO, ps plus, Netflix, Amazon) and ALL games, while she pays for Hulu and Spotify. I have put at least a 1000 hours into playing while she has less than 100 hours. All the achievements and such are me at least 90%.

When she saw this she freaked out, we are moving out and each going to our parents next month. So who gets the account?

337,"Hi guys. Super long- sorry. I [23F] come from a very unconventional family. I have 12 siblings (2 step, 10half) all together, 8 of which are from my moms side (the 2 step, 6 of the half siblings). The second youngest [20M] on that side has a meth problem. Ever since he was 13 and kicked out of school for smoking weed in the bathroom, he’s struggled. My mom and step dad did everything they could to prevent him from smoking and no matter the consequences for doing it or the rewards for not, he always ended up getting caught every 2 weeks - the kid would not stop. This was a struggle all throughout high school and there never ended up being any relief to the problem. 

-Note that my mom and step dad don’t hate weed or think it’s this horrible thing, in fact they have both smoked. What worried them was his seeming dependence on it in order to be happy or feel like life meant anything - so all in all just a very unhealthy relationship with it. 
 
Well, no matter what they did, it never seemed to help my little brother. On top of the weed dependency he stole from everybody, family, friends and eventually he broke into his drug dealers house (the day after he turned 18), stole some shit and got himself into a world of trouble because he was caught on camera. This then lead to another world of problems for his mental health and the already negative image he had of himself. The thanksgiving shortly after this incident(2yrs ago), news broke that he was doing meth and was up against some serious charges related to the drugs - which landed him in jail a few times. This is all especially depressing because he’s a super smart kid, school always came easy and he can be a total charmer - when he isn’t lying, stealing and playing mind games. He’s been clean for a minute but just lost his job last night - if he’s caught for anything drug related, it’s off to prison, so he’s really trying - but fuck dude, I know it’s gotta be hard.

Before I get to the advice part it’s important to understand a little more about my family situation and where I’m coming from. I am the first in my immediate family to graduate from college, my degree is in social work, though I’m not a practicing social worker but a nanny. I moved out of my moms house and into my dads my freshman year of high school - a much more stable situation at the time. Of my moms biological children (excluding the 2 step) she has 7 and with 6 different men - not shaming her by any means but it’s important to see how many different people and parenting styles we are dealing with. My dad is really the only one who is a worthy human being and I got fucking lucky - he’s an amazing dude. My other siblings either don’t know their dads or wish they didn’t. All of my siblings on this side have really struggled in a lot of ways I never really had to, but fortunately the majority are doing pretty damn well as of now - excluding the two youngest (the others are older than me).

The person this advice is focused around is my 17 year old brother in his junior year of high school, who was extremely close with the meth addicted brother. They are the only two on my moms side to share a dad - we all lived with their dad for many of our younger years - it wasn’t pretty. But when my mom divorced him finally, none of us had to see him anymore, except for the younger two, every once in a while. Which definitely has something to do with their inner demons. 

Well the 17yo has obviously struggled with the whole meth situation - his best friend was pretty much ripped from his hands in one of the most depressing ways. He now lives alone with my mom and step dad and goes to a school he hates with people he hates and is really starting to show some similar, less extreme patterns of behavior as the 20yo did. He smokes weed often, even when he knows he’s going to be drug tested, then when he’s punished he says suicidal and self deprecating things - which makes it super hard for my mom to punish. He very much struggles in school and always has, unlike the 20yo - which is where I have beef with my mom - she’s a great person but has never put the time or effort or thought into enforcing good grades in school for any of us. If a kid is failing classes and continually struggling, I really believe the parent is the issue, not the kid, and teachers can only do so much. So he has bad grades, he thinks he’s dumb and that the future holds very little for him. He is passionate about nothing. His immediate solution is to get a full time job (currently has no job) and do online schooling. He has very similar school patterns as I did before I moved with my dad - I would get all C’s and fail a class here and there - I cared but nobody pushed me, which I very much needed. That structure came through when I moved to my dads and I really began to excel - which felt so fucking great. The self fulfilling prophecy yeah? So without his teachers there to push him to do the work for online schooling I really doubt he will push himself or end up getting a diploma. This online school also just further isolates him from the rest of the world - and he’s already so lonely. — He already thinks so little of his future, and I agree that college isn’t for everybody, but when was the last time you heard someone complain they went to high school and got their diploma? I only know people who didn’t get it and really fucking wish they had. 

My mom is the type of person who would rather pretend things aren’t happening around her because she suffers from extreme anxiety - for understandable reasons. But this mixed with raising teenagers has proven to lead to some pretty dark and upsetting shit. I’m constantly called for advice on how to help - my advice with the 20yo and now the 17yo has always been to see a doctor about depression for potential antidepressants and for a therapist referral - we can go from there. Well this advice was never taken for the 20yo and I fear it won’t be taken for the 17yo either. I already have so much guilt for having moved away from these two when I was in high school - it may have benefited me endlessly to leave, and I don’t regret it, but had I stayed - I really think life wouldn’t have been so troubled for these two. Seeing one human you helped teach to walk and talk when they were 2 and you were 5, sit behind a glass wall while you talk through a phone with one another  3 feet apart about meaningless shit because you’re unsure if it feels worse to visit or not visit - is hard enough. 

I also suggested the 17yo switch schools so he can be around people he maybe doesn’t hate (not that I really think this is all the fault of his current classmates) and get a part time job to feel a part of something and meet friends in a positive setting. He has excuses as to why he doesn’t want to do this.. things like it being an extra 10 minute drive before and after school... 

ADVICE: How do I help my mom help the 17yo help himself so he doesn’t end up in the world of hurt the 20yo is in? How can I do more, how can I get her to do more? Because surely it’s easier to do the hard work now rather than once it’s too late and we are all just faced with the hurt, yeah? I’m so scared they will commit suicide before they even have a chance to live a life they love and feel proud of- and I’m so scared of what any more of this will do to my mom, let alone a suicide.

339,"Some context: I manage an online social community(mostly from gaming circles). For the past two or so years, we’ve grown to be super close, in some cases more so than real life friends. A while ago, a member with whom I’m decently close to posted the passage above in a space I made for sharing real life problems/struggles. However, much unlike the “common” topics of depression and relationship help, this one is much more serious. As we’re essentially anonymous online and there’s nothing super revealing in the passage (plus the fact that he was comfortable enough to share it openly with my community), I thought I would ask for the advice of internet strangers. 


&gt; so I feel kinda down and depressed and I like you all  so I thought I'd vent all of my emotions into this channel because I feel like I need to because it feels like I'm about to collapse, so this is mainly about the whole situation in my country, I live in Venezuela right, and dunno if you guys might've heard of the whole economical situation over here but it's pretty fucked up, we're probably the lowest minimum payment country in the whole of South America, with just about 10$ a month, I know it might sound ridiculous or fake but it's the truth, mainly because that's the price it has in the black market which is where we base our economy around, so living here is extremely rough, people are homeless, starving, and doing the best they can to live another day, and it's really heartbreaking, which is the main reason why a lot of Venezuelans have migrated to another neighboor countries like Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, even Brasil, because they simply couldn't take it anymore and they had no future here, now even in other countries the whole situation isn't better for everyone that migrates, we often get discriminated from said countries due to our status, offended, saying awful things to us and that we should go back to our country, when all we want is to try to keep going forward in our life and hope for a brighter future, friends that have left the country often tell me that they get hired and then later on fired for no reason and that it's rough but they simply can't go back because it's gonna be worse, at least they can afford to eat meals most of the time, sometimes it's like 5pm and I've only eaten a piece of bread in the morning without anything to add into it, as for myself I'm 22 years old and studying computer programing, trying to live day by day in this depressed state that I feel like I'm in, why? because I can't do anything I feel like I should be doing, I can't buy clothes because it's expensive

&gt; I can't buy my favorite food/desserts because it's too much money, I can't go to the cinema with a single friend because just the two of us would cost us pretty much a whole month a salary to go together to the cinema, since to put into perspective, the minimum payment is 1800 B.S, and the entrance to the cinema is 320 each and a big box of popcorn with 2 cokes is 960, so you can already get the idea how fucked up the economy is, I can't go to a party with friends because there's not enough money, I can't to the beach on a weekend with friends to have a good time because we don’t have enough money, I can’t go to the club on a Friday for the same reasons, all I’ve left to do is spend most of my days in my house, in my room, on the pc doing whatever to make time so I can finally go to sleep and then live another day the same way, over, and over, and over… I just feel like I’m wasting up my youth away because I’m not doing anything with my life because I simply CAN’T, and people around me simply tell me to have faith, things will get better, when the fuck is that supposed to happen? In 20 years when I’m over 40 and I can’t do the same things I should be doing right now?

&gt; Like I’ve big dreams, I want to have my own apartment or house, buy myself a car, get a job, and many more things, and I just feel like every single one of them is being slowly crushed by the reality that I live in this country, as if there was no escape to this misery I’m living, because I want to be independent and not live with my family for the rest of my life because I simply can’t afford to have my own place, like I feel like I’m useless and I’m bound to live in my room for the rest of my life if I stay in this country, I just want to feel happy that I’m achievement the goals I’ve in my life but they just seem like dreams in here, right now my days are pretty much getting up in the morning, eat whatever is available throughout the day, go to the gym in the afternoon (because I couldn’t take it anymore just being in the house all day), play some stuff on the pc or watch youtube and then go to sleep at night, and that’s just it, no going out, no hanging out with friends, not doing almost anything because I simply can’t due to economic reasons, and I’m not the only one in this situation, pretty much all the friends I’ve are going through the same struggles, and it breaks my heart, because we’re young and we shouldn’t be living like this and it just feels like the only alternative every one of us have is leave this country to rot on what it has bring upon itself due to the mentality of the people who support this shitty government

So yeah, pretty powerful stuff and not exactly something I can *really* do anything about. So what I’m asking is what can I do? Adopt a “oh well, suck it up” mentality and realize I can’t do anything? Is there anything I can at least say that doesn’t sound like empty encouragement? For context, I live in the US so it’s not as if I can truly understand whats really going on over there. Any help or advice would be appreciated.",24Oct2018,1
340,"Ironically this is the first time I am at a loss. Usually I am really good at managing my emotions staying calm. Like I am never really too upset over cancelled plans or trip or anything and I always have a way to deal with my emotions. I was never too worried for my brother who went overseas in Europe for months. I was also never too worried for my anyone in general. 

But ever since my boyfriend enlisted via a mandatory conscription in my country, I can't help but worry constantly on his well being. Being in the military is a whole new ball game and normal rules and regulations don't apply. Suddenly I found myself in constant stress over his well being and if he is being treated well. It doesn't help that the punishments are harsh and he tends to risk take a few times. 

I thought the emotions would get better with time, but it has been 5 months and I still feel as anxious. I have tried distracting myself and even have a job, but it's a terrible feeling each time I remember him. He still has another 1 and a half year to go and I really don't want to be stuck worrying for the next year.

Any advice to help cope would be really appreciated. I am honestly at a loss. I know a therapist's advice was if I can't do anything, I shouldn't worry. But it's so hard to feel helpless and hope that everything is alright.  My boyfriend knows my constant worrying and always reassures me, but it doesn't help too much. ",24Oct2018,1
341,"I've been working in a small medical practice for about seven months. The doctor has treated me off and on since I started the position. When he treats me, he does things that that would be inappropriate in a normal setting, but because he's a doctor it almost feels warranted. It's a uncomfortable feeling to put it simply. I've always felt uncomfortable around him. He makes inappropriate comments like talking to me in graphic detail how much he likes sex and oral. Were closed on fridays and he always tries to get me to come into the office and be alone with him, but I make excuses and have never gone in.

Yesterday he calls me into his office to look over some notes for a patient. While talking he grabs the draw string on my scrub pants and pulls it to untie the string on my scrubs. So I jump back like ""what are you doing"" and start to tie my scrub pants back up, he reaches forward and grabs my crotch. I'm so caught off guard I jumped back and almost fell. He says ""is this a camel toe?"" And I jump back and say no and walk away to the kitchen where he follows me repeating the question. I tried to do anything I could to change the subject and get away until I could finally get back into my office.

Today I called out sick. I just couldn't even face him. I called a couple hotlines today and I have gotten answers varying from search legal action to do nothing and stand up for myself. The one counselor told me, if I report to the police, they will do a controlled call. Have me call him while listening in and see if he admits. Is this true? My biggest concern is; if I pursue legal action, being that he only assaulted me,  there is no proof, and no one else saw,  that it's his word against mine and he'll win. I mean He's a Dr.  Is it worth pressing charges or do I go back to work, stay away from him, continue to look for another job, and if he tries anything else stand up and say something to him?

343,"So I (22F) met this guy I’ll call him John (31M) through friends a year ago. We hit if off and hung out everyday for six months.He would talk to me about my emotional issues and always have a sympathetic ear. We have the same mutual friends here and they all like him.


He has a very cynical world view though. His parents were both doctors. In high school he had a 4.0 gpa and got nearly perfect scores on the SATs. He want to Colorado state because that’s where most of his friends were going. His plans were to become a high up political figure or a lawyer. Everyone in his life was saying that’s where he was going. He hated all his general education classes.


He flunked out his second year and worked retail jobs. He met a girl named Rebecca(30F) who his friend used to date. She was his only crazy ex, the rest he has not much bad to say. She would throw things at him, get mad if he was looking at celebrities in movies to long, accused him of using her for sex ,and would break his things. They dated for five years.


During this time he had periods of depression that started when he was in college and made him fail out. Where he would spend months not working and having suicidal thoughts. He has nihilistic views about the world, he thinks things are meaningless and random. He was never bullied, never had any abuse, and came from an affluent family.


A years before I met him he was doing therapy for depression. At 28 he went to a residential treatment center but said it was a scam and took his money. He spent five months there, it’s an expensive reputable treatment center. He saw no change.



After five months he started to become depressed. He started complaining that rent was too high, that his job had become mundane. He quit his and we planned to stay together but he “had to leave because he was being screwed over for rent money”.


So he went home to live with his parents. He’s had no job for a year. He doesn’t pay rent, he does SOME chores, he takes care of the dogs, and most days watches movies, reads the news, and reads books. He says his depression has made him feel so negative he can’t function.


After eight weeks of leaving he told me he was suicidal and I said talk to a professional and stopped talking to him. He says he can’t open up to me now because of that. I talk to him a lot about my insecurities because when he left I felt very alone. I’ve tried bringing up that maybe something happened in his childhood he doesn’t remember. He said that was stupid.


I’ve lost my temper with him. Since we met I have an ex I’ve know since I was 16 for six years. Even though I haven’t seen him in 2 years, he keeps sexual photos of me and contacts me every so often. It’s to the point if I ignore him he sends the photos to me saying “remember these:)”. I feel like I can’t block this ex because he’s been aggressive in the past and knows where I live and my family. John always rolls his eyes when I tell him about it now.

He says there’s an easy solution block him. I try to explain that if I make a hard choice and piss him off I have a got feeling he’ll do something. I’ve blocked him in the past but he’ll find ways to contact. I compare johns and his relationship with Rebecca and how he stayed so long. He said I try to compare two situations that aren’t similar and that I’m bad at arguing.


He says that I’m shallow because I was bullied in high school badly and now really critical of my looks. He says I’m emotionally immature and a liar . Ive never been called that really before but he says it comes from things like me lying about taking the last cookie. I’m an anxious person and working on it but I tell white lies sometimes.


I’m in Chicago for my birthday with all my friends. He’s in a grumpy mood. I try to call him and he doesn’t want to talk. This is a common theme throughout the past year I just want to talk how normal friends would. Like a couple times a week or once a week. But he won’t do that sometimes and if I try to keep trying to talk to him because I worry he says I’m annoying and needy.I try couple days later and he says we aren’t dating ,we don’t live in the same state, I don’t have a future for myself or you. I am upset. I say he’s never cared about me , that he’s a constant pity party, he’s a loser and that he’s selfish.


We don’t talk for two weeks and he send me like a text that was like 700 words. Saying how I’ll find someone, all my good qualities and talking about his own issues. I felt a simple sorry could of been enough or phone call. I felt patronized. I told him I didn’t read the whole thing and deleted it. He was pissed that I couldn’t be bothered to read it. And ignored me for awhile. 



He’s very unemotional and acts like I’m hysterical. I apologized a couple weeks later he says he doesn’t see what he could of done differently in either situations. He said that I was mean and just throwing things in his face when I was criticizing him. He said he thinks the things I say but ten times worse.That he was being objective and logical. I said I know I need to work on my anger issues.


Am I a mean person? Am I acting crazy? Should I cut contact with John?

347,"This is a REALLY long story (4 years worth), so bear with me....

&amp;#x200B;

So there's a guy I have known the last 4 years, and he used to be my boss at work for my work study. 2 years into working with him, we started talking outside of work, it became sexual, and things were awesome. Unfortunately, staff found out and he got fired because of it. Regardless, we stayed in touch and still have had sexual relations over the last 2 years. I'm a senior in college now, (21), and he is 36. I know the age difference is vast and that may be a factor, as well as the history above. We have GREAT GREAT GREAT sex. The chemistry is amazing in the bedroom. And I want it to stay that way. 

A year ago (Oct/Nov 2017), I gained small feelings for him, nothing crazy just like ""aww he's attractive"" yadda yadda. My friends on discord noticed I clung to him a little in the discord and in game (I'm a PC gamer). He would always tease me and acted like there was a little something there. I told two of them in the discord group that I was into him, and nothing more. And I mentioned I didn't expect anything to happen nor was I necessarily ready. They got all excited and was hoping a gamer relationship would form between him and I, and told him. I was humiliated. I didn't want it to get back to him. And he mentioned how he didn't want anything etc. I understood, but he kind of made me feel a little bad. I was sad in a way but I understood. 

There have been arguments between him and I only over text really. He is a stubborn guy, and is very arrogant. He has a big ego, and from what his family has told me, has had minimal  romantic relationships and treats everyone like shit at some point. So that's why I know he is \*\*\*\*DEFINITELY NOT the one for me. I love the sex, that's it. And when we hang out, all we do is get take out, sit on different couches, eat. Then he and I go to his room, do our thing (we have kinky sex mostly, only he insinuates the intimate sex. We don't kiss outside of the bedroom, or cuddle, or even hug. We aren't a couple and I know that. He and I used to kiss but we stopped mutually. 

He introduced me to his father and sister over the summer on a fishing trip to my hometown (I met up with them as I was home on a vacation from college)... and I have met two of his brothers recently. I know a few of his friends that he introduced me to. His father called me his ""honey"" and he didn't say anything to deny it. I didn't either. His sister LOVES me, and definitely thinks he and I could wind up together, and wants it to happen. The sister invited me to her house and actually introduced me to their mother (I was not comfortable with it but I was not going to be rude about it). I also met her kids and they liked me too and the oldest even added me on facebook. 

He and I have had a friendship where I also go to the store and ask him if he needs anything (I do that with friends and family anyway, like I'm sure other people do). It's just convenient and he doesn't have a car right now so he can't really go anywhere. 

There was also a time a few weeks ago, where he was drunk, (he says he tells the truth when he is drunk).. and he told me he loves me. I was shocked. 

I also used to sleep over his place in his bed every time I went over. I haven't slept over in at least two weeks and I also don't sleep over much any more regardless. 

NSFW:\*\*\*\* Another thing for the story below, is the last few weeks I got a little bored of always riding him when we have sex. I felt like I was putting in the most work. For a while it was always, go over, suck his cock, ride him, and finish him in either my ass or I'd swallow. (I am not the biggest fan of anal but I do it anyways to please him.... Dom/sub).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So the point of this story, is last night he got a bit drunk for the world series. I was in my dorm, wanting to order pizza. Before he got drunk, he mentioned he wanted some pizza too. I got a really bad migraine before I was going to order it (around 6pm), and I took some Tylenol and decided to take a light nap to see if that would help. My ass slept through the alarm and slept till 10pm. I messaged him and told him it was a bit too late to get pizza for me then, and I didn't want to mention the migraine so I didn't. I told him maybe tomorrow I could get us pizza and we could watch the rest of the movie we were watching last time I was over. He got a little sarcastic but I didn't notice because I was sleepy and had a migraine so I wasn't paying attention. He then said the whole eating and watching movies thing was repetitive (falling back to me not wanting to ride him the last few weeks during sex). He said he wants to actually do something because it actually feels like a relationship which he doesn't want. I told him, I don't understand how that defines a relationship, but okay. I thought relationship stuff was a tad more romantic than that anyways. He called me dumb and naive and an asshole, and that I should understand his personality by now (which I do, just sometimes he acts off and tries to hide his pride).  He also said I was trying to play with his emotions (How can I play with his emotions if both of us don't want a relationship??). I told him NOTHING has changed over the last two years and I think he's being irrational and overthinking everything. He almost INSISTS I like him and want a relationship with him, and actually seems to get mad if I deny it. He started calling me out on being intrusive, introducing myself to his mother, overdoing it with getting things for him at the store, doing ""unofficial relationship"" stuff. And he jumped topic to topic, I couldn't keep up with the headache. Eventually after he kept getting angry, I just told him ""I'm done with how you treat me. Seriously I'm done"". And he said fine, if you're done, I'll show you what done is. And he blocked me on facebook. 

I did cry, and I stayed up till 3am. 

&amp;#x200B;

He still had me blocked on FB by 11am. I finally took it upon myself to message him on discord. I told him I apologize and I realized there was a lot of miscommunication. He still kind of stuck with what he said last night but knew he went a bit overboard. He still thinks I'm wanting him, and again got a little upset when I said people change and I don't have those feelings. He hasn't replied to me since he accused me of playing with his feelings again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question. Does he like me and is afraid of dating? Does he actually ""love"" me and is scared? He has been the one asking for me to come over late at night to cuddle in bed the last week or two, as well, and I haven't initiated any romantic stuff. He also kissed me a couple weeks ago, a LOT. I don't know what his problem is! He's so back and forth, and it's annoying me. I want to be friends with him and still have sex but I'm tired of him accusing situations that are invalid and nonexistent. What do you guys think? I know I'm dumb for letting him treat me like that too. ",24Oct2018,1

350,"I met a girl (Sara) at the gym a few years ago and thought she was really attractive and cool. We seemed to hit it off, but I never made a move. We just hung out with mutual friends in group settings. 

Flash forward a year and I move across the country for work. Right after I move multiple of our mutual friends sent me messages that Sara missed me and has a big crush on me. 

I travel back to my old location for work once a month and the last time I was here I told Sara I was into her but it couldn’t be anything with the distance. She agreed, but then proceeded to start flooding me with messages, future plans for visits, pictures of her self, and phone calls. I was pretty flattered and went along with it. Really seemed over the top with how much she said she wanted to see me. 

Then she started going hot / cold. One day telling me how much she missed me and then 3 days of passive aggressiveness. Finally she went silent and I ignored her thinking it was over. Well, it wasn’t. She texted me right before my latest trip back and brought up old plans. She was super enthusiastic to see me and invited me to a friends party on Saturday/ told me that I could sleep over after. She was pretty flirtatious at the party and on the way back to her home we kissed and made out for about 5 min. She made some playful comments while kissing - All seemed great. 

Once back at her spot I went in for another kiss and got a head dodge and a “nope”. She then told me that I could sleep on the couch. The morning after she was incredibly cold to me. I didn’t know what to do or say so I left shortly after and haven’t heard a word from her. I know this is over, but I just can’t figure out what happened. I totally respect her decision, but I feel really hurt / rejected. Do I just ignore her? It feels like there is stuff left unsaid and I’d really love to know what happened, but I doubt I’ll get that.

Now, I'm worried he's not going to pay me for the last two times I babysat which is what he owes me for. 

I kind of need the money right now, but since he never replied earlier I'm worried I'll come off as pushy if I text him again. I last heard from him Saturday which was the last time I babysat. 

How should I go about asking him to pay me for the hours he owes me for? I don't demand payment up front because of his financial situation. I thought I was doing him a favor but now, I'm not sure he's planning to pay at all since it's unusual of me to not hear from him this late in the week.

My parents were none the wiser, I told them we simply went to McDonald's and had some dinner.

358,"So I turn 30 this year and I think that's kind of a big deal. I made it to 30 years old! It's a decade birthday! I wanted to do something special but I'm getting married next year and were saving for the honeymoon so it'll just be something small. My niece has her birthday the day after mine, she is turning 5 and my sister and brother-in-law are having a party for her. My sister really wants me to be there. It is the middle of December, in Boston, the day after my 30th birthday and I live 10 hours away. Then she told me that they are moving into the house they just bought the day before my nieces birthday, my birthday, and they would like my fiance and I to help them move. Normally I would totally be down to help, but it's my birthday. Then she kinda made me feel shitty about caring about my birthday, saying she didn't do anything for hers cause she had a 3 month old. Am I being selfish by wanting to do something for my birthday? Because I'm feeling really torn. I just wanted to spend the day maybe going to a cute tea place in the city or something but I feel so guilty now. ",24Oct2018,1
359,"So I am a college student majoring in Media Arts, and I am shooting for an internship working in the broadcasting department of a video game company. It's something that i am putting 100% percent into, and I would really love to achieve.

Right now, my on campus job is working as a Team Lead for the university system of computer labs, basically I have a team of lab clerks that I manage, as well as reporting to our employee manager about issues in the lab. The job is very easy, pays 10 dollars an hour, and is really flexible with my class schedule. I like working there, and the environment is really nice.

On the other hand, there is an open position for an e-sports broadcaster through our varsity e-sports league. This job pays 9 dollars an hour, would involve working nights (but still works with my schedule) and is a lot harder work. 

So for less pay, more difficult hours, and harder work, I would get good experience towards what I want to do.

Should I apply for this job?

It is worth noting that even I do not, I still am involved with the university television station, which gives me the opportunity to work on some projects for experience as well.",24Oct2018,1

I peaked a little but didn't see anything so I decided to just decided to take the L on the quiz.  It was until my neighbor got up before finishing his quiz and signaled out to his friend in front of us, asking if the answers were B and C. I wasn't sure what  the answers were either so I just rolled with that. Looking over the answers, I would have answered one of those the same way regardless if he said the answer or not. It made sense to me. The other question though I just used that answer. Turns out both answers were incorrect.

 Is there enough evidence for me to get busted for cheating? If so, how should I go about all of this. I'm considering just fessing up.

363,"Hey guys I am really in need of some advice about a situation I hoped to never find myself in. I have been off work for the past 6 weeks after a false sexual assault claim was made against. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of background info. I am a male (24) working in childcare for the past 5 years. It began as a part time job to help pay for my university and somehow I continued to find jobs in the childcare area. I really enjoy my work and have worked at several facilities all for children aged between 5 - 13. 

&amp;#x200B;

About 3 months ago I moved to a new town and began a new job at childcare center as an assistant manager, this is my third place of employment in the childcare area. My girlfriend and I decided to move to a new area to explore more of the world no other circumstances involved.

&amp;#x200B;

Work had been going really well and I was settling in with my colleagues. i was actually really enjoying the role. However out of the blue I was told that the facility would be suspended from operating for a few weeks. I was confused but as I was still getting paid and as nothing had been mentioned to me I assumed that something behind the scenes was going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I was kind of right. A week of the facility not operating three police officers turned up at my door. They told me that a male member of staff had a sexual assault claim made against him by a 6 year old boy from the facility. I was completely shocked. They asked me to assist them with the investigation which I of course did. They took my computer and phone for testing and I accompanied them down to the station. Never having been in trouble with the police before I was completely in shock and was going along with whatever they said. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the station they conducted a formal interview. I was recorded and questions about the facility and safety procedures etc. They asked me questions about other members of staff and children who attend. They did not mention that the assault claim had been made against me directly. They offered to get a lawyer for me but at the time I thought asking for a lawyer would make me look guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

After several hours at the station they took me home and told me they would be in touch within a few weeks. My phone and computer were returned later that night. I was asked not to speak to other members of staff as I was the first person they had spoken to. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few days went by of complete anxiety and my boss called me apologizing for what had happened. Apparently they had been in touch with the police for the previous week and the way she spoke implied that the claim had been made against me directly. At this point I was very confused so I asked if this was the case. She said yes the claim had been made against me. One of the younger boys claimed I had touched him and photographed his private areas. I was completely shocked and disgusted. I cried that night and I am so thankful my girlfriend was with me to keep me company.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few weeks and I haven't heard back from the police or any other staff about what is going on. I was pretty scared at this point because this was taking a lot longer than the police originally told me. I reached out to a colleague and they confirmed they had been questioned by the police about me directly. I did not understand what was going on at all. Despite feeling confident that I had done nothing wrong I was wracked with anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday i finally received an epicly long email from my boss about the whole situation. She apologized profusely and explained they had been told by the police not to discuss an ongoing case with me hence no contact for the past few weeks. The police have closed their investigation and have concluded that the child in question made the claim up. Apparently they admitted as such to the police officers and said they didn't like me because i made them clean up a mess they made. I've never been so angry in my life. Being a male working in child care I have always been extremely careful not to put myself in a situation which could be misinterpreted. I feel so angry that a child could make something up that impacts my life so heavily but at the same time I worry about children that are abused. I am honestly a bit of a mess right now.

&amp;#x200B;

The center is re opening next week and I am extremely scared to go back to work. All of my colleagues are aware of the claim that has been made against me and I know that parents will questions why the facility has been shut. Thankful the child in questions has been banned from the facility. I honestly feel so sick right now and I really dont want to go back into work. What should I do? Do I quit my job that I used to enjoy or try and work around this? I feel like despite the fact the claim was made up it could still influence peoples opinions of me. Please let me know your guys thoughts or if anyone has been in a similar situation. I am feeling so depressed right now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a male working in childcare and a false sexual assault claim was made against me by one of the younger boys. I am scared to go back to work next week and need advice. Do I quit my job or not?",24Oct2018,1

Last night we were talking about something on text and I was telling about something that happened recently and I wrote a super long paragraph and all he said was “haha” like wtf? I wrote a whole paragraph telling and you reply “haha”. I got super mad and started arguing over this. He compliments me 24/7 which I don’t like as they seem super fake. Like I can’t even tell any problem or anything cuz I feel like he is never real. He would send heart emojis, and give me meaningless fake compliments. I don’t know what to do about it.

I found a different career path only to have then say no after I toured the facility and everything. So I'm trapped at a job I hate. I've tried going back to the gym, but that ultimately made my health worse. I only have time for studies and work and almost no social life. I lost the love of my life because I wanted to focus on myself. After we agreed on no contact for two month, she called me two weeks early to tell me she was seeing someone new. I was planning on trying to get back with her. I've been ghosted by girls too often with no explanation. I feel like something is wrong with me and no one will tell me. I know something is wrong with me. No one wants me. No one talks to me. No one checks up. I get panic attacks daily, and it's the worst when I'm in class. I'm never going to be happier than I was with my ex. I deserve all the pain I'm feeling. I made the choice to end the relationship, so I must harbor the constant pain. I wasn't good enough for another job. I'm not good enough to be with another girl. I'm not good enough to be a musician. I'm not good enough be happy. I can't stop thinking about suicide, even though I'll never do it. These thought keep plaguing me. I've lost interest in almost everything. My biggest regret is losing my ex. She was perfect for me and I ruined it. I deserve this pain. She moved on so quickly, and that felt like my heart was ripped out and stomped on. It makes me feel like the year and a half relationship meant very little to her. Even though it was the happiest I've ever been. She tried to get back with me within the first few months of the break up but I said no because I'm stupid and blind. I can't take this pain. I wish we have never dated.

371,"I’ve recently turned 21, I’m currently attending a university in California but as of this year I’ve decided I do not want to go back next semester for a bit. Money is the main reason why I cannot go back next semester, applying to scholarships and getting grants and loans and yadda yadda is all a brilliant thing to do (in theory), yet in reality I did not get any of the scholarships that I applied to, I didn’t get anything but loan offers from this terrible money-loving school. It’s a private university so of course the tuition is high, but it’s the closest university from home and I can’t leave yet… let me explain.

I currently live with my parents but I feel like I am at this point in time where I feel like I cannot grow any further in their house. My parents, more so my father, is very over-protective; meaning I can’t leave the house to hang out with friends until late (latest I can stay out is about 9, sometimes 10 if it’s the Summer). So there is this barrier between a normal freedom-filled life and mine. It seems to me that everyone around me is growing, **yet I’m still in this same age-group bubble that my dad** **files me under**. At one point last year, I was dating this girl who was 2 years younger than me and she had her own car, drove out past whatever time, and was clean of course, she did not smoke or drink and was very responsible. I don’t drink or smoke nor have I ever.  I don’t own a car because my dad says the insurance is too high for new drivers…as of exactly today October 24, 2018 I have had my driver’s license for 2 years. I know people that have had their car even before they had their license. I digress on that though.

I have a younger brother, he’s 15 years old. I feel as though my dad **files me under my little brother’s age group.** It feels like I can’t grow anymore here…

I don’t even know how to put into words this last part but sometimes my dad goes out of control…he get’s both physically and mentally abusive. About 3 weeks ago, I was sure I wanted to leave the house for good; we were arguing and he was being very vulgar and I just wanted to leave. As I go inside from the garage (where our argument was taking place) to get my wallet and phone, my dad runs after me. I get in the house, grab my wallet and phone then book it out the open garage, but before I have the chance to leave, he grabs me from my back and pulls me down…

*I stayed…*

Knowing all of this, my problem is that I want to leave the house, but I feel very sad thinking about leaving my brother and mom… Not because I’m afraid my dad will hurt them (he doesn’t get like this all of the time, but when it happens, it’s a nightmare) but because I would just be leaving them in general. So from a general perspective, just leaving the family is sad, but I need to do it for my well being. I have saved up money to move out (money from next semester) but I plan to escape my house in a Harry Potter Style

&amp;#x200B;

Though we won’t be flying away, my friends are going to help me take all of my stuff out of my room from the window, as I will be leaving through there in the middle of the night.

I then plan to buy one of my dream cars, a 1992–95 Jeep Cherokee XJ to go on a month long road trip up to Seattle as I have never been out of California before.

I guess the main problem here is that I feel like my time on Earth is flying away faster (I’m 21 now) time is flying and I clearly won’t be able to travel whilst being in my parent’s house. I’m getting this sadness for I need adventure in my life. I just do not know how I can leave my comfort zone and be happy knowing my mom and brother miss me…yesterday I told my brother all of this, he cried but he more importantly understood my situation. I do not plan to tell my mom about this because she’ll just tell my dad…

375,"So I work in the entertainment industry and have met several friends during my time spent at pop culture conventions (ie Comic Con, Wizard World). I’ve been doing this for over three years now, and I’ve been trying to make a career out of it (think guest relations) because it’s something that I really enjoy doing. There’s A LOT of travel involved, and while they do pay us some money towards expenses, it’s not enough to cover everything. Getting this job would really change things for me since I wouldn’t have to pay a dime, and I’d be getting a salary. 

Another girl that I’ve become very close with (we’ll call her *H) has also been wanting to make a career out of this as well, and we’d commiserate with one another about how unfair it was that we’d work our asses off and get zero recognition whilst others who didn’t work as hard ended up with the prime positions. We’d travel together and watch as the two of us ended up with the crap end of the deal, but it was tolerable because we had each other. It was an escape from my retail job, while H, who has a great job with money to blow, saw it as an adventure. 

During this time, I’ve had a few opportunities to ‘prove’ myself and basically do a few trial runs that would lead to an eventual hiring. However, each one fell through, and it’s been a nonstop cycle of disappointment and being told ‘you’ll get your chance’, and frankly, I was COMPLETELY done with it all until an opportunity arose for me to have my chance. The catch? They only needed one person and it was between H and I. H promptly went into defensive mode and said if she didn’t get the coveted spot, then she was quitting altogether - essentially saddling me with an enormous hotel bill and other travel expenses that were non refundable. She then backtracked and said she hoped it didn’t ruin our friendship, which I agreed, even though this was a job that would’ve been life changing for me. I don’t have the extra income to throw around like she does, so getting this opportunity was important to me. 

The woman who held the job offer (we’ll call her P), told us to ‘figure it out between the two of us’ which is quite unfair considering that a friendship hangs in the balance. H wanted to argue with me about how she deserved it much more, so I told P separately that she should pick the position because we couldn’t come to a mutual agreement. While the two of us waited for P to make a decision, H kept bringing up the fact that her foot had been injured (about three months previously) so an easy spot where she could sit all weekend would be best for her - aka the single guest relations job that was up for grabs. Her foot was never an issue before the job was up for grabs, but now it was suddenly SO PAINFUL and she was ‘literally unable to stand’ for extended periods. Essentially if the job hadn’t have been offered, she would’ve been standing for hours regardless - I just feel like she threw her injury into the ring to at least garner a bit of an edge. And? It worked. P said she was going to give H the job because of her injury, but that my ‘chance will come.’ 

My chance. A statement I keep hearing over and over again. 

Needless to say I am utterly devastated. I am heartbroken. I’ve been crying for the past two days because this is something I’ve been working towards for so long and I feel as if someone I considered a ‘friend’ ripped this away from me. I can’t even cancel anything because the event is this weekend and everything is non refundable, so I have to endure four days worth of H gloating about her new position that was rather unfairly won.

378,"Basically the title. Here are 3 examples of institutional (not student on student, but organiation/institution on student) racism in the last month alone. 

1. They decided to do a meet and greet with Muslim students (of which there are maybe 10, because the school is racist). They called it ""Meet your Muslim classmates"", and they decided to promote it with a photo. In this photo were 2 Indian individuals that I know well. **Theyre practicing Hindus**. They ""look Middle Eastern"", so the school decided to use this photo to promote the event. This is textbook racial profiling. Also, it's harmful to Muslim students that are already severely underrepresented in every way at this place. 

2. As part of that same series of religious events, they decided to do a similar event with Jewish students. **They called it ""Schmooze With The Jews**. What the fuck? Is this 1950? In what way is language like that okay? Why can't it be ""Meet your Jewish classmates"" in the same way that the Muslim students event was called ""Meet your Muslim classmates""? 

3. 2 years ago the University created a ""task force"" to study and publish the Universitys involvement with slavery from the 1820s onward. This ""task force"" is like 5-7 people. An archivist, a couple professors, and some random talking heads from adminstration. They discovered ledgers and documents proving the University owned and traded slaves (shocker right? It's because the school is racist). They published this material and that was it. That's the end. No apology, no statement saying ""we don't condone slavery"", nothing. ",24Oct2018,1

I certainly romanticize the military as a way to gain camaraderie and honestly a way to prove that I am a man (as silly as that might sound). The offer to take over the business does have a time limit, and it won't necessarily wait for a four year enlistment window.

381,"Using an alt account for obvious reasons. 

Long story short, my s/o and I have been together for 4 years and engaged for two. I’m not sure if “the one” exists, but if it does, he’s the closest I’m ever going to get. I’ve never felt more comfortable, happy, or confident in my love for someone, and I know he can say the same. 

There are flaws with both of us, as with everyone, but I can’t help myself but to get stressed that his flaws are going to be too much for me someday. I’m a firm believer in planning for the future and the belief that if something ever becomes a non-starter for me, to walk away. I can only compromise so much. Anyways. He doesn’t *truly* care about anything. He makes decent money, but won’t do the necessary hard work to move up in his job. He refuses to see the doctor even though there are a few random medical issues that could be solved. He says he will only do things that are in his best interest, but there are things that ARE in his best interest that he refuses to do. He has a lot of money in defaulted student loans he refuses to get help to rehabilitate. I have offered multiple times to help in all these areas, and to even set everything up for him, but he won’t do it. 

This stresses me out enough as I want the best for him and for us, and I don’t want to suddenly be without my s/o or not be able to buy a house because of his stubbornness. I’m willing to try and compromise to let him make his own decisions and do what he wants. It is, after all, his own life. The thing that worries me is his lack of caring. He says ALL THE TIME he would rather just drop dead one day than go to the doctor and try and fix possibly insignificant problems. He says ALL THE TIME what use is paying off student debt if he’ll die one day. Not to mention he firmly believes he won’t make it past 30 (he’s 29 right now) and seems to be nonchalant enough to brush everything off. If he dies, he dies, if not, cool.

He doesn’t care to try on things that I feel are important, sometimes. He doesn’t make an effort to talk to my family much at all. He says they’re all too loud and obnoxious and since he doesn’t try with his own family, why should he try with mine? It’s always like that. “I’ve always been like this and I’ve made it this far, why change now?”

But then there are so many other good things. He makes me laugh. He helps me de-stress and to care less about things that don’t matter. He shows me new things and loves me fiercely. But what if that’s not enough for me at some point? 

I’m such a type A, typical control freak planner and I want everything to be a certain way and to, frankly, go my way most of the time. I know I need to work on that aspect of it. I’m worried that as I progress in my career and my life, he won’t progress with me. It’s important that he sees us as a unit, and this relationship as a journey, not as a half-assed “this is great but I don’t need to try that hard” thing.  I feel like I’ve tried so much shit to get him to care and now I’ve just given up. I just get angry. Why even propose if you aren’t planning to live long enough to get married? Why be in a relationship when you aren’t willing to care about things that make the other person happy? 

Do I have unrealistic expectations of him? Or is his carelessness a red flag? Is it depression? Anyone have any experience in these situations? Am I not trying hard enough to help him?

TLDR; been with s/o for four years, his carelessness is getting to me as i don’t understand how someone can care about their significant other but not care about so many things in life. Looking for advice on if I’m overthinking it or if this is a red flag.",24Oct2018,1

We really hit it off and we’re texting all the time, after awhile I worked up the courage to ask her out, she told me that she’d love to and that the crush was mutual. Things continued well for about a week after but a few days ago I checked snapchat and saw that she suddenly unfriended me on snapchat midway through a convo. I texted her asking if everything was okay, didn’t hear anything. I asked her if I did something to upset her and again I haven’t heard anything.

I am very disinterested in the industry, the CEO is a degrading micro-manager, my (new) direct boss is turning out to be a nightmare to work for.

386,"My university hosts a large number of Greek organizations (fraternities and sororities). Of our student body, roughly 60% are active in Greek life, and more participate in it (formals, parties, etc). At one particular party **thrown by our chapter of TKE (Tau Kappa Epsilon)**, a brother drugged several drunk girls with the intention of raping them. The girls had to be hospitalized for many days. **The University did not call the local police. The University is taking no punitive action on the assailant. The University is taking no punitive action against TKE.** They say ""university police are working closely with TKE to investigate the event"". That, however, is for show. There is no investigation going on. Those girls were traumatized, and nobody is doing anything. 

On another occasion, a close friend of mine was sexually assaulted and sexually abused by her boyfriend at the time. The university has an office called ""Title IX"" which represents the name of the policy concerning sexual assault on college campuses. This office is supposed to be the avenue through which students take action against sexual assaulters and abusers that have harmed them. My close friend went to this office, reported the individual, met with different representatives and university police many times over. She presented evidence, witnesses, and multiple corroborations of her story. **The university refused to take action against the student.** They said to her that they would not help, and that the only way for this individual to be removed from campus was for him to fail his courses.

389,"My first post on Reddit. I hope you guys can help me (and hopefully others in similar scenarios) with the problem that's been haunting me since High School. I can't for the life of me figure out what career I should pursue.

My current situation: I am a college Senior studying Finance at a public University. I chose this major based on being good at math and liking money, although now I regret my decision as each of my courses have not been interesting/seem pointless. Now I am faced with graduation in a couple months and I don't think I am ready to go out into the real world. 

I am a good student and enjoy learning generally, so I am considering grad school but since I currently disdain Finance, I cannot see myself pursuing a MBA. I have an interest in technology, but unfortunately I don't feel as knowledgable as those who studied Computer Science or Information Technology as their undergrad. Also I'm afraid I will be unable to get into graduate school because of the requirements for the schools I've been considering (letters of recommendation, impressive internships, etc).

My dream job is simple: a high paying job that's not the same mundane task repeated over and over until it's my second nature. I'd love to work remotely, which makes me consider a degree in technology. Ideally, I'd love something that mixes my love for technology and business but I'm unsure if this job even exists.

Any advice from others in this scenario that have succeed since their predicament, how did you figure out what to do? What steps can I take to better my scenario? Thanks for any help :-)",24Oct2018,1
390,"She is in Major B.

I am in Major A.

No common classes. I get to see her round the hallway in my class transitions which are less than one minute, twice a week.

I initiated introducing myself to her on the hallway with my name because we always locked eyes at each other before and didn't know who each of us were. She took it well, said her name is Nell and she studies another Engineering discipline. This was 4 weeks ago.

Since then, I've said hi to her, done small talk about random school stuff (all less than 5 min convos, most were His and Hellos). She is enthusiastic about saying hi to me back, and she says bye to me even when we are at a table and she does not have to. She never made a weird stare.

I really want to ask her out. I am going to keep it simple, just ask her out for coffee. You guys have encouraged me with my plan when I posted it here.

But here is where the problem.

I can not stop besting myself up after I could've asked her out. This morning, I saw her exiting class and I could've EASILY gone and talked to her then popped the question. What did I do? I said ""Hey"" and she said ""Heyyy!"" in a long way back to me. I could've captivated the moment right there but I just let go. Case in point, it was 7:26am and both of us had class 7:30am. It has been repeating in my head forever now and has in the past when I could've asked her. How do I stop this self sabotage?

TL;DR 21M wants to ask out 21F in different major. Has made small talk a few times. Sees her only twice a week and even then she is not alone and with her friends. Saw her today, but can't stop beating himself up about it. It's stuck in the brain.",24Oct2018,1
391,"Win is a strong word I believe, I mean how do you argue successfully when you know you are right and the other person is wrong? when do you stop the conversation?

For example I saw a woman on facebook once marketing a scam, when I tried to warn people. Everyone came hounding at me, calling me a liar and that I was trying to stop her from gaining money. It was a pyramid scheme, if they just google it they would know. She provided evidence that she is marketing a product by linking her instagram page where she sells this weird herbal thing that is way too expensive, all of the buyers sent her thank you what's app messages. No names which is suspicious at best.

Another time I was arguing with someone about their misinformed opinions of my religion which they got from fox news, all of it was wrong. How do you argue when the other person can't get their facts right?

Also even if I do argue in a polite manner and prove my point. The other person will just insult me personally and I am REALLY REALLY bad when it comes to insults. I freeze and don't know what to say and just back out.

392,"That may be a odd way to phrase that but basically...

I recently had a really bad experience with a person that happened to associated with something I love. Specifically, I joined a small group of people whose shared interest was a show I’ve followed for 5 years. I had a really bad experience with one person in particular which made my entire relationship with that group very stressful and it ended up tainting my overall enjoyment of the show. I basically have begun to associate all that stress and negativity with the show which is extremely frustrating. 

It’s not as if I slowly started to enjoy the show less and less because of the show itself. It’s this association with this person (and the group at large) that’s basically tainted it. I feel like I definitely would be able to love the show again. I just wondered if there was anyway to help ease myself back into it.

394,"I have this friend who I like to see the good in, but all my other friends think he's a leech that will never change. He's the kind of guy that borrows money and never pays people back, and constantly makes excuses about why he can't pay for things, but then shows up the next week later with a brand new phone, and still complains that he can't pay for beer. I don't know much about the phone situation or where that money comes from, but he has had a rough Financial life. First he had to cover one of his brothers financial loans and then that got him into really bad credit which he has not been able to come back from. Then he has very little education and has been taking lowest paying jobs possible for his age, and if that's not bad enough he quits every single one and complains about why he's broke all the time. If that weren't enough to convince you how much of a slime he can be, he is also the guy that throws stones in glass houses. Even when people are nice to him he still has bad things to say about them to their face or behind their back, so basically what he does is he pushes away all of his friends until I'm the last one standing who is the nicest in the whole bunch, and he says that he has to do everything with me because I'm his only friend now. But but by ""do everything"", whenever he wants to hang out he always wants to drink alcohol and it's not bad enough that he wants my free alcohol, he makes me drink with him because he says he doesn't want ME to make him drink alone, he always tries to turn things around on people... He has always had mean things to say to me and then brushes it off as being sarcasm which is bullshit, the man doesn't even know what sarcasm is, he genuinely makes fun of me to my face and expects me to take it and meanwhile does all these mean things to me and spiteful things to me and steals my money and alcohol and .....why is he still my friend?

Well, He is the person that has been there for me through thick and thin, he is the person who whenever I've been lonely and feeling down in the dumps that person is always there to hang out with, though I never assumed back then that he was using me the whole time.  Lately he's becoming the reason why I'm down in the dumps all the time.

Now, He has definitely changed since I first knew him for the better, he has more money now, he has a new job that I helped him get through a friend, and he has a wonderful wife, and he made me best man at his wedding. Now my other friends will say  ""of course he made you best man, he knew that you had money and you were going to plan things the best"" But in my mind I know that the reason he made me best man is because I was his only real friend. He IS less of a slime these days and he does ask for money less and I started to put down ground rules saying ""you want to drink my beer bring over your own and we'll trade, I'm not buying you any more dinners, I'm Drawing the Line in the Sand on the nights that I will absolutely not have any alcohol with you"". 

However, the one thing that bothers him the absolute most I am going to hang out with other friends and people whenever I damn well please. This is the strangest part about him. he gets so obsessed over me hanging out with other people and then tries to Guilt Trip me into hanging out with him. Is it that he's afraid to lose me? 

Most recently I was going through a medical issue and I had no job and while I was starting at my new job and had no apartment he let me stay with him and his wife, they basically saved my life. Why then does this person that sometimes shows real acts of kindness, have to be so selfish and deceitful all the time and is it wrong that I want him so much to change into a better friend? I still have really bad depression and he's just making it worse with all his bullshit. Friends aren't supposed to do that right?

Now his marriage is on the rocks and he's looking to me for support and possibly a place to stay if things go bad and if I drop him now I don't know what the hell will happen to him, and that worries me too. 

I hope I explained things clear enough here and I tried not to give away any personal information. What the hell should I do? Thanks everyone.",24Oct2018,1

398,"So I have known this girl since middle school. We weren’t best friends right away just friends who hung out in the same group, but around junior/senior year of high school got very close, we are 27 now. 

We decided to become roommates two years ago. I know a lot of people say never to live with friends, but I’ve seen it work fine for some people and it had worked for me in the past and it was the best opportunity I had to get out of my parents’ house where I was living at the time. Obviously living together was mistake number one. 

Literally a week after I moved in shit hit the fan. She broke up with her boyfriend at the time who was also living there, which caused insane amounts of drama. She then brought guy after guy after guy into the apartment, constantly having loud sex and being generally obnoxious, only warning me that someone was coming over like half of the time. She eventually got a new bf, then they broke up and had a bunch of drama. All this time she never wants to hang out, always in her room with the door shut, any time I asked her if she wanted to hang or go somewhere it was a no, without any attempt to pick a date that would work for her. I was disappointed because I thought moving in with my best friend would be fun, that we would have movie nights and drink together etc etc. On top of this I came to find she is low key a hoarder, she was constantly bringing weird things into the apartment and putting them in the living room without asking, and just generally makes little effort to keep the common areas clean. 

I also have a boyfriend. Last year we became long distance while he went to school for his master’s degree, so when he has time off from school or on weekends he comes to stay and visit. It quickly became apparent that she did not like him. He can be a rather blunt person and doesn’t always filter what he says the way he should, and she is very sensitive/prideful/tends to take things personally. She complained about him visiting to a mutual friend, who told me what she said, that she hated hearing him pee and didn’t like how’d he constantly says the apartment is dirty (it is). 

I recently confronted her about everything, how I’ve been feeling, etc. and we talked for a long time. She wrote me a four page letter about how she’s severely depressed and suicidal and just talking about all her issues and using them as the reason that she never wants to hang or talk or anything. She also said that me being with my boyfriend damaged our friendship. After our talk things were a little better, but it was definitely still not out of the woods. 

But then while my boyfriend was visiting, he stupidly took it upon himself to clean out the fridge. He threw away anything that was expired. I know for a fact there was some gross stuff in there (mostly hers) and I don’t blame him for wanting to toss it (he’s a bit of a neat freak) but obviously the right thing to do would have been to ask first. She saw the fridge and was pissed. She confronted us about it, and went in on him. He got defensive, she kept going, I sat there blanking on what to do or how to react. Things escalated to the point where I finally completely lost my temper and was screaming at the both of them (wrong, I know). He called her a bitch and a cunt, and I told him to stop because the name calling isn’t okay. She just stood there and completely shut down, which is what she does pretty often when presented with conflict. She walked off to her room and shut the door leaving my bf and I in the living room still arguing. He now will not return to my apartment. 

I sent her a long text the next morning, explaining how I’m angry at them both for putting me in this position for so long, saying I want a relationship with them both but that I’m not gonna choose one over the other. I touched on a lot of things, and informed I won’t be renewing the lease again. The only thing she responded to was the bit about not renewing the lease. Again, she shut down. I feel like I’ve tried so hard to save this friendship. I hate that its ending this way. I would rather we had just drifted apart. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m sure I’m missing important details so feel free to ask for clarification. I’m the type of person who just wants to fix everything and be a mediator but this is way beyond my depth. 

TLDR: My friend/roommate and I have been having problems, she and my bf hate each other which doesn’t help, we all got into an argument, and she doesn’t wanna try and be friends anymore. Is there anyway I can possibly salvage this?

400,"Good morning. I got a sort of unique issue and thought it be worth a shot posting online and seeing what opportunities arise.

Some background. I'm the son of immigrant parents from Latin America. My father was a military officer in his home country and still recieves a pension from the military there.  He works in a tourism company and has for about 4 years. 

Back when the economy was very good and there was more opportunity for them, my parents owned a cleaning company, made good money, as well as worked dayjobs. Unfortunately due to bad financial decisions in 2008 (purchased a property and refinanced their home right before the crash), they lost their home in 2008. Father also lost his job and the company went under.

My parents then rented various houses and apartments ranging from 1400-2000 dollars a month.  Unfortunately when at the high end of the spectrum his income was not high enough to cover all his expenses and he relied on credit to pay the bills until he got the steady job he has now.  This left his credit a mess and it's rightfully his fault. 

After some financial advising I was able to get him he's slowly started to recover economically, but the huge thorn in the side is the price of rent. The apartment he's been in for the last 3 years costs 1775 a month and continues to rise yearly. 
To make things worse my mother decided to sperate and now lives in another city as a live in maid so it's on his income only. Due to this I have had to supplement him with some extra money for rent once in a while.

I have calculated that for him to have a stable budget his rent should be no more than 1200-1300 a month.  

I posted on the Orlando subreddit as it's where he lives to see if maybe any people there are looking for tenants but I'm not sure if that lead to much lol. 

The biggest difficulty I'm having is in finding a 2 or 3 bedroom home for that price which isn't in the ghetto. I haven't in loved in Florida for 3 years since in stained out of state but I can't believe that rent would have gone up so damn much that it's impossible to find a relatively safe place for less than 2000 a month. Am I wrong about that? Hopefully Florida isn't turning into California is terms of rent. 

I'm even willing to cosign as a guarantor since his credit is shot but I keep having trouble finding places within price range. Rented always been a nightmare for us and a lot of applications go into the black hole and cost like 50 dollars per person so it's like to go for realistic stuff rather than apply in every complex that accepts an application fee.

Anyways if you read up to here I greatly appreciate your time and even some advice is appreciated as well. 

Thanks",24Oct2018,1
401,"So, i made a new friend like a month ago and we been good friends since. Shes on my class. We usually talked on snapchat (i dont remember if it was much or nah but she now on my bf list number 2 so must be alot).

402,"So, I'm just looking for advice on handling a situation that's really stressing me out.  I have a pretty closed circle of friends and I'm more introverted, so I'm not outgoing and meeting new people all the time.  So, outside perspective would be appreciated.  

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a small town and my friend was introduced to someone via ex-co worker and since I met her, I feel like I'm seeing constant red flags with how they are being brought in, how they act, etc.  I know that eventually I'll need to talk (or argue) with my friend about her, so I've been compiling my thoughts and what they do to wrap my head around it all.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically it went like this:  


\- Less than 2 weeks after she met him, she started regarding him as her absolute best friend in the world, even more than her 'best friend' that introduced her to him.  At this point, she'd only known him via phone calls and not having ever met in person

\- She moved to our area and within a couple weeks, got kicked out of her 'best friend' 's house and had nowhere to live, immediately moving in with my friend's mother, whom she had never met before.  

\- Shortly after this, my friend's mom not only started to pay some of her bills for her but suddenly became too ill to take care of herself (she does have a bad situation with her health), and this person used that to her advantage or so it looked.  I would send them job postings and after that happened, her looking for work turned into ""They need me too much.  I can't afford to have a job"" which, to me, looked like ""I'm using this person as an excuse to not get a job"".  

\- The way she acts is something I've always felt odd and nervous about.  She is very guilt-trippy about trying to get people to do stuff with her and when given other options, she usually retorts with something else.  Once, she was complaining that she had no friends to hang out with and when given the option of the people who introduced her to my friend, she retorted that she wanted friends to hang out with that weren't them.  

\- She also sometimes retorts with the idea of changing who she is.  Once, I told her I wasn't going to hang out because I wasn't comfortable around her because we'd just met.  I'm a very introverted person and it takes me a good amount of time to open up.  And she'd mentioned that she's the same way, but she was trying to be different.  Which, to me, seems kind of like a ""I'm trying to be something I'm not"" sort of situation.  

\- Finally, not as big of thing but still a thing, is that she puts words in other peoples' mouths.  Once situation is my friend mentioning to her that I owned a controller for a game system, which she contacted me and turned that into ""He said I can borrow your controller"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I know that's a lot to take in, and more than I'd planned to write, but I'm trying to think this situation through and wonder if I'm just being too paranoid or there is something to this.  I've spoken to my family (parents) about this when I've visited them and they seem to agree that she's trouble, warning me not to ever be alone with her or let her into my home.  But, outside perspectives do help, I think.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, let me know what you think.",24Oct2018,1
403,"Ok so basically, my brother who is 16 never listens to anyone. He never listens to my mom when she asks him to do things like his chores, or even to just clean up after himself. When he showers he leaves a huge mess and puddle on the floor, when he does laundry he only washes his own clothes, not even towels or anything we all need. I asked him why and he said ""Because I only do what I need to. Only what benefits me."" He always gets home late and never does anything for anyone but himself. I asked him to get me toilet paper because I was out and he just groaned, and then left the house on his skateboard without saying a word to anyone. When he's expected to do his chores he just moans and bitches and gets out of it. My point is, I think he's just a self-centered prick, but my family thinks he has Alzheimer's or something. What do you guys think? And how should I handle this? I'm older than him btw.",24Oct2018,1
404,"I want to emphasize a few things, mostly that my parents are fine with me being there. I have never heard them say that they want me gone, and when I brought up moving out to them a few days ago they flat out stated they really didn’t mind me being there whatsoever. My relationship with them has always been great. 

Also, I work. I work 40 - 45+ hours a week. I pay for everything I have. I pay my car, health, and life insurance. I help around the house and I even go and take care of some things for my grandad on the weekends. 

But a couple things hold me back: income and my brother 

My income isn’t the greatest ($11 an hour), but if take the time so really save up some I could probably get a cheap apartment near here and live very modestly. But if I needed a new car or something I’d probably be screwed. 

The bigger issue I think is my brother. He has mental retardation and is of the mental age of 3 or 4. He can’t be left alone and has to be watched and taken care of. If someone leaves the house we have to make sure someone is going to be able to stay with him. He doesn’t do well in public so it’s always better to just keep him home if we can. He’s fine in places like restaurants but the shoulder to shoulder nature of super markets and such can really stress him out. 

If I leave then that might put a burden on my parents that I’m not sure they are prepared to take on. They have expressed that they would have a harder time without me there. And, while I sincerely doubt they were trying to guilt trip me, it does make me feel kinda bad leaving them like that. And yet on the other hand it’s humiliating to tell people I still live at home. 

I just feel really conflicted right now. What do you guys think?

405,"So a few months ago, i texted this girl on insta and told her everything- my porn and masturbation habits, my inability to talk to girls in real life and my depression and suicidal thoughts, even shared nudes with her. He's been pestering me for a week now about an appointment with a psychiatrist. It was kinda odd so I asked ,""why do you want to do this?""HUGE MISTAKE. He told me he knew about this from the start. My heart was in my mouth.

Now I don't know how I'm supposed to look him in the eye. Please help",24Oct2018,1
406,"Going to try and keep this to the point but I think a little background is necessary. We have been best friends for over a decade with little issues. Usually I am the one to have a problem but I be the bigger person and let it go or look past it. We are both 26.

My friend is well off money wise and attends a lot of events that he invites our friend group to. A lot of us can't go to everything due to money/time/travel and so we decline invitations. However, he's very persistent an keeps nagging us, telling us to think about it or let him know. He recently invited us to something he already bought tickets to for himself, and his other group of friends were going, so he thought it would be fun if we all go. However, even though the tickets are tiered, he bought the most expensive ones which gave him extra VIP access. My group can't afford the expensive tickets so we told him no or we would think about it, but he kept telling us to think about it.

Fast forward a week, I come to find that he has some camera gear I left at his house that I need for an upcoming work shoot, so I asked him to bring it to my parent's house (he lives 2 min from me) before the weekend when they were planning to visit me at my apartment. He told me he dropped it off but it turns out he lied and didn't. When I realized he had lied to me about dropping it off, I confronted him asking why he didn't but he said he would do it later. I kindly reminded him that I asked for it to be dropped off earlier for a specific reason, but that it wouldn't be that big of a deal because I would have a friend get it from him and hand it to me. I looked past it trying to avoid a fight.

I come to find out today that he's being a pain in the ass to the person who is going to pick my gear up so I decided enough is enough, especially since I am hurt he lied to me &amp; the fact that I am now stressing over getting this camera gear in time. I text him saying that I am upset by two things: he lied to me about dropping the gear off &amp; the fact that he is upset but didn't say anything to anyone. For years he has always preached that if people have a problem with him they should tell him to his face. I decided to take him up on that and see what he says. 

He responds by saying he doesn't understand why Im being annoying about getting the gear &amp; that our friend group doesn't respect him by giving him straight answers when he invites us to events. I told him that sometimes he pushes us even when we say no to him and tries to change our minds and that he kinda forces us into saying ""maybe"". In regards to the lie he told me, he said ""I said I was going to drop it off Saturday"" but I have evidence of me asking him if he already did it and he said yes, which was on a Thursday.  He then tried to end the conversation by saying ""enough"" in which I responded with ""that is childish and we need to discuss this"". Then he called me an asshole and said he had a meeting to go to.

I know you're only hearing one side of this story, so maybe there is bias here. But, I am trying to fully explain the situation. Did I handle this the wrong way by semi-aggressively texting him telling him that I am upset? I feel completely disrespected by my best friend, especially since I know he is talking smack about me to his other friends. The last few years I have noticed him become more and more two faced which leads me to believe that he is going through something that he isn't telling people.

We are both poor communicators. He will harbor feelings for months about you and won't say anything until you notice and apologize. I am done apologizing &amp; being disrespected; I feel like I have done nothing wrong here. I am trying to get him to realize that I am hurt and upset but he is playing victim here. His claim is that people judge him when he doesn't attend our plans, but blow off his plans. Did I approach this the wrong way? Am I in the wrong here? How can I talk to him and get him to see that I am just trying to voice my feelings and fix the situation? My other friends say ""fuck it, hes rude and never treated you correctly"" but he's been my friend since 5th grade and we have gone through a lot together. I want to try and salvage this.  A few years ago, I had to stop being friends with my other best friend of 5th grade due to drugs &amp; bad boyfriends. I know I am not the best at wording how I feel properly, and he is not good at realizing his mistakes and/or communicating his feelings, so I feel like we are at an impasse.

Any advice is helpful since most of my friends are telling me to ignore &amp; drop him which I don't deem the answer.

She is very clingy and every time we meet wants to cuddle and have sex. She is always texting me.

I am in college and I am being distracted from my studies. I'm paying a lot of money to be here and my girlfriend is consuming most of my time.

She has no job, lives with her parents. So I'm basically this sort of savior figure to her. I asked her, what about college? Job? Etc. She said she's afraid to think of that because she doesn't know what to do or pick.

She's understanding and cooperative which is good. But I just don't know...I question if she's helping or holding me back. 

She also has mental health issues such as bipolar and depression. She is medicated which evens her out (so I've heard) so no extreme behaviors have manifested yet.

This is my first actual girlfriend. I'm 21 years old. 
Latley I've been feeling pretty down and angry and trapped and I don't know why. I just don't know what the do because part ofe wants to stay, part of me what's to leave. I care about her a lot and don't want to hurt her, but I also don't want to sabotage my own success and happiness for someone else's.

A couple days ago we had physical education as always but in the locker room, for some reason, there was a tampon hanging on the wall.

For some reason we (around 8 people) thought it was a fun idea to burn it with a lighter. (I was the one who actually lit it because the other kids didn't know how the lighter we had worked)
When we did it it was funny and the flame was really small and it fell down so we kicked the flame out and everything went well.
The teacher came in and she smelled it so she found out and asked all of us who did it.

After a whole hour she still didn't know because no one said anything.

In 2 days we will get questioned again by someone with higher authority, (someone of the school board) and I can think of a scenario that will happen;
Scenario 1: ""You kids tell us who did it or all of you will get punished"" 

When that happens I'll be forced to say that I was it to keep my ""reputation""..

Except if you people can come up with a solution with my problem.

ps; the flame was really small, the teacher knows that all 8 kids know who actually lit it, the teacher did not see the flame herself, she only smelled it.

415,"Sigh. this is going to be a long one. I just need some sort of advice.

I'm 19. I work as a cashier at a grocery store like 5 minutes from my house. I don't have a car. The store just cut almost everyone's hours because we just hired 25 people for the front end (where i work) alone. I went from making 250$ a week to now getting less than 100$. I live with my folks but we don't get a long, as we are constantly arguing and they make me pay my share of the bills. on top of already having to pay my phone bill. Which my phone just broke btw. 

I am at fault because I should've been saving money, but I went out almost every check and spent it on food or clothes, I bought a new camera lens. Needless to say, the almost 2 months I've worked there I have damn near nothing to show for it. 

My parents have made me sell almost all my stuff. All i have to my name are the clothes I buy, the laptop I bought for school, and my camera. I had TWO different gaming computers over two different periods and they made me get rid of both of them, despite buying them with my own money, despite being in college paying for it myself and maintaining a 3.5. All because they didn't want it, they didn't think it was the ""right thing for me"". To be quite frank, whenever I sold my computer I feel like is when everything went down hill. I became depressed, a shut in. I lost all access to online friends I had made, I loved playing games and it kinda sucked - it still sucks - having to come home to nothing. No friends, no family, just me, my room, and my dog. 

I've thought about numerous times maybe I should up and leave but I've nowhere to go i'd be better off here than out on my own. Besides I can barely afford myself, I surely can't afford myself and my dog alone.

When i turned 18 I got 10 grand inheritance money and my parents basically told me i'd be retarded not to spend it on school, and basically made me believe that. I spent 13 thousand dollars on my first YEAR alone. The 10 grand came from inheritance the other 3 I worked for. 

I finished my freshman year and I could not afford to go back. 

I wasted all that time and money because I thought that's what my parents wanted, that's what they made me believe was the right choice. 

Had I known then, I would've said fuck school, bought myself a car and took the year off, worked for and then went back the second year and I would've been much better off.

10 grand down the drain in 1 swift payment. 

I sat at home all summer this past summer, I didn't know what I wanted to do, I knew I couldn't go back to school. I ended up deciding to join the military, I went through all the paperwork, all the screenings and evaluations, it was about 6 weeks of time. 

Only for them to tell me I was too deaf to join. And there was no other option. A big fat no from the Surgeon General. 

After I got that news I didn't know what to do. My parents told me I could either get a job and pay rent, or gtfo. 

It took me a while but I finally found the job I have now. &amp; as I said in the beginning I should have been saving money. But I didn't. I know I'm at fault for my problems. 

&amp; now the 5c I've had since like 2014 has finally croaked, I hope it's resting peacefully. 

I guess I just need help. I don't know what to do you know. 

I know I should save money, that's something I plan on doing from now on, I've never really done it before it'll be tough but now i have no choice but to.

We hung out last weekend and he surprised me with comments against Jewish people, Korean immigrants, and even used the word nigger (which he justifies by defining the word as meaning ignorant people of any race). It made me sad and changed the tone of the weekend for me.

I doubt I can change his view, because he spends so much time around those rednecks. Part of me thinks I shouldn't be friends with him, but we've known each other for years and I'm undecided about whether it's really a deal-breaker. I don't think he understands the full scope of what he's saying, because he's somewhat intellectually impaired and probably just goes along with what his community is saying.

A few of my best friends are making plans to go and I have always wanted to do a trip like this while I am still young and with my friends, but holy hell is it expensive.

The entire trip is about $5500, which will be paid for bi-weekly at around $135 until June of 2020. I work a minimum wage job part time and earn about $175 per paycheck and have a bit less than $2000 saved, since usually every paycheck I'll set aside around $150 in savings.

423,"For some background, I’m 16 going on 17 in less than a month, and I’m currently a sophomore enrolled into a high school IB program. For some time now, these past few years if I had to pinpoint it, I thought my parents were pushing me really hard to do the best that I could in school, and from time to time I’d complain about some of the things they expected of me to my classmates. I wasn’t doing it with the goal to throw shade at my parents, as I thought they were just trying to help me achieve my greatest potential. 

Or at least that’s what I thought until a few weeks into this school year.

Towards the beginning of September, some of my classmates which I had grown kinda close to approached me, and asked me if my situation with my parents had gotten any better over the summer. At first I didn’t know what they meant, and when I asked, they said they wanted to know if there was still verbal abuse going on, and if CPS had been called yet. Up until this point, I didn’t even know you could call CPS to report verbal abuse. Honestly, I’m still kinda confused as to what defines verbal abuse, but my classmates keep bringing it up whenever I talk about the interactions I have with my parents, so I’m concerned that something may actually be going on that I’m not fully grasping.

Now before this gets asked, I’d like to point out that my GPA currently stands at a 3.8, I’ve never done anything disrespectful or rude in any of my classes that would cause me to get into any trouble with teachers or administration at my school.

I’m happy where I am in my life, proud of my accomplishments and glad I’ve grown out of many things. 

Still, there’s this time in my life that can overwhelm me in an instant and make me feel like I’m not at home anymore. It’s strange. Echos of the past overwhelm me at times. Music from back then reminds me of long showers by myself listening to those songs, trying to navigate my strange existence. 
Even though back then I had nothing figured out— there were times I felt so much hope and idealism. It’s strange because it was right before my life went COMPLETELY (and I mean completely) awry and I learned some of the most important things about myself. 
I’m sure some part of me wants to go back and save the ship before it sinks. Be a better friend. Be a better person to myself. There are so many things that have happened since then that have changed me. Most for the better. But there are some things about myself that I miss. I cant even pinpoint what was different back then, it wasn’t about the people I spent time with I realize now...it was about me. 
I moved far away from my hometown and I miss it often. All of the things that I used to hate are things I miss. But especially from that time. The giant rain drops that feel like they’re beating down on your head. The smells of the seasons. The way that the old neighborhood looked walking through it alone. Walking to the spots that felt less mundane and looking at wild water running. The way the grass was so dark it almost looked blue in the night. The way shadows looked during the golden hour. 
There aren’t places that feel quite the same where I live now. (It is a completely different area of the USA and has a different ecosystem) And while I dont plan to live here forever— at times when I feel this overwhelming nostalgia— I feel trapped in my new life. I want to take parts of the new and take parts of the old and merge them...but I don’t even think it’s possible. When I get this overwhelming sense of longing— it feels almost like heartbreak. Not of the people I was with— but with how things felt. I wish I could feel the ways I felt in the past again. 

Has anyone ever felt this? If so...is there a way to embrace these feelings and find acceptance? Is there a way to pretend/manufacture the feeling of going back? I’d like to say I hate this feeling but I dont. There are some forms of sadness that don’t feel suffocating. And this is one of them.

428,"For various compounding reasons, I've developed Contamination OCD. I could go into details but I'll spare you unless you're interested. I 'see' germs on everything and when I touch something dirty, I wash/sanitize my hands or whatever part of me the dirty thing touched. To be clear, I'm not afraid of being dirty-- it's more like disgust. A prominent example is how frequently I hear/see people leave a public restroom without washing their hands. Now those germs are on the door handle I'm about to use, along with everything else they touch... so in effect, everything is filthy. If I keep myself clean, I won't have to worry about transferring those germs to my phone and then my face and then my couch, etc.

I hate being like this. I've seen various medical professionals over the years about this and have even tried medication when CBT didn't help. Around April I got off the medication and started a self-developed CBT approach and actually started doing a lot better. To culminate all of this improvement, during a two week trip last month, I forced myself to stay ""contaminated"" and I actually did really well. I cleaned everything when we got home, but otherwise it was great to feel free for two weeks. I wasn't cured, but it was real progress.

But the night we came home, my in-laws went into my house and stayed there for 5 hours without us, despite us having agreed otherwise and us demanding them not to be there. They wanted to bring my puppy home (who they had been watching), and for some reason beyond me, thought it was OK to open my closed bedroom door and go in and go touch my stuff. Long story short, I HATE how they disregarded our wishes and crossed clearly laid boundaries. It's sent me far back in my OCD progress, and I'm at a loss for what to do now. There is more entwined with this but to spare you, this is the short version.

The next day, I went to a local clinic and was diagnosed with a throat infection after the doctor took one quick look. I was prescribed antibiotics and went on my way for $60.

A week later, I receive a ""reduced cost"" bill of $1,300 from the hospital with a list of all of the blood tests. I am making slightly above minimum wage, and cannot afford to pay that bill.

432,"I recently became a certified phlebotomist and made the horrible realization that as usual I was an idiot.

Currently job hunting and seeing very jobs in my area that pertain to my certificate and I know that I don't really want to do this. I did it on a whim and I feel so fucking guilty because my grandfather was kind enough to give my money to pay for the course. He did something nice for me in the hopes that I could get my life together and fuck I feel guilty.

I hate the medical field but I always feel pressured to go into it. My mother has always pressured me to be in it and because of that I have background in low lever medical jobs. I feel stuck in this shit and I hate how I still allow her to do this to me despite living states away.

I don't intend on going back to school. I've tried twice and had to leave for two different reasons. I still tear up badly when I look at the deans list letter I got when I finished my first year in community college.

I do like nature and being outside. My current jobs lets me be outside but I hate it due to the retail aspect. I'm a garden merchandiser. It's a seasonal job and it's ending soon which is another reason why I need a job. I actually found out yesterday that instead of it ending in December like I was originally told about 3 weeks, it's ending in the beginning of November.  I wasn't even worth a 2 week notice.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, what can I do to get myself through this? 

Any self care tips would be greatly appreciated. ",24Oct2018,1
434,"First things first, I'm 16.

&amp;#x200B;

I wan't to try to keep this as short as possible, but it's a very long story, and I tend to make things way longer than they need to be, so bear with me if you will:

&amp;#x200B;

\-(I'm 8 years old here) My mother is arrested for drug possession and breaking and entering/robbery. I'm taken away from her and sent far south to my grandparents.

&amp;#x200B;

\-(12 years old) I am now leaving my grandparents to live with my father, who I could not beforehand because he was also sick like my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

(13 years old) I learn my grandparents only decided to keep me so they could get child support money from my parent(s). I also learn this year that, despite many good memories, I was abused as a child when living with my mother and was rarely ever fed, bathed, or watched after.

&amp;#x200B;

(16 years old, this July) For years now I've been living with my father and step-mother + her 3 children. Over these years, my father had been getting worse and worse and was a very abusive person, to my step-mother and step-siblings in particular. He was a compulsive spender and a victim of bipolar mania, but he is medicated and still has absolutely no excuse for blaming all his money spent on my step-mother. He beat her and abused the children (thankfully didn't touch them) and I assume he didn't ever bother me because I'm his blood child. On July 4th, I guess something snapped and he chased them out of the neighborhood, but thankfully an officer was on patrol and caught him in his truck. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, the other children have been taken away for safety to their real father. However, I'm old enough to decide who I get to live with (thankfully they have joint-custody over me and I obviously chose my step-mother). We have a court case coming up in December for divorce reasons, and good news, my step-mother has found a job and a nice place for us to stay and we've been here for a month.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems arise with literally everybody else in my family. My mother's and father's side are mostly druggies, but even for those who aren't, they are very ""family over everything else"" attitude. I've been barraged with hateful messages calling me a traitor, retard, and many other things, and my only family I have is my step-mother and siblings.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm feeling guilt for some reason, if I'm depressed/anxious, or if I'm just not thinking right, but I don't particularly like the situation I'm in with my family, ""blood"" or not. Over these years I've recognized their mistakes and try to personally forgive them, but I'm either ignored or told ""water under the bridge"", even though they do something like what they're doing to me now a few months later. It's also very hard for me to trust nearly anybody at this point, family or not. Not only that, it's very awkward to be living with my step-mother. I love her, and I appreciate everything she's done, but for some reason, I don't see her as true family. I don't know if this ties in with my trust issues or if I have anxiety or what, but I feel irregular and stupid. I feel like I'm leeching off of her escape from my family and I feel like I don't particularly deserve to be here, if that makes sense at all. Another problem is I refuse to believe I have any problems. Even though I mentioned I might have something mental like depression/anxiety earlier, I just refuse to believe I do. I mentally feel like I always have, but I don't know if I'm just being stubborn, if I just refuse to face my possibly mental disorders, or if I'm just shooting blanks and worrying too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading, if you did. I clearly don't have anybody to tell this to, or at least anybody I want to, so it's nice to share something like this anonymously. It also might be a source of help if any of you are professionals in this. Thank you.",24Oct2018,1
435,"Ever since I was younger, I’ve always had a dream to become a film maker or director, growing up around kids who wanted to be lawyers and doctors, being a film maker made me feel unique. 

Recently, my uncle who I only saw a few times a year passed away. He was a well respected film maker/director  who worked on classics like the A-Team and Spider-Man.  When he passed away, I was at camp and didn’t even realize until a few days after when I was home and opened our computer to find a news article about his passing that had accidentally been left open. Even then my parents never brought it up or any family members. I don’t know why and I wonder, without seeing that article I wouldn’t have even known. 

I wish that I could sit down and talk with him one last time and ask him what he learned from being in the industry, and asked him for advice on how I could be like him. I only imagine if the letter I wrote him from camp got to him before he passed. 

Ever since this, I can never stop thinking about why they wouldn’t tell me about it. What do you guys think? I wasn’t super close with him, but him and I had a connection and a common interest

443,"Hi everyone,

I know this sub gets a lot of these and you’re all pretty tired of seeing these posts but I could still use some advice. I’m actually a little embarrassed by the situation, hence the throw away account. 

Anyway, there’s this girl that I’ve known for years but really started getting to know a year ago. She and I were in classes together last year and we had a fun time, next semester came and we had two classes together and we would talk before and after class (she was across the room for one of the classes, and the other was Bio and she is really into school work so she would just work silently). 

I started liking her a month into the second semester and ever since then I’ve been trying to get her, but to no avail. I got her number during March Break (a week in March where there is no school) and we started talking, I learned so much about her but I don’t have any experience with getting girls and I think I over texted her. Anyway, we kept talking throughout the year but there were points where we didn’t talk as much, but they didn’t last long. 

We lost contact over the summer because she was busy working and I was busy with school work (I took senior chemistry for the summer since the school teacher is terrible). Now it’s senior year and we have no classes together. The only time we talk is when we text, in the morning before physics class, maybe during lunch, and in halls if we bump into each other. Our schedules are basically opposite to each other’s but we have had long talks and do enjoy each other’s company. 

But now, I’m just lost. I have close to zero experience getting girls and I have no idea what to do. That’s basically the extent of all of this, we mostly talk during text now and I think I have moments where I think I say the right things. 

Sorry if this is too long and if I had any issues, I’m typing this on my phone. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks. ",24Oct2018,1
445," 

Tl;dr: Relationship with advisor went from warm to cold over issues with low-quality work and destructive criticism. Situation was never resolved and now I'll have to leave which leaves me feeling dissatisfied and guilty.

I recently gave my notice at a place where I've been working for a year besides my studies. This is my last week.

I naturally assumed I would say goodbye to all, especially to my advisor. We initially had a very good relationship.

I hardly ever got any feedback on what I did. My main task was to write snippets of code, hundreds of them. The topic behind them was quite complicated and I only worked a few hours per week, so things were dragging. I did seek out my advisor when I had questions and she would always answer and explain things. However, she never sampled a few of those codes to check my work. After a few months when I was done writing them all down, another coworker ran a check over them and the majority of my codes were faulty. Not even then did she actually look at my work. She only briefly asked me what the problem was, if I was struggeling because it was a new task. Dumbfounded, I said yes and then she set me down to rewrite them all. Still, without any checking.

I found that odd, but I regularly asked for her advise and to me it was obvious that someone had to give my work a look. I think she knew that too, but just didn't have the time or didn't bother. Maybe it's my fault here but I just didn't know how to get her to check them because it felt to me like telling her how to do her work.

So I rewrote them and at the end I think I got the hang of them.

As both my time there and my studies were coming to an end, I applied for a position in another department. I actually studied a different field and got into this department by chance. They rejected my application but offered me a position in the department I already worked at, instead. I wasn't too intruiged, but asked my advisor about her job so that I could make an educated decision. That's where things went downhill.

When I told her about the reason for my inquiries she said ""I guess they turned you down because you can't code"". She suddenly felt very hostile and suggested I looked for another job. The position offered actually entailed the same amount of programming as the one I applied to. When I told her which position was offered to me, she finally gave me a brief description of her day-to-day tasks and told me that she indeed could need some help but that would have to be someone who is proficient.

I took the hint and did not take the position (not only because of that, but that discussion certainly wasn't a pro on my list).

I guess I would have let it slip but I remembered another, similar situation early in my time there. There was confusion about what they wanted me to do first. I told her that I wasn't supposed to do task A but rather task B as was discussed with our supervisor but suddenly she just asked me if that task was beyond me. Mind you, I am just a student and had just started there. That situation gave me a bit of anxiety but the following days she just acted normal so I thought she was just on the verge of burn-out and just needed to vent. So I let it slip and things went back to normal until the discussion about my application. I bring that up because that's the reason why I reacted differntly this time.

She had never checked my work to catch issues early on. When things were faulty she just let me re-do everything. And then she just told me I was shit, twice.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind constructive critisism. She could have sat me down anytime and said something like ""I get the feeling you're struggeling. Do you have any idea of how we can improve this situation?"" or ""I looked at your code and it seems to me that you don't understand XYZ"". But the only thing I get is nothing for months and then ""You suck, go get another job"".

After this incident, the advisor again acted as normal but I was actually hurt. I felt treated unfairly and went to work with a literal pain in my belly. Still, I communicated with her professionally and asked her advise when needed. But there were no more jokes or anything. I could tell that she wished for things to get back to normal but I was legitimately feeling miserable and she never apologized or anything. I did not expect her to get on her knees or anything, just something like ""I guess my words came across a little rough, that was not my intention"". Maybe I'm asking too much, I don't know. Maybe I just suck and she couldn't take it anymore.

Regardsless, I need to wrap this up, so: Our relationship grew cold and we didn't discuss anything other than work. I meant to say my goodbyes to everyone this week but she won't be coming because of private reasons.

So I just wrote her an email to inform her about the things she needed to know and added that I feel sorry for what happend and that we couldn't say good-bye in person. Given the background, that feels shallow and may come across as insincere. I also feel petty. Is there anything I can do? I'm moving this week also so I won't be able to drop in next week or something. Can I give her a call or write a text message?

Our relationship wasn't great at the end, but I really enjoyed working with her most of the time so I'm not happy about just having dropped an e-mail.

Any advice?",24Oct2018,1

I have found some research that 7 hours per day is enough sleep and should be kept still, but then going for 7 hours per night makes me tired after few days.

I do not drink coffee at all.

I have decided that it is best to sleep when it is dark for the quality of sleep and wake up early for the quality of day.

452,"Hey guys,

My predicament goes back a bit, but a little story on me. I’m 21 year old university student. Do pretty well, working two jobs, etc etc. Still live with my parents who I really love. Girlfriend of 4 years. Individually, I’m doing pretty great.

I’m looking for some advice on my younger sister. She’s 18. Last year she was absent from the household as she was addicted to cocaine and prescription drugs. My parents tried everything. She was hospitalized many times. There was a breaking point and she went to a youth rehab centre for the summer, where she got clean. Everything seemed to be picking up. 

When she got home, her old habits minus the drug use returned. She would argue with my parents, scream, yell, break things, leave for days at a time. Arguments were mostly over her car (technically my parents car, she doesn’t pay for any of it). She would get it taken away because she would smoke weed in it.

Now, weed is not a no-no in my house. I live in Canada so it’s also become legal.  My parents are perfectly okay with her smoking weed, but don’t want her smoking in the car because that is still very illegal and she is still underage.

For the past couple months my sister has been living with her boyfriend. The house has been really nice since she left. No yelling or fighting, just laughs with me, my parents, and my youngest other sister. I know it may be selfish but I was glad she moved out. She wasn’t in any trouble and we knew she was safe but she wasn’t causing stress at home.

Just today, she came home for an unknown reason. When my parents got home, there was a lot of weed in the car along with a bong and other paraphernalia. When they told her she can’t be doing that, she blew them off. They told her they were taking her car keys, and she lost it. Called mom and dad every name in the book, hit them, screaming, beat her head off walls, and then ran away on foot. These kinds of arguments are pretty normal for when she’s home.

The thing is, is it breaks my parents hearts. They do a lot for us and I’m lucky to have the things I have. When things like this happen, she threatens to kill herself and this and hat and it really despresses and stresses my parents. I hate to see them like this. I’ve tried talking with my sister multiple times, but nothing.

It makes me angry to see her mistreat our parents time and time again, when they have been nothing but helpful. I feel like we’ve exhausted our options. 

I’ll take any and all advice. Should I go to police? Doctors? How can I aid in such a situation??

TL;DR: Manic younger sister very disrespectful towards parents, freaks out, goes on violent tirade, calls them down to to the dirt, threatens to kill herself, obvious drug and mental health problem. What are my options as an older brother to help my parents and sister?",24Oct2018,1
453,"Dear strangers,

The British ""unfriendly"" culture baffles me a lot. I need some help over here. TLDR: I messaged an ex-teacher telling her I had my shoulder pain treated but she ignored me.

I once joined a few weeks long archaeological dig. I had severe shoulder pain for at least 15 years already. During the camp, one of the seniors (professional archaeologist) was nice and polite to me, I think (RED flag? Politeness is a sign Brits don't like you?). Once, when I was drunk, she told me that she liked my diligent attitude for continuing to work despite severe shoulder pain.

One year after the camp, I completed my degree and headed back to my home country. I got my shoulder pain treated. I thought it was good manners to tell her (the senior) about having my shoulders treated already. I was pretty excited about it (because I had already been in pain for too long, since I was a kid, and didn't know what to do about it). So I wrote to her over facebook messenger, telling her about my treatment (it's a chinese treatment using shaolin qigong technique where the master realigns blood vessels using bare hands, punches you repeated and such). I shared such details because I thought it would be interesting to share about cultural stuff. I myself wouldn't have gone to such an unlicensed practitioner if I didn't hear of his popularity in my hometown. However, my message was left on a 'read'. Have I done something wrong? Why was my message ignored and should I apologise in case I had offended her during the camp?

-Teacher-student relationship -Both females with big age gap, so rule out the possibility of not-wanting-to-respond-in -case-I-get-suspected-of-flirting -I never messaged her, I only occasionally like her facebook posts if I see them. I personally don't post on facebook.

459,"Long story short, I moved out of a bad situation with two friends of mine; away from my family and friends. Who don't have room to house me, cause large cities and small homes, mind you.

I have loved living here because I feel safe. Last night I brought it to my male roommate's attention that the live-streams he does are allowing a person who was in the same cult as me (I got out, thank goodness) has lied, cheated, and recently manipulated a person into no longer accepting work from me. (They lied about me removing watermarks from art that an artist I respected did for me. Of course, there is no proof of me ever asking anyone to do this. But of course the artist believes them because they're good friends with the person who is lying on me to them.)

He ran every vanilla 'just talk it out' option he could past me, to no avail.""Oh just ignore them and they'll go away"" --- It has been months and they're not going away, but appearing more frequently.

""Oh you both just need to sit down and talk to each other"" --- About what? They are obviously not right in the head for causing all this grief to befall on me. Need I remind you, I had to RUN away from the situation and find a safe place to live. Also, they're part of a CULT.

""What do want me to do? Ban them from my stream?"" --- Yes. They have proven multiple times they are only there to jab at me and pick at my slowly healing wounds. I've left the house entirely and was informed that minutes later, this person would leave the stream.

But of course, he doesn't want to do that. The person contributes nothing valuable to the stream, is not a Patreon backer, and is one of at least twenty other people who come into the stream. And those people provide wonderful and funny commentary. What I am saying is, if they were gone, no one would care or ask why.

So I did what my other roommate, who is his girlfriend, told me to do. 'Put this situation in perspective for him.'

I asked him, ""What if one of your girlfriend's exes or old backstabbing friends came into the streams and she told you she was uncomfortable?""

""I'd take her comfort into account and of course ban the person. But I'm not going to do that for you, no offense.""

***NO OFFENSE...?*** You try to make me see how peaceful I can be by just sitting here and ""possibly talking it out"" or ""Maybe doing something else"". But heaven forbid your girlfriend (who is on my side about this) gets involved with the same thing? The abuser will get the ban hammer and never ever be seen on stream again!

I guess the comfort level of not only a good friend, but a roommate you saved from an unsafe environment doesn't mean much.

\--

Understand this, I cherish both of my roommates. They're both great people and friends. But after pretty much being told my comfort has no value to them and I should constantly just smile and act like my previous abuser isn't in the room with us every time they stream, then I just...no longer feel comfortable here.

I have two jobs in this town and they both end and the end of the year. I want to be responsible and will keep at the jobs, and once the end of the year comes, seek somewhere else to live.

I want to know if this is wise? Or am I just being too sensitive about a person who literally keeps taking everyone and everything I enjoy away from me piece by piece?",24Oct2018,1
460,"Whenever I feel really tired I'm easily angered and end up taking it out on my girlfriend. I understand everyone hates being tired, but for some reason it turns me into an awful person. I'm never this way when I'm well rested. Before our son was born literally the ONLY times we ever got into arguments were on days we had to wake up early for appointments (I work until 4am so I would only be able to have a few hours of sleep).

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since our son was born a month ago, fights have been constant between us. Every Monday and Tuesday I work from 11:30am until 4:00am, and Wednesday through Saturday I work 8:00pm until 4:00am. I used to be able to recuperate on Wednesdays but now it's hard to get enough sleep on any day. I just perpetually feel exhausted. All I want to do is lay down and sleep for an entire day.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand it's supposed to be hard caring for a newborn. My girlfriend does as much as possible to help out and allow me to rest as much as possible, but I don't want to put everything on her either and I still don't get enough sleep. It's putting a huge strain on our relationship, and my girlfriend has even stated she dreads having to wake me up. We recently had a huge fight after I said I can't stand our son after getting next to no sleep before my second 15 hour shift. I didn't mean it. I love my son and I feel terrible for what I said.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep telling myself it won't happen again and I'll maintain my composure next time I feel the urge to snap at her, but I keep doing it. I feel like I'm becoming a different and awful person. We've been getting into so many fights lately and I know they're all my fault. It's making me feel terrible about myself and I hate the way I'm making her feel. I want to stop but it's like the rational part of my brain is turned off. I'm so stressed and tired and I'm unable to get enough sleep. How can I force myself to be rational when I'm being irrational?",24Oct2018,1
461,"My final exam is on May 27th, and bar a couple of graduation events, I am pretty much done with school that day.

That being said, May 27th is 7 months away. I still have all of that time left.

I've been feeling a bit checked out of this year to be honest. Not enough new opportunities. With the exception of decent exam results, I feel a bit unaccomplished. I also don't have a social circle at school so feel a bit lonely. These are all things that I want to change and they will change after I leave, but I still have 7 more months of this.

What can I do to get through it and make the most of my last year? I sometimes contemplate quitting, but I don't think it is worth it.",24Oct2018,1
462,"Hey so I'm 19 and she's 18. Both at seperate unis... She invited me to stay over to her uni because two weeks ago she stayed at mine overnight. There's some slight issues with that but now it's come to me not going anymore because I could sense she didn't want me to due to a 'fire alarm' which was the worry weeks ago when I wanted to go down then.

She's on a floor with 12 others, 9 of which are guys... Hey ho. These guys are pretty savage to each other. They're all brown (Will make sense in a min). They're all lads lads. I aint a lads lad. I'm pretty neutral and can fit in with either sex with little issues. Anyways, they already intimidate me a tad. I've met one and did that ""I self-conscious about my sexuality"" hand shake and squeezed pretty hard. I squeezed back ofc lol. Feel so manly. I kid. Anyway, these guys 'protecting' these girls including her on her floor  which sounds stupid considering they tried fighting with a rugby team when partying with them during their first few weeks 0.0

My gf invited a girl to see her clean room one day and everyone took that as an invitation to walk in her room and see. They saw a picture of me with a shitty chinstrap beard ;) and said I looked like a muslim. (Ironic). I aint racist but what can I say to that. ""You look like a suicide bomber"". Stupid shit. I'm sorry, I'm just angry. 

ANYWAY that was more of an overview (Let's admit it, a fat rant). I have growing to do. My gf said at first a few weeks ago that we'd spend the saturday night in. A few days ago she said that ""I never said that"" and that they might go out Saturday. ""But if they go out Friday they wont wanna go out Saturday"" which is true. I don't mind this, however, I go out a bit at uni however when she came around on a SATURDAY, I stayed in to spend time with her to relax and have a little break from uni life. 
What triggers me... As much as she tries to and wants to be 'Individualistic' she hangs on what people MIGHT think of her. I couldn't give two shits what people think of me if she's in the equation, so long as she's okay. 

Since she's a sheep to these people, she'll go out with them whether I'm there or not. Obviously I'd go to but I can just feel like she's my responsibility a bit as she cannot handle her drink as much as she thinks she can. I do not want a feud to happen between us because our stubborness goes through the fucking roof when drunk. I also don't wanna see guys flirt with her in the club. If they do when I'm not there, idc yanno? If it happens, she's a beautiful girl. But there are 'heroes' out there that tries to upstage boyfriends. 

Fakkkin hell. Yes we could communicate, and believe me, we do. But she plays dumb sometimes, denies things ever being said and leaving me to believe I ""Imagined"" this shit. Hence why she says ""Go find the messages to prove it"" knowing full well she said that she did promise a quiet night in during a FaceTime call.

I suggested not going around and she was kinda cool with it, spurting out the ""If that's what you want"" which is fair enough. What pisses me off? I said ""I know you so well, I know this is what you actually want"" with no denial from her and she wants to spend time worrying about this fire alarm that isn't going to go off at 3am. She suggested we stay out til 4am to 'avoid it'. Sorry, I'm not prepared to stay out in clubs til 4am, looking out for you sober cause I most certainly can't do shit when drunk just because you're worrying about some fire alarm.

I wish she'd put in as much effort, care and thought into me as I do her... Every damn day. 

Summary:
Ranted a bit in this post, fair enough for skipping!
Was going to see girlfriend who said
quiet night in... TO We might be going out TO... We're probably going out (With her uni friends who are rude arseholes from the sound of things. e.g. bullying a new flatmate they have, saying I looked like a muslim...I'm sensitive aye. New guys, saying shit about you to your girlfriend, idk! ). Anyway, she's basically not wanting me over and trying to deter me. This is a 1.5 year relationship and she'd been like this for a long time. The first 6 months were great. This past year it's all 'misunderstanding' among some other shit.

463,"2 hours ago I went to school. Everything was fine until the teacher brought me to his office and told me I had a 65% in the medical section of the class, told me there was no way around it, and that I was out of the class and could not continue. I turned in an assignment that was not completed and he gave me a 0/100 because of that. I had high 80’s on all my tests and on my final for that class section, yet the assignment failed me completely. I have not stopped crying. I am so embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I told everyone in my life I was going to be an EMT by December. I was so proud of it and happy. Now I have to tell every one of those people I’m a failure and I failed out of the class. I wasted my money and time. . The instructor is incredibly strict but I figure I will email him and try (probably fail) to appeal. I’m only 18. I was probably too young and stupid. It was a full credit class, so now I have nothing else to do or focus on. Could anyone please offer any advice from being in any sort of situation similar to this? I just need to know I’m not alone.

465,"I had been working with Company A for about five years, traveling all over the country to do the job, and I was/still am really good at what I do. I got burned out with all the travel, and tried to quit. Company A told me they wanted to keep me, and they'd just assign me local work when it was available if I'd stay on. Sounded like a good deal, so I accepted.

I got another job doing what amounted to the same thing with Company B. Company B is a lot smaller than Company A, and I rose quickly through the ranks, still doing work for Company A, usually one assignment a month on average. This worked great for a while, as I could generally schedule things so gaps in my schedule with Company B could be filled by work with Company A.

Now I'm management with Company B, making $10/hr more than Company A pays, where the pay rates were about equal when I started at Company B. Licensing laws are such that I am the only one in Company A who can do their work in my state, as they're based halfway across the country.

I've had so much work to do with Company B, that I stopped accepting new assignments from Company A for a while. Company A is starting to get a little backlogged and getting on my case about it. 

I don't want to just quit Company A altogether, but my priority has to be with Company B because of my responsibilities there, not to mention the significant pay discrepancy, which Company A has been unwilling to address.

How can I tell Company A that they're not the priority, and I'll get to their work when I can without burning any bridges? They're not a bad company to work for, they just have to play second fiddle now.",24Oct2018,1

471,"     About 2 or so days ago, I got off the bus and saw a dead squirrel lying in the middle of the road. I felt so bad and sad for it so I picked it up with my bare hands, and placed it on the grass under a bushy area. Apparently, there were two like high schoolers behind me who saw and started calling out how gross that was. I just ignored them and went home.
     The squirrel had no blood on it or any other substance, but I still vigorously washed my hands as soon as I got home . Besides that, I didn't think much of the incident.
     Today, there were a bigger group of high schoolers, and I heard one of them say, ""That's the girl that picked up the dead squirrel!"" And another one goes""You nasty!"" Then someone says something about where I live. I just ignored them and kept walking, hoping they wouldn't find out where I live.
     As soon as I got home, I searched up if I could get any disease for picking up a dead squirrel and it said it was very unlikely but I could get ticks.
     Now I'm starting to deeply regret picking up that dead squirrel and those high schoolers knowing and walking close to me every day. I felt like I did the right thing when I picked up the squirrel,    but now I'm wishing I'd just left it there, as much as it makes my heart hurt.
     What should I do if I see the high schoolers tomorrow? If they say things again? If they find out where I live? If I end up going to their high school and they recognize me?

I'm thirteen (a girl) and in 8th grade, and there's this boy I ""like"".

I don't think he will find out, because he doesn't have any social media himself, but I've looked at just about every account (Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) and picture of his family members, even his extended ones. I've heard him get very defensive about his sister when one of his friends made a silly joke about her, so I know that if he found out what I did he would be disgusted. I feel like... I almost kind of intruded his family and I feel so bad about it. I didn't message them or ANYTHING except look at all their stuff, but I found out that on Facebook if you look someone up or visit profile frequently they'll get you as a friend recommendation. It makes me sick that his family members have probably seen my name before, and that he could find out about it. He would probably warn his friends about me and they'd all make fun of me because that's what they do when somebody does stuff like that and it would be so mortifying.

I'm a second year community college psychology major (I enjoy helping my friends through issues so I was thinking Therapy) and just not sure what to do with my life at all.

I'v just never been good at school and work is the largest drag of my life. I don't skip classes and I pay attention and participate in class, but whenever it comes to doing any school work I just can't put myself to do it, that's always been my issue and its just not really one i can resolve I think.

I'v been playing guitar for about 4 years and I'm okay at best right now and I'm just trying to teach myself piano. I also love singing but absolutely suck at it. When im singing along to a song a record myself it sounds like I'm there but really not at all haha. No one around here (at least none of my friends) play any instruments or would ever seriously be down to get in a band and write stuff.

Hi everyone! I am a 20/f and my boyfriend is 26/m. We have been dating since July of this year, but have been long distance since the beginning of September because I am at school (he lives really close to my house back home). We talk/skype almost every day and our relationship is super great; we said we loved each other just about a week or two ago, and things have just been great! We make each other super happy!

My parents are a bit on the fence about him, for a couple reasons I suspect: (1) I'm their only kid and my parents have always been hesitant about me dating (2) they think he's just a bit old for me, etc. They know I've still been with him even though I'm away at school; I'm pretty sure they like him in general (they've said he's nice, respectful, etc) but maybe just don't like me dating, lol.

The day of, we will drive in the morning from my house to our relative's house which is just 2 hours away, then drive back that night. So it's just a day trip, nothing overnight. My relatives want Thanksgiving at their house because it is the first big family holiday they will be able to host since getting their house fixed after Hurricane Harvey last year (the whole first floor was flooded but everything is fine now).

In this conversation over the phone, I asked my parents what they would think of me bringing my boyfriend to Thanksgiving. At first, my dad immediately said no, and my mom was all ""maybe another time."" I briefly spoke about it and my dad changed to ""I'll think about it"" (in the past when my dad has said he'll think about it in regards to my current boyfriend, he's ended up being fine with whatever was going on). I left it at that for now because I didn't want to argue and I wanted to leave my parents on a positive note.

When I talk to them next I am thinking of bringing up the topic again. I really do want to be able to spend Thanksgiving with my boyfriend, he is more than willing to make the drives and spend it with me, etc. One important fact I've thought about is that this year will be my boyfriend's first Thanksgiving without his family, since he only gets one day off from his current job and his family is too far away to drive in one day. He's pretty sad about this and I want to help him have a good holiday!

Would it be appropriate to continue requesting to my parents that we bring my boyfriend? He would drive himself and I would ride with him as we would also need to carpool with my aunt and uncle and that would be too many people in one car. I was thinking I should also ask my relatives whose house it is directly as well; I think it would be appropriate and even polite to ask, even if they say no. Basically, is there anything wrong with requesting that I bring my boyfriend to Thanksgiving at my relatives house? If nothing is wrong, what are some things I should mention in conversation with my parents and relatives who own the house? 

Thank you very much!

TL;DR: This will be my boyfriend's first Thanksgiving without his family and I will be home during break (we are LDR while I'm at school). Is it appropriate to ask that I bring my boyfriend with us to Thanksgiving at my relative's house? This is the first family holiday my relatives get to host since Hurricane Harvey last year when their house was flooded. My parents are kind of on the fence about it; I was thinking of ways to convince them and I am also planning on talking to my relatives who own the house about potentially bringing him. ",24Oct2018,1

Another question I have is: Non smokers who date smokers, are you just ok with knowing that your partner could get cancer from it and also ok with taking care of them during the hell that goes along with a diagnosis.  Am I selfish for not wanting to touch that with a 40 foot pole? I realize we are all gonna die and anyone could get cancer but, to choose to put yourself in that position is beyond me (partner choose, not smoker choose, I know they can’t help their addiction or whatever)

My boyfriend is 35, I’m 32, his dad died of lung cancer. I love him but it’s getting to the point of either make moves to get married or break up and start fresh with the rule of dating only non smokers (I also fucking hate the smell, taste, etc, i also blame the smoking for his snoring, low sex drive etc etc). I guess I feel that it’s unfair to him bc of the whole addiction being a disease not a choice thing. Addicts deserve love too but maybe he should find someone with his same habits.

497,"(This is a copy-paste of a post made to /r/teenagers and it sounds a bit condescending because I'm explaining terms the average teenager my age won't know, so ignore my explanations. I assume most adults know what a maxillofacial surgeon is and what facial implants are, etc). I'm 17 btw. There is also a TL DR at the bottom.

I've complained about my face before here and people shut me down, saying there's nothing wrong. Well, a trip to a doctor called a ""maxillofacial surgeon"" who studies bone growth in the face has shown me that I do indeed have a deformity of the lower jaw. It is only aesthetic in my case, and not functional. My jaw is basically too small and undersized, so the skin around it isn't pulled tautly. That's also why I don't really have a jawline. I can, however, get a normal sized jaw with a jawline augmentation procedure, check this out:

https://exploreplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Custom-Jawline-Implant-design-for-Medpor-Jaw-Implant-Replacements-Dr-Barry-Eppley-Indianapolis.jpg

Basically they make a biocompatible implant using 3D scans of your skull and then they will attach it to your jaw. It sticks for life. Expensive, but it does look good. I have to wait until I'm 18 for the procedure, though (because even if my jaw won't grow to its full size it can still grow a bit, plus the rest of my skull might grow). I will probably wait until 19 because I want to be finished with school first.

So, the surgery costs about $14,000 and I think that I can cover $10,000 of it myself with money I have earned working hard past few years. I would like my parents to perhaps cover the $4000. It sounds a bit rude to say it, but it is their genes which gave me this problem anyways.

Anyways,

I mean it's an actual proper deformity https://www.healthline.com/health/retrognathia

Basically, it's when the rest of your face grows, but your jaw doesn't grow to adult size. Some people have it way worse than others. My case isn't that severe, but it's noticeable. Some people have even asked me; ""Why is your face so short when you're so tall?"" etc.

Sometimes it can be fixed by braces, but that's only if your teeth are not aligned. My teeth are aligned but my jaw is still stupidly small. Here's another example of a dude who has it:

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/462694847640502283/504744848423911426/Retrognathia_-_Pictures_Symptoms_Causes_Treatment.jpg

Here's mine btw:

https://i.imgur.com/b7taTi5.png

-------------

There are two ways to fix it; the first is to slice open the skull and reposition the jaw and skull and that's a very painful and brutal surgery which takes like 2 weeks to recover from during which you have to be fed through a tube etc... here's an animation of what it looks like, and you don't want to see videos of the surgery actually being carried out. If you do, search up ""Lefort 1 video"" into YouTube. But it's really gross and gory and even surgeons have passed out doing it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMS6mezf6WQ

And it costs anywhere between $50,000 to $75,000. Most people only get it if they can't chew their food (I can) or if their jaw is pushed back so it's restricting their airway because the tongue is blocking the throat (I probably won't have to deal with that for like another 30 years and if I do have to I can use a breathing tube or mouthpiece or something which is much cheaper).

The second way to fix it is to have implants attached around your jaw to make it look adult-sized. This is quite expensive as well but much less so.

-------------------

Neither of my parents have it, they have normal sized jaws. I know that a lot of you guys might say ""oh I don't notice it"" but if you look closer you can probably see what I'm talking about, and you guys don't have to life with this face. I have to live with this face.

So it's aesthetic surgery, to be honest, but a lot of people have aesthetic surgery. If someone was born with a freakishly large nose and got it corrected, then that's that. Some people get their ears pinned back. People who are burned in car crashes get their faces reconstructed. In my opinion, I'm not being vain - I am just achieving a face I would have had if I wasn't born with this deformity.

A lot of times, braces are used to correct alignment of the teeth for purely aesthetic purposes anyways. Many kids with braces don't even need them for medical reasons.

**I guess some of you guys will say ""oh just lose weight"" but that's not the point. The thing that causes my jaw to look small and lamely defined and ""shifted back"" is because it didn't grow to an adult size. Someone here advised me to do ""jaw exercises"" - I did that and ended up with a jaw joint disorder.**

**The doctor has told me literally the only way to make my jaw proper sized again is to have implants placed. I am actually already at a weight where I am on the lower end of what is considered healthy; if I lost a bit more weight I would be underweight, and if I lost a lot more weight I would be considered anorexic. This is not a diet / fat issue, it's a bone structure issue. I would really appreciate if you did not tell me to lose weight.**

So, do you guys think I'm being unreasonable in asking to have this procedure done when I'm 18 years old? My face will finally look properly grown. I'm not going to turn into any plastic surgery doll or anything, I am totally happy with the rest of my face (except my nose - but I don't think I'd ever have that changed, maybe a tiny bit, but not really something I worry about).

The procedure doesn't even age badly like most plastic surgery does, because it's not botox or fillers or the like. It's basically like adding an adult sized jawbone to my jaw. It actually makes you look better as you get older.

So, what do you guys think? I'm also probably never going to have kids so they won't have to suffer with this problem. But if I did, I would pay for a jawline implant for them too.


**TL DR: Have a small jaw thanks to slight genetic deformity, it's not a functional worry (I can chew! Hurray!) but it makes me look pretty shit visually. Surgery to get implants attached so I have a normal sized jaw is $14,000 and I'm willing to pay for $10,000 myself - is it unethical to ask my parents to cover the remaining $4000 and maybe pay them back another time?**",24Oct2018,1

He really has been around goodwill too much. And my mom loves him but she's sick in the head. She's always been this way. Sometimes I feel like drinking or taking drugs just so things can seem normal again. Without all the fighting. I haven't done either. I'm drowning here.

503,"Hey reddit,

I would like some advice on how to deal with this...
I have a 17 year old severely autistic brother who is the most violent, psychopathic, abusive monster (I don’t have anything wrong with autistics, i used to work with a few of them and have a friend who’s on the spectrum, just specifically my brother)
He is barely verbal, but the worst part of him is he’s extremely EXTREMELY violent. He’s literally a rabid animal, and has almost no human traits in him. He abuses and beats on my mother almost all the time, and sexually advances on my 18 year old sister who just started nursing school. I just graduated college, and just started a professional job and the lack of sleep is taking a heavy toll on me. I only sleep 4 hours(or less) a night due to my brother who’s constantly screaming, breaking things, thrashing, flailing, etc. My mother absolutely refuses to do ANYTHING about him. She will not budge. Even talking about him she will ask me to leave. She constantly says it’s everyone but her fault the way he’s like this. She tells my sister it’s her fault and she deserves it when he sexually assaults her. She enables him. The house has holes in the wall everywhere, broken doors, and broken objects. The police get involved once a week, sometimes twice a week because he goes nuts at school apparently. He attacks people on sight as if he’s Michael Myers or something. But police? they do absolutely nothing. No body takes any action against him. Either out of pity, or because they don’t want to be “labelled as being discriminatory against a disabled person.”

I have absolutely no money, since I just started my new career, and I don’t even think I can keep working because the lack of sleep and stress is influencing my work. My mother has multiple credit cards open under my name(when I checked credit karma I was 7000 in debt) , and can hold me hostage any time. I know she will if I try to emancipate myself. She constantly tells us it’s our fault and we all deserve to be abused by him. She thinks my sister and I don’t like him because of his autism. When in reality it’s the way she raised him by giving him absolutely everything he wants in life, and him actually enjoying hurting people. He even talks to himself all the time saying he wants to hurt people so much. 

I live in Los Angeles, and having a car is essentially a necessity here. But my car is under my mother’s name and if I take any action she told me she will call the police and file a criminal report saying “I stole the car”. 

I really, really don’t know what to do at this point. I have no money until I get paid(which is in a month). But my mother will hold me hostage. I don’t even know if I can last longer... I lost 4 pounds from the lack of sleep and stress in 3 weeks. At this point I think my psyche can’t handle this anymore, and might just die from stress.

So back story. My soon to be ex and I met in the military and had a child and got married. Both of our families are from idaho. Currently we live in California. I am not very close with my family, but they are well to do and overall nice, good people. Her family is from a very poor indian reservation with high unemployment, drug use, alcohol abuse and overall very uneducated. We are currently going through a divorce and she wants to take our son and raise him on the reservation.  I am very worried about him growing up in that environment.  I also worry that his mom has severe emotional issues, and she cannot take care of herself financially.  

My main dilemma I have is that I really don't feel comfortable letting her take him from a safe environment at a good school to a very bad area, surrounded by people who make me uncomfortable. My ex has told me that she would be a hardcore alcoholic, who would probably have a bunch of kids with different dads and work a dead end job.  On the flip side I feel it is selfish to deny him the opportunity to grow up around his family, and make his mom stay in California where she isnt happy.

tl;dr: I have a great first job and girlfriend but am unhappy and considering starting again in college. 

To give some details to this post. I've always struggled with depression and have recently had to come to terms with that fact. Not the type of depression where I am constantly hurting myself, but the kind where the days drag on and the sky is grey and you wish you were dead. I've also never been sure of what to do in my life. Come graduation for High School I decided IT is where I would specialize since I've always been interested in computers and a lack of better option. I managed to land an internship at my current company that eventually lead to a full time job with great pay (40k) and benefits with no certs or degree. I also managed to get a girlfriend and move out with one of my friends. So on paper it looks like i'm making all the right choices. I tell myself to study and take cert test so I can go to an online college and get a degree as well. But here's the kicker, I hate studying for the cert test and keep postponing it. I love my girlfriend but I can't tell if its my depression or if I am just generally falling out of love with her. 

Everyone has been nothing but supportive of me my entire life. My parents did separate and I was left with grandparents at a young age but they have somewhat been apart of my life since. I have always been told how I will be super successful and rich since i had a good head on my shoulders since I was a child. And ultimately I do want to be successful. I'm just extremely unhappy and I don't know why. And in case you were wondering, my family is poor and has been my entire life. 

So I reached a new ultimatum with my life. Maybe if I quit my job and run off to college and focus only on the schooling I can get my life to where I want it. Maybe if I get that party lifestyle you see in college I can become happy. I don't know I'm just lost and looking for advice.  ",24Oct2018,1

I feel like mentally I may have something wrong with me... But maybe I'm just a normal person who struggles with life...

It all starts when I was young... Middle school-ish... I began to develope an egotistical view of myself.. Like I could do anything. For the most part I could. I dated a girl just to prove to a buddy I could do it. I always got good grades with minimal effort. I was just good at being successful. This continues to HS when I date a girl because she's cool, but along comes another girl who I never could date for some reason, and she expresses interest in me. I do stupid stuff and have an emotional relationship, nothing physical except for hand holding, with this girl, causing me to hurt two people at the same time... I graduated validictorian (again something I found to be extremely easy), and head off to college.

Got a job at a warehouse, worked my way up the ladder while in college. Easy. 

College was/is a breeze. Currently maintaining 3.5 while working and married. I met my wife in college, and I love her to death. When we met she rejected me at first. We continued to hang out, until we started dating, then we get married. I don't want to think I took our relationship as just another hurdle to overcome, but sometimes I wonder. I know that I love her though, I would lay down my life for her. 

We recently moved and all was going well... Until recently. I had a job that I quit because of some people who would cause the whole workplace to be brought down along with several other reasons. I picked up a door to door job because I thought I could do it, but I can't... I talk to a few people a day, but most days I spend huddled in my car, afraid of the day. It's the first time I haven't been successful at something and it is making me spiral into something I've never had to deal with.

I feel like I'm an addict to my own success... Like I have the ability to not work, and still produce results. I have manipulated people in the past for my gain, and sometimes fantasize about pulling off some kind of crime just to prove to myself I could do it if I wanted to. I have known myself to lie with ease, and lose minimal sleep over it. Although I had not done this for some time until recently with this stupid job. 

Maybe I'm just in a bad spot in life and focusing on all the negative. I know I probably wouldn't commit said crime (usually just some kind of heist at some place), and I've always had an active imagination... I was successful at my old job, but maybe door to door just isn't for me and is triggering something else.
 
Sorry for the long post.

I've had everything I could ask for in this world and it never seems like enough. I had a good job, a great family, a girlfriend that was perfect for me, yet I feel like I was never truly happy. I was manipulative, dishonest and disloyal because I couldn't control my feelings. Always feeling like nothing is good enough, like I'm never achieving as much as I could be and that the next thing that comes along will fix everything. There's days I feel like I can change the world, and others where I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I say things that I want and feel like I need to do, yet my actions reflect the total opposite. I struggle to control myself, between my addiction to marijuana, juul, sex/masturbation and unhealthy desire to act sexually on every remotely attractive women that I come across. I fall back on those bad habits daily, even when I say I have to or am going to change. I don't know how to understand my emotions, or how to talk to people about my struggles. I ruined my relationship with someone I cared about more than anyone over all of this, and I just feel like I'm hitting rock bottom. I am lost and want to be able to control my life and feelings, be happy to wake up every day and not experience this constant doubt and self pity I have been going through.

Before our exams we have to do an online module. And after we do the module the days after we are allowed to take our exam in person. It's an exam ticket essentially.

Me thinking it was due tonight before the exam(Thursday) didn't do it. It was due last night...

Theres no way of coming back in that class. Because each exam is 28%

You can't give extra credit due to board of nursing as well. The professor tried seeing what she can do for us( me and two other students) because she knows we are A students and tried to fight for us.


If you don't pass one course of the first semester of this school that means you can't move onto the next semester regardless if you make an A in the other courses.

525,"I’ll explain everything. I’m a 16 year old male who has a bit of an anger problem. When I get frustrated and going I put my morals aside and I do not hold back at all with what I say. This doesn’t mean I mean everything I say but I can say some very messed up and hurtful stuff. I am currently going to therapy and it’s actually been going well, this is my first issue in months.

There’s a girl who I’m going to refer to as V in this conversation that I used to be friends with but haven’t been getting along with her lately because she’s been pretty terrible to me. I had no romantic interest in V at all, she’s just honestly not really a good person and acts like a stuck up female. She’s talked about me behind my back before and in our class group chat will nitpick at things I say that she wouldn’t nitpick at if I was someone else. This led to an extreme frustration and hatred towards her that I’ve been holding under wraps for around 2 months. 

In June, V’s father passed away and we were still friends and I was doing my best to support her. I showed up at the wake and I was as respectful as I knew how to be and she seemed completely fine. I recently found out that after I left she was talking about me behind my back, saying that she felt uncomfortable because one of her cousins asked if I was her boyfriend and she didn’t like that I hugged a few members of her family at the wake. Now I found this extremely insulting because when you show up to a wake so what if you hug someone? It’s out of respect to say I’m so sorry you lost this person, I didn’t mean any harm by this. Family members ask all the time “is that your boyfriend/girlfriend” and I think she overreacted. The thing is she was like this before her father died, always found something to complain about.I really had a strong dislike for her after all this stuff. 

On Sunday, we were talking in our class group chat when someone said something I felt insulted by so I said “I would say something back but I’m gonna be better than that” and left it at that. My now ex-friend enjoys drama and stuff and kept saying in our private group chat that they violated you and you should say something back. I eventually did but nothing serious and that person and V both came at me and started being petty. I got frustrated and vented in the private group chat and in the past when stuff like this has happened they would bring up her father’s death.

Out of pure frustration I said “I don’t give a f*** if V’s dad died, that doesn’t give her an excuse to be an ***hole to me.”

After this I argued with 2 of my ex-friends in the private groupchat for hours. Eventually I admitted what I said went a bit far and I was wrong. Unfortunately this one kid really enjoys drama and decided to go ahead and tell V what I said, tell me that another kid told her, then wait until I went off on the one kid before telling me it was him. I was furious because this started a whole lot of shit. But I can’t help but think how she may feel having a touchy subject brought up. I felt bad about saying something about her deceased father but I was frustrated with how I’ve been being treated by my group of friends, they aren’t good people and because of that I’ve been slowly distancing myself even before this.

My one actual friend just told me to go to bed and forget about those 2, so I did. But the thought of what I said and how it affected V really hurts and drives me to the point of having trouble sleeping. I’ve just dealt with 2 deaths recently and I don’t want to imagine how I’d react if the roles were switched and I was V. I felt like sh*t.

The next day I overheard 2 people talking about it saying that she was extremely upset and crying and saying “I want to kill this kid”. Today someone I know that is close friends with her decided to talk with me. It was about this and they told me how V reacted and I told them that I know i was wrong and I don’t know what to do because what I said was completely out of line. They told me I should apologize and just let her say what she’s gonna say.


I’m extremely hesitant to apologize for a few reasons. I know I was in the wrong here for saying that about her father and I really do feel terrible about it, but I don’t feel like V would even give me the chance to apologize. She doesn’t handle things right and if I tried to apologize I feel like she would just go off on me or do something even worse and be spiteful. I feel like apologizing to her is risky basically because I really don’t know how she’s going to react. She could leave me on read, she could go off on me, she could be short and simple. I don’t know. I know how I’d feel if the roles were switched so I’m scared of what’s to come if I decide to shoot an apology her way.

What should I do here? I have nowhere left to turn but reddit at this point. I don’t have a friend I can trust or ask for advice and parents aren’t the best advice givers themselves. I feel like they would be extremely upset with me if I told that’s what I said. Part of me feels like what I did was wrong and I should apologize but another part of me feels like that V has treated me like such crap that who knows what she’ll do if I even make contact with her. She might think I’m only apologizing because I got “caught” but that’s honestly not the case. I need help.


TL:DR Out of frustration I said something bad about a girl’s deceased father and I’m scared to apologize.

526,"I'm not sure if this would be the place that I post this, but I'm hoping someone could at least shed some light on what's happening to me/ give some advice? 

Some background : I've had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep since I was around 5 years old - I'm in my early twenties now. I never thought it was severe enough to qualify as a sleeping disorder, and when I was a kid it was normal for me to take 4+ hours to fall asleep. I was tired, but my mind was active and racing thoughts kept me hopelessly awake.

A couple years ago when I was in high school I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety, (which definitely made me understand why my sleeping patterns were so fucked up) and depression. I got on meds (Lexapro) and that mostly helped with keeping my jumbled mind at bay when I needed to sleep. When I got to college, I was in an extremely stressful program (pulling all nighters, running on 4~ hours of sleep for a few days), so when I needed to fall asleep and be reassured that I'd get 7ish hours, I'd take about 5mg of melatonin, every night. I know that there are no long term studies on the effects of taking extra melatonin every night. I ended up building up a ""tolerance"" to it, I was taking about 25mg a night, which horrified my doctor to learn, and I immediately lowered it after my appointment. I also learned that taking antidepressants and melatonin and cause some pretty wacky nightmares, but I didn't have any unusual problems sleeping and staying asleep. And my doctor reassured me that taking 3-5mg a night isn't harmful, and that I need to do what I need to do to fall asleep. 

But recently (for the last 3 months or so) I was switched onto Prozac after the Lexapro stopped working, and my diagnosis was reassessed to Borderline Personality Disorder + generalized anxiety + chronic depression. The Prozac has been working really week and I don't want to die anymore (thankfully!), but I've noticed that ever since I started the meds (25mg) and taking melatonin at night (3-5mg) I've been hallucinating(??) / seeing people around my bed at night. I'm a woman and I live alone, so this is terrifying. 

I'll wake up in a half asleep daze and notice someone standing at the end of my bed, and their facial features are so DISTINCT! The first time this happened, I saw a bald man leaning on my bedpost, smiling at me. I promptly screamed, grabbed my pepper spray from under my pillow and sprayed it in his direction. A second later, I waved my hand through the space and realized it wasn't real. This has happened nearly every night since then, with various people appearing by my bed when I'm half asleep. 

The problem is that I need something to help me fall asleep at night, being depressed makes me more lethargic than the average person, so I need all the sleep I can get to function as normal human being. My stress levels have significantly decreased since dropping out of college and choosing an different path in life, but I hate falling asleep at 3am and having to wake up at 7am. But I also don't like hallucinating random people in my apartment at night when I'm alone. 

I have done all the recommended things for ""calming"" my mind before I sleep - No screens for 2+ hours before bedtime, sleepy time tea/lotion, reading books, working out, daydreaming, not drinking any caffeine. For people who would suggest I take Benadryl/ a similar med, antidepressants usually react badly when combined with those. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences when taking melatonin? Is this happening because I'm on Prozac? Is this something psychological? I never recognize the people I see at night. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",24Oct2018,1

529,"Im 22 years old and I have never been in a relationship and yet I'm kinda scared to be in one. Specifically I'm scared of being cheated on. 

The reason I have not yet been in a relationship is not because of this fear but because I have been raised by a strict family.  Arranged marriages are common in my culture and just so there's no confusion, arranged marriages are not forced, it's where the parents find you someone and then u decide whether you want to go ahead.

Of course if I met someone myself my parents would be okay with it as long as he seemed decent. 

At first I was interested in finding someone myself but then this fear came mostly from hearing stories from my friends or in general about being cheated on after years of being together or even being married and having kids, I feel the pain the person must of gone knowing that the person they trusted and all the years they had together had gone to waste. I don't ever wanna feel like that. 

So I've decided I'd probably have an arranged marriage, that way most likely I won't love the guy and so if he cheated on me I wouldnt be broken hearted as much and I still get the pros such as having children cuz I really do want kids

I’ve generally just been supportive of her choices while gently encouraging her to continue seeing conventional doctors (hoping that they will persuade her to continue chemo, radiation, or the like).

545,"**TL;DR: Brother has been on disability his entire adult life, lost it, appealed, and lost the appeal despite the fact they acknowledged he's ""severely mentally impaired."" I am freaking out because we may not be able to pay bills.**

Longer story: My brother is basically the combination of our dad's and his mom's mental health genetics crashing into each other in a gory train wreck. I love him dearly, but he has depression and anxiety so severe that, even at the highest dosage of his meds, it's still not completely responsive and CBT only seems to work *sometimes*. 

He tried to get through high school, and dropped out. Got into college with a GED and became so crippled by anxiety he flunked out. He has lost two jobs because of his anxiety, one of which lasted a whopping *three hours* before he was terminated. His mom got mad and abandoned him with her mortgage when he was 22, our other brother bailed on him and moved across the country, and it was up to big sister to make sure he didn't end up homeless. He's lived with me ever since.

Last December, he lost his disability. I don't know how because nothing changed. They told him he could appeal but, if he did and he lost, he would have to pay back every bit of support he got from them during the wait. This led him to vouch out of it and hope he could find and keep and part time job.

He did... because my employers are afraid to lose me. They invented a job on the fly that is basically a part-time hotel janitor who works in the back of house and never talks to anyone. He works three days a week and has been doing it for seven months, though the entire seven months has been a struggle. If the managers here weren't so forgiving and worried about me walking out with him, I don't think he'd still be around. He has freak-outs and bottom-outs where he does shit like hide in his car or closets, and then you have to coax him out like a scared kitten. If he doesn't have time to finish a job, he outright panics. Sometimes, for no reason, he just curls into a ball on one of the chairs in my office and cries. He leaves early a lot; I'm working six days this coming week because he essentially went off the deep-end about half an hour ago and became an unresponsive blob that had to be told about ten times to go home. He cried, but he eventually left.

Then, they came back and told him that he wouldn't *actually* have to pay them back, so he asked to have his benefits returned during the appeal. They responded with a whopping... $36 a month. So he had to keep the job. They eventually raised it to $200 a month, but he's so scared that he just keeps the job anyway. They'd adjust it eventually, sure, but what if it takes months? What if we lose our apartment before then? He doesn't do well with ""what if.""

And yes, he reported that he's working. It would have been illegal if he hadn't.

So this has led to a severely mentally ill person doing a job he can barely do while getting jerked around by the state. When they finally got around to an actual meeting (after months of rescheduling), I figured that with his background, the witnesses at work, and the fact he couldn't even talk to them without me being physically present, they'd see he was actually in need of the help. We floundered through the meeting--my brother shook and laughed from nerves the whole time--and the guy promised to contact his old doctors and his current employers to see what they could verify.

And they... didn't. The manager we gave the contact details for never received anything. They relied on an evaluation from a guy who was paid by the state and who seemed satisfied that my brother knew who the president was. He was denied, again. They said he can appeal, but I don't know if they'd actually give him any benefits this go-around.

I think the kicker was the rejection letter literally said, he was ""severely mentally impaired"" but that mental illness doesn't count as a disability. 

This brings us to now: He's at the end of his rope and about to quit the one job that won't fire him for being a mess. This would leave me and me alone to handle paying the bills for two people. My options have basically dwindled to finding him a different job (stay-at-home data entry is the only thing I think he can do, because he loves spreadsheets but hates interacting with people), but how would he get through an interview? They didn't even interview him here. They just threw a job at him. I could get a second full-time job, but I don't know if I can juggle that and everything else.

I guess what I'm asking is if anyone has any ideas of what to do. Does anyone else have any experience with disability? Or have any idea of a work-from-home job that isn't a scam? Or an idea for me to make extra money on the side?

I'm pretty fucking desperate right now.",24Oct2018,1
546,"I'm [23M] sick of feeling like this.  Waking up every day wanting to make changes and feel better about myself but never actually doing anything about it. I've had everything I could ask for in this world and it never seems like enough. I had a good job, a great family, a girlfriend that was perfect for me, yet I feel like I was never truly happy. I was manipulative, dishonest and disloyal because I couldn't control my feelings. Always feeling like nothing is good enough, like I'm never achieving as much as I could be and that the next thing that comes along will fix everything. There's days I feel like I can change the world, and others where I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I say things that I want and feel like I need to do, yet my actions reflect the total opposite. I struggle to control myself, between my addiction to marijuana, juul, sex/masturbation and unhealthy desire to act sexually on every remotely attractive women that I come across. I fall back on those bad habits daily, even when I say I have to or am going to change. I don't know how to understand my emotions, or how to talk to people about my struggles. I ruined my relationship with someone I cared about more than anyone over all of this, and I just feel like I'm hitting rock bottom. I am lost and want to be able to control my life and feelings, be happy to wake up every day and not experience this constant doubt and self pity I have been going through.

I know a lot of people are going to suggest therapy, but I just have never been one to open up to anyone about my emotions. I have always been hard on myself, and feel like I can handle things on my own without asking for help. But here I am.

How do I make myself the person I want to be? Any advise would be better than the path I have been on.",24Oct2018,1
547,"Without revealing too much, let me explain this situation.  First of all, the child is not being abused.  However, the child is a 4 year old boy and he only speaks 4-5 words.  Perhaps he has a condition, and perhaps not.  The reason I worry about it is because his parents are extremely unstable.  The father whom I work with has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for suicide prevention.  Also he can't drive due to having Vertigo now.  Again without revealing too much, the father may be losing his employment in the near future.  The mother is even worse off, (according to the father) she has repeatedly threatened her own life.  She is seriously depressed and has anxiety to the point where she can't drive and can't stand being in public.  Physically she is also very unhealthy.  (Again, according to the father) She does not do anything throughout the days.  She only sits and reads.  
Back to the child:  His parents rarely interact with him.  They do not speak to him, read to him, or play with him, hence why he only knows five words.  However, the 4 year old child does know how play GTA and Call of Duty on his own.  To top all this off, the parents are having another child, she is pregnant.  They've told me they don't plan on enrolling him in school, but rather homeschooling him.  Also something worth mentioning is the guy's car is a mess.  There's vomit stains throughout the car, and it smells horrible - which leads me to believe his house where his child lives could be in the same condition.  So here are my questions:

Should I call CPS?  Will CPS do anything? Or will they just see that the child is fed and has a place to sleep and call it a day?  If CPS does do something, would the child be better off in foster care?

Also something to weigh in on:  Noting the depressed potentially suicidal nature of both parents... Should I worry that calling CPS is the last straw that pushes them over the edge?  Losing their children and then going through custody battles I'm sure is seriously stressful.  Is this child's livelihood worth the slim chance of one or both parent's killing themselves?

Please advise.  I don't normally post here or even read here, but honestly I have no idea where else to turn to before I make a decision like this.  Thank you for any and all replies.",24Oct2018,1

She would always make me feel like I don’t deserve a place in this world because she downgraded me and thought she was the best person etc etc. she isn’t what you would call a mean girl, everyone seems to love her and think she’s so godly and perfect because she hasn’t shown anyone her true side except me and Tracey.

Frankly we shouldn’t have been using it. I said I understood why she deleted it, thinking it was inactive, but they were livid with her and then with me for “defending her”. It spiraled our from there. 

Ever since then I’m hearing rumors about myself. One from a girl in the disagreement. The rumor going around is that I have a huge ego because I talk about my boss a lot. I’m not really sure how to take that, since I don’t talk about him aside from saying I’m doing a project for him if they ask what I’m doing. I don’t tell them about positive feedback I get, but it’s been coming in a lot because I basically am working round the clock to establish myself at this place as a relatively new employee.

Since I heard this rumor a week ago, I’ve been hearing that people I considered close and some even friends have been partaking about how I have a huge ego and am out of line and should just keep my head down and work. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

First off, I live pretty far away from them both. I live with my parents and it's like a 30 minute drive to college and I imagine their houses would be farther away. I have a car, but I need to replace/fix it. 

Second off, my parents make dating really awkard. I wasn't allowed to date until I was 17; but I dated before then lowkey. To them, they think I've never dated anyone (I've had like 3 lowkey relationships before).

So what do you guys think for advice? I may be moving into an apartment much much closer (my parents are helping me pay for), but I think if they knew I was dating they may not want to help pay for the apartment anymore. Plus how would I go about picking one girl over the other? Oh, also it's worth mentioning my parents work at the college and so do I.... what's your advice guys? Thanks.

I ride my bike to and from work. It's been refreshing the past few months, but on the 12th, I got a stick in my spokes, and landed directly on my left shoulder.  


Collarbone (clavicle) broken. I've been out of work since the 13th. I get to start work back up on the 29th, but a lot of bills have passed me by, specifically my bills due in November. Fortunately, I like being a month's rent ahead, and am looking at the money order for my November rent.   


My wife also works, and makes enough money to pay the rest of our bills in November, however...  


On the 6th of November, I'm going back to see my doctor, and I may require surgery. We are fine through November, but I'm just worried about December.   


Because while my wife can pay every \*other\* bill, she can't also pay rent, and food, and gas. That's what my check was for, basically.   


So, after being rejected for a $1000 Unsecured Line of Credit from my bank, and not having any credit cards, does anyone have any ideas?  


I'm not worried about November. I got November. December is the great fear, and while I have time to figure something out, days go by quickly.

557,"I (29M) live in a european city and met a travelling Mexicana (26F) on tinder visiting my country. We got along right from the start and agreed to have sex before we physically met. She came to my house for drinks and had nasty sex (I have sex). Put her on the bus and then thought that was it. 

Soon after, she texted me because I forgot to tell her where she had to get out and she missed her stop which got her completely lost, so I had to navigate her back to her hostel which lead up to another date.. this is where the fireworks really started and from then on she was at my place for the rest of her trip, which lasted 5 more days. We were strangled into eachother every second and we totally fell in love. Mutual, no hidden agenda's. Love. After the 5 days she had to leave to visit the other countries she had planned to visit so we both kind of knew this had no future at all.

Two days after we said goodbye she called me and asked me how I would feel if she'd cancel two countries of her trip to spend one more week with me. I couldn't be happier and immediately said yes. Now here we are. Shes coming back from Berlin to me in about a week and I have no idea what I have gotten myself into. I'm head over heels but at the same time i'm scared shitless because of the distance. There isn't much time to lose and action is required.

My question is: how do you get something like this to work without (both) feeling forced to move faster than usual? *Shes an educated woman with a master's degree and could easily get a job in my city.. has mexican friends living in europe so she doesn't really have to rely completely on me to come here if she wanted to.*

558,"I’m currently at uni in my second year, and in first year I had a good group of friends on my course, although I was never super close to most of them and we’d really only been bought together by one person. Around the end of first year and beginning of second year, I’ve become really close with a group of friends from my sports club, and spend nearly all my spare time hanging out with them and going to club practice with them. I’ve started to realise that I’m really not close with my course friends, and find it really hard to be interested in their conversations and what they try to talk to me about. Whenever I’m in lectures I feel like I’m pushing them away in a really unhealthy way, but is this really unhealthy seeing as I have a whole group of close friends outside my lectures that I still have? 

Basically I’d much rather have my main friends off my course where I’m not spending all day with them as I’m definitely a lot more introverted than extroverted, and would rather a couple friendly faces on my course that I can kind of make small talk with at the beginning of lectures, and talk to occasionally about homework and stuff.

•grew up with an alcoholic father who i took care knowing he was dying of from the age of 13-17.
•my mother was and still is very controlling of my life, finances, and habits.
•i’ve been in nothing but abusive (some physical some mental/emotional) relationships.
•i don’t have more than two friends. (i’m introverted but will do everything i can for anyone)

it’s dawned on me lately that i am very unhappy with my life and my decisions i’ve made in my past and the decisions i make now. i struggle to get out of bed with the fear that i’ll do the same routine i’ve been doing for the past three months while not working (i left my job from being overworked and underpaid). 
i get up, i have my coffee and cigarette, shower, do my makeup (i used to find so much joy in that and now i don’t), i sit around and try to make stupid errands for myself to make me feel like i have some responsibility and to keep myself busy. debating on how long that takes me if i choose to run around for nothing, i’ll usually wait for my friend to text me to hangout.
my friend is also my ex who i’m still very close with. he’s recently started class again and our schedules aren’t what they used to be. i hate feeling like i rely on someone else to keep me happy and occupy myself to keep my mind from racing. i never used to be like that. i was always so independent even when it came to my own general happiness. my other friend is such an angel. she and i go through a lot of the same issues mentally. we met from work but we know each other from growing up in the same town. she left the same job as i did and took time off herself just like me. we both have nothing to do during the day but whenever i hangout with someone i feel like i need to occupy them so they’re not bored being with me. the task of hanging out with anyone has become tedious and not enjoyable. i’m not motivated to do anything. i take a narcotic known as ritalin for my ADD. this stuff is my savior and also my downfall. when i take it i feel like i want to be productive and do things even though i have nothing to do...which leads me to my next point. having nothing to do while also taking a stimulant is a terrible mix for me. i’m a pessimistic person who when faced with nothing to do will sit and think myself into a terrible state of mind. ill convince myself that i have nothing to live for, i’m not living for myself anymore- i’m basically just living for my two friends and my mom. ill find things on my ex’s social media to get upset about and then almost lose that friendship (him and i are very confused romantically while trying to work on ourselves). i’ve tried seeing a therapist before but never really saw any results (my pessimistic self really shines through with that). 

i’m at the point where i don’t really know who i am anymore. i don’t know what i enjoy. i can’t find anything other than my medicine to motivate me to get through the day (which i know is so dangerous). i don’t know how to not be codependent on other people for my happiness and to occupy my time anymore. i just need help.

if you’ve made it this far, first of all-thank you! but also please send me your best advice or anything at all that might be encouraging or helpful. seriously, anything helps.",24Oct2018,1

I’m in college now, and have been receiving treatment for years, but I think something more might be wrong with me, because nothing is getting better or changing despite me having been in treatment for years. ( I know anxiety and depression don’t just ‘go away’, but I can barely function.) I think I need to see someone besides just the regular therapists I get tossed around to, to maybe find some definitive answers, if there even is an answer at all. Over the passed year, my mom lost her mom and is having trouble coping, and I think she’s at her breaking point. I’m 19 years old, but my mother has control over most of my assets, and I’m still dependent on my parents for funds. I could try to get treatment alone, but I think she would inevitably find out one way or another even if I tried to hide it. So my dilemma is this: Should I try and seek treatment with my mother inevitably finding out and getting more stressed, or should I just suffer through it and maybe things will get better with time?

566,"Need some advice, but some background on my situation first. And sorry the family relationships are kind of difficult to track if you come from a normal family. Sorry this is a little long but the last bit has my advice request.

This person I know, let’s call her Emery, was raised by her Grandparents, but has always called them mom and dad (AKA step grandpa). Because that is what they were to Emery, mom and dad. They raised  Emery since birth and have earned the title of mom and dad, at least from my perspective. Emery also has two step-sisters (in actuality step aunts) from her Dad's side (step-grandpa) and an actual uncle that Emery calls her brother from her grandma's side. Emery grew up knowing her  biological mother but not the biological father. So unfortunately, this is where I opened my big fat mouth and offered to help. 

We set out to find Mr. Dad aka the biological father of Emery. After some initial digging we got a name from Emery's biological mother, Juan Gomez. Unfortunately, this name is too common, so we  couldn't do much with this information at first. The biological mother stated Juan was of Spanish descent. Which I thought was weird, I mean besides the name being an average Spanish name, but because Emery is a blonde haired, blue eyed, and fair skin lady.  She didn’t have any of the chrematistics of a person with Spanish origin. We quickly hit a brick wall and we had no leads and no idea what to do to further this investigation. 

As the years passed I questioned both the biological mother and Emery's mom about Juan. I got the impression that something was amiss with the story provided. The last story I was told is that a  friend of the biological mother heard he had disappeared and was probably dead. I took this story as more of a “Shut up, stop asking questions, don’t look any further into this situation”. Naturally I was more enticed by the possibilities, so we forged on.

Emery decided to take a DNA test through Ancestry.com with the hopes that we would find a DNA match that had to be from her father’s side. When we got the results of her DNA test Emery  oddly knew most of the DNA matches, meaning we didn't see any Gomez or any unknown matches besides the 5th and 6th cousins. Who knows family members that far back anyway? The other odd part of her test results was her first cousin. Her  brother (AKA blood related uncle) doesn’t have any kids and she has no other aunts or uncles. The first cousin was someone she knew of already. He was her dad's (grandpa) nephew. Being completely ignorant to the facts presented to us, we reached out to this  first cousin through Ancestry.com and asked who his uncles were, thinking one of his uncles must be Emery's father. The cousin’s response took months, I even tried reaching out to people with his name on Facebook but never got a response... probably because  I sounded like a crazy person. Anyway, this was also looking like a dead end.

While we waited we talked with my mom about this situation. She has done extensive research on her own genealogy and understood the family lineage far better than Emery and me. My mom explained  that Emery is technically only related to one of her first cousins’ parents and from the DNA matches it looked like her dad’s (step-grandpa) sister. So, she doesn't share any genetic information with her first cousins’ father in this case. This information  is what we needed to move the investigation forward and yes, we probably should have known this bit of information, but this investigation was overwhelming for the both of us. And we both were probably ‘hopefully ignorant’ to what was transpiring in front  of us. Meaning we didn’t want to admit the truth we probably both already knew.

Emery knew the first cousin’s uncles were on his father's side. Knowing this information, we went back to Emery’s DNA results and showed my mom some of the DNA matches Emery had on Ancestry.com.  Knowing that Emery's matches were only shared by the first cousin’s mom we were confident that the first cousins’ uncles were not candidates. Unfortunately, this only left one person that could possibly be Emery's dad. And that person was her dad... the person  Emery has called dad from the day she learned to say the word “dad”. After some discussion Mr. Dad agreed to provide DNA to submit to Ancestry.com. After a couple weeks we unfortunately got the results back and she has a dad. It was the person Emery called  dad her whole life. The person who had “earned” the title “Dad” by taking her in and away from her not so fit biological mother... now I am not so sure what to believe. Besides the fact he doesn’t deserves the title “Dad” any longer. I can think of some titles  he deserves and one of them should have put him behind bars for 10 to 20 years and the pleasure of registering to stay away from schools and places that harbor small children.  

Now for the dilemma. Emery grew up hating her biological mother because her dad stated the mom wanted to abort her pregnancy. But now I can kind of see why the mom wanted to take such extreme measure  but so so glad she did not move forward with that horrible option. By the way, the biological mom of Emery is the Grandma's daughter. The person Emery calls her actual mom. I didn't make that clear... which leads into the other shit storm. Did the Grandma, Emery's ""mom""  know of the situation? How far do I take this? Did her step-sisters, now her half-sisters, know? This is fucked. I hate myself for helping. I hate myself for telling Emery the results of the DNA test. I thought this would be a fun ""now you know and can move  on type of situation"" and now that we know there is just pain. And I don't know how to help my wife through this without causing more damage. I mean, how do we tell our kids that the guy you called ""Papa"" is your ""Papa"". Actually, two of the kids are too young  to understand, but my oldest is going to have questions that I don't want to answer or even think about. 

How do we proceed? This is a lot to unpack.",24Oct2018,1

I’d be fine with them if they’d take responsibility for literally any part of the tiny shared space. They practically shed all over the stall shower and bathroom floor (I’m a blonde with short hair and no roommate the long dark hair piles aren’t mine, I’m sure of it, and the frankly scary sized hairball in the trash didn’t just appear there), refuse to clean the toilet or shower ever, forcing me to sweep and clean the bathroom they use too. They also apparently shit once every few hours and do nothing to clear the air in the tiny rectangle of stench. The worst part of this however, is their horrible habit of both locking me out, and using up all the toilet paper in the span of a day or a week. I recently thought that my nice tp would last longer. It’s lasted maybe 4 days. They use tissue paper usually and never replace the roll on the dispenser. They also seem to not realize how the dispenser works because apparently they were raised by wolves who take obnoxiously long hours long showers, and lock you out and burn through the tp. What do I do to housetrain them? Is it curable? Do I just live in bathroom disgust forever? 

TLDR: I live near two assholes who don’t respect most things in a shared bathroom space. Any advice?",24Oct2018,1

How much of a turnoff is it? 

On dating apps my pictures don’t show my scar because it only shows up when cast in certain lighting. Does that mean I’m not being truthful about my appearance? Would you be turned off if you hadn’t seen it in my photos and then seen it when we met in person?

577,"Btw this is like my third time trying to post this cause it hasn't shown up the previous couple times... I haven't changed anything from the first time I was writing this even though it is probably a mess because I kind of just got done crying when I was writing. I didn't even know if I should even try to post it again after it didn't show up but I kinda realize that I wasn't just venting and actually want some advice... although I don't really know if I'm even worth you all's advice... hope it works this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got into (kind of?) a fight with my mom where she had said things like ""I'm not gonna raise a loser"" and that I'm garbage or whatever. And this is because I didn't go to school today.

I don't see myself as a bad student, I get decent grades... but for at least the past couple years I've been... unmotivated? I don't know. It's my last year in high school so I feel like this is my most important year to try to get into university, and I recognize that but I can't stop procrastinating.

Lately I've just been really sad as well, I don't really feel happy anymore (?) and I just don't know what to do with my life. Honestly like actually all throughout high school I've been feeling down or stressed or just nothing.

I also really hate myself. Like I really want to be dead but like I'm not going to/don't want to kill myself. I don't want to say I'm depressed or whatever because I really don't know. Is it normal to feel this way? I know other people go through rough times as well and I just don't know if I'm just weak or like... I don't even know. I'm just constantly mad at myself. Whenever I sit and like really think about my problems and like they all seem small and I just feel even worse for feeling bad about them.

I think I want to see a therapist but I just don't know like what steps to take or... I just idk, something that can make me feel better... Am I just being silly? or sensitive or stupid or whatever?

I don't know who I can talk to, I really don't know anyone who can help me. I always forgive her but it's not a rare occurence that my mom calls me things like ""loser"" and ""useless"" and ""waste to society"" etc but it always feels true. I can't really talk to my dad about anything because there's kind of a language barrier and he's just kinda distant in general. I feel like all of my family is just really judgemental in general and I'm like lowkey scared of them and I just don't want to be near any of them anymore. I've thought of running away constantly but I could just never. I don't even know if this is the right place to put all of this but like I really just don't want to live like this anymore. I think of myself still young so I don't know what to do. I can't really do anything by myself.

I don't know if I'm just being stupid making a problem out of nothing. Everything is my fault anyways so like I don't know what I'm expecting for someone else to just fix my life??? I just got done crying and I'm sick of crying so often recently. Idkkk sorry if you read up to this far for being such a burden I don't really know what to expect if anyone's even going to read this. At least I got it all out right...? I don't know if you really think I'm making a problem out of nothing just give it to me straight please I just want some type of direction.",24Oct2018,1
578,"Last week someone got into my car parked somewhere in bronx New York. Nothing was broken, but I remember locking the car. They stole a bag containing my samsung tablet, a dash cam my girlfriend gave me, a notebook, a pocket knife my mom gave me, my favorite book, a bluetooth headset, and my chapstick.

&amp;#x200B;

I parked at 11pm Tuesday and returned at 7:45am wed. Upon returning I could tell something was wrong. I had a box of books in my trunk and the books and box were on the sidewalk. Everything was out of place. Glove box open, everything all over.

&amp;#x200B;

I called NYPD. They took 2 HOURS to show up.

&amp;#x200B;

Filed a report and showed them the GPS location of the tablet. It was in Manhattan within the NYPD jurisdiction.

&amp;#x200B;

First off the police told me they aren't going to put everything from the bag on the report. Just the tablet and dashcam.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, They didn't give me a police report number.

&amp;#x200B;

Third, They said a detective will reach out to me because I can locate the tablet with the GPS.

580,"I'm a 20 year old female who goes to school with and is friends with a girl who does art/photography as a hobby. She has asked me to be a part of a 'female empowerment' themed group photo shoot.

I'm not 100% on all the details, but it would basically be 2-3 females and 2-3 males, posing in ways that, as she puts it 'turns the tables' on what we normally see. Her idea is to have the guys strip down (either to like boxers or fully nude) for some of the poses (since it's usually the girls), while the girls pose with them fully clothed. Poses with the girls being in 'positions of power', etc.

581,"I’ve been seeing this guy Patrick (not real name) for about a month now. I am absolutely head over heels for him and this is the first time i’ve felt alive and comfortable with somebody in about 3 years. I really really adore him.

I have always been weird about bringing boys home to my family. I am the second youngest of 5 kids (3 of us live at home still) and i have my two parents. My family is extremely fun and outgoing, however sometimes they can be judgmental and i am constantly worried about if they like a boy i bring home because if they don’t, they have no problem making him feel unwelcome. It’s ridiculous, i know. 

Patrick isn’t the type guy i’ve brought home in the past. My type (since the age of 12) has been tall, dark and handsome, meaty baseball player, hardass vibe. You get the picture. I went for dicks lol. Patrick is still tall, very skinny, curly blonde hair and blue eyes. He is extremely kind and caring and he’s shy but he’s still social. The problem i’m having here is his nationalities.... 

I KNOW it sounds fucking unreal and that’s why i’m anonymously posting right now. That’s how judgmental my family can be. 

I’m half Mexican and half German. My dad was born in Germany and moved to the US when he was damn near a year old, but he still grew up old school German and he’s closer to 70 so he’s old school overall. This can lead him to having some... “opinions” on others with specific nationalities. 

He does not hate people for being specific nationalities and he is not openly rude to anybody with specific nationalities, he is just extremely biased on them from past experiences and i’ll get to that in a second.

Patrick is 85% Polish and 15% Russian. These are the two nationalities my father isn’t a fan of. 

Before i continue, please PLEASE keep hate comments about my father away. I love him more than anything in the world and he is not racist or prejudice at all!!! I would admit if anyone in my family was but nobody is. I’ll explain more.

My area is extremely Polish. All of my neighbors are Polish and pretty much everyone outside of my subdivision is as well. My dad doesn’t get along with any of our neighbors because they’re all rude tbh, so this caused my dad to create an opinion on Polish people. AGAIN, he does not hate them. That is such a strong word. He is friends with many Polish people and works with many as well, however he is old and past experiences created this opinion for him. 

My family (not me and my younger brother) went to Russia a few years ago. Some things that i won’t get into happened during their trip, and this formed another opinion my dad has on Russians now. I don’t need to explain again that my father does not hate either of these nationalities. You understand by now. 

While i never really had an issue with any of this, my family is kind of on the bandwagon with this stuff. I really like Patrick and i can seriously see myself with him in the future, however my family has caused me to doubt relationships in the past if they don’t like the guy, and that usually ends the relationship. I’m just afraid they won’t like Patrick, especially for the purpose of his nationalities. I know if i have him over that will be the first thing my dad will ask (this type of stuff is important to him, especially if i marry somebody. He just likes to know.) 

I guess in conclusion, what do i do?",24Oct2018,1

584,"My year-end-review is coming up at my office. I've been working at my company for what will be 10 years in April. I'm currently making $48k and I'm due for a $2k raise at the end of the year. But instead of settled for that, I was wondering if anyone thinks I have enough leverage to ask for a $7k raise instead since it will be my 10th year.

I ran the number on my overall performance for the year and it's been more productive than all of 2017 already. 

My work this year has brought an additional $573k in annual revenue for the company, and the gross profit off that is $133k. These numbers do not factor consistent revenue that I generated last year as well. 

Additionally, I'm the top performer in my department while also managing the entire office. But observing everything through a strictly financial standpoint, does anyone think asking for a $7k raise is a reasonable request? Do I have a leg to stand on?",24Oct2018,1
585,"Bit of backstory 

I met my best friend about 7 months ago and we have been inseparable ever since the day we met. We had a mutual friend and after we were introduced by them we just really hit it off. I have slight attachment issues and so since the day we met I have been very clingy with her but it she is the same way.  I am 100% straight and she is lesbian but lately every time she has gotten a gf it has made me extremely jealous, not because I want to be with her romantically but just because I feel like a girl is more relatable so she could possibly take my place as best friend. We are both very jealous people though and she does not like me romantically but gets jealous when i make friends but every time we make friends we always make sure to make them friends with the other one so all of our friends are cool with both of us. 

Now she wants to room together in college which I do as well but on many tours we have went on they all make it very clear do not room with your best friend.  We practically spend every night together anyways and basically live together already but the warning from people in college have me second guessing. I do not think cleaning or buying groceries or anything would be the issue, I think if anything it would be the jealousy.  

Do you think it is a good idea to room together, if no why not and if yes then do you have any ideas on how to keep our jealousy from getting in the way?",24Oct2018,1

587,"I'm new to Reddit, but I've seen many stories of how people where helped tremendously from advice this site as given, and I could really use some right now. If there is a better sub to post this to, please let me know and I will move it there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom just called me about an hour ago, bawling, looking for help to get her life together. She currently resides in Arizona, where as I and the rest of my family live in Iowa. She moved down there some time ago to get away from my sister, who has been nothing but a tornado of destruction since as far back as I can remember. She's barely worked a day in her life, she's a drug addicted who has been arrested multiple times because of it. In and out of rehab and support groups, and nothings worked. Part of the problem I feel was that my mom was always there, willing to bail her out whenever she came crawling back, and my sister repaid her with nothing but anger, violence, theft, etc. She once even punched my mom in the face after she let her back into her home.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, my mother felt the only way to try and make her life better was to leave. She fled to Arizona with little notice, and I was actually happy for her at first. My sister has been a huge burden on her, and has dragged our name, and my mother life through the dirt. Unfortunately, my mom does little for herself, and has never been able to turn away others who've come calling for help.

&amp;#x200B;

She's allowed her ex to put his electrical bills in her name, because he had an outstanding balance, and now has racked up over $1000 in her name. My sister somehow found a way down to Arizona, and made my moms life a living hell for about a month, even threatening suicide to try and milk money out of her. A low blow considering my brother did commit suicide years ago, and has haunted my mother ever since. After that she came back, and apparently my youngest sister allowed her to stay with her for some time, until my older sister destroyed her house one day, either because she wouldn't give her money, or just in a drug induced rage, I have no clue. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to my mother, she is currently living alone in a small trailer with two dogs, and very little heating to provide warmth for the winter. She's apparently developed very serious heart problems, that may require a pace maker soon in order to correct, her depression has gotten worse and she has apparently tried to commit suicide recently, and was in the hospital for several months because of the attempt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help, but seeing how people have treated her has really shaped my world view. My wife and I are in our second year of marriage and doing fine, but I'm unsure of how much I should offer. I think the best option would be to get her back into the state where she can be around myself, and my youngest sister, but I don't think it'd be fair to either of us to have to have her stay with us. We're just starting up a family, and my sister is still getting used to life on her own. Not to mention I've seen stuff like this before, and my biggest concern would be to offer to let her stay with us, and never have her get on her feet or leave. Still, however, I don't know where we would begin piecing her life back together if we do get her back here. Her credit is now poor because of her ex's bills, her heart is bad, her 401k is all gone due to court fees she accrued trying to keep custody of my older sisters children. I have a great job at the place she used to work out, but I don't know if her heart could handle the stress of it, or if they would even hire her back after the way she left, which is a whole other story.

&amp;#x200B;

The other problem of moving back is that my drug addicted sister is still here, and if she finds out my mom is back she may try and find her to leech more from her, which I know my mom can't handle. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any advice, it would be welcomed. I had a feeling this day may eventually come, but I didn't realize how unprepared I was for it. Thank you all in advance for any advice you can give. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: My mom lives out of state and currently has no job, and next to no money, and has now called me looking for help, and I don't know how to proceed.",24Oct2018,1
588,"So I'm living that cliche where girl meets boy and she catches feelings. 

I met Connor last spring, right before we started our first semester of college. We're both part of a really tight knit friend group that all met at the same time. The minute I met him I was attracted to him but I pushed the thought aside bc I  was in a relationship at the time and I didn't know that group would become my actual friends. Since we all started school in june he and I have gotten really close where, as much as they're all my best friends, he and I are each other's #1. I've been actively denying to myself that there might be something there for a few weeks now, but last weekend we went to see a movie on campus and he bought my ticket. It's a little thing but it wasn't him covering me as a buddy, he like bought my ticket. Since then I've been trying to sort through what the fuck I should do about this whole thing. 

He's an awesome guy and we get each other in a way that's new to me but I'm terrified of fucking up. I'm not a timid person so there's a piece of me that just wants to send it and shoot my shot, but there are a few things holding me back:

\-if I fuck this up I'm out of a best friend

\-our group is small, so everyones gonna know our business, but when we break up its gonna throw the whole ecosystem off

\-I'm not really in a position to be in a long term relationship right now, and I don't think dating him for 2 or 3 months is gonna be worth wasting the rest of our potential friendship over

\-I've been in a relationship before and he hasn't. It wouldn't be an issue for me if I knew I would be able to take it seriously but I don't know that I can

\-there's no reason for me to be in a rush, like he's still gonna be there in 6 months so why would I risk it when I have 4 years of college with him?

reasons I'm not talking myself out of it all the way:

\-I really like him. I haven't had a crush on a guy since like 6th grade, but I would call this a whole ass middle school crush. I didn't even have a crush on my exes before they asked me out. This is a ""you're cute and your personality is great"" kind of a moony fucking crush and its weird as hell to have that.

\-I think about him?? Like last night I was anxious and couldn't sleep I literally imagined him being there to settle me down and all of the sudden it was the morning.

\-I have a friend outside of the group we're in that I've avoided introducing him to bc I'm afraid she would like him.

this is the first time I've laid it all out like this and I'm shook bc I sound like a little kid but maybe thats because I may as well be with the way this whole thing has me behaving.

sO any advice yall can give me would be much appreciated. This is a throwaway account bc he doesn't have a reddit but one of our mutual friends does and I just don't trust it. Thanks everyone I'm a child",24Oct2018,1
