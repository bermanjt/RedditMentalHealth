0,"im gonna get straight to the point. my mind keeps reminding me that nobody likes me. i cant seem to focus on school like i used to. my arm is bleeding and idk why. i dont have an appetite, food makes me gag. my brain says that i have friends but everything else says ""nah'. im always annoyed, especially with my close friends. i cant seem to stay grounded.",09May2018,2
1,"So I've been in my school orchestra for the past four years. Every year, I've been seated towards the back of the orchestra. I'm now a senior in high school, and I'm still in the back. I've been really disappointed in myself because of this - I always thought my best skill was playing violin, but it turns out that I'm not as good as I thought I was even at that, and I've made no improvement over four years. So rather than bother trying and still not playing well and just feeling like a failure, I've been skipping class to do homework instead. I've also been misdirecting some of that frustration at my teacher - I've been acting cold and passive-aggressive towards him because he picks favorites and can often be very obvious about it.

However, I've been having a bit of a change of heart. After getting awarded some pretty hefty scholarships and a prestigious paying internship, I would feel guilty for accepting all of that while continuing to be a petty drama queen instead of sucking it up and still just trying to do my best instead of quitting. Sure, my teacher picks favorites, but it's not like he does it on purpose. He's also a really nice guy, and I know that he's sometimes confused about why I've been so hostile to him when I talk to him.

So my question is, should I write him an apology letter, or should I just fix my behavior? I feel like an apology letter might be excessive  because like I said, he does have favorites and can turn a blind eye to other students - for all I know, I might be mostly invisible to him, anyway. But at the same time, I feel like I owe him an explanation.",09May2018,1
2,"**I *am* scheduling a therapist appointment sometime soon but due to my packed schedule I might not even get to see them until next month.**

I keep having panic attacks. The cycle seems to go like this:

1. I think of something bad or a bad situation happens. (Alternatively, not a **single goddamn thing** happens and the panic attack just fucking jumpstarts itself.)
2. I am unable to calm myself down because an event is about to happen and I have no time or resources.
3. Traditional Grounding Methods and Breathing Exercises fail to work. (Or they work, but my anxiety comes back with raging fury the moment I transition out of them.)
4. I have to go to the event while still having the panic attack. (Alternatively, I will be under the impression the panic attack has ended and then I find it actually hasn’t as the event starts.)
5. I start to worry about how I’m appearing to others because I can barely keep it together and it probably shows, and that feeds into the panic attack.
6. I white-knuckle it through the event but have to excuse myself when I eventually start uncontrollably tearing up.
7. I find a space to sit by myself and the panic attack ends, but I’ve burnt so much energy I’m starving and absolutely **exhausted** and can’t think straight.

After all that, I usually end up going home early or leaving the event immediately when it ends.

I don’t know how to stop these. The thoughts that trigger them are often ones I can’t avoid (My Future, College). 

Or they are self-feeding cycles because they remind me of some bad event from the past where something bad happened because I DIDN’T worry. (I have a lot of those...) Therefore trying to calm myself down makes it worse.

Obviously sometimes I can control the thoughts and situations that lead to these attacks, but not always. It seems like sometimes they come out of nowhere.

So I need some way to deal with these in case they come up during the upcoming weeks. My family has packed my schedule FULL of events and I can’t just run away from every single one, although obviously if I can’t find a solution to this I’m not sure how well I can attend them either.

Sorry if this is a bit scatterbrained. I’m writing this right after an attack. I’ll try and clarify any unclear bits later.",09May2018,6
3,"Im here. at the office. trying hard not to cry. foolishly browsing the net for anything that I could do. 'coz i'm starting to believe that anything I'd do, would not change a thing. I'm 21 years old. yeah, i'm definitely an adult. But when all your life was controlled by a paranoid and selfish mother, you won't have enough time to mature or to know your own self apparently. My mom and dad got separated when I was 6 or 7. after that, my dad just gave us money for support and I never got the chance to really knew him. after all, my mom would say bad things about him and his mistresses. you wouldn't believe the things my mother would do to me. even my haircut, my clothes, foods, friends and every little thing about my life, would be HERS to decide. She owns my life, literally. I'm like a character in The Sims game. now that I'm older and have a job of my own, she would demand everything. attention, money, love, time and even service. and if I won't do it, she would play the victim, saying that she did everything for me and i have no right to not repay her. my dad, he doesn't care anymore. sometimes he would fight with mom and my mom would ask why wont i defend her to him. i tried talking to them. about everything they put me through. but still, nothing really changed. i tried to run away, but they just saw it as me ""rebelling"" on them and that its not really their fault. yeah, so..

4,"I'm 16 years old. My mind, according to what I've read online, is still on the increase rather than decrease. And yet over the past few years I've noticed that I have more trouble comprehending things and a shorter attention span when it comes to learning. I'm just not passionate about it anymore. 

I blame the fact that I'm always at home these days. But I don't really have a choice, both of my parents work and I don't have my own car yet. I've been applying for a job but have gotten no replies yet, so that way of getting out isn't available at present either.

Is there a way I can stop my mind from becoming totally stagnate due to being stuck at home? ",09May2018,1

6,So I’ve known this girl for almost two years now and we have become really close and we tell each other everything. A few months ago I started developing feelings for her and don’t know if I should tell her or not? If she takes it the wrong way then our friendship could be destroyed. I don’t know what to do but I really want to be more than friends with her and if I don’t say something then that will definitely never happen,09May2018,0
7,"Now of course people will say just ask her out but here’s the deal... I’ve never really asked anybody out, and I don’t want to ask her out until I know 100% that she likes me back. 

But I want to build a pretty good foundation/friendship with her. I’ve already been friends with her for like almost 2 years but I feel like it isn’t in the level we need to be. The first year of knowing her I didn’t really like her in a crush type of way or at least not that much... so my stupid self didn’t really try to make great friends with her and I feel like she liked me in that time because she used to do some cute stuff, stand beside me, when she has other friends on that room. But I never made a move on her so I screwed up majorly. The second and current year I’m absolutely in love with her. She recently broke up with a guy because she didn’t like him like that anymore and that made me excited. Oh yeah almost forgot to mention that when she dated that guy back in February she acted distant with me. Now after her breakup she and I have a alright good-ish relationship so far. Some days her and I share laughs which I love those days, most days she laughs even more and she’s herself more around one of my great friends since 6th grade (I’m in high school. Im a sophomore, and my good friend is in a committed relationship so I’m not worried that he’s going to be with my crush and he knows I like her so he teases me by holding her hand in front of me and stuff like that) 
So my great friend and her have a way better friendship than her and I do. Hell even my bestfriend and her have a better friendship than her and I. 

So how can I be closer to her? I already tried text through Snapchat but but she has hella people in Snapchat so she mostly rarely reads my messages

I could ask for her phone number but I feel like that’ll be kinda weird. I apologize for making this longer than it should be I just don’t know what to do, what to say to her. I mainly wanna make her laugh everyday, because I know that building a bond/trust isn’t a overnight thing. 

I just really need advice about this kind of stuff. To summarize, I’m going to restate questions and I hope I get some advice 
1. How can I get closer to her? 
2. How can I build a strong bond/trust with her like my other friends have with her?
3. How can I 100% know that she still likes me or doesn’t anymore?

I believe that is all. This is the girl that I see my future with so I really need good advice. Thanks! Oh and sorry if I made any grammar errors, I was in a rush. ",09May2018,1
8,"I go to a community college. And, I got into trouble for stealing food from the campus. I had been doing it for the most part of a year. So, I had gotten a letter from the Dean, saying that she has begun an initial investigation into the matter, after I had gotten called in for a previous issue unrelated to stealing food awhile back. I got called into the Dean's office a couple of weeks back, for this said issue and from the information given to her, she doesn't know that I have been doing it for that long. Also, other people have been doing the same thing I have during that time span.  I'm also on a program for clearing some misdemeanors that I cannot afford to be dropped from. I'm currently not able to go to the building where I had stolen the food from. When the report was filed, it seemed like the person who had submitted it, thought it was only a recent thing. I'm not sure what they'll see if they review the camera footage or how long the camera footage goes back to. I got myself into an extremely tough spot and I'm not sure how this will turn out. What advice can you give me about what you think will happen possibly, and the punishments that could happen and what I can do when I sit down with the Dean and talk to them. I'm extremely worried because my parents don't know about this and I could be kicked out of my home if they find out about this.",09May2018,1
9,"Hi everyone so let’s just get down to it. I met this girl who is honestly a amazing person and lots of fun to be around. I was thinking about trying to date her and get to know her better, but I found out through social media she was previously engaged about 8 months ago and I’m 80% sure she is in a relationship now. I was kind of shocked when I found out about the engagement and am not really sure on what to think about it. I also don’t want to assume she is in a relationship a miss a chance, but I don’t want to ask her out just to find out she’s already dating someone.(Little background: We are both at the same college and age isn’t a issue, I’ve only dated one person in my life and am still kind of new to the dating game)

I had a few questions I thought y’all could give your opinions on!

Is 8 months too soon for her to be involved in another relationship?

Should I be having second thoughts about asking this girl out? 

Should I be intimidated by these finding?

10,"Long story short there is this obnoxious guy at work. He is 5’5 late 40s and about 200 pounds. This guy always has to comment on my (m/33) physique (im bodybuilder-esque), my clothes, my glasses when I wear them, that I have my ears pierced (even though Ive never worn earrings to work), and always calls me the “man” “cool guy” any stupid generic nickname you can give someone.

After about 3 years of this I basically try to not involve myself with him at all and when I do run into him I always am professional and cordial. 

We got involved in a project together and his level of obnoxious-ness has exponentially risen. He was messaging me one day that he was going to use a power drill and drill more holes in my ears... hardy har har. After that I started to ignore him on messenger and since then he seems to be even more persistent to get a hold of me. Finally I told him Im very busy and if he has any work related questions to email me and Ill respond as soon as possible.  

I don’t want to make this into a bigger deal but at the same time I have a feeling this is going to continue unless I do something more drastic. 

How do I set this up to handle it correctly? Have I taken the proper first step?

I mentioned something to my parents (my two grandparents and my dad) about moving into my boyfriend's (19M) house for a little while with him, his dad + dad's girlfriend, and his brother until we can both scrounge up enough money to get our own little apartment. My parents, two of which are diagnosed narcissists, took this and ran with it, turning it into the biggest controversy the house has seen in years. I was raised in this very emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household, and up until recently haven't been able to stand up to my parents when I know they're wrong without fear of being hit or having all my belongings taken from me. Anyway, they turned this into a huge argument about how I'm not ready and it's wrong because we're not married and we ""don't know shit about anything,"" and other related nonsense. I told them that I wasn't planning on it any time within the next few months, but it was fruitless. Just a little while ago, they called me in to tell me that they think I *should* go live with him, that I need to experience this and make my own mistakes and that ""If it backfires, don't say we didn't warn you, at least you'll learn your lesson"" and they said they want me out by this weekend. I currently have no bank account, no ID because I don't drive, no birth certificate, no nothing. I have nothing that will get me anywhere out there, which is why I wanted to wait, but now they are adamant about me leaving as soon as possible, and that I should start packing right away. I'm so lost and I'm sure there's more I could say about this situation but I'm so exhausted with it all and I just need some guidance.

15,"so this is more of an update about my situation before i go into detail about it.
im 17 and catfisher said she/he was 18.

heres the situation before evryhing turns a 180: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8hfi0x/i_want_to_die_feeling_really_stupid_mad_and/

btw im making a new post since mods deleted my previous one idk why. they didnt even msg me. this post is still for asking advice on something that has terribly affected me and changed the way ive been feeling lately. cant eat or sleep right due to whats happened.

so basically to recap my previous post. i met a girl on facebook she looked cute and friendly. we begin chatting and one thing led to another we became really close and exchaaned nudes and sexted(she was the one who started it and asked for pics first). one day we promised to send videos of what we requested. after they were done i sent them. they had my face on and i was doing somehing rly embarrassing. i waited for her to send her vid but it was just her fingering herself with no face shown. i ask for her to send vid with face. she tells me to wait. then while waiting out of nowhere i get a text saying its her aunt and she caught us. i feel depressed and worried for the girl. she tells me to stop contacting her. i tell her its ok and i wont spread her pics or vids. i feel a wave of emotions and just delt really sad and depressed. i believed it and just ended it there.

fast forward next day i get a text from her. she says she missess me and she left home. i was like WTF FUCK. i feel guilty that i did this to her. i told her to immediately go back and live her life, she said she wants to die and i try my best to comfort her. i tell her to delete the convos and send a screenshot for proof. i would follow and do the same thing. she said that its not my fault. that shes sorry and whats the point if our lives are already ruined and that her aunt has all the details of our convo. im heartstruck and brain has melted. i tell her to calm down and go bac home. im stressing out rn.

then out of nowhere she fucks me up by saying. ""HAA ITS A JOKE IM A POSER"". my brain has already been destroyed at this point. in just so confused and worried she was making this up to cover up for feeling suicidal or something from  being caught sexting with me. she just keep saying i got catfished. she was a fake. she had other victims that hated her too. she said she was gay. i say that i dont know what to think or say anymore. she says my nudes and vids are safe with her. he/she wont spread them. he/she said they could sell my nudes but arent that heartless. at this point i say that i couldnt bear he embarradsment of it being leaked and that i would commit suicide and kill myself. she said i was a drama quenn and i should just RELAX. i wanted to make him or her feel as guilty as possible. she/he then tells me to block him/her. i told them my goodbyes and farewells. didnt want to show my anger incase it would anger them. they said they wouldnt blackmail me. and it ended there. blocked. tricked. i have no choice but to trust her/him.

aftet all this happened i couldnt stop thinking if the would accidentally get leaed. my life was fucked. i couldnt eat well and gag'd at the thought of my nudes getting leaked and my family(i have alot of relatives and family members) looking at me in disgust and disowning me and not getting into school. idk what to feel anymore. sometimes i think she was just faking it for my sake because our conversations looked so real like her reactions to seeing my pics and her sending her nudes( idk where she got the boobs and vagina pics if she was a gay man posing as her all along. did a reverse image search aswell and nothing). 

i dont know how to cope up with this. my head has a mix of emotions from whats happening. i need advice on how i can deal wih this. how can i live. cant post any pics. cant get popular or try to get attention or they might leak or ill get blackmailed in the future and just ruin my whole life. idk what to do anymore. the situation itself is making me mildly suicidal and very depressed.

21,"Sorry for the encroaching wall of text, but I'm a bit of a talker.  

I am a SCIA (Special Circumstances Instructional Assistance) for my school district. I've worked for the district for a little over 2 years. And got transferred to work with ... Turtle Queen Antebellum just after Christmas break this school year. I'm one of 3 aides in the Special Day Class, the other two being Para-Professionals specifically for the class. The teacher (we'll call them Typhoon Megadontus) has a competence level on par with a 1 legged goat in a foot race. Tyhpoon Megadontus ""delegates"" (read as ""has about 30 minutes of uptime in front of the class before making us aides do all the actual teaching the entire day while they sits at their desk studying for their own classes that they haven't passed yet and have failed the RICA examination 3 times in 2 years""). You may have guessed by now, but I'm not a huge fan of Typhoon Megadontus. But that has not stopped me from working in and loving the entire class like they were my own flesh and blood. I've poured plenty of my own time and resources into making this class flourish to the best of my ability. My point is, I care about this job, these kids, and the school I'm in like a second home, (or first, considering I'm not much of a fan of my current residence, but I digress) and I have no interest in giving up the position now or any time in the future. I disagree with the way Typhoon Megadontus does things, but it doesn't stop me from doing so much more than my job description entails. I'm in charge of a group of 6 students for 80% of the day and am expected to do this every day, in and out, regardless of the behavior issues of Turtle Queen Antebellum, and Typhoon Megadontus is not available to take over my table when I have to deal with the child. Typhoon Megadontus' usual plan of action is to plop Turtle Queen Antebellum behind the desk and leave them there for upwards of 30 minutes (it once lasted 2 straight hours). Obviously, this is not helpful to the student's learning. Up until now, I've done nothing because it was apparently what the SCIA before me had let everything decline into, and there wasn't much I could do to start digging out. (I forgot to mention, Typhoon Megadontus is a 60+ year old ex-pastor who demands to be called ""Doctor Typhoon Megadontus"" by their elementary aged students because they have a doctorate in Religious studies {no, I don't work at a Catholic school} so just really REALLY full of themselves and overly controlling) The last few school days, Doctor Typhoon Megadontus was absent because they were busy studying to fail the RICA again. During this time, I finally got to actually do my job because the substitute teacher was more than happy to pick up my group while I handled Turtle Queen Antebellum. So maybe I got to comfortable with actually doing my job. Doctor Typhoon Megadontus was finally back today. The crawl between first recess and lunch was almost half over and Turtle Queen Antebellum had started misbehaving at the group. Doctor Typhoon Megadontus grabs them by both wrists, plops them down behind the teacher desk, and gets back to whatever on the computer. 45 minutes pass by and Doctor Typhoon Megadontus needs to use the restroom. While they're gone, I'm in charge of keeping an eye on Turtle Queen Antebellum behind the desk. I'll lead by saying I did what I did not out of malice or defiant intent, but because I truly believe this method is doing more harm than good to the student, and I'm not ok with that. I ask the other Para-Professional, who has Turtle Queen Antebellum in their group, if they're ready for Turtle Queen Antebellum's return. I also explain to Turtle Queen Antebellum that they have the next 20 minutes until lunch to prove they're ready to get recess by being on best behavior. A couple minutes later, Doctor Typhoon Megadontus returns, asks why Turtle Queen Antebellum was moved, moves them back behind the desk, and fumes at the teacher desk for a few minutes. Doctor Typhoon Megadontus then calls me outside and yells (not loud talking, not constructive criticism voice, not friendly ""I don't like when you do this, so stop"") at me for usurping (yes, the word usurp was used twice in this ""conversation"") their authority in the classroom. Doctor Typhoon Megadontus then does the thing that really pisses me off, and threatens my job. The exact words were ""If you ever usurp my decisions in this class again, you won't be working at this school anymore.""  

Now, I'll fully admit that I probably bruised Doctor Typhoon Megadontus' fragile and overbearing ego when I decided Turtle Queen Antebellum needed to actually fucking learn in the classroom, but that gives them no right or power over my position as an aide to a specific student (one that will be leaving Doctor Typhoon Megadontus' classroom at the end of the school year, no less). 

The advice I guess I'm looking for is what do I do next. I will not have a position I've strived and bled for be threatened by a stubborn, controlling, non-credentialed, lousy excuse for an educator. Do I go directly to HR at the district level, or do I take it to the Principal of the school first? I'm worried to take it to the Principal because they've already had too much leniency for Doctor Typhoon Megadontus' lackluster capabilities. Or do I do nothing and wait out the few more weeks of school before I'm rid of the useless fuck?",09May2018,0
22,"Okay so long story short, I dated a guy for 2.5 years who turned out to be kinda abusive. You can scroll back in my post history to around June 2016, you’ll find all that fun stuff if you want details. But in order to keep this short, imma just jump right into it. 

Due to that shit show of a relationship &amp; breakup I am **very** uncomfortable with people knowing where I live. It’s definitely gotten better since 2016, but I’m still uncomfortable. So it’ll essentially start out “yeah we can totally hang at my place!” Then I kinda like obsessively think about it until it’s not okay. Then I cancel the plans. 

None of my friends know where I live. I’m moving out in August so I was thinking this is a great time to start making progress on trusting people to know where I live. I wanted to do baby steps, like invite my closest &amp; most trusted friends over. But it’s not gonna go according to plan. 

A new FWB, Anthony, is gonna be coming over next Thursday. I wanted to go to his place instead but it’s not a possibility. So he’ll be coming over to mine. And holy fuck I’m nervous.

I also don’t want to assume she is in a relationship a miss a chance, but I don’t want to ask her out just to find out she’s already dating someone.(Little background: We are both at the same college and age isn’t a issue, I’ve only dated one person in my life and am still kind of new to the dating game)

I had a few questions I thought y’all could give your opinions on!

Is 8 months too soon for her to be involved in another relationship?

Should I be having second thoughts about asking this girl out? 

Should I be intimidated by these finding?

And literally any other advice y’all would be willing to give me would be much appreciated!
Also if you have questions I’ll answer them to the best of my ability. Thank you!",09May2018,0

25,"(Sorry for bad grammar or wtv, I'm not gonna proofread this)

So, I met this girl in October 2017, and we quickly started texting every day (no classes together, we were 16 and licenseless, also shy) and around Christmas I confessed my feelings for her, which she said were mutual. The problem is that she has NEVER been able to make time for us to spend together. Since the beginning, all the way back in December, we have spent time together outside of the class we now share TWICE. She cancels every time we make plans, usually the day or night before. I confronted her about it in April after she let me go to the movies alone on what should've been a date, and she said she doesn't do it on purpose and that she's really sorry. I forgave her, though I lost my love for her and decided to just continue being her friend.  A few weeks later, she asked to accompany me on my plans to see a different lgbt movie, and I said sure. However, she again cancelled the day before, citing forgetfulness and saying she had made plans with her aunt.  I haven't answered her texts since and only talk to her when she talks to me now because I'm trying to force myself to move on. The problem is, I don't want to; I enjoy talking to her and think she is such a warm person. However, I don't enjoy the constant disappointment and feeling like she would make time if she wanted to. 

TLDR: Going nowhere, she never changes, but I enjoy talking to her and don't want to end it. Should I end it on the principle of self-respect or continue because I still care about her? What to do?",09May2018,1

However my parents don’t want me to do it next year because they feel that I care too much about it and not enough about school work. My question is; how do I balance my school work with drumline?

27,"To preface, I am a 6ft male, decent build. 

Today I found out the person that has been harassing me and some people I know online is habitually stalking me and even going as far as buying an old phone I sold to a pawn shop. They have gained access to my entire contacts list probably not through the phone but through my Verizon account. I have notified the police with screenshots and posted a Facebook status to everyone so they know what's going on in case they get harassed.



I'm waiting for the police to get a warrant or something to get the login info from Facebook and Snapchat, but until then I feel unsafe in my own home. No doubt they have been to my house before, they have the address. I don't want to throw out any mail in case they go through my trash. I carry pepper spray just in case but I don't want a confrontation.


I also feel terrible that someone that was trying to get to me had harassed my friends and family. They should never have been involved to begin with but once I found out all these random accounts were the same person I was overcome with guilt.


I don't actually know who it is yet and I'm afraid to even leave the house because it could be anyone. ",09May2018,1

He was rarely home \(my sisters are eleven and thirteen, and I'm sixteen\) and was never really there for us as soon as he began to date. He left me home alone on my mom's birthday to go on a date with this lady. Just last month, a specific woman he has been dating moved into our house. At first I didn't mind her but now I cannot tolerate being in the same room as her. She's a nasty woman who berates me and my youngest sister often, while idolizing my thirteen year old sister. Since this woman has moved in, most if not all of my mom's stuff has been thrown out: her clothes, her decorations, her pictures, EVERYTHING. It's like she never existed and to be honest I don't even know what's real anymore. My dad repainted the entire house and changed half of the furniture because his girlfriend wanted him to and he has become a lot harsher towards me. He told me it'll be his girlfriend's decision to help me pay for college or not, when before he had said he would do his best to help me out.  I broke down crying a week ago, and all he said to me was ""If you're going to cry, go do it in your room"" in the coldest voice I have ever heard. He then took my cat away and to a pound because his girlfriend did not like my cat. I broke down crying after that, once more, telling him how I thought about everything. And all he said was that I'm just overreacting because of my Asperger's syndrome. My youngest sister began to cry as well, because she loved that cat, and immediately my dad says ""Good job: you just made your sister cry."" I honestly don't know if I am overreacting or not, I'm incredibly high\-functioning \(I think it has gone away for the most part if that's possible\). I think about what's happened and can't help but get so mad, then sad. And I just don't think I can handle this all, it just seems like a terrible situation. And then I think about if I'm overreacting and I just feel like I'm going insane.

Am I overreacting? And if I'm not, or if I am, how do I respond best to this? How do I deal with this so I don't go insane? I really don't know what to do, I just feel stuck and alone and hopeless.

30,"Does it make sense for me to move to a larger place (since I have a lot of stuff) but a bit further away from school but more or less same distance to the city and most importantly I'm living with the owner who's a nice lady versus the crabby people I'm with?

I'm going to make a list of pros and cons of moving there or staying: 

Pros and cons of moving there: 

Pros

* slightly cheaper since I won't have to pay any bills or bonds according to landlord lady

* nice lady

* larger nicer house, large room (lol she's giving me the garage/home office) she's looking for someone who'll stay more than six months, cat friendly (since I've already got a cat) and she's thinking of adopting a kitten herself which would be an awesome companion for my cat when I'm not home :) 

* That new Express train line down the suburban line is gonna be sweet or so I hear 

* Near a shopping centre five minutes away + IKEA and near a reserve with a creek (cool!) + 7/11 AYYY


Cons

* I have to move. Pack stuff, disassemble stuff. Blurgh right during exams 

* A bit further away from classes

* Hear that it's a bit more unsafe in Springvale but I doubt it since this one is close to the station and I'm going to try and be home when it's dark more and whatnot.

* Have to pay to rereguster my cat with a different council 

Pros and cons of staying: 

Pros

* Already familiar with crabby people 

* Don't have to move stuff 

* Closer to classes 

* Already registered with the council for my cat 

* From experience I can tell it's safe and I've been walking home at 1am without getting stabbed from the station

Cons 

* Crabby people 

* It's through an agent

* I want my bond; bills are balls

* House is crappier, in comparison what I'm getting for what I pay isn't as good as what I'd get if I moved to the other place 

....Looking at this list, I think I'd like to move still but I'm just not looking forward to the moving bit much...

But then that makes me consider the possibility of getting a scholarship and not having to deal with student loans, etc because I am going to go to college no matter what.

I obviously didnt believe him cuz this girl has been loyal and has loved me for so long. then he sends me text messages. im in denial i still think the text messages are fake. then i show emma the messages and the look on her face was... shocked.

i start getting worried, he sends me more text messages and a picture of him at her fucking house, my girlfriend denies a lot of things at first, then after sufficient proof this cunt has sent me, she admits to things at time goes on. 

first she says all they did was hug and madeout

then she said they fucked.

“i like *cunt*”

she wouldnt stop repeating this... i was on the verge of suicide but one of my friends talked to me and i feel a little better but my stomachs in knots and i feel ashamed and fucking humiliated. 

she has absolutely no remorse and doesnt seem to care

40,"Hi, I'm originally from Washington state, but about 7 months ago I moved down the California. I'm 17 and have a year left of high school after this one is completed. It was not my decision to move at all, my parents hated living in Washington and wanted to move so they did. I begged them to wait until I graduated but they refused. 

My life in California has been shit to be honest, my life is falling apart. Right after I moved I broke my nose and had to get surgery, then I tore a ligament in my ankle and had to get surgery again. This has made it so I started missing school a lot, and since then I have never been able to catch up. About a week ago my apartment house got infested with rodents, so I had to move yet again. I've been sleeping on the floor for the last week, and if that was worse enough, my younger sister got MRSA and has been in the hospital on and off for the past week so I have missed in even more school. I have 3 F's with a month of school left to go, and before I moved the lowest grade I had ever gotten on my transcript was an A-. I love my parents but they do not help, and I have had problems with them in the past. Every time I ask them for help or try to express my concerns they tell me this is my fault, that I need to get my shit together. Whenever I tell my mom my problems she says stuff like, ""maybe I should slit my wrists, because this is all my fault right? Would you like that?"" Or some insane shit like that, like she's about to have a breakdown or something.

My dad has been fine, but in the past he was almost borderline abusive. When I was in 6th grade he would shove me to the floor if I didn't get all my chores done. I don't want to make it sound like they are terrible parents, because they're not, they are a million good things they have done for me as well. But they won't listen to me or help me out when I am begging them. 

I'm just done, I have tried so hard ever since I moved to do my best, but all I have been rewarded with is disaster. One of my greatest joys was basketball, but I wasn't even given a chance to play on the team down here because  they had already picked the team out. My grades are falling apart, the way they are going I will have no chance at any college, except for maybe community college. I just want to move back to Washington, so I can finish my senior year and get in state tuition at the University I wanted to go to anyways. My best friend up there is 18 and getting an apartment, so I just feel like this would be better than continuing the path down here and letting my life fall to pieces. I have no interest in universities in California either. I don't know if it's legal to move at 17, I'm turning 18 in 7 months. Anyways I just need some advice, I feel like my life is falling apart, I don't know what is the best option at this point. Thanks for any help.

41,"A year or so ago I met an amazing girl. She was everything I looked for and had a very similar sense of humour to me. Things where going very well, never past first base but had real chemistry. I should clarify that at this time in my life I was addicted to drugs. I bonded with her over smoking weed or snorting coke/ addarall. After a while of things not progressing in the relationship I made an ultimatum which was basically do what I want or stop talking to me. I was very bitter and sad that I didn't get what I wanted, so I expressed that as anger and ceased communication with her entirely for a better part of 8 months. I've been sober for over 6 months now, and I've become very regretful of my actions. I recently began talking to her again, and she is very forgiving.

My mom found my story somehow and she got really mad at me and we just had this huge fight.

44,"Hey Reddit. 

Some general advice regarding myself, I am 21M living in Sydney. 

Recently two good things happened to me in my otherwise depressed state. I got my P1 license, and I discovered a great video on YouTube. The video was a story of actor Bryan Cranston and how he recommended travelling for young people. 

He had a story about, how when he and his brother were just 20, with not much money or belongings they hopped on their motorbikes one day and travelled the country working odd jobs and never sleeping in the same place. He said it was an experience, and it struck a cord with me because I have never travelled or anything if the like. 

Now, I’ve been a NEET for the past two years, so I’ve been stranded at home bored. I’m planning on buying my first car (second-hand) and travelling the country of Australia as a sort of exploration. 

Now, my psychiatrist thought this is a bit more of a fantasy and would not translate as well to the real world, but I think it’s very doable. I planned to take an Esky with some food and drink, 5-7k in cash or savings. Or just my old debit card I stored some extra money on

And spare changes of clothes. Money isn’t too much of an issue, because I do have some of it saved, but I do expect buying a car to take a chunk out of my savings. 

If you search “Bryan Cranston Travel” I feel the man explains it better than I could. I also plan on sleeping in my car or hotels, possibly working temp or odd jobs in order to keep myself afloat. 
This pretty much explains everything I feel is worth explaining. I would love anyone’s honest opinion on this. 

I know gas and hotels would eat up money quickly, which is why I plan on working. It’s not like I’ll have anything better to do, I’m a young, fit guy so hopefully I could work manual or any menial jobs

Another guy slipped his Xanax into the wrong drink, which happened to be mine, and I became ridiculously blacked out in no time at all. 

Long story short, I was so drunk that I didn’t even go to the party and was just blacked in my friends room with 3-5 of my buddies and some of their girlfriends. A girl I know showed up randomly to this room and came sat on my lap and we apparently made out for a while. I don’t remember any of this and none of my “friends” even tried to stop it from happening. 

2 years later I just found out there’s video, and my roommates girlfriend basically blackmailed me to say she has it and could ruin my life at any moment (no idea why she waited two years, but she’s recently dating my roommate and they have a horrendous/toxic relationship so maybe jealousy? No idea...). I asked my roommate to intervene and he basically said he has no obligation to keep her from blackmailing me or have her delete the video, insists she has no intention of making this an issue, but also told me to tread carefully?

Only my coworkers that were hired on in the same training class as me have been consistently receiving their offer letters with a pay decrease. Technically its not substantial, but from 11.91 to 11.00 is going to be roughly $40.00 less a week. Potentially a lot more depending on how much the benefit opt-in is. 

This is a good company to work for, and its in the HIM field so its fairly stable. The problem is that I live in a city experiencing a housing shortage, and while the average pay is pretty high (cashiers at fast food usually start at $10.00 full-time) the cost of living is higher. 

So I would like to see if its possible to negotiate my ""offer"", but  I'm not really sure how to do so. Especially since this is probably the first job I've had that hasn't involved retail work, and I've never been in this sort of position.

Where then a little later we went to a bar the first bar we all had less than one beer. So from my impression at this point i did not think any of us were even buzzed. Then we wanted to get wasted we hit up a few more bars and some shots, we were having a good time. Then we went to a bar to dance and danced and hung out for a while but it got too hot so we left. We went to another bar where the third party got into a fight with her sister or someone and things went downhill fast. So now she was upset and she is newly married and things are not great i guess that opened up a can of worms. She decides to go to a strip club we are like okay we are here to have fun. Some more shot must've happened in here somewhere. We go to the strip club where the third party is sad the whole time crying, i comfort her but i also pay attention mostly to the strippers.

At this point my BF and her tell me that she wants a threesome because well she hadn't been getting it. Drunk me was like well if you are down i am down. The whole uber ride was her telling the uber driver she wanted the threesome and i rememebr tipping him $20 on the app because awkward right...!

She is panicking say she didnt remember anything from dinner on which i was like oh okay so i explained what happened and then she says that she remembers saying she didnt want to do it which i said at that point when you did want to stop we stopped instantly no hestiation because consent is fricken here ladies and gents. Now i am uneasy the way she is saying she did not remember anything or all the details. The night is not really clear to me but i know for a fact it was not my idea as well as i remember clearly asking what she wanted and that i respected what she wanted from there. So now I know she regrets it and we talked about it but the way she was talking on the phone made it feel like she was blaming me and my bf and that makes me uneasy here.

My friend of 15 years got into a relationship 2 years ago. 8ish months later was my birthday and we went skiing and we were supposed to chill afterwards and he told me he made plans with his boyfriend (who I haven't met yet)

It put me in a really sad mood, because he already seemed like he didn't want to introduce me to his boyfriend because me and our other friends were immature (he told another friend this) (the BF is 8 years older)

He ended up staying afterwards, but it just made me feel like he had somewhere else he'd rather be.

Then a year later, again on the day we were celebrating my birthday and go to dinner and then a friends basement to drink, he calls me a couple hours beforehand and tells me his coworker is also having a birthday party and he might leave for an hour (which means 3-4 hours) if we were ""just going to drink after dinner""

Again, same thing, he didn't leave, but again it felt like he wanted to leave and had somewhere else he wanted to be. I felt like shit the entire night thinking about how again he had somewhere else he'd rather be.

As part of the homework, the last HW and worth 2x as much as the previous HW's, she is asking us about a ""biot"" number and some formula and we are supposed to figure out the unit of thermal conductivity? WTF. She hasn't taught us anything about this, heck. I don't even know where to start. Then we are supposed to convert mph to km/s, hp to watts, hectacres to sq meters, then 12300 NmKg ^-1K^-1 and convert without exponents. I have no clue what that is! There are 5 problems witn those exponents. 

She gave a lecture on units, but never how to solve a problem. All the lecture was, was a Powerpoint that included copy and paste Wikipedia charts, that showed what SI derived units. Like, just listed the SI Units. Didn't teach or mention to us ANYTHING about a ""biot"" number or thermal conductivity or even how to convert or anything. Nothing. 

This is her first year teaching in general. She is a NASA employee. She's a smart woman. But more often than not, she's not the best at teaching. She expects us to know all this stuff already, I think she had a bigger expectation.

This class has absolutely zero prerequisites and it's worth 2 credits points. I have an A in the class currently. 

Should I mention to my professor that I believe these questions shouldn't be on the last graded assignment, given there were no prerequisites for this course about us knowing what whatever physics, chemistry whatever that is? 

I am not the only one expressing these feelings as well. Other classmates, also aren't in the level math necessary to know what she is talking about.

56,"So I snore when I sleep and usually when my girlfriend sleeps at mine she kicks me or hits me when I snore to wake me up and I sleep on my side as she cant sleep if I snore and its really hard for her to sleep. Recently when she kicks or hit me I haven't been waking up and the other night I only woke up when she grabbed me and shook me as hard as she could.

Last night I was going to sleep on the couch if the same thing was happening but in the middle of the night when I went to the toilet and came back she asked me to go to the couch and I responded I will soon, I have no memory of this and dont remember saying this or even going to the toilet.

This is happens often but not this extreme, for example if im falling asleep or whilst im asleep and shed wake me up I would respond but have no memory half the time and not be as compliant when I have no memory as opposed to when I do remember. I also sometimes don’t wake up from my alarm but I have figured out that I turn my alarm off and continue to sleep bc my girlfriend saw me do it, but I also have no memory of this. As a kid my mum also says I used to talk a lot in my sleep so this is not uncommon for me. So my question is do I have any sleep disorders and how can I prevent this from happening?",09May2018,1
57,"My parents think I’m a lazy piece of shit and have told me that to my face. They tell me this on the daily despite the fact that I’m working two jobs (although one is on and off seeing as it’s only a “come in when we need you for a week” job) 

My dad is super disappointed because of my choice of school, which was expensive except I literally don’t have a choice because it’s the only place I can take that major. Plus the school is on strike, which screws me even more.

My mom thinks she does everything for me even though I lived on residence for eight months by myself, without her help and I did fine.

It bothers me so much that they call me lazy to my face when I’m trying my absolute hardest. Sure, maybe I’m lazy on my downtime, but I’m not lazy on the job- I think. They keep telling me that my brother does everything around the house except when he gets asked, he whines and complains (at age 14) mind you. And plus, he doesn’t do shit anyways. I’ve been doing the shit he’s supposed to do lately. All he’s supposed to do is take the trash out every Monday. Except I work Monday nights so since I’ve had my new job, for about three months, I’ve been coming home and then been told since I’m already outside, I should do the garbage. 

Plus my parents literally do my brother’s job FOR HIM. He’s a paper boy and he gets paid to sit on his ass while they do more than half the work. 

What the fuck am I doing wrong? Why do they call me lazy? Why do they fail to see that my brother is a piece of shit too?

58,"I'm 21, and currently looking into degree programs. I've yet to start classes, but I've switched my program once already, and now just as classes are about to start again, I'm considering another switch. I was initially looking into an Associate's in Business Administration because I thought I might enjoy a business career, but I instead opted for Bachelor's in IT because of the average salaries in the field and I'm also naturally very tech-savvy. My line of thought is that I'm going to hate my job no matter what, so I might as well choose something where I can make enough money to support my expensive hobbies with (gaming, music production, motorcycles, firearms).

I was speaking with my mother today, and she actually made a good point that I might enjoy a law enforcement career, and i'm inclined to agree. However, I don't want to switch my program again, go down that path and then realize ""shit this isn't for me,"" and then either set myself back yet another year to switch back, or stick with a job with a subpar salary and not so much enjoyment.

I've yet to find any career path that I find interesting, and makes a decent salary, and I feel like I'm going to keep treading water until I'm too old to make anything of myself. ",09May2018,1

I could go and try and make friends with them but I am an introvert and not interested in taking a week off of work so I could be the friend that walks behind when the sidewalk is too small kind of situation.

I’m the ONLY one in the Entire office to sit at this station that has 6 desks pushed against each other. Used to be intern area. Exec thinks it’s a good idea to place the analysts together and will hire more in future.  

Got hired as senior analyst. I’m not trying to be  extra but I’m sooo uncomfortable in the middle of the office. I can’t work with ppl walking everywhere and need headphones just to do basic tasks. 

This workstation was not discussed on hiring. Rather it was implied that I would get a cubicle like everyone else at the office.

69,"First of all, I'm rarely mad at anyone but myself. I am what most people consider a hyperactive person; I find it *really* hard to be chill. When I speak, especially when I'm explaining something to somebody, I tend to stand up (if I'm sitting that is) and gesticulate with my hands a lot (*a lot* worse than stereotypical Italian).

Since today's society has zero tolerance to any form of hyperagressive behaviour, I'm unable to vent.

I had trained muay thai, and the trainings were so exhausting that they'd leave me brainless for half an hour afterwards, I was sore from beating and being beaten. But even after that, I could still snap and punch a hole through a closet, break a mirror, lamp, or just punch a wall until blood starts dripping from my fists.

Same with punching bag, gym, team sports, masturbation, sex, drugs... you name it.

The only thing that gets me off is destroying something, but, as I've mentioned before, *society has zero tolerance towards hyperagressive behaviour*, which makes it literally impossible for someone that lives in the city to act like a madman.

I also keep bottling up the raw bloodlust towards anything/anyone that can feel pain, but, ironically, I'm an extremely empathetic person so I tend to suppress those impulses.

The thing is, I've been bottling it for so many years that it started to take toll on my body. 

If entropy was God, I would be Jesus.

I would greatly appreciate any kind of legit advice on the topic.

This time, he ignored his court date and community service and was also caught with an illegal gun... I’m mad but more sad than anything. I feel that my mom and brother are just saying he got what he deserved for being irresponsible and don’t want to help him. I feel sick and so sad thinking that I wont be able to spend time with him if he gets a long sentence. He has heart failure and I’m always scared of him passing away, I was really looking forward to spending a lot of time with him this summer, and I am now scared more than ever and feel guilty that I cant spend time with him. My dad and I are very close and we talk every single day, I have a very strong bond with him so this is why I feel terrible. Even though I don’t agree with a lot of the things he does, he is a great dad. 

Not to mention he is going to miss me graduate from college this week which I am very sad about I am almost not excited to go at all. 

Also, i finally planned a vacation with some of my friends and of COURSE his court date is the day i leave next week. I feel like i will be so stressed out i wont be able to enjoy this trip, I know i will feel ruined if his sentence is for a long time. So i am considering not going at all.

Last time he went to jail for a few days he was treated terribly and was barely fed, I am so scared that is what they are doing to him now.

Everyday at work somebody walks in immediately after and farts really loud while pooping. Happens everyday. I thought it was a funny story to tell my friends. They told me to film it next time so I did.

Today I use the bathroom and moments after somebody walks in. Surely it’s this guy, I think..

(Notice the angle of my phone in respect to the stall - you do not see the stall next to him.. his phone however, was dropped down to hit feet and had distance to the stall meaning he probably even caught my face).

He played in a soccer league with me and followed the Premier League intensely. He also liked video games but mostly Nintendo games and he normally played casually with his friends. 

Once he went off to college, though, he became increasingly less active and more into video games, bringing either his Xbox or Wii U with him when visiting home. He stopped playing soccer and eventually lost all interest in the sport, and spent more time playing online games. Then Overwatch came out and things got really bad. He joined a recreational team and started devoting all his free time to playing the game. He managed to graduate with average grades (as I said, he is smart but he just doesn't try), and after moving back home he took the monetary gifts he got from different family members (totaling around $1K) and spent it all on a gaming pc and started getting really serious about his Overwatch team, i.e., doing tournaments and practicing daily for them. He came back saying that he wanted to take a year off to ""think about his options and get experience"", and my parents were fine with it.

Fast forward to a year later now and he still is completely obsessed with his team. He has spent pretty much every day of the past year staying cooped up in his room grinding Overwatch, only coming out to eat or pick my little brother up from school. His daily schedule typically involves waking up around 1:30 pm, playing Overwatch for a few hours, eating dinner, then playing more until around 3:00 am and then going to bed. Besides taking the GRE (which he only did because our parents forced him to) he has made no steps toward applying to grad school, even though he claims that he wants to do it. He has never worked a job, full or part-time, and shows no desire to work at all. Around the house he is equally inactive; usually letting his dirty clothes pile up in the center of his room and then bringing them down all at once for our mom to wash, leaving used plates, utensils, and napkins wherever he eats and not cleaning up, leaving trash around, etc. He doesn't exercise and barely goes outside at all. The only topics he has any zeal for talking about involve either video games or twitch, and I'm pretty much convinced that he secretly wants to become a pro esports player or a streamer. 

As I said this has been going on for a year now, and though his ""year of thinking"" is over he still shows no sign of changing. My parents have tried talking to him a couple times but he gets extremely defensive if they ask too much about it. He always says that he is ""still thinking"" and my parents just accept it. Personally I have gotten very frustrated with him, primarily because of his selfishness, and also because my room is next to his and I am often kept up at night by him shouting/raging while playing Overwatch. Recently I have tried to tell my parents that they should be more forceful with him and make him apply for a job, but they also get very defensive and say that '""it's not my place to tell them how to parent"" and also that I'm being too judgemental of him, when I just want to see him be more active (and also not have to wear headphones every night). It's gotten to the point where it's basically a taboo subject and nobody mentions him. 

So right now we're in this state where he is continuing to stay isolated in his room day after day and nothing is done about it, and I fear that this will continue for a long time if things don't change. As time goes on I lose more and more patience with him, and at this point I don't even talk to him at all. I don't want this to damage our relationship but I find it very hard to get along with him. 

I want my brother to find motivation, but I don't know how to get him going in the right direction. What should I do?",09May2018,1
100,"Hello, Reddit. 

I am nineteen years old. For my whole life, I have been terrible with any any kind of transition or change. I am hypersensory to my surroundings \(noise, light, sound, touch, smell, emotions, etc.\) and I am a deeply sentimental person, and this makes change of environment very neurologically challenging. My parents tell me that when I was in kindergarten I would cry every day after I got home from school and began to really realize and adapt to the change of surrounding because I would just be bombarded with too much sensory input. When I was eight years old I recall freaking out when going on a day\-trip on a vacation because ""what if we never come back""? 

I still struggle with transition. Tonight is the last night of my freshman year of college, one of my dogs died around two weeks ago, me and a former partner of over two years are going our separate ways, and I can't believe it. I just packed everything up and was suddenly overwhelmed with emotion. 

How can I learn to better deal with change and transition? I know that change is a big part of life and I don't want to be miserable every time it happens, but sometimes it feels like it's just built into me. ",09May2018,1

102,"Before I go the logical route of “find a new job”, I need a practical solution to some of the bullshit at work. 

There’s been a few guys who are non-confrontational complaining that they feel like the underdogs and are being singled out by a select group of guys (2 managers, one sales associate) and are ready to leave the store.

I’ve experienced it a few times and probably at the worst time of my life. I don’t handle stress well and lately I’ve been reactionary. I’ve been going to counselling to address a lot of this but it’s a shitty situation. 

I have some really bad anxiety issues, but rather than shut down, if there is someone being the source of my stress I just want to crush their skull in. The one manager is aware of my issues and rather than being even remotely understanding, exploits it. 

Today he decided to try and push my buttons and I threatened to sink his teeth in and he threatened HR on me. Not because he was afraid, he said it in a way that was dismissive like it somehow protects him from all harm as he acts like a total fuck boy. 

I generally try to actively ignore them, but they will go out of their way to bug me even though I make it very clear I ain’t down for their retard, knuckle dragging antics. 

How can I address this without a blowup and without getting higher ups involved?",09May2018,1

My depression has been noticible since I was in 6th grade when my parents got devorced. I have always put a smile on it and just pretended that everything was fine. Recently it has been getting worst and now I cry myself to sleep because i cant handle it. My mom and my relatonship isnt good. She thinks its my fault that I shut her out. I do shut her out. I shut her out for multiple reasons. The first year my parents got divorced my uncle was living with my dad. Me, my sister, my cousin, and my dads two kids were stayinng the week because it was summer. He tried to rape my sister and If my dad hadnt jumped out of the shower and came into the living oom I might have had to kill him. He admitted to the cops he was trying to rape her and my mom didnt belive us. My mom had him come over about 6 months later when we were outside so he could mow out law. (he was my dads best friend but they were friends since they were 12 so he was our uncle.) My sister had a panic attack and started having flash backs. My mom said it was just heat stroke. My mom was yelling at me for some reason I dont remember 2 months ago and she said, "" If your dad was in a better spot right now I would send you there because I dont fucking want you."" From that moment on I didnt try to be her friend. Everytime I went out in the living room I got yelled at for some reason and she said that I was ruining our relationship by not ever coming out of my room. My mom went to night school for four months to get her GED. Im proud of her but during those 4 months I only had one person. My mom hates my boyfriend and says hes ruining our relationship because all i do is talk to him. He was the only person I had to talk to for four months and its hard to adjust. My mom yelled at me for weeks to make friends and hang out with them after school. I eventually found friends after being yelled at for 3 months. I hangout with them afterschool for a month before she started yelling at me about how I never do anything but go with friends. I have stopped talking to those friends because they felt bad that they got me in trouble. I get yelled at for having anythhing less then a B-. I get all As and Bs and im taking extra classes to graduate early because Ive always wanted to do alot of college. She yells at me for that. Saying that im only doing it becauseI think I cant move out when I graduate. I know I cant move out till im 18. I have 4 different masters degrees I want and I want to have them before Im to old to get the jobs I want. My mom thinks im a bad kid. she tells me all the time that im a bad kid. I have never ditched class, snuck out, or gotten anything less then a B on any of my report card. The only time I have been in the principles office is when a girl beat me up because I refused to fight. My mom finds anything to fight with me about. The counter wasnt wiped off because everyone was making dinner and she yelled at me and told me I never do anything right. My dogs water bowl was next to the counter and she yelled at me saying it was in the middle of the floor. She is a hypocrite. I dont shave alot because no one really sees my body so I dont see the need. Neither does she but she yells at me saying im not being clean. My dads dog is staying with us and she yells at me because she feeds and lets him out when she wakes up saying its not her dog she shouldnt have to takre care of it. Her actual dog that is hers she got it as a present HER DOG THAT SHE EVEN SAYS IS HER DOG sleeps with me every night because her husband doesnt like him. I feed him and let him out when i wake up. She asked me a bunch of questions and one of the questions was, "" Whats your favorite thing to do?"" I couldnt think of anything and she said I can answer honestly i wont get in trouble. I said yelling. The next day I took a nap and she yelled at me for it and said, "" Isnt this my favorite thing to do? yelling?""

Girlfriend was supposed to go out for dinner with her friends and said she wouldn’t be home late. I text her and ask what’s up and she tells me she’s busy.

We have a LDR so communication is really important. Doing things like this makes for a pretty shitty relationship in my opinion.. Plus it’s hypocritical for her to lose it when I lag to reply but allows herself hours in between texting me back.

107,"recently my family's one year old german shepherd died in a freak accident. It still doesn't feel real. He was the sweetest most loving dog, he literally loved everyone and was always happy and literally never did anything wrong besides being too affectionate. I had such a strong bond with him. I was away at school and they didn't tell me until I came home last friday, and my mom had already gone and got a new puppy that same day I came home. 

She told me they bought him from a breeder in Missouri and the breeder had him shipped by plane. Today things my mom said started adding up. ""Oh they didn't even make me sign papers to not breed him or get him fixed weird huh"" ""when we brought him home and put him in the yard it was like he'd never seen grass before"" and the fact that they shipped him by plane, didn't care they didn't know anything about my family, he was way cheaper than other dogs my family has gotten, he is fine with our other dog but reacts weird to people and being petted, and on top of all this the puppy is extremely skinny. He's fluffy so it's hard to tell visually but you can feel all his bones. he's 14 weeks old so I feel like he should still have baby fat

also my mom lied to me, I was telling he how weird it was that they would ship him by plane and she was like ""oh well they didn't want to ship him but we paid extra"" I looked at their website. They ONLY ship puppies. They had no other information, no pictures of facility, nothing human. Just a few different random breeds of 8 week old puppies for sale



I don't know what to do. I guess there is nothing but I am just so grossed out my mom would support something that is probably awful just to have a cute puppy immediately

she keeps getting mad at me because I don't care about the new puppy but I am still processing everything that's happened and now with this I don't know how to feel, the whole thing just makes me so uncomfortable

I can't talk to her about it, she is an alcoholic and kind of emotionally unstable, I'm honestly scared if I do she might end up hurting the new puppy. It's always been like this, if I ever suggest getting a dog from a shelter she gets really mad and yells at me. She just wants cute babies and stops caring about them when they grow up or she gets bored

109,"I feel Guilty about my ex and the way he treated me. I wasn’t great to him either and definitely emotionally cheated on him and he was hurt. But here’s my story. I feel so guilty. I also got really mad in arguments. We dated for six years. I am a 26/F and he is a 27/M.
I would find out he lied to me about something I would get really upset and say fuck you and all that bad stuff. When he would always call me crazy when I would get upset with him for something and say I just had a shitty perception of things I would say well then if all my feelings and complaints are crazy to you, why don’t you leave and find someone who you don’t find crazy he would be like wow, you’re so unstable emotionally, why is that always your first resort? And I would be like yeah.... “we don’t agree on these issues. You’re not willing to see the role you play in it. I gladly will tell you exactly how I contribute to this bad situation and when I ask you what you do to contribute to the situation you literally say I can’t remember or I know I can do better... you literally cannot give me a concrete answer as to how you can improve and work with me on this issue because you can’t even point out what to work on on yourself”
He would tell me that I painted a bad picture of him to my family and friends when I went to them for advice and for validation of my feelings. He never made me feel validated. And if he did he made no changes to his behavior but I so believed that he loved me and would change. Just seem to love me. He never hit me. He was always just there. Never went above and beyond for me. Meanwhile I did his homework for him, helped him study, cleaned and cooked for him, made friends with his friends and family, made an effort to see him. Forewent my family events and holidays to be with he and his family because I wanted to see him and I knew there was no way his mom would let him be with my family for Christmas. Nor did he seem excited about the idea of it. I also tried hard to stay fit and sexy for him.
When I would bring up something about his behavior that I didn’t like he would tel me I am too sensitive or blame me for something I did in the past that was apparently equally as shitty or even more shitty, then he would be like “yeah so basically this ain’t as bad as that so why are you upset? I didn’t get upset with you during that situation... why do you have to be such a fighter? Just let it go!!”
The issues were minor at times but they kept happening over and over and he would tell me over and over he loved me and would change. It was dumb shit. Like begging him to kiss me or hold my hand in public, or asking him to invite me to hang with his friends instead of telling me I am always invited (when he used to invite me). Or never being a part of my family or friend group.
So all this lead to me having my feelings invalidated and feeling really poorly about myself and so I emotionally cheated with my friends and family and some of those friends were guys. I could have a real conversation with them. Where we disagreed and it was okay. We saw both points of view and agreed to want to work together to understand each other. Where they did kind favors for me just because. Just because I existed. They seemed excited to have me around and would be genuinely excited for me, whereas my ex seemed to fake it. Hell I got into nursing school and graduated from a top university and it was always my dream to do that and he didn’t even plan a special dinner for us. His parents took us out to eat and he thought that was sufficient. This was six years in.
I know it messed with his head and was wrong but he kept promising me things that never came and I so badly wanted him to change and just be a more present person and seem to put me first. Hell. He would make up excuses to leave my family functions early and we would have to drive back home three hours away. I would always make a point to hang with his family. I always wanted to hang with them because I knew he had a tight knit family. Meanwhile my family thought he was really fake nice. I also thought that after a while. His actions and words wouldn’t align.
It ended with him coming home at 4 am, him leaving me and calling me crazy and saying he walks in eggshells around me when I asked him why he came home late without calling and why my contact name was deleted in his phone. He told me four different stories as to why he came home so late because I found an email from the girl he went home with. I later found an email uber receipt split between two people dropping him off at the university by his apartment. He told me to move out of his place, he blocked me on everything, told me to not go to his college graduation later that week (when I helped him countless times to study and motivated him and did flash cards with him and wrote and edited his papers). Two weeks later when she dropped him he begged for me back, asked for a threesome which I declined and instead tried to be crazy sexy in bed and do insane stuff to please him (I’m his first). I couldn’t deal with the insecurity that I wasn’t enough for him despite everything I did for him. His biggest complaint was that I got really upset with him (when he lied or didn’t make me a priority). We got together to try to make things work and use this as an eye opener to work on our relationship. He promised to do therapy. He never made any effort into getting therapy. But mentioned t often.
I left him when he started to not make an effort to see me when I had a weird work schedule and he works for his mom so I assumed she would give him leeway with his schedule so he could spend time with me. But he never seemed like that was an option despite his family loving me. He worked a very minor role at the company at this time.
I then regretted my decision of leaving him and tried to get him back but he started seeing a new girl and said he wanted to give her a chance, that she and he aren’t compatible but he wants to give her a chance because he gave me so many chances. He says he would be sad to see me marry someone else. He said he just knows they won’t workout but wants to try so he doesn’t regret anything. That he ideally would be with me. I made him upset one week and all the sudden he says “fuck you, I hate you, I love my girlfriend, we are very compatible, I can see her being my wife and the mother of my children, don’t ever talk to me again, I will never see you again or be with you again, and I am blocking you on everything” then he doesn’t block me on everything.
I see him showing this girl love and affection in our mutual friends social media (some of our fights were about the fact he never showed me affection in public, fuck he didn’t even give me a NYE kiss in front of his fam after 7 years).
I just want to know why I wasn’t enough and what I did wrong to deserve this. And if I am the issue?
TLDR: ex didn’t seem interested in me. Invalidated my feelings. I feel it is my fault. I did everything to make him happy. When I voiced how he didn’t make me happy he would point the finger at me. Strings me along. I feel I am a fucked up person who will never find love now and I ruined something good with someone",09May2018,1

114,"I have (had?) an amazing FWB relationship with a friend of mine. Things started at a mutual friend's party several months ago when she got quite drunk and encouraged us to hook up, which we did. 

I am not a very social person but I AM a very sexual person... My needs in this regard are many, storied, and common knowledge. Prior to hooking up with the man in question I was continuing a friendly sexual relationship with my ex, who was emotionally abusive but was at least giving me sex regularly like I require.

When I started this FWB relationship with my friend (who I worked with maybe 6 years ago and I have known casually for a long time), I thought that I had hit the jackpot. He was a friend, he was kind to me (already better than the last guy), he wasn't looking for anything serious just like me. He gave me a million things that my ex hadn't been able to give me either during or after our relationship.

The problem is simple; over time the requests for my time from my new FWB have tapered off. He told me right off the bat that having sex less than once a week was crazy to him... Great for me! I am of a similar mind and was excited to hear it. Now, six months later, I stand having not had sex for over a MONTH. We saw each other at an event two weeks ago and I said to him ""if I don't hear from you this weekend you know I'll be mad"". I didn't hear from him that weekend, nor the one following.

Even the time could be forgiven with an appropriate excuse, but when I finally bit my pride bullet and messaged him today basically asking him to please tell me if he was over it and done with our FWB relationship so I could make other arrangements for myself he responded with ""I didn't know there was anything to end, I thought we were just banging"". I sent several messages in response to which I have not received an answer, the basic sentiment of which was ""yeah we are just banging but not enough for me and I want my needs to matter here too"". I have yet to receive a response.

122,"My girlfriend of over two years and I have been in a bit of a stunt lately. Our conversations are dry and repetitive, I think I make her uncomfortable when I try to do anything romantic at all. I can’t recall the last time she spontaneously gave me a hug or a kiss or told me she loves me just because she felt like it. She does do all of those things but only on a routine (like saying I love you before we call it a night or part ways for the day). I try to do those things with her but she isn’t very responsive or enthusiastic as she once was or as she should be. The sad thing is that I think she does firmly believe she loves me and would be shocked if I suggested otherwise. We do have fun mostly talking. She’s an incredibly funny person and she thinks I am too at times (joke). I have a lot of fun when we go on dates going over what has been happening in eachothers lives and making jokes. She does confide a lot of personal problems in me that she wouldn’t talk to anyone else about which makes me think she does love me but I can’t figure if it is just as a consultant. I just never pictured the “I love you”s in my relationship would only come on regular set intervals. For a while I thought it might be because she was too nervous or self concious of her feelings to share them like she was when we first started dating. But as things go on and my hugging of her is met with an awkward smile I think to myself she isn’t truly happy. I know if I were to say that to her she would insist she is.

My point is and what I need opinions on is what I should do. Is she really in love with me despite not appearing to be? Is she deluding herself or does she just have an odd way of expressing it. If she is deluding herself should I break things off even if she denies it? I want us both to be happy but I’m not sure that’s where either of us are now",09May2018,3
123,"In school, I (17m) am seen as the loner, suicidal kid because a while ago I tried to commit suicide and got caught (thank god). Apparently the rumor got out around school so now everyone thinks of me as the suicidal loner kid. Even before that people straight up found me annoying because I was a late bloomer and bullied me which is what led to that event. At the time I just wanted to fit in but no one liked me. No one talks to me unless they already know me, which makes every single girl that I like impossible to talk to. Every girl tries to avoid me because of that and it puts me a state of depression because I genuinely just want to have someone I can talk to and feel comfortable with. The one time I was able to talk to a girl and get her number I got this warmth in my chest whenever I thought about her, and I’ve never felt it before. It felt like genuine happiness. Then she found out what happened and abandoned me, which completely crushed my spirits. It doesn’t help that I’m introverted and whenever I talk all I spew is bullshit because I can’t express my emotions properly. I just become a chameleon and adapt to their humor and the environment. I try to be funny when I’m actually horrible with jokes, and I try to not be shy when I’m actually the worst talker ever. I realize within seconds of this that I’m trying way to hard and making a fool out of myself. I try to stay to shut up and go back to being me, and then people think I’m back to being suicidal when I’m not in the slightest. I just want to be able to have a relationship and not have to worry about my accident because I fell in love with this girl and I want to talk to her and be with her but my past is such a deterrent I don’t think she’d ever talk to me.

126,"My friend that I met in college who is a girl(20) and me guy(20).

So she has really bad face acne and she is really self-conscious about it. A little while ago we were talking about it and I told her how I during highschool football went a saw a dermatologist about my bad acne at the time. The dermatologist prescribed me some antibiotics and some cream to put on my face and that it helped a lot. So I suggest she goes and sees a dermatologist about it and maybe they could help you with the acne.

She did exactly that and they prescribed her some antibiotics and some cream to put on her face. What she then told me was she wasn't going to take the antibiotics and use the cream because her mom was addicted to prescription pill when my friend was younger and that's why her mom left the family. So my friend was afraid she was going to get addicted to pills and turn out like her mom.

So about a week ago from today she is telling me she is cutting dairy out of her diet and going completely vegan. She didn't say she was doing this because of her face but I'm assuming she hopes this will clear her face up. Hey whatever works and it's a lot healthier... (Something I might want to look into lol. )

Well a few days ago she is telling me she is rubbing chocolate on her face to get rid of the acne... (Idk if that's a real thing but it's the first time I've ever heard of it.) At this point I feel like she is just looking up ""natural ways to get rid of acne"" and trying anything that comes up.

So Tonight she says to me she's not going to be happy untill she can figure out a natural way to clear her face up. She also says that nobody likes her and nobody wants to be friends with her and it's because of her face (acne). She also said some other very sad stuff (just can't remember right now exactly).

How should I give her advice to help her deal with her acne and the depressed mood it has put her in?

Should I even give advice? I don't know I just want her to know I'm there for her and am willing to help her through this...

thanks in advance for the help!

TL;DR - friend has bad face acne and it's made her depressed. She doesn't want to take antibiotics to get rid of it. And she is going all natural. Just want to know how to help her through this.",09May2018,1
127,"So backstory. I asked this girl I like to prom and we went and had a great time and now we’re close. So I was walking to my car from school when this kid walked up to me and asked all about my prom so I told him, basically asking “did I ask her or did she ask me?” And all that kind of stuff. Then he say that his friend, who I also don’t know, had dibs on my date and how I need to stop talking to her and if I don’t back off his friend will “not be so nice next time” so what do I do? I don’t want to fight anyone but I don’t want to stop talking to her. Also I looked up the friend and apparently he boxes so if we did get in a fight I’d most definitely lose.

130,"A bit of background info: after I was nine months old my parents moved to America (town of court land) for two years and then to Canada (toronto) for 3 because of work reasons. I went to preschool there and learnt the language fairly easy. My parents still spoke Dutch to me but I always responded in English. Sometimes a mix of the two, but mostly With English grammatical structures with a few Dutch words sprinkled in between.

When I came back to the Netherlands. My Dutch was so bad that my parents considered putting me in an international school before a regular elementary school. Luckily that didn’t happen. But my first year there in Holland, I talked with English grammar and Dutch words. 

I was the first born in a new generation of my family, so it wasn’t like I didn’t get any Dutch information fed into me. Thus after a while I could speak Dutch normally.


But then the internet came. 

I was on it almost everyday. English websites, English games, eventually English online chatting, everything was English. When YouTube became popular my English was fluent and somehow I picked up a British accent.

Now my Dutch is getting bad. My grammar is sometimes messed up. Vocabulary is confusing. Though I’m going to get through my Dutch exams easily, speaking on the spot is still difficult for me when it isn’t about something I like to talk about.

I’m going for a gap year in England next year, and after that I’ll be studying a game tech back in the Netherlands for 4 years. Which is also an English course. 

I’m really concerned my Dutch will eventually be so bad that I can’t have formal interactions with people from my home country. What can I do to fix this?",09May2018,1

I have an okay job that doesn't pay much but also doesn't make me want to jump off a cliff. I'm in a marriage that I would classify as average in the sense that both of us are happy enough without being either ecstatic or deeply distressed. We've been married two years and together for four, so we're pretty much past the honeymoon phase and into the ""this is normal everyday life"" phase.

I don't make much money but my husban is a nurse and does alright. I feel like he's accomplished a lot more in life than I have even though we have similar levels of education. My hobbies are mostly gaming, playing guitar, and studying foreign languages. I have few real life friends and typically don't socialize much. I'm pretty bored most days.

I'm not trying to just incessantly complain. I'm just sort of laying out what my life looks like. I feel like I suffer from a sense of directionlessness. Maybe it would be more specific to say that I suffer from an inability to pick a direction and commit to it- or even decide what seems interesting to me.

I really wish I had majored in nursing or computer science or something with a more distinct career path, but I didn't and now I'm where I am. I've accepted this, and I've finally started drawing up some plans for paying back my massive student loans (I've only been out of school for a year, so I haven't been avoiding my loans for long- but I really don't want to avoid them for much longer because interest is totally accruing.) So, other than paying off my student loans, I pretty much have no goal in life other than get into shape which it seems like I abandon about a week after I try every time.

For as long as I can remember, my dad has always been constantly berated/disrespected by my grandfather. He even goes as far as to talk smack about my dad (and sometimes even my mom) to me directly. Regardless of the topic of the conversation, he always ties it back to my dad’s inadequacy and how his unsuccessful career/life is a result of, plainly put, how much of a loser he is.
My dad came to the U.S. with his family when he was 17. At the time, he wasn’t allowed to attend high school because of his age; instead of letting him go to community college or attain some form of education in a new country, my grandparents had him work to support their family. And while I understand the need to provide for the family, their lack of concern for my dad’s future stood in stark contrast to how much they were invested in my uncle’s, who was fully supported by the entire family through undergrad and grad school. While my uncle had his education, my dad only had work, so he invested a lot of time into bettering his skills and pleasing my grandfather. 
Nothing was never enough, though. My mom told me about how my dad had essentially mastered roasted goose, how everyone aside from my grandfather praised it as some of the best in LA. There are countless stories about the way my grandfather treats my dad like a disappointment.

His intolerance has shaped my dad in many ways. He’s persistent and an over-achiever, but I can still see the little boy in him desperate for the approval of his dad. It breaks my heart to see my dad get shot down time after time by insults, humiliation, and indifference to his achievements. Yet he still relentlessly tries to please my grandfather. 

I hated my grandfather for a long time because of this and even considered standing up to him about it. But regardless, my grandparents are still a big part of my life, and especially my dad’s. I want to be able to nudge my grandfather toward a different direction without damaging our relationship, but am clueless on how to. Older generations of Asians can be incredibly stubborn and prideful, so trying to change their views/judge their actions is dangerous territory.

I just don’t want my dad to spend the remainder of his (or technically, my grandfather’s life) trying to gain the approval of someone who treats him so poorly. I am proud of the person he is and proud to call him my dad.

Whenever I have to communicate with him, I don’t and just tell my mother (who I love but is apathetic). He’s not evil or abusive, but a flawed man with a broken childhood. A trait that I dislike of his the most is his neuroticism. That is his defining trait in his personal life, and I just cannot stand it as it causes me stress.

I’m not too sure what sort of advice I’m searching for, but I suppose its advice regarding our relationship, which I honestly don’t even know if I want to mend, for our personalities are not compatible. “If there’s someone I know who I have no compatible conversation with, why should I force myself even if that were my father” - is my current attitude.

I've felt great this semester and more comfortable with myself. I have been in a semester long project, and there has been this girl in my group who hasn't showed up to any of the classes, which I'm assuming is because my professor doesn't take attendance. I met her once the entire semester. The project was to write a report, and she did her part for the report (because we wrote this report on a shared google doc, so she didn't have to show up to class). Our professor offered extra points for revisions, but he announced this in class so she wasn't there. My group and I in class, without her there, completed the revisions together. I did not want her taking credit for her work so I removed her name off of the revised edition. Then, my professor made an online announcement the night before our revisions were due, to which she became aware and then went on the document, saw her name was removed, added it, and physically turned it into the professor before I was able to. Me, noticing this, approached the professor at the end of class and told him what she had done, and how she hadn't been present at any of his classes, so her earning extra points for our effort was undeserved. Under normal circumstances I probably would have let this go, but I'm trying to make an effort to speak up for things that are worth speaking up for. Anyways, I guess he emailed her, and she came at me with a bunch of passive aggressive texts and accused me of being a child because I didn't contact her directly about not showing up to class. My rebuttal to this is that I am in one of her other classes, and she shows up to this one and my assumption is it's because my professor takes attendance. Anyways, she just went on calling me names and accusing me of being a shitty person basically, and I am starting to believe it. Should I have texted her about not showing up to class?

My Dad got out of jail last year after being in and out of there since I was 14-15ish (I’m 24 now). My Dad and I have always had a good relationship: I always sent him money in jail, wrote him letters, and sent updated pictures of our family (my mom wouldn’t and she was just tired of my Dad). When he got out, I paid his fair home to a small town to be closer to us (me and my 5 siblings).

He ended up moving home to his village where he grew up and dated my “Aunt,” which is his own brother’s ex-wife. My uncle and “aunt” got divorced 3-5 years ago. He got her pregnant when our relationship was just kindling again. 

Then they got instantly married and my “Aunt,” just turned into my step-mom. They just had my half-sibling in mid-March.

157,"Okay.  So, let’s say my friend in South Korea has a classmate who was raped.

She went to the clinic, they identified she was, and the university there is in the process of barring them from campus.

My best thought process to destroy said persons rep (they are studying abroad from US) is to create an anonymous Facebook account and inform their mother.  

I can’t really think of any non-slanderous way to otherwise absolutely shred someone’s life than to tell the person that raised them about what they did.

Is this an okay idea, do you guys have a better idea?  I don’t want them to be able to just go back home and act like nothing happened in the event they aren’t, and probably won’t be prosecuted in the current country.

Background;
1. Had a miscarriage at 10weeks 1month ago with high hCG before my D&amp;C 

2. 2weeks after my D&amp;C I had unprotected sex

3. 1 week after unprotected sex I feel pregnant again

4. 1week after, I took pregnancy test and its positive but the Dr said its because I still have high hCG from previous miscarriage. So I started eating fruits high in Vit C and exercise to induce my period, then one day I had a very sharp cramps that I coudnt move it last for like 20mins.

5. At exactly 1 month after D&amp;C I got my period now for 7days already

6. I still feel pregnant due to my nipple sensitivity

7. Can anyone please tell me that I'm just crazy? Overthinking. I started taking my pills on the first day of my period that's why I'm worried if I'm pregnant. 

8. The Dr is still monitoring my hCG as it still hasn't dropped into 0 yet, but it is close to 0, she said it should dropped now that I had my period. I'm so dumb that I didn't ask her this stupid question that I'm posting now. Please no mean comments.

The very first pet he got was a dog. He got a full time job and left me to care for her. I do not like dogs and never had but still took care of the animal. Baths, brushing, food, water, pets, walks. I did it all. He never got up early to walk her. He never made sure she had food and water. I was very upfront and told him i would take care of her while he worked but it's your dog and you need to step up. He wouldn't. My final straw was when she was kept in her cage for a few days only to be let out for bathroom and drinks because he was busy. I found her a new home and he agreed that he wasn't taking care of her.

Next he wanted fish. He set up an aquaponics system and got about 8 Tilapia. He did not take care of them. He thought his system was fool proof and did zero maintenance on it or the fish. The fish all died although he bought more and they all died too. 

Next he wanted chickens. He bought a chicken coop online, put the chickens in it and went to work. That was it. He rarely cleaned their cage, he rarely got the fresh eggs. Eggs would be in their for days, which is bad for chicken keeping. He would frequently leave their cage unlocked and 4 of them got eaten by predators over the coarse of a few months. I finally convinced him to get rid of them

He recently got bunnies. And im fucking livid. He built a make shift cage. Stuck it outside and called it a day. The bunnies to do have access to grass and are standing on a wire the whole day. The wire is important though because their poop falls through but bunnies are suppose to have an indoor home to go into to feel safe and where you csn lock them in. All he did was turn a tote on it's side and call it a day. He put somr shavings in their and said that it only needs to be changed every few days. The bedding was disgusting and i forced him to change it yesterday. It poured all night. I wake up to find out he never put the tote back in their and the bunnies had no protection from the rain all night. They are completely out in the open. Yesterday their cage was in direct sunlight and their water was warm. I made him move the cage but he just wont take me seriously. I do not know what to do. I refuse to let these bunnies suffer.

Hi there, I don't know if this post is relevant to the sub, but i need your opinion. I am thinking to start a service to help people who are trying to attract things to their life and reach their big dreams. I will explain more. 
Someone using the law of attraction to attract something, say a beautiful marriage, he/she can tell me the final mental image they are using as visualization of their goal such as they and their partner standing, he in the wedding suit and she is in her wedding dress smiling or hugging or whatever they imagine. Then I draw this image on computer as a vector art using adobe illustrator. I can make a graphic poster, or portrait, or whatever needed to help them visualize their goal everyday. They can print it out, or make it a background for their PC or smart phone. Then they can reach their goal much faster while they see their image after reaching their goal. 
So, it will be like that: 

1- People send me their photo, their dream, and how they imagine things after reaching their dream. They give me all the details they want to include in the final image. 

2- I make a graphic design that includes all the details they gave to me.

3- after I complete it, I will send it to them, so they tell me if they want to change anything, then I keep modifying it and send it to them until they are satisfied.

4- they put it around them all the time to see themselves after achieving their goal, so they can attract it faster and easier.

201,"A friend and I moved in with a professor for the summer so I could have free lodging while working. She has a cat already (Maine coon) and my friend brought hers as well (mutt). I’m not super fond of cats but I’ve lived with them my whole life and never had issues. My friend is out of town until the end of May but her cat is still here. Both of these cats are extremely aggressive toward me for no reason and I have no idea what to do. 

My solution so far has been to try to ignore them. I’ve tried averting my gaze, walking slowly, just not petting them or anything, and they still attack me. They come out of nowhere and bite and claw and hiss at me. I have multiple scratches (one on my chest that’s pretty deep) and they’re scratching up the things in my room too. I don’t know how to approach this. I don’t really think the professor is going to be willing to lock up her cat whenever I’m home. 

You guys, I’m scared to walk anywhere in this house because these cats are so mean to me. I realize this sounds pathetic but I’ve never dealt with such aggressive animals before. I’m overwhelmed at work and i can’t relax at home. What can I do to help my situation? 

TL;DR: Roommate’s extremely aggressive cats claw, bite, and his at me virtually every time I take a step. How do I get them to stop hating me?",09May2018,0

204,"We share a friend circle so going no contact hasn't been a solid option. I have removed him off social media and left group chats to keep my distance. 

We broke up 1 and a half years ago and I honestly thought by now I still wouldn't be dealing with these crappy feelings and emotions.
To make it clear - I do not want to be friends with him, I want to just be cordial. If I stayed friends with him it wouldn't be healthy for me at this point in my life.

I don't know what to do about the way he goes about our interactions (all of which are in groups). He flip flops constantly between happy to chat and say hi to the next time not making eye contact and not engaging in conversations i'm in. 
I'm tired of the emotion toll it's taking on me. I'm afraid to talk to him about it because I have a feeling he will say it's all in my head. He makes me anxious... but then add this to it makes it even more draining.

The most recent example was 2 weeks ago. Few of my friends went to a pub, I met up with them after I finished work - I didn't realise he would be there and there was only 6 of us in total, only seat was next to him. So, I sit.. we talk for a while and catch up - it's all fine, we're laughing. Bring up that he removed me on a random game to tease him ... that eventuates to him asking about Facebook, why i removed him and he asked ""Why don't you add me again?"" I didn't think before i blurted out ""Because I don't want to"" - I admit, i could've put it more elegantly. 
Anyway. I explain why not (not healthy for me), he acts strange shuts down the conversation. 
We go to change venues and he leaves. He literally walks around hugs everyone good bye and doesn't even look at me... even though I yelled out (Loudly) ""GOODBYE!"" but nothing. 


I'm tired of nothing being consistent between us. If it weren't for my friends I honestly would leave it be, but i can't.

I'm 21, I want to have a family one day and I just don't want to bring them into a country where sharia law could be a viable possibility.

The refugee crisis still hasn't ended and hundreds of thousands of muslims are moving to europe legally, so it's definitely not going to get any better.

I've though of a few countries to possibly move too. USA, I know they're going through problems, but all this is just an idea at the moment.

If I did move to the USA, trump will most likely be gone by then. I would consider Canada but they're also letting in too many muslims. So no.

I think Australlia or New Zealand would also be good choices.

The point of this thread is to gather how hard it is to move to countries like the US. How difficult is it? The process and everything. It's just a fantasy at the moment, but I am seriously thinking about it.

Any advice would be appreciated.

210,"Greetings fellow redditors. Hope you're all well.

So I'm an 18 year old Indian guy. I've never had a girlfriend (too busy with academics and sports in high school) and I'm still a virgin (waiting for the right person). When I started university this year, I was introduced to the idea of casual sex, where you have sex with a stranger or just a friend. It's not something I would ever consider doing because I want to share that type of intimacy with a girlfriend/wife. Before any of you say ""You've never had sex, you can't say that!"", please don't try to convince me to have casual sex. I will do no such thing because it goes against who I am and my values (personal, not religious). Nothing wrong with casual sex, it's just not something I will ever do.

One night, I came out of my bedroom high (I've stopped smoking marijuana for good now). I went into the kitchen of our suite for a glass of water. My three roommates and two girls were sitting in the living room of the suite. When they saw me, they started pressuring me to have sex with one of the girls. I politely declined as I wasn't physically or emotionally attracted to the girl and had no interest in her. They all started saying things like ""A beautiful girl wants to have sex with you, you should just do it."", ""Don't be a pussy, just do it"" and ""Do it! It's now or never!"". I kept declining saying I was intoxicated on weed and couldn't consent (Canadian law). They blew it off and kept trying to sway me. The girl was trying to open my bedroom door and kept saying ""Let's do it"". Let me give some background on this girl. Throughout the year, she tried to kiss me, grind on me, and try to hookup with me (during parties), but I declined every single time (she would be very drunk).

Now back to the story. Eventually, they left me alone and I went back to my room. I felt kinda shitty. Like I wasn't good enough a virgin and that I wasn't cool enough to hang around. This all happened last night and I haven't really spoken to any of them since. What should I do? Do you think I did the right thing?",09May2018,293
211,"(im not english, my grammar may be bad)

The headline says everything. I have a little war inside me because of this: i dont want casual sex with girls but society wants me to have. Im 26 and few years ago i had a little bit of casual relationship (i played the badass guy) but...i didnt liked it. They were suck. Once i fell in love with her but she just wanted a last ride before a big relationship. Or we just wasnt compatible. Im said to myself, never again. 

But society frustrates me to have sex with everyone or date with anyone because im male and males should do this. Even my parents or friends (we are almost 30 we shoul have sex with chicks) I have not one friend who always has girls to ""hang around"" and this is frustrates me too. Im realized im rather a light hearted dude and i rather have sex with who i care for. I dont want to get married or kids but i want one girl. Nor consider myself as conservative but how society pushes sexuality in my face or that ""have sex with everyone"" feeling.

Im a hetero dude and yeah watch porn, or get turned on even just a touch or scent, hug of a girl but i want to feel those with a girlfriend not with someone who i just met. Im on dating sites and nobody wants a relationship. They are bored or just want sex. 

I turned down a girl who only searched for ""bulls"" to have fun with. Im feel quilty and frustrated. I feel im the bad one or im doing something wrong...

212,"I've been best friends with this girl (let's call her Tanya) for about 3 years. She has been dating a guy (call him Felix) for around 3 and a half years now. 2 of the last 3 years have been long distance. Over the last 2 years we've both been developing feelings for one another on and off since we really get along well and genuinely enjoy our time with each other, but it's been complicated obviously because she's in a relationship and I was in one too. This semester (our last together) things hit a boiling point and we acknowledged these feelings and ended up hooking up. So here's what's on my mind:

1) I don't know if I am just a comforting male presence in her life while her boyfriend is physically absent or whether it's really me that she's interested in. I'd like to believe this isn't the case because she's told me that she's felt jealous of other girls with me, and thinks of me when she hears some romantic songs. 

2) I think that even if she did break up with her boyfriend it would take her a long time to get over the relationship and be ready for a new one so that also required some kind of... Commitment I guess?

3) I really like her and would like to be with her, even if it means I have to wait for some time. I really think we'd be good together. 

4) She says that she still wants to be with Felix. She doesn't know what makes her want to make it work but she wants to keep at it. In my opinion if she really believed that, wouldn I really be in the picture? Am I just in the picture because of the fact that he isn't here? This one really scares me because we've been acknowledging our feelings for a while and honestly I'm quite invested in this (even though I know I shouldn't be), and knowing that I was only a distraction of sorts to her would really hurt. 

I guess I'm looking for advice about what to do in general... I feel that I want her to be happy. If she really wants to be with Felix I will make sure I'm out of the picture. But there's a part of me that also doesn't want to give up if she's not sure. A part of me that wants to be with her, but I fear this part of me is selfish and not looking out for her best interests. 

I'm not scared of getting hurt but I'm scared of regret.

213,"I have been working for a relatively small company for 9 months now and have really enjoyed my time here and have no intentions of leaving anytime soon. I’ve had my 3 month and 6 month reviews that both went well. During both reviews, I was told by the reviewer they would expect me to be promoted from Assistant Project Manager to Project Manager not long after 6 months. 

The president of my company had some health issues to deal with pretty much my whole time here so they haven’t been too involved in what’s happening with the company. Within the last month, they are just getting back into working again. Since the decision is ultimately theirs to make on if/when I get promoted and a raise, I understand the delay. 

I have really been struggling financially lately and have almost drained my entire savings just trying to get by. I was really hoping to be promoted by now along with receiving a slight raise.

216,"I'm not sure where should I even start. Alright, I have a elder sister and she's 26 this year. My sister has been staying at home for years now, suffering from anxiety issues and hallucination. She tend to have the idea that the whole world is against her, that someone is out there to physically assault her, and she have the habit of constantly repeating what she said again and again. As much as I wish to communicate with her nicely, it's really tough. Our conversation often lead to arguments as she'll go around the topic of how she wanted my parents to get a new flat because she thinks that our neighbours are stalking and disturbing her. However, the fact is that we're broke. My parents are old too, and there is no way we can fork out a large sum of money just to please her request of moving to a new flat.

She's afraid of any and every form of human interaction. Few years ago, I mustered my courage to called the mental hospital for help, and because of that my sister wanted to commit suicide. It was a tough decision for me. Thankfully, her suicide attempt failed and she got warded into the mental hospital, for a few days. Yes, just a few days because the hospital said that her condition is not serious enough. Thereafter, she stepped out of the house and went back to schooling, and back to the hospital every now and then for regular check\-ups and medication. Sadly, that only lasted a few months. She stopped taking her medication and I've spoke to her counsellor and doctor, they couldn't help me due to what they deemed ""regulations"". The patient have to be present in the hospital in order to collect her medication and I'm not allowed to collect it on behalf of her. Because of that, she stopped medication. 

It was really miserable. In addition to that, my parents are helpless too. My dad even told me to bring my sister along for the rest of my life \(yes even when i'm married next time\), and that I should always give in to her because of her condition. Few weeks ago, I caught her messaging a whole chain of text messages to herself, and when i question her about it, she said that the telco companies are checking our messages from their system and stalking us. I am really exhausted from hearing all these hallucination thoughts from her. Right now, my sister is suffering from hallucination every now and then, and she would stomp her feet on the ground or hammer the walls during odd timing when everyone is asleep. Being a light sleeper I'm deeply affected by it, yet I have no idea on what I should do. Approaching the mental hospital will not be helpful as the same thing will happen again, they will tell me that she's not serious enough to be warded. On the other hand, I am really worried for her future as she's 26 yet she's not exposed to the outside world at all.

223,"I was in my room, and I heard shouting, some thudding and crying, at one point I heard her say 'get off me'. I wasn't sure what to do, so I was getting my shoes on to go down when I got a text from my other housemate asking if I could hear what he was hearing (my room is above their room and his is below). I went to his room, and the noises continued, like bangs and shouting, so we decided to knock on their door in the hope that an external person would bring them out of whatever it was, and in case our housemate was hurt. 

We basically said that what was going on wasn't cool, and that it sounded pretty awful. She was crying, and they both sort of asked us to leave (as expected, but they were nice about it). So I left, and sent her a message afterwards that I knew she probably didn't want us to do that, but we couldn't sit there in the house hearing it and not do anything. I said that I didn't want to report it this time, but that I've heard this kind of thing a few times before, and if she needed anything she could talk to me even though we aren't close. 

After I sent that, I got a message from the boyfriend (who I have always gotten on well with) saying thank you for checking in on her and that he would never hurt her etc. I didn't respond because I didn't know how to say that I am also concerned about him and that he possibly has anger issues. I don't think he is a bad person, he just isn't acting in a great way when angry sometimes. 

After the message, she caught me and the other housemate as we were leaving and said thanks for checking etc, but she was fine, and he would never hurt her, she loves him more than anything, they were just throwing things, and that she didn't need us to check on her again. I said it did sound like she was being hurt as she said 'get off me', which she denied saying. I didn't push it any further because she'd obviously been having a rough day, and it's hard enough worrying about your boyfriend, but also that your housemates might get your boyfriend into trouble over an argument you had. But to me it seemed like damage control but also like it wasn't just her words coming from her mouth.

BUT, both me and the other housemate are sure we heard what we heard. It was awful and I don't regret going in there - imagine if she really was hurt and we had done nothing. We live in the house too, and behaviour like that isn't acceptable - even if they were just throwing things, they still have things they need to sort out (but, I just can't see her throwing things, she really doesn't seem like that type of person). Also, her justification is obviously something I don't believe, I've heard them argue before, I've heard noises like that before, and I've heard him yelling awful things at her. Obviously there are two sides to every story, and she probably has pissed him off, but there's no excuse for things to go to that level.

We are not close to her or her boyfriend as they spend a majority of their time together. Any time I have asked her to hang out, she always says she'll check with her boyfriend what he's doing, or that they're supposed to be eating together- basically they are together 24/7 apart from when they're at work, and they spend all that time in her room, so we barely see them. We now feel incredibly comfortable being in the house with them both, it's not that I don't feel safe, it's just I don't know what to do about the situation.

The third housemate doesn't know about the situation since she wasn't there, and I'm not sure if I should tell her in case she hears anything serious? There's the risk that she may make things worse as she is a feminist and has very strong views on things like this. 
Should the other housemates and I ask him to leave (because she won't, he basically lives here)? Do we have any right to do that? I know she doesn't want us to intervene at all, but I don't think I could let it slide if it were to happen again. If it did happen again, would I be wrong to call the police? I don't want to cause them trouble, but I also couldn't live with myself if something really bad was going on and I'd just allowed it to happen under my roof.

tl;dr Heard my housemate's bf get physical in some way with her, confronted them, both denied that anything even happened (even though we're pretty sure it did as two of us heard it) and now we feel uncomfortable with them in the house. Please give me some advice I don't know if I've done the right thing or what I should do if it happens again.

225,"This might be kind of long but I guess I just need to get it off my chest 

I’m a recent college graduate (just graduated last week). Currently I work as a delivery driver and am searching for another job (obviously). I’m somewhat behind on all my bills though because with the stress of keeping up with school, work, etc, I’ve fallen a bit behind on the past couple months. My sister is graduating college this weekend, and though we aren’t an extremely close family, maybe see each other 2-3 times a year, she’s asked us all to come to the ceremony. I had originally agreed and said I would, but I’ve started to have second thoughts and I’m torn between doing what I want and feel is right for myself, and feeling guilty if I don’t go and knowing I’ll receive major backlash from everyone for not going. 

The ceremony is on Friday and Saturday and it is 600+ miles away from where I live. So I’d have to drive 10+ hours both ways in order to go. This is already going to cost 100+ dollars worth of gas money alone, and I would have to leave Thursday and return late late Sunday at best...which means missing 4-5 entire days of working...and being behind on everything already I just can’t afford that. There is also the problem of simply putting that many miles on my car in one weekend....my car tires are pretty much on their last leg as it is, and are going to have to be replaced pretty soon. Again, I’m a delivery driver so wasting precious gas/wear on my vehicle causes me stress, because if my car goes to shit then I’m entirely screwed because that’s what I use for income at the moment. 

My parents might offer to fly me out, maybe, but even then I’m still hesitant cause again I’d have to miss days of work....and tbh being a recent college graduate myself I just feel like there are so many things I need to get in order here and I just don’t want to travel 600+ miles right now when I’m trying to figure my life out. Idk, maybe I’m being selfish....but if I miss these days of work I’ll be even further behind and spend the rest of the summer miserable trying to catch up.

We had a physical relationship, but it wasn't based on that. When we shared inside jokes and laughed together, it felt like I was laughing with my best friend. 

We also went through some serious real-life shit together that made the bond pretty deep.

So, life has continued to go on. She's had plenty of boyfriends, I've had plenty of girlfriends. I've even deeply cared about new girlfriends. I would assume she's deeply cared about some of her new boyfriends.

We're 27 now. It's been 12 years since we met. She and I live in different area of the country now, but we still try to keep in touch from time to time. We're both on the same page. There's always gonna be a  deep bond between us -- but we have different lives now.

I'm not sad or depressed about her. I don't even think about her every day. But, if this makes sense, she's always there -- in the back of mind -- and she'll pop up in my thoughts out of the blue.

I feel like that bond and affection might be permanent.

Do you just ignore that ""soulmate"" feeling, or do you try to fight for it?",09May2018,0
228,"I am 25 years old. Recently my girlfriend of 1 year and I broke up. 
At first it was sort of like a mutual break up. I say ""sort of"" because even though we both agreed to it, I immediately regretted the decision. I tried to ask her to date again but she said no. 
After some time I found out that she had been talking to other men about a month before we broke up. I don't know if anything ever happened but the intention was there, I assume. Finding that out crushed me. 
Fast forward a month to now. I'm thinking that I wasn't good enough physically and/or emotionally. Maybe I didnt understand what she needed which drove her to seek out others.Maybe I was making her bored out of her mind. Maybe we just didnt connect and it took a year to find out. I dont know. 
All those thoughts rushing in and out of my brain now lead me to believe that i will not find another girl. If I'm a piece of shit big enough to make someone seek out other people then why would someone else want to be with me?  
Since the break up I have tried to come out of my shell and talk to people, specifically women. The women I do talk to seem very uninterested which is just adding on to the piled insecurities

I feel like a piece of shit for wanting to move on even the feelings arent mutual anymore...

Ive talked to people about how I approach women and they all reject me. Those people say that if they looked like I do they would have no problem picking up women. All I can think of is ""well how come Im having so much trouble with it?""

I guess that was more of a rant but I need advice on the situation and on how to start to change the mentality.

They came up to my room, I was playing video games at the time and I'm sure I forgot to ask for my keys back \(mistake #2\). We hang out for awhile and then they go home. I wake up this morning and can't find my keys anywhere in my apartment. I asked them if they happened to have accidentally taken them and they say they gave me them right when they came in and don't have them. So now I don't have any of my keys and will have to pay for locks to be replaced at all of these places, which will cost me well into the thousands of dollars range, if I can't find them.

Some possibilities of what happened..1. What the person says is true, and I misplaced them in my own apartment, where I set them in the same place every time.

2. When the person came in the door, they forgot the key in the door, and someone subsequently found them and took them.

Growing up I've never been a big drinker. I'm in my twenties now and have the occasional social drink with my friends.

I just drink as feel like and at times have had 6-7 pints in a night.

At different points of the night I ask myself:

Am I aware of what's going on? Can I still process complex thoughts? Do I still affirm X judgment about Y idea issue or situation as I did before I'm started drinking? Etc

Basically asking questions and thinking through things to see how much of a grip of myself I have.

235,"Hi all
So I (16M) am in a relationship with a girl and I feel like she's manipulative. It all started off well but I started to pick up on things that seem not quite right, such as her going ""You're the only thing that's made me happy in 6 years"" and after she's all arsey with me because she doesn't know how to deal with her emotions, she goes ""You know I love you, right?"". 
It's getting hard for me to stay in the relationship because it's not making me happy, but I don't wanna make her unhappy or depressed, or worse, by ending it with her if I really am ""The only thing that makes her happy"". 
But I don't know how to end it, so I have two questions:
1) Is it manipulative?
2) Which way would be best to end it? 

I'm not sure I could bare to see or hear her cry but I feel like text is too insensitive. Any advice would be helpful.

238,"So I am 17, next year 18 (yay), I currently live in Europe and have double nationality, so I'm half american. My family is fluent in english, my dad is a veteran and an english teacher and my mom was an English teacher and now.. I never really understood.

When I had the short age of 10 years, me and dad were talking about US. I never believed the cartoons where the school or life in general was amazing there, but from how dad talked to me about it, I suddenly felt that the country where I live is not my place.
I don't belong here, but there, in the USA.
I saw news, read articles on USA but I still feel that I belong there.

I want to attend college in America, an art college. I'm in my third year of high school and specializing myself in art. 

I would like to work for an animation company/concept designer for a videogame company/comics creator. Where I live it'll take lots and lots of years for success. And I want to succed.

But to achieve all of this, I must move there. Me and dad would love to go, but mom has lost the interest, because of our money problem mostly, plus we have 5 cats and 2 dogs.

I could go there alone since I have family there, but I suffer from anxiety and an eating disorder, so it would make things more difficult, and I would prefer to be with people I know and trust.

I am ready to give up everything here, even because I don't have much. But I am tired of crying because I don't feel at ease in my country. As soon as I finish high school (2 years) I want to organize with my family the journey to our new life. No one's happy here. Not even my mom whom is european, but won't admit it.

So please, tell me how I can make all this happen. If it all goes awesome, with and family and my pets, a friend who is very important to me might come with us. How do I help my mom accept all this? How do I help my family with money? How much does the flight for 3/4 people cost + 7 animals, with some furniture? And a house? Possibly not a flat, but an estate (?) In AZ or a country where the temperature is warm. Please send me links or tutorials on art so that I can sell my artworks.

I'm the only person in my class failing French 001 and Psychological Stats. I'm already 23 years old, and unfortunately deciding that my Psychology degree is not what is making me happy. I'm going to finish it \(I only have another class\) but don't know where to go from here. 

1. I graduate with my Psych \+ Creative Writing degree, take a brief break and find a job, and then go on to art school like I always wanted.
2. Finish my Psych degree and stay a little longer to complete a Radio Production degree \(something I love since getting involved with the campus radio station, and I'm kicking myself for not discovering it sooner\). Then, while holding a job at a Radio Station and creating a podcast, go back to art school.
3. Finish my Psych degree, go on for a Master's in Mental Health counselling, grit my teeth and abandon my lifelong art school dream, and become a therapist like originally planned with the hopes I will love it as I go on.
4. \(Not sure how to go about this as an option, but if anyone knows please let me know!!!!\) Get my teaching certification along with Psychology and work as a teacher; do radio as a hobby on the side; \(HOPEFULLY\) go back to art school.

Please forgive me if these all seem like stupid questions \- I have ADHD and I am a very distracted person. I am aware that possible learning disabilities might be holding me back in an ""actual"" college; I am on the waiting list to be tested, but unfortunately probably around September or so.

242,"so basically, during the earlier part of my life, my brother and i were extremely close because we had to go through our parents divorce, so we were basically best friends. but obviously we started growing and both started drifting away and keeping boundaries. we’re only 2 years apart, but i’m the older sister so i’d assume he sort of looks up to me in a younger sibling sort of way. the last couple years i had gone through some bad depressive episodes and treated my mom and him pretty horribly(we live with my mom). i was aggressive (never physically, but i got mad a lot) sassy, and i isolated myself a lot. before my brother got into highschool he was a super sweet and caring boy, and he worried for me a lot. when i started taking medication, he was scared i was going to do something to myself and he one time started crying. i’ve gotten better and i’m stable now, but now that i’ve gotten the help that i need, he seems to be falling into a pit of something that i can’t understand. he’s gotten very aggressive and angry, if my mom or i says something wrong he gets annoyed and raises his voice a lot, and the other day, we got into an incident where (my mother wasn’t home) he got so mad at me for not instantly doing a favor for him that he started screaming and punching the walls telling me how much he hates me and how i’ve been a terrible sister for all these years. (he sprained his hand too) he later apologized saying he just doesn’t like talking about it, and that he’s fine. my mother and i both know that he’s not okay and can see the signs of him spiraling out of control. i’ve been dealing with mental illness since i was young (my dad is bipolar, and my mom suffers from panic attacks) and i don’t want him to end up hurting himself or someone else. he refuses therapy because he doesn’t “like talking about it” and refuses to try medication because he said he doesn’t need it. i asked my dad to talk to him considering he would understand better than my mom and i, but they don’t have the best relationship because he’s a mommas boy and i was a daddy’s girl. they don’t hate each other but they don’t go on dad and son fishing trips ya’know? he ended up telling my mom one time after crying and getting into a fight that he feels like everyone hates him and that he hates himself, and it completely broke my heart. i can’t remember the last time i hugged him or told him i loved him, but i want him so badly to know that i do. is it worth trying to restore my relationship with him or give him space while he goes through whatever he’s dealing with? should my mom keep trying to get him to go to therapy even though he doesn’t like it? also are there any healthy ways that he could release the anger he has instead of screaming and punching the wall? thanks for the advice in advance....",09May2018,1

I am not sure where to go in life. I currently work 48 hours a week at 11 an hour. I make roughly 350-450 depending if I take the extra weekend day of ot. I live with my dad's family who very much so wants me to go back to school. The living conditions aren't the best, we live (all 5 of us) in a small originally one bedroom house. We cut the living room in half and made on bedroom for my sister, my parents get the real bedroom and me and my half brother get the upstairs attic. There is nowhere near enough room for us and we don't even have room for clothes upstairs. I currently do not have a car either sadly. I want to move out but I don't know if that's financially possible. I've lived in tight situations before and can keep money set aside for those occasions. All I need really is just Internet. I want to rent a house that I can live on either just me or even a roommate. The biggest problem is that if I do that I don't know where to go next in life. Work at the factory doing the same job till I die? It sounds awful. Going to college doesn't sound any better to be honest. The problem isn't that I don't know what to do its that I'm not sure what jobs are even out there that college gives me the oppertunity to experience. I love travel but know it's not possible to make a living off of YouTube and Patreon any more so I think I'll give up on that one. I don't even know if I'll have money for college next semester. I just don't know where to go and if moving out is right.

I know all this and yet I still feel a lack of motivation and unwillingness to respond. I always say next time for sure but can't break these old habits. I am stuck in a perpetual downfall of my own mind. 

I want to fix this and succeed in life and accomplish goals. I, however, continue to lie to myself and others about the situation I am in.

I'm young. In early 20s but I feel like all the pressure of debt and trying to succeed is putting me down and I seek forms of entertainment to distract myself from reality which is the main reason I am stuck in this mess to begin with.

-How do I begin to change my mindset and grow confidence in myself? 

-How can I grab hold of myself and shake me out of this awful mental state? 

-How do I grow up and start to take responsibility over my mistakes and begin to improve my current situation? 

-How do I deal with this pressure I am feeling and use it to motivate myself instead? 

-How do become a person who says I will start now instead of tomorrow?

267,"Bit of a teenage whiny one:

So when I was about 11 or 12 I had a crush on my best friend, and she liked me back. She tried to ask me out, but being 12 I freaked out and said something like ""I don't want a girlfriend"".  Later on we would occasionally go see films together, and I would always kinda act a bit monotone, and give short responses because I was scared of being seen in public with a girl. That continued until I was about 14.

I feel like a complete piece of shit for leading her on like that, and even worse when I think about how long it took me to realize what I was doing was even remotely bad. I haven't told her yet but I really do feel guilty for what I have done.

I'm 16 now, and have never had a girlfriend whilst she's happily with her (3rd?) boyfriend. I wanna just tell her I'm sorry but she goes to a different school now, and I don't wanna make things really awkward, or evoke any feelings in her that she wouldn't like. Maybe she hasn't realized what I did, and might hate me once I point it out? Basically I know what I did was wrong but I'm to scared to apologize.

Please could you guys help me out, even if she's moved past this I sure haven't. Feel free to call me out on anything, and I know I've mentioned myself a lot more than her. I'm trying to become less selfish like that.

270,"Hi there,  


Recently I had a flashback sorta deal from when I was deeply depressed,  
And right now I feel like I am right there again, with the same kind of motivational level to do my daily things.

I go to a University of Applied Sciences, where I'm in my first year of Biologic and Medical Sciences.  
Because of my fallback I have fallen severely behind in my schoolwork, and I don't think I'll be able to make this year, which means I'll have to quit school and look for a different course.  

The thing is, for me, that this is my second course I've followed and I really do not want to drop out *again*...  
I had a brief conversation with my mother a couple of days ago, and she always thought of me as the more creative one at home.  
Even though I do really like to draw, cook, etc., I also really like the course I'm taking right now.

So now I feel like I'm at this crossroad, because on one hand I want to continue my course, and not let anyone down on their expectations of me,  
But on the other hand I feel like I'm stuck, and I don't know what I want to do anymore.

I'm new to asking this sort of things on the internet, so bear with me. A few years ago I used to have a lot of friends I used to hang out with everyday and these friends all liked me as well \(you could say I always was a heart of the party\). Then some things have happened and being short, I'm not friends with any of them anymore. With some I just lost contact when they moved out, some now found new friends after they graduated from college etc \(what I wanna say is there was no conflict or a bad situation between us, our communications just kinda stopped at some point\).

So now I kinda miss being around people and I've been trying to make new friends, but while I really want to have fun times with people I also at the same time don't feel like doing it. I feel like there's no point in it, I don't know what I'm gonna do with them if I befriend someone, I feel like I lost interest to any group activities. But then again I do want to socialise, especially when I watch YouTube and there are groups of friends I feel like I wanna be a part of something like that too.

I have my own mental health issues I'm working on and I feel like I need time away from working to take care of myself, but of course no one wants me to quit if work loves me and I have nothing lined up right now. 

They have been very kind to me in working with me and my problems and I'm going to therapy once a week and trying to be good about taking my meds regularly. It's gotten to the point that sometimes I hope they let me go so I can try for unemployment and just start over but I don't want to burn any bridges. 

I just moved to a new place where the rent is a little higher so I have the money for a few months of rent at least but I'd rather not use what I've saved up for this. My mom quit her job last month and that doesn't help me at all; it just makes me want to quit even more. 

Sometimes I'm not sure I can even get through two weeks if I give my two week notice but I know if I quit on the spot I won't be eligible for rehire and I don't want that to come back to bite me in the ass. 

I go into work in just under an hour and a half and I seriously want to call off because I'm having a lot of stomach problems today, but I had to miss work two Wednesdays ago and I've had to miss for stomach problems a lot. So I'm worried one more time and they'll talk to me and as much as I do want to be let go, I don't. 

My friends and family are anywhere from ""you need to work to pay rent and that's life"" to ""you need to take care of yourself and your happiness"". I'm just so lost. Any help is appreciated.

281,"TL;DR - I've been made redundant and am now unsure of what to do with my life. Feel like I'm in a downward spiral and need some help. 

I'm 23 and I've been working in social media for music for three years now, two of which I've spent at a fantastic company.

Recently, they told me they needed to shift me to another area of the business (basically just admin, not something I personally enjoy) and after having a hard time with it for a few months they've told me there's no role left for me here, and so I'm leaving at the end of May and being paid until the end of June. 

They've handled this beautifully, I've never been treated so well in the workplace before - however I'm a quiet and creative person, a musician myself on the side seeing some level of success from the music I release, so my future looks uncertain. We're talking hundreds of thousands of streams on my tracks, so I guess there must be something there?

What I'm struggling with the most is the thought of working in an office again. At 23 I want to feel as though I'm making headway in an area that I'm going to spend my life working in, but the potential move into another 9-5 position is causing me a lot of problems - for the past couple of weeks I've been going to bed crying and waking up even more upset, and I'm not usually a cryer! 

It's been really difficult to motivate myself to do anything. Usually I can deal with this shit and be quite resilient but the situation seems to have broken me a bit. Here are what my options are after speaking to a few people...

1. Find a new job and continue going in a direction that I don't feel is right for me, and that could make me more miserable, with little free time for music
2. Go freelance doing Audience Development for signed artists and have more free time for music, and suck up the fact that I'll probably have to leave my London flat to get this started (bearing in mind that I'm still not sure my skills are good enough to make a living from this)
3. Sack it all off, go and live back with my family, work part-time in a shop/cafe or something and give up everything to make my music career a proper thing

As you can tell from above, my life pretty much revolves around music and the unlikely event that I'll make a career of it! 

With parents who are actors and dancers, I feel a lot of pressure to do my own thing and be great at it, the main problem at the moment being that I have really low self-esteem and am finding it difficult to envision myself doing anything with my life.

I'm very much in a downward spiral and am prone to depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts - as ridiculous and melodramatic as it seems (especially compared to some of the desperately upsetting situations my fellow Redditors are in within this sub) I need to make some kind of moves soon.

Always feeling like I'm not good enough is affecting all areas of my life, and I want to get out of this self-pitying zone but I just have no idea how to. I'm totally stuck. 

Any advice you can give is more than welcome, and if you'd like any further context I'm happy to explain more.

284,"It all started 4 and a half years ago, our team hired this new coach for the fall. He seemed like a nice guy at first, but I guess no one did a background check on him. Practices were pretty normal for the first 3 months, his practices were just extremely difficult for our age. When the winter came around he got really weird. He would tell us stuff like, ""If I put a gun to your head and told you to go faster, would you?"" or ""Swim butterfly like your humping, you know like dogs hump?"" Keep In mind, most of us were 11 and under. My worst memory of him is when I was having an off day and a younger girl beat me, he went bat\-shit crazy and made me do a 1000 fly.

When summer came, he couldn't coach due to his work being in the morning. He started a new team because, ""I don't want any other coach coaching my kids."" The team is made up entirely of stolen swimmers from our team. He basically goes up to the parent and says he can make their children Olympians if they join. At the moment his team only has 5\-6 consistent swimmers, one of them is very fast, one of them is pretty good, and the the rest are pretty below average. We thought it would end there and we wouldn't have to deal with them any more, but obviously they stuck a cock wrench in those plans.

   Two months ago their team got a notice that they would be kicked out of the pool. \(They swam at a different pool out of our city limits.\) I was pretty happy because they would slander us in the newspaper and the aforementioned ""stolen swimmer thing"", but alas they are now trying to shut down our team and take over the pool.  They just managed to rewrite our pool contract today and now get 2 lanes of pool space the SAME TIME we practice. There is a perfectly fine pool in a town 15 miles away that is unoccupied. On top of that, our head coach has always been the high school coach as well. He is moving to Oregon in about a month, which leaves the high school coaching position open. Both, our new head coach and the other team's coach has applied for it. It should be a no\-brainer due to the other coaches criminal records but it sounds like he might get the job anyway. The high school coach controls the pool usage for the fall, so if he gets the job he will undoubtedly kick our team out. 

   As things are, the future of our team looks pretty bleak and I will be out of swim. Swimming has always been very important to me and is the only reason I have friends.

I haven't been on Reddit in a while but I'm scared so I thought this would be the best place to solve this problem! 

A few days ago I got a random Facebook request from a man from the Middle East who obviously didn't speak any english. This is very unusual for me as I don't use Facebook often- my profile has pretty much the highest security settings you can as it's only for my family and very close personal friends. I declined the request and thought nothing of it. A few days later I went to check my security settings and realised I had ""Find me via my phone number"" was turned on. Of course only my friends, family and business contacts have my number so I turned it off, thinking it wasn't related to the random request. 

Two days later, I got an iMessage from a mobile number in Libya saying I was a very pretty lady and should send pictures in broken english. This obviously unsettled me as I've never given my phone number out online. I demanded he explain where he got my phone number but he wouldn't tell me. I blocked him and moved on.

The next day (today) I got a WhatsApp from a number in Uzbekistan saying in Uzbek that I was a beautiful lady, what was my name, that he was an ""english man in hot summer of Uzbekistan"". This really scared me because not only was it the third time this has happened but he KNEW I was in England.

The only explanation I can find for any of this is that someone who knows my phone number has posted it somewhere online or something. I googled my own phone number but found nothing.

My once best friend has been in a relationship for a year now and I have had a crush on her for a year. I hate her boyfriend even though I never met him. Their relationship really messed with my depression and self esteem. I have cried myself to sleep, self harmed, and made a habit of getting drunk every now and then. She knows I have feelings for her. I asked her to avoid talking about him to me because it messed up my mental health. His name physically makes me sick and I feel like throwing up whenever she mentions him or her relationship ( I don’t know why. ) these past few months have been really hard on our friendship because she works, goes to school, and spends time with him. It seems like she never haves time for me. We argue occasionally and I really want to fix this but she’s always busy and we almost never have time to talk about this or resolved the problems. Anyways, we argued today. I think our friendship might end which was bound to happen for a long while now.

290,"My friend (F 24) is in a 3 year long relationship with someone (M 25). The relationship has had its ups and downs, I’ll put it simply, most of the downs have been his fault - talking to other girls, sending explicit messages to other girls and often alternating between being interested in her to not even showing an ounce of care. 

Now naturally, anyone would just tell my friend to just leave the relationship and the general opinion of me and all my friends is that the relationship is toxic and needs to end. Unfortunately, my friend is “in love” and cannot possibly see her life without him, she has zero self esteem and thinks the worst of herself and assumes she’d never find anyone better. 

In the last couple of weeks he’s gone back to his “acting off” phase, he’s barely speaking to her and is spending his free time with friends (sometimes only girls). This upsets my friend and it gets to the point she just spends her nights stalking his social media in the hope he posts something. It’s sad to watch but no matter what advice we give she doesn’t care or listen. Another point to add is that he’s told her multiple times that he doesn’t see a future with her. 

However, as always, eventually he goes back to the nice, loving boyfriend and things seem normal and no problems occur until the phase switches again.

They’re extremely close, almost like brothers, and they both study together at uni, share the same accommodation and never go a single day without seeing or talking to each other. But something has gone wrong. 

From what Aidan has told me, everything was fine, then one day, as he’s walking over to his Accommodation, Zac just walks past him and doesn’t even acknowledge his presence. When Aidan spoke to him, Zac just continued walking away and ignored him. He’s tried everything he can to talk to him, but Zac just doesn’t seem to want to talk to him, to the point that he’s gone and stayed with some of his other friends in the same accommodation complex. Aidan doesn’t have family here, and neither does Zac. They’re both alone here and they heavily relied on each other for almost everything. They even introduce each other as “yeah he’s my brother”. That’s how tight they are. 

I’ve tried telling Aidan that he should meet up with him and try to talk to him. He’s tried talking to him at uni, at the accommodation and even at the local Starbucks when he runs into him there. It got to the point that he messaged an called him a lot and Zac has now blocked him. Aidan mentioned that he had a small altercation with this one dude at the uni who was part of their social group, and that this dude was friends with Zac too. He thinks this guy had something to do with the problems that have occurred between him and Zac. I can’t be too sure, as I’m not necessarily part of this social group. :/ 

Today, Aidan used my phone to text him and talk, but Zac was just coming out rude and Aidan is still trying. It’s gotten to the point that I don’t know what advice I could possibly give him. I said that someone who blocks you clearly wants nothing to do with you anymore. It’s possible that Zac might be going through something and he just wants to be alone, which is exactly what he told Aidan through text, but he’s been spotted chilling with other friends and going out and stuff. I just feel like Aidan deserves a reason as to why Zac is being like this. I sent a message to Zac just explaining that the situation between them is sad and hat he should try and talk to him, because whatever he’s facing, Aidan will always be there for him. That’s what brothers are for right? I just don’t think there’s much I can do now. I’m just wondering if you guys have any advice on what I can tell Aidan? He’s such a sweetheart. So kind and caring, and he’s done soooooo much for Zac. It’s literally unreal. But Aidan can also be a bit naive, and he can’t tell when someone is using him sometimes. But I strongly believe that his is not the case. They’ve been close for so long it would come as a shock to hear that Zac was only using him for his money. (Both Aidan and Zac are from the same country and Aidan does come from an extremely well known and high class family in his country)

Even in High School, where it's super easy to make friends, I had a hard time (I naturally look like an angry person. I've been trying to smile more to help with that...)

Can anyone help me out? Any tips or ideas or anything?",09May2018,1

My friend Meera (all names are fake) and I have known each other for years and years. We’re like sisters. But sometimes she does stuff that pisses me off. All friends have their ups and downs. But it’s like always with her. 

Over the years, there have been times where she’s planned to do something with me and when I cancel my plans to dedicate everything for her, she leaves me hanging. Sometimes she keeps me waiting for her for hours when she says she’s like 10 minutes away.. dude really? 

I’ve always just let it go, because I love her. She’s like my sister. We’ve both been through so many things that we couldn’t have gotten through without each other. But this was the last straw. 

She called me just as I was finishing work and said she was down town in the centre. I work in the centre and she was about 7 mins away from me in a different shopping centre and she said she wanted to meet. So I said cool. Let me finish my stuff here and I’ll meet her outside in 20 minutes. So I got done at work quite early and I was outside waiting for about 45 minutes when she called me and said she was on her way now. She didn’t turn up. So I was like hmm, let me go buy some makeup and kill time, which is when I ran into my other friend [24f] Blake who came along with me. We spent more than an hour looking around and trying stuff just killing time. I called her to ask where she was at and she said she was just waiting for her brother to drive up and collect her shopping so he could take it home for her. 

1 hour later.. I’m still waiting. So I went to this outside bar area and got a drink and chilled with my friend (who already had plans but was told to join us by meera, so  Blake cancelled her plans). Half an hour passes. It’s 8:45 and we’re still waiting to the point that Blake got pissed off and left. How embarrassing for me. Blake and Meera don’t know each other. They’ve only met once but liked each other’s company, which is why Blake decided to chill. But Meera didn’t even have the decency to call and say she was either running late or couldn’t make it. I was pissed off. But me being the naive person I am, I ended up waiting another hour or so. 

It’s now 10pm and I’m walking down to the car park to drive home. And who do I see? Meera. On the other side of the street, taking a casual walk and laughing along with this other girl. At this point, I was LIVID. I acted normal and just went over to my car, and drove home. This was one month ago. And yet she still keeps calling and messaging and trying to talk to me. I’ve had it up to here and I’m tired of being taken for granted, like my time is not valuable. 

This other mutual friend has reached out to me and tried to meet up with me, but I know if I turn up, I’ll be seeing Meera too. I just don’t think it’s worth it anymore.. or am I being too harsh? Should I hear her out? Fair enough if something happened and she needed to see someone or do something. I’d be cool with that. But only if she had sent me a text or called to say she couldn’t make it. I would have saved hourssssss doing something much ore productive that downing glasses of wine one after the other. 

What do you guys think? Am I acting out? Or was I right to ignore and just move on? 

Tl;dr? My close friend Meera (fake names) , almost like a sister [21F] stood me up for more than 4 hours and embarrassed me In front of my friend, Britt [24F] who cancelled her plans to chill with us because of pressure from Meera, but ended up leaving after waiting for more than 4 hours with me, and I [22F] have had enough of the things she does. Constantly standing me up and keeping me waiting when my time is valuable and I could do something more productive. She keeps calling and messaging, trying to talk to me through other people. Have I acted harsh in just ignoring her? Should I speak to her and hear her out? 
Any advice would be great .. thanks guys. ",09May2018,3

303," Tl;dr: currently with gf of 3 months who has significant past trauma and would like to know how to love and support her

I  \(23 M\) have been with my \(26 F\) partner for just a few short months. We  haven't known each other for very long but I love her as she is such a  wonderful person.

However, she recently  confided in me that she has a history of extensive childhood trauma  \(domestic violence, never towards her but she witnessed a lot of it\). I  won't go into detail as it is very personal but suffice it to say I was  absolutely shocked. She suffers from anxiety, depression and PTSD from  it. She has been in previous relationships but they haven't been very  supportive; her last ex \(whom she was with for over 5 years\) was  aggressive and abusive \(emotionally, she has not told me of any physical  abuse\).

Recently, she has become very  closed off from me. She said this was due to stress with work and other  things but it's affecting our relationship because she doesn't feel up  to talking or spending much time with me. I have decided to respect her  need for privacy and space but it's got to the point where we haven't  met or talked for a few weeks now, although we do stil text.

I  suppose in a way, I am concerned about the state of our relationship  but I am more concerned about her wellbeing. As I said, I love her very  much and I know she hasn't had a lot of experience in a loving  relationship plus she has all this trauma from her past. In essence, I'd  like to know how I can support her. Talking is out of the question at  this time because she's very closed off so we can't really communicate; I  know this isn't because she doesn't want to communicate, it's just that  she doesn't really know how.

My question  really is, what can I do to help her? I'm not looking to fix her but I  want her to be able to overcome all these issues. Does anyone have any  experience like this and can advise me on what you/your partner did to  make you feel loved and secure? I know I haven't known her for very long  but I love her more than anything and I want to do anything I can to  make her happy.

Thanks in advance!

305,"Dear Reddit,

I'm not the best in friendships and can therefore use your advice!
I have a friend with whom I got closer through the years. But because it all went so fast I got insecure. She didn't understand my behaviour and got angry. We've been working on our friendship since then but I now notice the highs and lows more. She has weeks in which she contacts me a lot, talks about how much she loves me constantly and wants to hang out with me all the time. Then suddenly there are periods, like the last few weeks in which she's distant, she answers long texts in a very short matter and it's always me who's starting the convo.

I have another good friendship in which months go by with me being the one that start most of the convo's but I don't mind because I know she's busy. And after those periods I know she'll make up for it.

So I guess I don't really know how to handle a friend who is very much in the friendship one month and then very distant the other. I never really know what to expect. I've tried to tell her but I feel like a burden whenever I mention it. I feel like she does her best but doesn't really get what I'm trying to say. Any thaughts?",09May2018,1

I am currently in a reception position and our office with around 10 different managers. All working their way up. Lets word it like.
A is my boss
B is her boss and is the client and is never around
C is her boss
And so on.
A has no back bone towards anyone and wont stand up to/ or stick up for us but makes no hesitancy in telling us how awesome she is (seriously we had a one to one meeting and she told us) thinks shes incredible for working an extra 30 mins. She puts us down. A lot. So much I stopped even mentioning what I did at the weekend when she asks to “nothing really, you?” She is so chummy with C. 
If C sees something wrong with us, she’ll comment on it like a compliment and then write an email to A to bring us down and usually ends in a bollocking. C is dirty, she’ll send an email to A about anything and everything wrong. Hair out of place? She’ll compliment you to your face then send an email.

This is just a slither of power play but I think i’ve reached my limit (with everything!) and leaving is not an option until the end of the year.

308,"I’ve been employed at one place, a somewhat large car service shop, for almost three years. 

I was hired on as a cashier and to handle basic customer service like answering the phone. In reality, I’ve handled a lot more managerial and office work than I should have. I’ve trained every employee (beside mechanics) that have been hired after me. I’ve been in charge of time sheets, inventory, and maintaining business accounts. I made an entire invoice templating system, remade the automated emails, and set up a unified calendar/accounting system across all of our locations. I’ve saved them from losing all of their customer information multiple times. Besides the owner, I’m the only person who actually knows how to use the full computer system, and there’s 4 locations worth of people. 

I know none of my coworkers do nearly as much as I do for the business. One of them tried to change an invoice template while I was on vacation and deleted some of the master files, and I got a slurry of texts all week since no one knew how to fix it. 

None of this would be a problem if a) the owner knew how to manage employees and responsibilities and b) I was compensated accordingly. If someone messes up, it my fault. If I make a much needed change, the owner acts as if she did all the work. I also apparently make less than a coworker who I trained and who has actively caused problems in the company. I’ve approached the owner a couple times about a raise (and gotten $0.25 extra an hour), but a competitor down the street is advertising starting at $2/hr more than I make now, and a place much closer to where I live has offered me $4-$5 more.

309,"Hi guys! Sorry this got suuuper long. Any advice about how to deal with bad/crazy neighbors welcome! TIA

My boyfriend [M26] and I [F22] recently moved to a new home in a slightly less nice but not terrible area in our state. We’ve been here since April 1st of this year, but since then our transition has been a little... off? 

My boyfriend (from now on “BF”) and I have never had bad neighbors before. Nosey and loud neighbors, but never “bad” ones. For some background information, the house we now live in is sectioned off into 4 units, and we live in the studio in the lower end of the house. The units consisted of BF and I, Landlord’s son and his girlfriend, family of 7; with five extremely rambunctious and unruly children, and then said family of 7’s cousin. I wonder if you guys can guess who we had the problem with.

It wasn’t the constant baby cries throughout the night (we’re night owls anyway), it wasn’t the constant stomping feet of *five* children ages 1 to 15 years old; or the crazy screaming father that was just muffled enough to be indistinct. ** *It was just the entire family.* ** At first it was coming home to finding the kids playing on our porch, or the older daughter sitting on our patio table watching YouTube videos, or the younger kids peaking through our windows and screaming in the early weekend mornings. Just a general invasion of privacy and space that we politely asked the kids not to do, but it of course continued. 

Then, not even 2 weeks into living at the new property, the Dad comes angrily knocking on our door and — I kid you not — threatens to kill my BF for putting a broken down cardboard box in the “trash” bin instead of the “recycling” bin because all four recycling bins were full. And since this is the Dad that screams, I can actually hear him from the porch as he screams *“I swear to god I’m going to go back to prison for this shit, I’m going to fucking kill you”* When my BF showed him all the recycling bins were packed to the brim, he stuttered and stormed off in anger. I took this threat seriously, so I decided to email the landlord when and what happened not only to let him know of the incident, but also for documentation. The next day I got a 20 second voicemail saying the Landlord spoke to the Angry Dad Tenant and he would apologize since he was “just having a bad day.” He of course didn’t apologize.

With the next incident, I had just come home from a long day out when I noticed that the $200 I had in my back up purse was missing. The BF was still at work, so after a brief text to him, I decided to look around and found that I had left one of the sliding glass doors unlocked. I felt guilty immediately thinking it may have been one of the tenants or kids that linger around our unit, but it was unlikely it could be anyone else as nothing else was damaged or taken. I ordered and installed an indoor security camera soon after as well as made sure all windows and doors were closed and locked whenever my BF or I went out. 

And finally the most recent incident; (Important note: my BF and I live in an area where it’s common to take your shoes off before going indoors) I had left a pair of expensive, but well worn, high end name flats with a large gold buckle/plaque-like thing with the brand name on it on the side entrance of the house, as usual. To get to this entrance you would need to walk past the main door and around the patio (which is supposed to be private). This entrance is slightly visible from the driveway/street as the house is more elevated, however it’s unlikely anyone would be able to see the shoes. On this particular day, the left shoe’s plaque had been ripped off entirely, with the bolts that held it together completely removed as well. The right side was loose, but not completely removed, as if someone gave up half way through trying to remove it. I looked around but didn’t see the buckle/plaque or bolts anywhere in sight. And if you’re thinking that maybe they had just come off with Long-time wear, I had coincidentally just washed and polished these shoes a couple days prior, and both buckled/plaques and their bolts were tightly fastened. While I figure it was probably one of the younger kids exploring and just being a kid, this is not the first time I’ve caught the kids playing in what is supposed to be our private area, and defacing someone else’s property is uncool to say the least. 

I haven’t spoken to the parents of the 5 kids or to the landlord about these last two incidents because to be honest, I don’t think the Landlord would care very much and the parents seem to be the type to be offended if you ever accuse their kids of doing anything. And I’m thinking of getting an outdoor security camera as soon as I can figure out how to hook it up (there are no outdoor outlets). The part that I need advice on is basically... what should I do? Is there anything that I can do besides making sure my doors are locked and possibly getting an outdoor security camera? Should I confront the scary upstairs neighbors? I know there are much, much worse neighbors but we’ve only been living here a little over a month and we’ve already been threatened murder by (I’m guessing felon?) crazy Dad of 5. 

If you have any other advice regarding this situation I welcome it. I know this got really long, so if you’ve gotten this far then thank you for reading! ",09May2018,0

I feel like i lack things like ambition, self-discipline and focus. Its difficult for me to focus myself and do something that i might not necessarily WANT to do, but need to do. I don't have the mental strength to undertake an endeavor like going to school, the gym, etc. And sticking with it, especially when it gets tough. I give up way too easily on things, and default to feeling bad about myself instead of pushing harder. 

I don't want to entirely blame my upbringing as ive lived a very comfortable life at home, but i feel like my father did a crap job at teaching me those things. He's incredibly lazy himself, and uses lazy mental manipulation to get people to do chores, and will guilt trip me if he has to do more than he was expecting (like ""oh you didn't have time to do X? Guess I have to do it now..."" As if it's the most horrible thing in the world). I feel like he didn't do a good job at preparing us to live independently and now I'm missing crucial life skills (2/3 of his children are depressed, reclusive, and harbor a shit load of resentment towards him, and he has NO idea how to interact with us without taking things personally, getting upset, and acting like a child).

How the fuck do i start learning things like self discipline and digging down in myself to pull put some ambition? I feel completely lost, unprepared and terrified to face my own life.

313,"Long story short, I have a long time close friend and former bandmate/roommate who consistently stands in his own way. He's very smart and capable, very talented artistically, and is good looking to boot. He had a shitty upbringing, which I guess could be used as an excuse, but not a very good one. He was taken away from his parents who were addicts and placed in the care of an uncle, who was very good to him. 

He's almost 30 and doesn't work and won't maintain steady employment. He still lives at home with his uncle and gets upset when his uncle effectively ""grounds him"" by taking away the car he lets him use, doesn't give him money to go out with, etc etc

He has all these enormous aspirations of being a traveling musician (he's a very, very good drummer), of being a graphic design artist (he's a very good artist), of being a programmer, of doing this or doing that, but he takes no step toward making those things a reality. I guess he thinks that something will inevitably leap out at him. 

I try to tell him to take small steps. Instead of waiting for some magical opportunity to appear, maybe take a seemingly shitty job temporarily in the meantime to make a little money to put toward the dream jobs. He may get a job in the short term, but before long he always finds a reason to quit

All this said, it's not like I'm some wildly unbelievable success story, so I don't know that I'm in a position to preach. But I just feel that after the last 5 years of me saying the same things and him not taking any actions, I feel like I've really reached my stopping point.

together or not

I’ll see a friend do or say something rude, and spend all day thinking of a passive aggressive dig I should post about them on social media.

Or I’ll have a friend start talking to me less and ignoring my texts. I think of how little they’re giving to our relationship and how it’s time to cut ties. I’ll get all stressed and sad about it. Angry even. I’ll be upset for several days at a time until they come out and mention things are hard for them right now and they just needed time.

323,"I attend school in British Columbia (Canada), and have had an issue with attendance. I have missed over 50 classes, and this week has been especially bad, attending only 2 days.

I have no medical excuse, nor are my absences considered ""excused"" because i'm not very commutative and i almost feel like i would be lying telling my school im sick. Last year I had 6 A's and 2 B's, and by the end of the year I missed around 80 classes. But this year, my grades have dropped. I am failing two classes currently.

Out of my four classes, I chose to drop physics about half way through because my grade (30%) and needed more time at home to work on other classes. So I really only have 3 classes to worry about, but I still manage to miss them often.

Going to try to remain objective, but here is my defense:

I usually just do schoolwork (and often teach myself the material) at home, and this has always worked for me. but lately i've had no energy and a very bad sleep schedule. I spend most my time in bed (too tired to watch movies or do work, too awake to sleep), and because of this I spend my days in essentially a depressed vegetative state. Ill go to school 8am-3pm, get home, have to lay down till 6pm-7pm before i have any energy to do anything, at which point ill try to do what work i can but ill usually get too tired and eventually pass out (then wake up at 2am-3am for no reason and can't go back to bed), or go into my depressed vegetative state where i just lie there all night trying to sleep, then am too exhausted in morning from lack of sleep to pay attention or go to class.

last year i was diagnosed with mononucleosis, which is a viral throat infection that makes your mopey, but i have since gotten better but i am still always tired. I will sleep 16 hours, wake up tired, go to bed tired. or, i will sleep 4hours between school days and wake up and go to bed tired. I fell normal-ish when i sleep ~8 hours but i can rarely manage to sleep for this time.

my school has decided to have an interview with my parents, and i am scared i might be expelled. I am a respectful student, I've never disrupted class or made up excuses or talked back to teachers, but i feel like i need a break mentally and physically from school not because it is overwhelming but because i know my position is partially my fault which just adds to my not-so-happiness.

*(skip to conclusion this is just extra b.s)*
Last year i taught myself how to program, and shuffled 4 classes each semester very well, all with mono. but this year, i've had to ask for no hours at work and i still can't find time to do work. I have a bad habit of pushing things off and i don't know what to do.



**CONCLUSION:**

I'm not some low IQ slug wanting an easy ticket, I just want some insight into how i can fix my sleep schedule, what my school might do, and anything else :/

school, despite my attendance is really important to me. I am an academic person but I feel like i'm walking in molasses lately.

324,"So stupid me decided to go through the drive thru in Wendy’s forgetting that I have bikes on my roof. I did some minor damage to the roof (bent two metal plates) and they took my information and put it through their insurance. Today I get a call from the manager saying the invoice is $880 and what do I want to do next. Here’s my issue, I dont want to put this throughout insurance so my rates go up for the next 5 years, but as a 21 year old student I dont have the money to pay them back either. Do you think if I ignore it, it will just go away? Or do you think Wendy’s will sue me over this. ",09May2018,3

326,"There is this guy (m/40s) that works at my gym (m/32) that seems to have an issue with me or an issue in general and im not appreciating his attitude.

When I come in and say hi he never says anything back, he just barely picks up the scanner where I have to literally reach over to scan my card. So many times ive said what’s up to him thinking he didn’t see or whatever and not once has he greeted in return. Several time while working out this guy has literally walked so close to me I had to stop doing what I was doing. Today he did that and I finally said fuck it he doesn’t like me.Once I locked myself out of my locker and the manager asked him to help me, on the way over I made some silly banter about what an idiot I am and he didn’t respond. Im finally not in denial anymore and have realized this guy has an issue with me or in general and as a paying customer it’s bothering me. 

What would you do?

I've never been so pissed off in my life. Doesn't that completely defeat the entire purpose of the ACT being standardized?

PS - if it makes people feel better, its a different test with different questions so he cant just look up or ask his friends for answers. also apparently hes gonna be compared to kids who got the same accommodation, but arent all the kids getting THAT accommodation kids who literally have serious mental problems, and not just fucking ADHD?

334,"Hello everyone i'm an 18 year old lad who from time to time recently has just kept on bursting into tears, as of yet nobody knows. 

In my free time i go on a 5 mile walk every day, most of the time on these walks i can't help but start crying, sometimes it will be when i'm still awake during the night, sometimes walking to sixth form. In fact, it got so bad one time when walking to sixth form i skipped my first lesson because i simply couldn't stop:/ i just sat on a quiet park bench for like 30 minutes. 

What's really weird is i'm constantly active, e.g playing football, going out for a drive with friends and messing about - just really teenage stuff. I sometimes get on the verge of crying infront of my mates but something just stops me, i'm not embarrased by any means if it did come to that but it genuinely only happens when i'm alone. IMO i'm certainly not depressed as i never feel down and other things depression makes you feel. 

I'm always up for a laugh and etc but this is a constant thing with me when being alone - i start crying. When this actually does happen i just think of all the memories that happened at school with my mates, i'll think about the girl who liked me and i liked her but never did anything about it, i still care about her so much despite not seeing her in a year and a half:/ i get so nostlagic about everything when i cry.

TL:DR when alone i can't stop crying, happens most of the time and no idea why:(",09May2018,1

336,"Hello Reddit,

This is my first time asking for advice online, so sorry if I forget information that's neccesary to understand the story.

I'm 17 years old. 2 1/2 years ago I met a friend (15 years old now) through a Minecraft server and I've been incredibly good friends with her since then. She lives in Texas, while I live in The Netherlands. When I met her she was already in quite a depressive state and with help from her friends I was able to talk her out of suicide. We've been chatting almost daily since then, but lately she's been venting a lot more than usual. During the 2 and a half years that we've been friends I could understand that their family relationship wasn't very healthy. Her father would hit her, made her watch the baby full time and generally made her feel like a victim. It doesn't help that her sister is taking over these characteristics as well, making it an unhealthy environment to be raised in. I've been trying to get through to her that she needs to go to the police or child protection services, because she has clear evidence of child abuse. The reason she won't go to the police or child protection services is because she doesn't want to tear apart the family, that they'd be worse off by letting her, her sister, her little brother and the new born baby go to an orphanage or to other relatives. Tonight I got a message saying that her sister chocked her for 10+ seconds. I talked about how unhealthy the family relationship is and how it's a bad way of growing up. Trying to tell her that it's worse to let her, the new born baby and her little brother grow up in these abusive conditions than being raised in an orphanage. It didn't get through to her.

Some extra information:
It doesn't help that she's transgender (she wants to be a boy) but her parents are everything except supportive about this. This left her in a emotional mess for a very long time. She's home schooled and there aren't any people in her family or surrounding that she can talk to without the parents finding out about it. She can't move out until she's 18, and even then I don't think it would help to move out.

I don't know what I can do from this distance, since she lives on the other side of the globe. She tells me to not do anything about this, but I just can't get myself to accept this and let it happen.

What can I do?",09May2018,2
337,"   Hi guys so since yesterday it's been a frantic two days and basically for the past month or two I've been ordering cat food to feed the strays in my apartment building where in the back I go outside to the garbage area and feed the strays. Now so yesterday I noticed two small new kittens, I'm guessing 4 weeks old and after the whole day I hadn't seen their mother so I took one of them in (the other escaped and disappeared later kept going out in midnight to find the other one which was meowing a lot and eventually did near sunrise so now I have both). 
   Now this afternoon I've been going back and forth near the area I found them and the mother we brought the kittens near the mother or father we believe but it isn’t doing anything even moved the kittens near him/her but just smelled the kittens a little and hissed back, my mom is pissed that we have two new cats that we probably can’t take care of and that the house is messed up cause of this. Now I'm wondering to myself are the cats that I'm seeing (besides the usual black and other colored cats) really a parent or I'm just wrong and these aren't it's parents and they're abandoned. Right now I've been just feeding them milk mixed with the Gerber baby powder. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!!! ",09May2018,1

339,"Our neighbor has had leaks on and off for years. We had a little bit of water damage in our living room, but it wasn’t anything sanding and paint couldn’t take care of. In the past week, we’ve noticed a lot more. I actually watched water bubbles forming when they were showering last week.

My relationship with my neighbor had deteriorated over the past few years. He had a dog barking problem that we tried to address with him. He ignored it and eventually my wife got fed up and filed a complaint. He’s since come out and screamed at my 6 year old son. I laid into him about how inappropriate making a 6 year old cry was, and he honestly seemed proud he’d done it. 

We got a quote from our home owners and it of course comes in right under our deductible. We got a private quote though and it is twice as much. Insurance drops us the minute they find mold anyway. The water restoration guy and I started taking off picture frames and we found a lot of mold. It could just be the picture frames though, but he thinks it’s likely in the fire wall. 

So what do we do? We don’t have the money to fix the extensive damage as we are still young with a family of four. My wife works for a law firm and we’d get free representation which is great. It could be a long drawn out process though and we clearly have would could potentially be serious mold growing. Insurance won’t touch it though.

340,"I say ""step-parent"" because I do not consider this person as such, they are simply married to my father.

To simplify a long story, I have very valid reason for seriously disliking this human, to the extent where I would say that I hate them. I also hate the fact that they have forced me to even experience hate as well. Awful emotion.

This person is married into my family and there is no way that is going to change. How do you deal with hating a ""step-parent"" when you are in no way at fault, they are simply a terrible person?

342,"Ok so im a 19M never had a gf before. Lately though ive been on the look out and have been trying to keep my eyes wide open for a potential girl. These last few weeks of the semester i had 3 girls in 3 different classes i was interested in. However once i started talking to them i realized they all had boyfriends. Tommaorws my last day of school and its just one final thats 2 hours, after that summer finally starts. However i feel like my chances of finding someone are going to go down drastically. Im going to take one engineering classs in the summer and hope theres probably a cute single girl in it but thats about it. I was thinking of getting a job but i already have an internship, of which im probably going to be the only person under 30 working at so thats also a no. I dont have much friends, mainly one close friend that i dont mind asking if he knows anyone single, which he said no. And the other friends i feel like im not that close with to ask them and look all thirsty and desperate in front of,( im not desperate im just getting really impatient lol). 

Anyways then theres my cousin.... shes the same age as me and has tons of girlfriends. Back in highschool she used to always show me her friends and ask if i wanted to get with them so shed set it up. Her friends are pretty cute too but heres the thing. Growing up we were pretty close and there wasnt much going on, but now that were in college, there whole family is kind of low key really competitive and jealous of me and my accomplishments. There mom always compares them to me and has me as the bar for them to reach lol. Because of this i dont like telling them literally ANYTHING about my college life of which i am very very invested in. I dont how to descibe it, its really wierd and annoying. Like at one moment were really cool but then, they ask some personal questions to try and gauge what im doing since i keep everything secretive. Its honestly pretty sad. But putting that aside were still really good friends. When thats secret shit isnt going on we get along really well and enjoy each others company.

So basically i thought to myself, if she hooked me up with one of her girlfriends and i became really close with the girlfriend to the point where the girlfriend knows all about me and what i do throughout the day, then my cousin could easily find out all the things ive been holding back and hiding. She doesnt even have to try and ask, it could come up in conversation like 

My cousin:""oh so what did you and my cousin (me) do yesterday hanging out?""

My gf: ""blah blah blah...then he had to go do such and such""

I want a supervisor to review this chat log, and then offer bespoke instructions based on this chat log and my specific order and those factors alone. \[2018\-05\-09 16:46:21\] \[Matt\] our supervisors are not able to review every common case if it can be easily solved.

I don't want to miss this opportunity because I know I would regret it in the future and I'm only getting older.

346,"18 year old, have some money saved. The thought of starting college right after I finish highschool scares me and for multiple reasons.  I don’t know exactly what I want to do, and I don’t want to be in thousands of dollars of debt for a degree I wasn’t sure I wanted. I’m also just fucking tired of school right now, not in the mood for 6 years more. 

Staying where I am and attending college while living with my parents would be the easy choice, but I’m dying to get out. 

I’m thinking of picking up, leaving to find my own place with a roommate and living a little before throwing myself in a desk for a couple years. Then maybe after a while of living in my own and knowing myself better, I can start college if I decide to.  But of course, with this method, many things can go wrong. 

Based on your personal experience, what would you advise? ",09May2018,0
347,"So I had a bad experience with [Bloomex.ca](https://bloomex.ca/) today trying to order flowers for Mother's Day.  Essentially I had a 20&amp;#37; coupon which I thought would be applied to the order, but it wasn't.  When I noticed I immediately opened a chat support \(within 1\-2 minutes of placing the order\) and the log is below.  I'm still feeling pretty heated about this whole thing, so just wanted some impartial advice on if I'm right or wrong, and if it's worth actually escalating.  Thanks!

     Transcript:
    [2018-05-09 16:11:59] [Me] Hi. I had a 20% coupon that wasn't applied to my order.  Please assist.
    [2018-05-09 16:12:09] [Matt] Hello! Please wait a few minutes while we process your request.
    [2018-05-09 16:12:17] [Me] Order # is XXXXXXXX
    [2018-05-09 16:12:24] [Matt] This field is under shopping cart and above billing info. You need to press word HERE for it ;Click here to enter code
    after it you need to press SUBMIT. Unfortunately I cannot apply the code to existing order. You may keep the discount for the future purchase.
    [2018-05-09 16:12:28] [Me] I was sent the coupon while items were in my cart, clicked and never saw a discount.
    [2018-05-09 16:14:25] [Me] well in that case i'd like to cancel my order.
    [2018-05-09 16:15:11] [Matt] cancellation fee is $25
    [2018-05-09 16:15:30] [Me] i just placed it a minute ago.
    [2018-05-09 16:15:36] [Me] i refuse to pay a cancellation fee.
    [2018-05-09 16:16:27] [Matt] ok, so we keep the order then. sorry for any inconvenience
    [2018-05-09 16:16:35] [Me] NO.
    [2018-05-09 16:16:39] [Me] I WANT MY ORDER CANCELLED
    [2018-05-09 16:16:54] [Me] and i REFUSE to pay any cancellation fee for an order placed in the past 15 minutes.
    [2018-05-09 16:17:04] [Me] it was placed in error with the assumption the coupon would be applied.
    [2018-05-09 16:18:17] [Matt] we can cancel with cancellation fee or keep the order. time it was place is irrelevant
    [2018-05-09 16:18:28] [Me] the order was placed in error.
    [2018-05-09 16:19:36] [Me] please let me speak to a supervisor right now.
    [2018-05-09 16:19:58] [Matt] you didn't apply the discount. it's not our mistake, so it's not our fault.
    [2018-05-09 16:20:37] [Me] I clicked your link and it was not applied.  It was therefore your mistake.
    [2018-05-09 16:20:45] [Me] I contacted you IMMEDIATELY after
    [2018-05-09 16:20:53] [Me] and this is all happening within MINUTES of the order being placed.
    [2018-05-09 16:21:02] [Me] as I said before, I demand to talk to a supervisor.
    [2018-05-09 16:21:12] [Me] you are being incredibly rude and condescending to me
    [2018-05-09 16:22:06] [Me] and I assure you that if this isn't dealt with in a more respectful and proper manner that I'll cause bloomex to lose more than $25 worth of business from future potential customers when I post honest reviews and logs of this chat.
    [2018-05-09 16:22:15] [Me] so please transfer me to your supervisor right away.
    [2018-05-09 16:22:23] [Me] i am done talking with you.
    [2018-05-09 16:22:30] [Matt] it's not supposed to be applied automatically, but manually
    [2018-05-09 16:23:39] [Me] Matt, the only thing I wish to hear from you is that I am being transferred to your supervisor.
    [2018-05-09 16:23:40] [Matt] it's my job to talk to you and I have clear instructions on how to proceed in this situation.
    [2018-05-09 16:23:57] [Me] Transfer me to your supervisor.
    [2018-05-09 16:25:57] [Matt] there is no supervisor in chat. I do customer service and authority to resolve this issue. if you're not satisfied for some reason you can email to wecare@bloomex.ca
    [2018-05-09 16:26:29] [Me] can you please give me the name of your immediate supervsior and your emplyee ID # so I can reference that directly in my email.
    [2018-05-09 16:27:16] [Matt] Jenny or Lisa, my ID is 218
    [2018-05-09 16:27:22] [Me] If you have any authority to resolve matters I promise you that waiving a cancellation fee as a common sense courtesy would be the far preferable solution.
    [2018-05-09 16:27:59] [Matt] unfortunately it's against our policy and instructions
    [2018-05-09 16:28:21] [Me] Could you have your supervisor contact me via phone?
    [2018-05-09 16:29:28] [Matt] unfortunately not, but you can mention this request in your email and provide your order number
    [2018-05-09 16:29:56] [Me] Better idea.  Could you contact your supervisor now, explain the situation and see if they're willing to forego the cancellation fee.
    [2018-05-09 16:31:28] [Matt] we are not cancelling this order without cancellation fee. these instructions come from our supervisors
    [2018-05-09 16:31:47] [Me] can you contact your supervisor and explain this specific situation.
    [2018-05-09 16:32:01] [Me] i'm not interested in generic instructions you may have received.
    [2018-05-09 16:32:14] [Me] i'd like this particular case to be reviewed.
    [2018-05-09 16:33:05] [Matt] in this particular case we cannot cancel the order and wave cancellation fee.
    [2018-05-09 16:33:37] [Me] Did you speak to your supervisor just now, explain this specific situation,and then they told you they can't cancel the order and waive the cancellation fee?
    [2018-05-09 16:33:43] [Me] or are you just repeating your generic instructions.
    [2018-05-09 16:34:14] [Matt] I have instructions on this particular situation
    [2018-05-09 16:34:31] [Me] which supervisor provided those instructions.
    [2018-05-09 16:34:41] [Matt] Jenny
    [2018-05-09 16:35:00] [Me] and what's her empoyee ID #?
    [2018-05-09 16:35:33] [Matt] I don't know her ID, just the name
    [2018-05-09 16:36:16] [Me] Could you please get her ID?
    [2018-05-09 16:36:45] [Me] I want to make sure my e-mail is correctly referencing which employees caused this issue to escalate so needlessly.
    [2018-05-09 16:36:52] [Matt] not right now, we have only 1 supervisor by this name
    [2018-05-09 16:37:42] [Me] Why not right now?  She was available to offer you guidance on this particular issue so I'm sure she can provide her employee ID #.  I will wait.
    [2018-05-09 16:39:19] [Matt] it can take 24 hours. I received those instructions before, this case is not unique
    [2018-05-09 16:39:34] [Me] So you lied to me earlier Matt?
    [2018-05-09 16:39:44] [Matt] how come?
    [2018-05-09 16:40:13] [Me] I was extremely clear when I said I wanted my specific unique case reviewed by a supervisor, and you said your supervisor had done that.
    [2018-05-09 16:40:24] [Me] Now you're telling me once again that you just provided me a generic response.
    [2018-05-09 16:41:26] [Matt] your case is not unique as I mentioned. so I identified your case according to the instructions
    [2018-05-09 16:42:45] [Me] I don't wish for you to identify my case per instructions.  I want a supervisor to review this chat log, and then offer bespoke instructions based on this chat log and my specific order and those factors alone.
    [2018-05-09 16:46:21] [Matt] our supervisors are not able to review every common case if it can be easily solved. I'm sure you understand. There is nothing else I can do for you. Feel free to email us your complaint.
    [2018-05-09 16:47:00] [Me] We've been in chat for the past half hour Matt, I wouldn't call this easily solved would you?
    [2018-05-09 16:47:15] [Me] Are you refusing to let me talk to a supervisor?
    [2018-05-09 16:49:13] [Matt] I'm not refusing. I cannot get you a supervisor in chat now, she's working in another office. You can email and your complaint will be responded to.
    [2018-05-09 16:50:17] [Me] I want to be sure it's seen by the proper people and I have zero confidence it will be if I send it to a generic e-mail box.
    [2018-05-09 16:51:51] [Matt] don't worry about it, our live chats and emails are monitored by higher staff
    [2018-05-09 16:52:16] [Me] then why is no higher staff available to talk to me?
    [2018-05-09 16:52:31] [Me] I'm sorry but I'm not going to take a &amp;quot;don't worry about it&amp;quot; from you at face value.
    [2018-05-09 16:54:57] [Matt] they have their duties to and not able to speak to you right now. you can still email your complaint if you wish.
    [2018-05-09 16:55:23] [Me] i can hold.
    [2018-05-09 16:55:35] [Me] i'm quite determined to speak to them.
    [2018-05-09 16:57:11] [Matt] ok, they work til 5pm, but you can wait if you wish. Cannot guarantee you the response today
    [2018-05-09 16:57:22] [Me] Which time zone are you in.
    [2018-05-09 16:57:46] [Matt] EST
    [2018-05-09 16:58:01] [Me] well I won't have to wait long in that case.
    [2018-05-09 16:59:38] [Matt] it will be past business hours shortly. Anithing else I can help you with?
    [2018-05-09 17:00:08] [Me] Yes, I'd like the full contact information for whoever heads up your customer service deparment.
    [2018-05-09 17:00:18] [Me] Name, email address and mailing address so I can send a postal letter.

    [2018-05-09 17:01:23] [Me] I'm looking for corporate data.
    [2018-05-09 17:01:53] [Matt] it's inner information
    [2018-05-09 17:02:23] [Me] your corporate executives are inner information?
    [2018-05-09 17:02:27] [Me] i find that hard to believe.
    [2018-05-09 17:02:49] [Matt] correct
    [2018-05-09 17:03:08] [Me] so your President/CEO isn't public knowledge?

    [2018-05-09 17:06:30] [Me] I'd prefer an official corporate link please.
    [2018-05-09 17:06:54] [Matt] I don't have such link
    [2018-05-09 17:07:07] [Me] or a corporate directory of executives?
    [2018-05-09 17:07:29] [Matt] don't have it either
    [2018-05-09 17:07:52] [Me] How do I directly contact your VP of Customer Service? (or whoever is ultimately responsible for the department)
    [2018-05-09 17:09:02] [Matt] I can't provide you any other details
    [2018-05-09 17:09:14] [Me] Can you provide a corporate address
    [2018-05-09 17:09:21] [Me] for postal mail.
    [2018-05-09 17:10:08] [Matt] no, I don't have instructions to do so.
    [2018-05-09 17:10:42] [Me] I'm not asking for anything unreasonable.  I want the mailing address for the company so I can send a letter.
    [2018-05-09 17:11:09] [Me] once you provide that i'll close this chat.

348,"I was a freshman at ASU, and after 2 semesters, I did not maintain the minimum 2.0 GPA to re-enroll. I was sent a notice saying I have been academically disqualified. The W.P. Carey policy states that in order to re-enroll, I need to have completed 8 specific skill classes and wait at least a year to re-enroll. These courses are ACC 231/232, ACC 241/ 242, CIS 105, ECN 211, ECN 212, ECN 221, MAT 210, and MAT 211. How can I complete these courses online within a year to re-enroll? ",09May2018,1
349,"So I recently moved to California with my mom and her new husband. My girlfriend of 1 year has been in the Navy for about 7 months and I recently visited her for about a week in Washington state. For the past 4 and a half months I've been getting into shape for joining the army, as my stepdads best friend is a 1st Sargeant and has been guiding me through the process. (haven't talked to a recruiter yet or signed anything, just getting fit) I've lost about 25 pounds but I'm not where I want to be yet. As you can probably guess the distance has put strain on our relationship and we both have been really bummed not seeing each other. I've been pretty unhappy since I've moved to Cali and my day to day has been nothing but working out, studying for the asvab, babysitting my siblings, and playing video games. I don't have a job and I still feel like I'm in highschool not really doing anything productive.  I really love my girlfriend and I really want this to work so I've been thinking about moving up there with her. She has an apartment near her base. I'll need to get a job once I'm up there and I'll need to deal with the recruiters by myself without the 1st Sargeant, but I think it'll be good for me. I feel like I've had my hand held my entire short adult life, and I think moving would be a good thing for me.",09May2018,2
350,"Don’t congratulate me yet.. 

So I’ve been driving since i was 18 I’m currently 19.5..... “what’s so special about that?”

Well... I drive like a maniac.. it’s a long story.. I have no idea why but Im a speed junkie.. I have no idea why but I’ve always been obsessed with speed. In high school classmates called me bullet legs since I was so fast and had really fast reflexes. Today I was almost caught multiple times by cops.. it was I think 4x? I was around cops/didn’t see them and hey were literally in front of me and I was speeding/revving and no one did anything. In the freeway I drive really fast 120 at times (at night) but normally I drive around 85mph but my dad put a speed lock on the car which is at 75 now.. There have been so many times where I nearly crashed but like I’ve said, my reflexes are really fast and I avoid it by weaving around cars. I’ve been considering getting a motorcycle but holy shit. I do sharp turns at 55-60 mph in highway exits, can you imagine what a crash would do to a motorcycle?? And it’s not even just that thou. Cars have limits. They weigh thousands of pounds can you image a 300-500 pound motorcycle? It’s ducking fast. 

I really want to stop driving fast because at times even I scare myself but I don’t know how to. When I drive at speed limit it’s just so bribing and normally I can overcome that and adjust to just doing speed limit but once I’m running late and I break the speed limit I can’t go back to going to speed limit.. I think I’m literally addicted. Literally everything I do i do with speed. I run fast my mile time was 4:48 in high school, I drive fast, do my hw fast eat fast workout fast, bedroom activities fast.. if you know what I mean😉 lmao but legit I can’t do shit slowly or like a normal person because it seems so Boring to me.

Now that I’m done with school, I’ve moved back home but I’ve been in such a depressed mood for months now that I’m scared if I hang out with them I’ll make them uncomfortable with my constant anxiety and depression.

356,"So, a few months ago, my coworker (late 30s, f) was trying to set me up with her daughter (19f)'s best friend (also 19f). Let's call them A(coworker), L(daughter) and E(friend).

Now, I had a girlfriend at the time but E lives with A and A told me that E had a huge crush on me. Like E was asking A to take pictures of me at work to send to her.

My girlfriend thought it was cute, so with her permission, I started talking to E on Instagram, gave her my number, and we started talking.

I just happened to be going on vacation out of the country the next day, so I couldn't see either of them in person for the next 2 weeks. My girlfriend wanted to know what I was talking to E about (it was just the casual ""getting to know you"" stuff, no flirting or anything) so I screenshotted the conversation and sent the screenshots to my girlfriend. Except for one thing... I didn't send them to my girlfriend at first, I was in line at airport security and not paying close enough attention and sent the screenshots of the conversation I was having with E... to E...

I explained to E what happened (except I said ""friend"" instead of ""girlfriend"") and E laughed it off and said she'd done it before, no big deal.

E and I kept talking for the next 2 days, but then the next day I texted her ""Hey"" when I woke up, and she never answered. I knew she was talking to other guys, and I had a girlfriend anyway, so I figured she'd either been told that I had a girlfriend (which, by the way, I wasn't keeping a secret, it just hadn't come up in conversation yet. I am very against cheating), or she found another guy and lost interest in me. Either way, no big deal.

Fast forward 3 months to now. My girlfriend and I broke up (for 100% unrelated reasons, she is moving away for school and neither of us think long distance works), E is still single. E and I haven't talked in person since she didn't answer my text... until yesterday, she came to pick up A from work, I smiled at E and she smiled back and said ""Hi"". Today she came to pick up A again and A wanted me to put something in her car, so I did, and E and I talked for maybe 20 seconds but it was really friendly and for the short conversation we both laughed a lot.

I haven't told any of my coworkers about my breakup yet

So should I text E? And if so, what should I say?
Or next time she picks up A from work should I just walk up to E and ask her to go get coffee?

TLDR: girl had a crush on me while I had a girlfriend, I embarrassed myself, months later I am single and wondering if I should text her",09May2018,3
357,"i’ve met this boy i can genuinely say i love with my entire heart. he’s my best friend and the person i know i’ll spend my small forever with, but i feel when i’m trying to tell him about my abusive ex, i’m also making it seem like i’m not over him. don’t get me wrong, i never want to see my ex’s face again, but i don’t know how to explain the things he’d done to me without sounding like i’m not over him. 
how do you tell the person you love most about how you were yelled at for finding a girl he had been cheating with for months? yelled at for doing the exact same things he was allowed to do but i wasn’t? yelled at for simply being so fucking stupid sometimes? how do you tell the most gentle boy on this earth of the times my ex had threatened to hit me, about the times he almost had if someone hadn’t miraculously timed an interruption? how do i tell him about all the times he’d used me for sex, and although it wasn’t rape, i really wish i was given a fair chance to express that i didn’t want it. how do i tell my boyfriend that my ex specifically picked me out for how young and naive i was, and watched him do it again to another younger girl when i left him? 
i want so badly to open up to him and tell him these are the reasons i react the way i do, and i swear i’m trying but i’m just not used to someone who won’t yell at me when i get upset over things that have previously with my ex turned into traumatic fights and was later told everything they said was out of love.

359,"For the love of god, or gold, please help me! 

I was in a relationship with a guy for several years, but it was never that good of a relationship. We broke up several times due to each others infidelity, but kept getting back together because of codependency. For 3 out of 4 years, he would ask me to see escorts with him, and pay for them, and since I have low self-esteem, I would say okay. A year ago (3 years into the relationship) I got so depressed about the situation that I messaged my ex, who had since gotten married and had a couple of kids, thinking he could maybe offer some advice and maybe help me mentally escape. After talking to him for a year about my relationship troubles, and having the same issue keep happening for that entire time, I finally decided I was done and I would leave. Every time I tried talking to my boyfriend about the issue with the escorts, we would get so emotional and yell at each other, and nothing good would come of it. So I knew I would just have to leave a note a run away. My ex and I were still talking and he offered me a place to stay, and to work for him as a nanny, and he would help me get on my feet again. I thought it was a good idea, so I left my job, left my home, left my cats, left a note, and ran away to another state to live with my ex, his wife, and their 2 kids. That was 2 months ago. Since then I have failed 2 out of the 3 online college classes I was taking, sucked at my job as their nanny, failed at the weekend job (Wendy's fast food) I picked up for extra money for bills, and have continued talking to the boyfriend I ran away from, completely lying to him about almost everything. As well as lying to my ex and his wife about practically everything too. Being around these people who have a home and a life makes me think of how much I actually had before I left, and now I am seriously considering getting back together with the boyfriend I just left. Except, this decision to leave my boyfriend also came about because I am about to turn 30 years old and I am still behaving like an emotionally incompetent 20 year old.  

What do I do? I don't know why I'm here, I don't know why I left, I don't know how to handle all the changes that are happening, I don't know what I want anymore, and I don't know how to get out of this to the next step which is completely unknown. I haven't graduated college yet, I have worked in daycare for the last 10 years, but as an assistant or a nanny, so not getting paid much (I have no savings at all, and have a lot of student loan debt), and I am not even capable of handling fast food work. The only thing I'm good at is being a lazy slut. But I'm intensely shy and introverted so I don't have people skills either. 

(There is way more backstory here which makes things more f*cked up, but I doubt you want to read all that.)

/bTL;DR I am an almost 30 year old codependent woman with very few life skills and very few people skills who ran away from a long term boyfriend for an ex that made me think I had a chance at a better life. How do I grow up and start behaving like a 30 year old? ",09May2018,1
360,"So, yesterday I went to visit my girlfriend. I got off work, bought some groceries and I prepped some meals for her,a care package kind of thing . She works in medical so her life is hell and I figured the least I could do is give her food to eat and a massage for her rough shifts. Soon as we get out the shower I see guy shorts and underwear on the side of her bed. At this point she’s on a call with someone she is tutoring. The whole time I’m just standing trying to figure out wtf it’s doing there. Once she gets out she lets me know that it belongs to her really good guy friend and that she’s mad that he left it there. Apparently he needed a place to stay or was changing to go to the gym or something I don’t remember. Her story didn’t seem to match but that could also have been me being pretty pissed. She tried showing me the texts and that nothing is going on and they didn’t do anything but at that point I wasn’t really having it. I stayed the night cause it was late, I was tired and she lives 20 miles or so so it would’ve been a 30 min drive. I’ve been pretty upset to even talk to her about it but it’s something we have to bring up and talk about.  How should I handle this? Assuming it is just a misunderstanding and her guy friend is just a pos for doing that (not even sure if she tells people we are dating honestly, cause I didn’t see that in her texts with him) what happens after. Her roommate is a guy and I didn’t think much of it  cause they are never around together honestly but I feel a little bit of trust gone.

Little info about us: see each other maybe once or twice a week due to our work schedule, she lives in my downtown area so 30 min drive, had plenty of sex before but last 7 weeks she doesn’t want to cause she’s tired or says she doesn’t like sex. Been dating about 9 months

I said yes right away because I was excited about having my own classroom and getting to work with my own group of kids and potentially make a difference. The school has been very supportive of me and the principal has even spent some time out of her day to give me some teaching advice. However, after much much thought, I realized I wasn't ready...AT ALL. I just started the credential program, and I can barely manage a part-time job and school at the same time. I can't imagine being a first year teacher and juggling being a full-time student. But I don't know how to tell the principal no after I've already said yes and after she has spent a little time prepping me for the upcoming school year.

I have been thinking about transferring back to another state where all of my friends and my boyfriend currently live and where I grew up. The biggest problem is I won't be able to get in-state anymore (since my parents moved more than a year ago) and I highly doubt all of my credits will transfer. My sister who transferred during college told me not to but I miss having my real friends around me and I miss being in a city I love and that I can only visit once a month now (if that).

We got paired together for a project (individual project but paired seating) and now we’ve become better friends and she gave me her number. I started to develop a crush on her earlier this year, and now it’s gotten so much more promiment. We pretty much only talk in English class or texting, she’s in 2 of my other classes but she’s usually with her friends so... anyway ,I’ve started flirting with her kind of, but I think it might just come off as being nice so..  hard to tell if she’s flirted with me, but she definitely likes talking to me and finds me hillarious lol.

368,"What do you do about unsupportive parents and achieving your dreams? I apologize if this is long...trying to create a background without going totally off base!

My parents have not been my number one supporters of various achievements throughout my life, to say the least. While they have been so kind enough to allow my fiance and I to stay with them while we save for a house (we pay rent, we pay our own bills, and we help with household chores daily), I'm beginning to wonder if I need to cut myself away from my parents when we ultimately decide to move (which will be 500+ miles away from here). When I was younger, my parents pitted my younger brother and I against my older brother. He was well accomplished, extremely intelligent, and once was a man of God, often playing the piano for services...all traits my parents admired. My younger brother was the funny personality and played sports well. And myself, I was the reserved one, courteous to others, and enjoyed the arts. However, we paled in comparison to our older brother. And our parents would let us know every chance they got.

Fast forward a few decades, I completed my Bachelor of Business Administration 13 years after I graduated high school, which my mother finds quite amusing for some reason or another. During my education, I worked well over 40 hours per week and did a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. I graduated less than two years after I started at the university with honors. My parents did not congratulate me, only smiling and walking away when I showed them the degree that showed up in the mail a few months later. During school, they pushed me to go part time incessantly, arguing that I wouldn't be able to handle school and work. It was such a vote of confidence that my parents believed I couldn't accomplish anything if it meant I had to work hard for it...

Now, with a strong desire to be an entrepreneur and call the shots at my own business, I have began pursuing a career in permanent cosmetics. I met a lady who began permanent cosmetics in 2001 and boy, does she have it going for her. She lives comfortably, she designs her own schedule, and the thing I admire the most about the ability to be in this profession...she gives back weekly through Meals on Wheels and various charity events. Being the one into art, always wanting to give back to those with cancer and those who suffer alopecia as I have since I was a young child, and strongly desiring to promote self-worth, this is the career path that I have chosen, that I have wanted since I first got permanent eyebrows over a decade ago, and want to give my all towards. I quit my job last month after several years of personal attacks (no HR department) and being looked over for promotions. After the events that happened on the day I quit, my parents urged for me to find something first. But they were supportive when I came home and told them that I left, which I was grateful for. I job seached for HR positions for two weeks and got a few interviews, one of which offered me a job. But I wanted more than anything to begin my training, and I ultimately turned down the offer. So I began my studying with a SPCP trainer late last month, passed the exam with a nice 100%, and started in-class training everyday since last Saturday. Every time I've come home to share my enjoyment of what I've learned that day, my parents would nod and return back to their phones or TV. This afternoon when I returned home from training, my father asked in a nasty tone if I have completely given up on trying to find a job. I explained to him that this is my passion, and I need time to complete it. It would be too hard to expect a new employer to allow me to take a few days of each week for the next few months to complete my training. He again pushed that I need insurance and I need an income. I am able to pay my bills while I am unemployed, and certainly being uninsured is not a great situation to be in. But I have kept a job record of no gaps between employment since the beginning of the recession, and I have no doubt I'll be able to find something when I'm ready to enter the job market again. He started back up again saying that the permanent makeup needs to be secondary and that I need to begin my career in HR now.

For years, my choices have been looked down on. My mother saddens herself every once in a while with the same thing, that she could have been in law school if she chased her dreams. Why is my situation any different than that? Why should I have to choose to look back 30 years from now and wish I chased my dreams, punching in 8 to 5 for a company I'd have no say or development in, and follow what others think is the safest path? Being unemployed is not a situation anyone would want to be in. Being provided the opportunity to train and accomplish your desires...why would you not take the risk? I prepared myself in the event I lost my job for my bills. And my fiance are doing just fine on our way to getting our house. So why should there be a reason to argue that this isn't the time to pursue a dream? I am at the point where I am considering telling my parents that I cannot be part of a family who doesn't emotionally support one other. I have already invested $5000 into training, so there is no way to turn back (not that I ever would at this point). But how do you/would you handle parents who have consistently been unsupportive of your dreams and hopes?",09May2018,1
369,"I'm really upset and shaken up right now. I'm temporarily living in a foreign country. While I've been here, my fiance of 3 years died just 3 months ago in a horror car crash. I've been renting a room from a lady, who, on several occasions has really hurt and upset me. I just let it go and brushed it off. She also took advantage of me. She had me walk and take care of her dog for a week while she was away. She also will have her whole family over or guests over for an entire day and not give me a little bit of notice (at all) so that maybe I could plan to be out for the day or get my food before they all come over (once they're over they are in the kitchen and I can't go in there and interrupt them). I have felt uncomfortable due to this so many times. There's never any consideration toward me. She has also made rude comments about Americans (I'm from the USA) more times than I can count. 

She's made a lot of backhanded insults toward me. I've been feeling very vulnerable and depressed since my fiance died and I'm in a vulnerable/sensitive state right now and the comments she's made have been really awful for my self esteem.

She has her two grandkids over this week. This is relevant for what I'm about to tell you. I got in from a long walk tonight and she says ""I need to talk to you."" So i say okay. She proceeds to yell at me that she went in the room I am renting while I was out to have a look at things. SHe said ""I Haven't gone in there and I've been respected your privacy while you've been here but tonight I went in there and I am NOT HAPPY. The shower is DISGUSTING. THere is MOULD everywhere and it's filthy and there's a ring"" and she just went on and on and on. She proceeded to repeat the same thing in various ways while belittling me. She goes ""Well I think you were a clean person, you wash your towels and things. I have AIrbnb guests coming after you leave and I don't want to stand in there and scrub the shower and all the chemicals..."" I told her I had planned on cleaning it and there is drain cleaner in the drain right now because the shower has not been draining properly. She was screaming and be very violent and mean toward me the entire time she was saying this and her grandkids were listening and were right there (they are like 9 and 11 or something). It was humiliating and belittling. I've paid this women THOUSANDS during the time I've been here and been very nice to her. 

My shower was not clean. The water is hard water. The drain was not draining properly. I was going to clean it when I got back. She said that I hadn't washed it in ages. I sprayed something on it recently. She then went on to say that's not true. She then said the window had mould on it, but I pointed that out to her right when I got here. She knew there was mould. She said I hadn't been opening the window in the bathroom, but I sleep with it open every night and it's always at least cracked open. She tried to argue with me and say ""That window is never open. I walk the dog and I never see it open."" 

I am due to leave soon but I feel like I can't be here another day and I'm in a foreign country and I'm panicking. On top of the grief I'm feeling I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose it. I don't feel comfortable to stay in this house. I already have issues with just going to the kitchen to make food or whatever I need. It's honestly horrible! 

I have one friend in the area who might be able to help me but I kind of doubt she will because her house is already full of people. I honestly felt so degraded and this woman will probably go and talk horrible things about me to all her friends/family. I feel embarrassed and humiliated.

370,"I'm sorry if this is poorly worded, I'm no good at stuff like this.

I live in a northeastern suburb near some woods with neighbors who are very reluctant to mow their lawns (read: tick heaven). I've had a serious phobia of ticks - or more specifically, Lyme disease, since 7th grade (I'm 24 now), and it's destroyed so many aspects of my life: I can't walk on any grass longer than a freshly-cut lawn without anxiety and even then never in open-toed shoes or shorts, doing most things in nature is off-limits, I can't walk my dogs without worrying about the length of the grass they're in, and I can't even look at pictures or watch movies without thinking about ticks and wondering if the photographer or actors knew proper tick safety. My experience is actually pretty much identical to the author of [this article](https://themighty.com/2017/04/fear-of-ticks-phobia/).

I used to have a phobia of bees, but working with a therapist I worked through it. A bee sting might hurt, but it won't ruin your life. I can't say the same for a tick bite. I know how physically devastating Lyme disease is. I know how often it's misdiagnosed, under-diagnosed, or blown off as paranoia.  So many doctors still don't believe in chronic Lyme despite the evidence for it. I know all of this, and living where I do I'm almost guaranteed to get bitten by a Lyme-infected tick. If you want to get all psychologist on me, the real fear is probably being rendered dependent on others and incapable of living independently caused by Lyme, but the fear of ticks still stands. If I see pictures of ticks I start having anxiety; if I see ticks in real life I pass out, which means I can't check myself or my pets for ticks without having a full-blown panic attack.

I don't know what else I can do. I know that my fear is completely blown out of proportion, but I don't think it's entirely irrational, either. If I could just do what every website says - live your life and enjoy nature, but take precautions and check yourself for ticks - this would be easier. I have a therapist I see regularly, but unless she can completely eradicate ticks and/or Lyme disease I don't see how just talking is going to help me. Any sort of advice or experience with this would be greatly appreciated.",09May2018,2

I had shitty attendance, grades, rarely did hw, etc. luckily and not so luckily, I passed my passed all my classes in freshman year with the bear minimum. I also passed most of my classes sophomore year (also bear minimum) but failed a couple core ones, which is coming back to haunt me this year. 

However, when Junior year rolled around, I became an absolute abomination... I literally had straight F’s last semester, and have straight F’s this semester with only a month left of school. Like I’d say I attended 35-40% of school days for both semesters. I really don’t know why this happens to me... I mean don’t get me wrong I love learning, being with my friends, etc.

Anyway, as you probably imagine my GPA isn’t particularly great, it’s an embarrassment actually... at this point I am starting to doubt I’ll be able to recover my GPA to something reasonable (2.5-3.0) or anything that’s not fucking 1.

When talking to my mom about it she said that she would not pay for it.  I was a little disappointed but I figured hey $35k is a lot of money and maybe she can't afford it at the moment considering I have two younger siblings that have to go through college also.

About 7 months later around Christmas time she takes the car that I drive on a daily basis (still under her name) and trades it in for a $35k for me without notifying me.  I don't want to come off as a brat because technically it was hers in the first place and I am happy to have a new car but I had a perfectly working car and I didn't even ask for a new car.  The only thing that I can ever recall asking for in the past few years was to go to grad school.  I'm a pretty simple person and live a simple lifestyle.

Now I'm working a decent job saving up for grad school while driving a car I don't need or would be able to be afford by myself and I can't sell it because it's not in my name.

She has always been notoriously bad with money, doesn't own a single investment, everyone in our family has a car less than 5 years old and there are a lot of expenses that go along with our property.

Do I have a right be upset about this?  In my mind I think of it as I could have just went to grad school and be finishing around this time now instead of getting the car and be in a much better scenario than I am in now in terms of job and salary potential.

379,"I'll be honest, it's kinda weird that I'm stressing about this but I am. I'm 16 and I'm really into music. I'm constantly listening to it and thinking about it. I've been taking music lessons for about a year, they started off as guitar lessons but are now just general music lessons. I discovered my first DAW in September or so and then started messing around in garageband and it was fun. I was just messing around until about February when I decided I should start actually making songs instead of covers and 30 second projects. Since then, I haven't made any significant. I have one good project that I'm planning on turning into a full on song and a bunch of small projects. I can program drums, add MIDI layers, and stuff like that but I feel like I'm lagging creatively. When I sit down and try to write songs all my licks sound the same and I fuss a bunch over chords. I just feel like I should have material to show for the past couple months. A lot people are making music at my age. One of my favorite artists wrote and produced his major album when he was 16. What's weird is that it's stressing me out a lot. I'm constantly ruminating about whether or I have what it takes to make music. My late night music sessions have turned into fretting and frustration. Whenever I pick up a musical instrument I get stressed. It's not like my life depends on me being a musician. I guess I would be bummed if it doesn't work, but still. Part of me thinks this is my OCD at play, because it feels a lot like my other OCD ruminations. Anyways, does this sound like someone who isn't cut out to make music or does it sound like a case of overthinking?",09May2018,1
380,Maight be overreacting. Moved to new town a couple weeks ago. Met some people and they party like every evening at their house. Today I went there the 3rd time in 6 days and after a while some girl came and said it made them uncomfortable if I always just appear out of nowhere. Kinda feel rejected. I deal with anxiety and self image issues. Also no friends there. Meh...,09May2018,1
381,"Hello! I'm a 24 year old male finishing up college. Not wanting the problems with living on campus--mainly the invasion of privacy and jerks--I have been living at home with my mother. Now, I've noticed a pattern arise over the months, and that is all female conversation. What I mean by that, is being in a group of females, and being the sole male of that group. 

Here's how this usually goes down: We are all seated and talking. They usually converse about something I have zero interest in because I'm a male, and I seemingly get jettisoned from the conversation. I really just have nothing to add, because it's something I really don't care for. Honestly, people think I'm a social recluse because of all this. It's times like these I miss my father, who would generally talk with me in a different area when this happened. 

I would really appreciate some advice in dealing with this kind of situation. Thanks!",09May2018,4

383,"Hi. As you can see based off the title, I'm having a hard time finding true friends. A bit of background here-I'm ending my freshman year at a suburban California high school.  Throughout my whole school ""career"", I have had issues with staying in a group. Once I leave my current group, this will be my fourth major friend group change. 

I started out fine at the beginning of this year, but then I realized that my friends were starting to change, or perhaps I was. The trouble mainly began when I wanted to go to football games and the Homecoming dance, but none of them wanted to. It wasn't due to financial reasons or anything like that, it was because they simply did not want to. As time went on, I realized that they didn't want to do anything! If I asked them to hang out after school, they either ""forgot"" or were too busy. Whether it was a dance or a simple trip to the shopping center across the street, they always passed up, and later complained that their lives were so boring. Gee, I wonder why. 

They also are unable to hold any sort of conversation unless it relates to school work. I've tried having deeper conversations than that, but it always ends up with me talking to a wall.

This whole year I have attempted to find good people, but it's very difficult. It seems my school is divided into two groups: the druggies and the nerds. Whenever I try to meet people, they either never want to do anything and can't hold a basic conversation, or are dealing with a ton of drama and smoke weed, which I just don't want to get involved with. You do you, but don't pressure me into not being me.

It's funny, I'm beginning to think I get along better with guys than girls. If you've watched Seinfeld, you'll remember Kramer saying, ""You're a man's woman. You hate other women and they hate you."" Maybe that's my issue, I'm not sure. But it's very difficult becoming friends with guys at this age, because they're afraid of me, lol. It would probably be important to note that many people have commented that I seem ""mature for my age"", and others have just straight up called me old. It's far more easier for me to have a conversation with adults, and to make them laugh. Often when I'm with other girls my age I feel like an alien that has crash-landed on another planet.

Often I'll develop a friendship with someone, and we'll get along for awhile, but then we'll run out of things to talk about, or I'll see that they laugh so much more with their other friends, but when I try hanging out with their friends they talk about stuff that I don't find interesting at all.

I'd say that's all of it. In case you're wondering, I do have one true friend, but she lives 500 miles away. She's experiencing similar issues as well. This bit of drama has been affecting my mental health, since I'm not having enough social time. It's making me feel pretty lonely, and it's affecting my mood when I try to meet new people. It's like an awful cycle.

Tl;dr I'm having a hard time finding true friendships, especially a group because I can't find people that I easily get along with.

Thanks for listening everyone, and hopefully I can get some advice. I really want next year to be better than this one.

384,"Hi, I need advice and have no one I can talk to about this. Trigger warning for self harm and suicide.

One of my best friends, let’s call her Sarah, has struggled with depression for a long time. We bonded over it and that’s how we became such good friends, and I consider her one of my closest friends. Just over a year ago, she got a boyfriend who has a lot of issues, and we have drifted apart since then but I still really care about her. We barely see each other anymore because of busy schedules/me being tired of hearing her vent about her boyfriend. She has consistently bailed on plans with me for the past 6 months and we had plans this week to get together but she bailed again, and this time I was really hurt by it. So I had a talk with her about how I feel like our friendship has changed and how she has changed as a person, and after a long argument she dropped the bombshell on me that she has been feeling depressed again (I had no idea because she never talks to me) and that she attempted suicide on the weekend. I don’t know the details but apparently her boyfriend was there and he helped her and she didn’t go to the hospital. Nobody knows about this except for me and Sarah’s boyfriend.

Now I’m at a loss as for what to do. Should I tell someone? And if so, who do I tell? She said she’s feeling better now but I just can’t imagine that she’s really feeling okay after what happened. I feel like somebody needs to know, and I don’t think her boyfriend is capable of really taking care of her and making sure that she’s okay. I feel like I have been burdened with this information and I just don’t know what to do next. Of course I already told her that I’m so happy that she’s still alive, and nothing else is as important as her being alive, and we can figure out everything else later and I’m here for her no matter what. Since then we’ve texted a little bit about work and other superficial stuff.

She told me that she hasn’t seen any of her friends in months, and the only people she sees are her boyfriend and her family (she has a complicated relationship with them but I think she is close with her brother). Besides her brother, I don’t know who else I could even tell. But I’m also scared about making things worse by telling him because I have no idea how he will react (I have only met him once). Please give me some advice, I don’t have anybody else to ask. Thank you.",09May2018,1
385,"So I currently work in a decent office job in Northern Ireland earning around £350 a week which is great as I’m 19. However, recently the job has started to stress me out as I realise this is not something I want to do long term. The job is also almost an hour from my home and the hours are from 12-8pm which can be quite exhausting.

I have started to think about leaving my job and getting a part time job earning £150-£250 per week in order to have time to redo my A-Levels as I do want to go to Uni in the near future.  All I really want is some assurance/an opinion on whether or not you guys think that this makes sense? It makes sense to me of course but I just want a second opinion. Thanks guys.",09May2018,1

390,"I’m having a tough time trusting my spouse after him emotionally cheating with someone online. This was 2 years ago and I forgave him. He now has a female best friend and I am having the hardest time being ok and trusting him.  

I also suffer from OCD so I get intrusive thoughts about what he does when I’m not around. I feel like I have him under a microscope and grill him constantly when he truly could be innocent. But given the past I just don’t know....he clicks out of things when I walk up or says it’s his only safe space when texting his female friend and doesn’t want me to read the texts. I caught a glimpse a few weeks ago of them sending hearts to each other and freaked out about it... he said they say “I love you &lt;3” before bed but that’s it and it’s only as friends. Which I trust, but am 100% not ok with the big red hearts. 

Side note: she’s married and my husband is good friends with her husband. 

I use to trust him and I want to so badly...but I don’t know how.  

Could someone tell me what to do? Any advice?? Help me. I can’t keep on like this.. 


**please do not tell me to just divorce my spouse, I want to fix this. Our marriage is young and we have learning to do. Constructive help only please. Thanks

TLDR I’m being paranoid that my husband is doing shit behind my back. I’m OCD and constantly assume he’s unfaithful.",09May2018,1
391,"I'm overweight. I always have been. I grew up with poor eating habits and while I've definitely improved since I moved out two years ago, I am still overweight.

It's always the subject my mum brings up literally every time I call her on the phone or travel two hours to visit her. ""What have you done about your weight?"" ""You know your friends from highschool (dating back anywhere from 2 to 8 years ago!) look great!"" ""Do you ever even consider how other people view you?"" are just some of the questions she hit me with yesterday on my lunch break.

I'm not even sensitive about my weight. It just is what it is, I'm actively trying to make much better choices and it's been up and down but it's definitely noticeable. It hasn't been overnight though.

I'm really struggling with major depression and anxiety. I called her back last night because I just wanted to tell her about my first therapy session in years because I've been feeling just really, really bad about existing and automatically it jumps to ""well maybe if you lost some weight you wouldn't feel like this"" ""well imagine how your boyfriend/coworkers feel, worried about your weight!"" and the fact that her ""boyfriend"" who I haven't even met offered to pay for major weight loss surgery for me. Mum told him I'm out of control, and my best friend recently had a gastric band placed so clearly I should have one too!

I thanked the dude for offering and just left it at that. Didn't say yes or no. Now I'm ""ungrateful"" and ""entitled"" because I didn't immediately take up some random guys offer to have over half of my stomach removed.

This conversation just carries anywhere we talk, so much so that I don't visit anymore. I'm just so over it. ",09May2018,1
