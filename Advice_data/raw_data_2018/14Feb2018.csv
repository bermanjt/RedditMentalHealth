2,"I'm a teen in highschool. My kinda friends that I really don't like that much said their gonna follow me all valentines day and I don't know what to do. I know they'll actually do it because they've followed me around when i was going to lunch with my girlfriend too before. I don't know if I can just try and lose them because i have my period before break with them too, so they'll probably just follow me. What should I do? I don't really want some annoying people follow me around on valentines day while i'm with my girlfriend, and we can't hangout after school either for different reasons so lunch is basically the only time I'll see her that day besides in class.",14Feb2018,4
3,"First of all, I feel like I never wanted to dress formally, I rather be comfortable, and I really don't see the beauty of a suit for example. Even when I see it, it's just not worth it, or at least, I feel I should have the right to dress up like that or not, but not the obligation.

This sounds kind of crazy, and I hate to have mentioned dragon ball, but i thought maybe is easier to understand in that way, more visual. I think I want to dress up as for example goku, I really love the show, it definitely would make me happy, so why the fuck not?

Obviously I'm not going to be like so every day, but at least similar clothes, shaolin monk-style or something like that?

I think we should have the right to dress up as whatever we want, and not give a damn about social rules. What do you guys think? And do you guys know where can I find martial arts-inspired clothes or just weird clothes? Because I don't want a shitty cosplay, but the real thing, something comfortable and cool I can wear.
I don't want just to dress up like this to ""fight"" society. It's because I like it, and I feel like a slave of the clothes most people think it's okay. Why can't i just go and dress up with clothes inspired on ancient greeks or anime?

4,"My cousin is white and he got into a fight a few months back when a black guy called him a 'honky'. He ended up beating the shit out of the black guy in question hammering the guy into the floor shouting 'you're supposed to be tough' and kicking the guy. 

Anyway, he has said that although he thinks he was in the right as if you call someone a racial slur you can expect to get your ass kicked (I can't argue with this to be honest, I would imagine if he had called the black guy an N word he would have got beaten up), he never wants to get into a situation like that. He has not run into that man again and believes the man may have been a drifter. 

I think he should go to therapy to be honest. He is worried that the assault will get found out and he will be arrested. So I am willing to wait for the statute of limitations on assault to run out before we go to therapy (anyone know how long that is?). 

Nonetheless any ideas on how I can persuade him to go there, once the statute of limitations runs out? He knows that he needs help but he is worried about going to therapy and then getting a medical history that means he cannot find work.",14Feb2018,2

12,"Please don't comment about the political or moral opinions you may have; just advice, please.
Also, I've obviously created a new account for this.

I'm a 19 y/o Jew from Canada, currently studying in Israel for the year. I should've gone to University, but in a final, split-second decision, I decided to defer my acceptances and fly off for a gap year. There are a couple reasons I decided to do it, but I think the main one was that I wanted to be far away from my dysfunctional family. It seems like issues are always cropping up and I honestly don't remember a moment of peace in my entire life. Life here in Israel is simpler and more complex than I first gave it credit for. I'm very attracted to it, but I know that things here aren't stable for me, personally. I have a good university, a possible stable career, and a family to return to in Canada, but over here, English isn't my first language, although I speak Hebrew fluently because my family is Israeli, I don't have University, and no means of making money, unless I get a minimum wage job. 

The allure can be attributed to a couple points: friends — I have real friends here, unlike in Canada, where I feel like everyone wears masks, hiding their true feelings and identities, and only show a smiling, friendly veneer. The friends I've made in Israel have all sensed the same thing that I have and they are all moving here, with some going to the army or already in it. 

The reasons I don't want to get back to Canada is because of my family, lack of certainty in the future that I have chosen, and most importantly, I don't feel any purpose in the rote tasks I did everyday in Canada. In fact, I haven't ever felt a specific overwhelming purpose doing almost anything. 

If I move to Israel, it would make sense for me to go to the military. Because I'm an Israeli citizen, I would have to be in the army for 3 years, but I would get paid the entire time. It's not a lot, but for newcomers who move to Israel, even if they are citizens, they get a lot of financial and psychological support. Afterwards, I can find a job in the vast tech field here—at first, I would have to take a minimum wage job, but the army calls to me because of the lifelong connections I could make and the lifestyle I could have here in Israel. It's also possible my family will move here in a couple of years because we have been far away from our extended family for a very long time, and my parents miss their whole family who live in Israel. My life is basically already here, and I can't envision a future in Canada. I've tried for years, even before i came to Israel, but it just doesn't fit. 

My brain is telling me that I shouldn't move here; I can make a lot of money in Canada—that's basically guaranteed, but my heart is telling me that moving to Israel will be the move that shapes my life and gives me purpose. Maybe I've romanticized the life here too much, and trust me, I know all of the issues this area of the world has and how tough living here can be, but I can't shake this magnetic allure. I'm still leaning towards logic's side of my life right now, but that's what I've always done, and I've never felt purpose. Maybe it's time to follow my heart? 
God, that sounds so cheesy and cliche, but that's exactly what's going through my mind right now. 
I'm not even going to get into the way I see religion lol. That's for another post, maybe. But it definitely affects this decision, as well. (I wouldn't call myself religious, at all). 

What do I do? Should I move to Israel on shaky grounds because of my feelings or should I follow the path that is easiest and least meaningful?

tl;dr Because of my family life and lack of overall purpose related to my potentially better life in Canada, my heart is telling me to move to Israel, while my brain is telling me to go according to plan.",14Feb2018,3

22,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this.. This will probably be fairly long.

My mom is 51 and has been dealing with depression most of her life, she’s attempted suicide multiple times but has never succeeded and luckily I was there. I have since moved away after her last attempt. I worry about her every second of every day, my life is literally consumed in worry and panic attacks.  I called her today to find out she quit her new job because it was stressing her out and she doesn't know what to do anymore because she doesn't know what makes her happy.

She's on meds but drinks constantly which pretty much makes her meds useless. She has a house she has to worry about refinancing. She has family who are willing to help her. She said she was feeling down but she did something different today which was she actually called someone both her mom and sister. They've tried reassuring me that she's gonna be fine. But I've heard that all before right before she attempted.

I've been crying for hours on the phone, my mom promised me, swore she won't do anything but I'm at a loss. I've heard those words before. I just don't know how to help her, she's been in numerous rehabs and psychiatric hospitals but in the end the cycle starts all over again. She drinks, quits her job, loses her boyfriend and then has a breakdown. I feel like at this point there's nothing I can do, I've told her that I'm always here for her, we're all her for her and just a phone call away. 

I feel like there's no hope at this point and I just have to prepare for the worst. I don't know how to cope, when she dies it's going to literally destroy me and I won't know how to carry on and I've told her that.

29,"This is going to be really long but basically boils down to how do I get my lazy in laws off their fucking asses?

My husband has to travel for work and this time was a several months long thing and I didn’t want to live alone with our daughter cause I never signed up to be a single mom; which I basically am. So hubs suggested moving in with his mother and sister and to make everyone’s life easier. Another adult in the house for the heathen nephews and two more adults to help with the toddler. I’ve mostly gotten along with them so I didn’t think it was going to be horrible. I had roommates in college so I thought I could do this.
Fucking nightmare. I’m paying rent and bills to live here. I buy almost all the groceries. They are not providing for either of us in any sense. They seem to think I’m the housewife and this is the 1950s. No lie, my mother in law came home from work today, sat down on the sofa, and didn’t help with shit. Dishes needed to be unloaded from the dishwasher and the drain rack, dinner needed to be made, and the toddler was screaming. Never fucking moved. Not a finger was lifted. I went grocery shopping today, took the kid to the doctor, scrubbed the bathroom, took out all the trash, and all sorts of other crap no one else ever fucking does like dust.
It’s something like this ALL the time.
I told hubs to tell his mom and sister to knock it off or I’d start charging to play the maid. He said he did. Not a fucking thing has changed. 
I *only* have another 6 weeks here but for fucks sake I’m ready to pack up and live in a van down by the river bc it would be preferable to this bullshit. It would have been easier if I had stayed by myself and been a single mom bc then it would only be two people not 6 people to clean up after and two disgusting kids that don’t ever wash their hands and bring home ALL THE CRUD EVER. My sister in law gave me a dirty look for spraying lysol when one of the cess pools brought home the flu. Really? I am a T1 diabetic and could die from complications from the flu. 
I may bite my damn tongue OFF of I bite my tongue any harder than I do most days.
I’m normally very nice and loving but I have had enough. I am snapping at my own daughter bc I am in a bad mood. I don’t have the energy to play with her bc I’m cleaning up after everyone else all the time. And my mother in law keeps telling me to just let it go and not let it bother me and to let it wait until tomorrow. Fucking disgusting. This from the woman that can just leave coffee grounds on the back of the sink and around the trash can when she empties her reusable coffee filter that has never seen soap... her cleaning day will NEVER come. I found a mixing bowl in the cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been used in a while in the cabinet when I first moved in. Went to use it to make dinner. Full of cobwebs and dead bugs. Told her about it and all she said was ‘hub’. Told her I wanted to get her help cleaning all the cabinets. Never happened. Ended up doing it on my own so my daughters bottles and cups could be in clean cabinets.

I am not OCD or a ‘clean freak’ at all. Just a mom that needs my daughter to have a clean, safe environment. And it would be nice if the two lazy cunts would help from time to time without giving me an eat shit and die look when I ask them for help.",14Feb2018,3

37,"Good friends are pregnant (I’m thrilled for them, they’ve been saving and planning on kids for years) but they’ve made some questionable choices throughout the pregnancy and became pretty hostile when I tried to intervene. 

Things really came to a head last week when they sent out invitations for a gender reveal party (one of those events where you cut into a cake and if it’s blue inside it’s a boy and if it’s pink it’s a girl.) 

I was really rattled to see such backward thinking from  two usually socially conscious people.

I don’t know how my friends could be so hateful or blind to the cisgender heteronormative stereotypes they’re not only embracing in their own lives but forcing on their friends and neighbors. 

Maybe if they’d called it a “biological sex reveal” party or something similar I could let it go, but even that implies the biological sex somehow defines the baby. To merge the concepts of gender and sex is also just plain offensive and insensitive. 

I broached the subject with them somewhat indirectly and they said it’s just a little fun so they can share in the moment with their family and friends, it was almost as though she said it in jest since I clearly was trying to help her understand knowing what genitals the baby will be born with is hardly an event and it’s overtly privileged to treat it as such. 
(Maybe because I’m a cisgender male the whole thing has an added element of creepiness to me.) 

They have trans friends, some of whom are going to this party, and I just know they probably aren’t comfortable but don’t want to ruin our friends’ day by expressing their concerns. 

It’s such a toxic way to start the baby’s life off, and so presumptuous on the parents part to assume their child’s gender. 

I’m considering boycotting the party or working with their friends to stage some sort of intervention at the party to hopefully reverse this behavior before the baby is born and can be warped by their ideology. 

I tried to imagine just showing up and smiling like nothing is wrong but I can’t do that disservice to the baby. A pregnancy isn’t about the parents attention seeking with this self indulgent party, it’s about the baby. Should I bother with an intervention or at this point would just coordinating a boycott with the other guests send a clearer message? 

**Tl;dr My friends are having a “gender reveal party” for their baby and are unwilling or unable to accept they’re reinforcing cisgender anti-trans/questioning/queer stereotypes. Should I organize a boycott or go to the party and stage some sort of intervention?**",14Feb2018,0

My first week there was amazing, everyone was nice, I was never left in a room alone and was helped with anything I might have questions about. My second week however, was not as good. Workers blatantly shamed students in front of them, diapers were not changed at the hour they said they were, kids were not clean unless parents were there to pick up, and last but not least I was thrown out of ratio in a room with 15 kids. I have been scolded and yelled at for mistakes that were not made by me amongst other things. My schedule has been pretty much the same. I come in at 8 and leave at 4. Last weeek they kept me til 515 cause they needed the help and I didn’t mind as long as I was being paid. I came into work on Monday, they told me to sit down and wait until enough kids were present for me to clock in, ok this happens sometimes I often wait about 10-15 mins to clock in, it’s wrong I know but it’s not a big deal. However they never got enough kids for me to clock in, I ended up waiting 2 hours before they let me clock in. They wouldn’t let me leave but wouldn’t let me clock in. I ended up working two hours and leaving to go home at 12. I didn’t mind my shift being cut short but spending 2 hours of my time for free up there has really upset me. Today the same thing happened. Only this time I waited 20 mins and told them I wanted to go home and told them I was not happy about this happening two days in a row. They would know an hour before I got into work if they needed me, they chose not to call me and tell me to not come in. I come home and they call me. I answer, they ask me if I can come in, that they have somehow become understaffed and need my help desperately. I decide to go because it’s better to miss one day on my check than two. Keep in mind, my commute to work is about 45 mins so it’s quite a drive but still, I don’t mind. I get to work and find out that they lied. They were over staffed and wanted me to come in because some people wanted to get off early and no one wanted to close. They had no one on the schedule to close in the first place. I don’t think this is a coincidence, I think they expected me to because I’m nice. Everyone is telling me to quit the job, EVERYONE. But I can’t bring myself to do it.

43,"In attempt to cut a long story short; I was raped by my best friend. Him [22m] and I [22f] were extremely close friends since we were both about 15. For years a lot of weird things happened which I brushed off, for example he tried to film me peeing but claimed it was accidental, but otherwise was an amazing, supportive, fun and generally very happy friendship. 

When we were both 19 something changed and I will admit I felt pressured into a relationship with Him, but I continued with that the thought ""what better relationship than with my best friend who knows me inside out?"" Which led to sexual relations which not all of which were consensual.

After this happened I took a turn for the worse and ended up with crippling depression and anxiety after only a month or so as being together and I broke it off. These mental issues got worse very quickly and I got to a state where I didn't leave my house at all for nearly 3 years. It actually took me a long, long time to relate these mental issues with what happened with him.

I did report it to the police. After giving my statement I was told that because I never actively said no or fought against the non consensual sex, there was no case. 

The past few months I've started getting my life back. I started going out, socializing and working and I feel my life is on its way to being back on track.

The reason for my posting is that I want to talk to him. A whole lot of shit happened in those 3 years, which I can go into if needed, but I feel like I've really grown, I'm stronger person now and I just want to live my life in peace instead of being scared of who I may bump into when I go out.

I want to speak with Him, not to rekindle a friendship, not to hear his view on events necessarily, but to just clear the air, have an adult conversation and out it all behind us so I can move on with my life. Is this a good idea or am I just being stupid? 

TL;DR: I had a great friendship with a guy who later raped me, because I didn't say no or fight it, I can only assume he assumes it was consensual (intercourse whilst I was sleeping etc) Should I try and have a conversation with him so we can clear the air and put it behind us?",14Feb2018,14
44,"Edit: No disrespect or offense to anyone who drives these vans. I am aware that these are common vehicles used by service workers. I use the term “pedophile” van due to their reputation as being seen as such. I understand it may be a stereotype. 

So I volunteered to take my little sister to the store to get Valentines because I could tell my mom was tired. We went out around 9 and when we got back, we got out the car and I could hear a car coming. As we were walking inside the house, I heard it stop in front of our house and I slightly turned my head and saw it was a white van. It drove off when we got inside the house. I’m slightly freaked out. I told my parents and I’m definitely going to be paying extra attention to my surroundings. My neighborhood has always been kind of eerie so I definitely won’t be going out alone or with just with my sister at this hour anymore. Any advice or precautions that we can take to ensure our safety? Never had this happen before so I just want to be cautious. Had my pepper spray with me but now I might buy a taser or stun gun just in case. ",14Feb2018,4
45,"So I'm a bit over two months into my first real full time job, and these past few weeks I've been put in positions where I've had to work close to ten-twelve hours a week. This week has been especially worse since I've been tasked not only with work that I had recently taken over because someone had quit about two weeks ago, but I'm also in charge of another person's position due to her going on vacation, which is an entirely different segment which takes me the whole day to do, leaving me no time for my work.

Simply put, it's stressing me out. Between a lack of adequate sleep, another co-worker who keeps on critisizing my organizational skills (which I'm willing to concede) and one upping me by telling me how much more work she had to do when she entered the company two years ago, and the manager hiring agency workers who either aren't capable of properly doing the work and leaving shortly after, leaving my division constantly understaffed, I'm finding it hard to keep myself calm and sane.

The biggest issue that I have is that I don't even know if it's because I'm not working hard enough or if it's because it's too much work. What I do know is that I'm doing one thing that's close to a two person job and another that's a three person job, and I know that by myself I won't be able to make the deadline next week, plus everyone else is busy with other work so I can't ask for much help. The only one's that I've been told can help me is one person who came two weeks ago, now taking over one person's position because the previous quit last week, who I have to basically train with the limited knowledge I have.

The long weekend is coming up and I fear that I will have to come in during those days to make up for not being fast enough and I know for sure that will burn me right out. I don't know how to cope with this so I'm turning to you guys to give me some advice.

1 - Am I overreacting or am I justified in feeling burnt out and anxious for the upcoming week?

2 - How do I put up with my co-worker constantly talking about how much harder she had it when she was first working/throughout her time in the company?

3 - What are some good tips on trying to de-stress or handle work related stress?

4 - Any general advice on whether I should continue to stick around or not?

Sorry for ranting. I generally don't reach out to others so me posting here on Reddit means I'm at my wits end. Lemme know what I should do.

48,"Hey guys, I'm just posting to see if anyone has been in a similar situation as me. 

I thought all my life that after graduation I'd go to my local university. However, because a close family member developed a mental illness that has progressively gotten worse over the past 10 years(suicide attempts, hospitalization, emotional abuse to other family members), my parents decided that it was best that I should move away since the environment at home was too disruptive. I ended up moving across the country, living on my own with no relatives or family here, and this is the first time I moved away from my home city. I'm in my second year now, and although I've been trying my best to take care of myself and work hard, I can't help but feel out of place here. My family situation is still ongoing, and it's getting worse every year. I'm here, but I don't really know what I'm doing in terms of my degree as a life sci student, as I have no intentions of going into professional school or graduate studies. I've been thinking of switching in comp sci, as I'm enjoying the intro course so far, but I'm not sure what I'm really getting myself into.

Part of me feels a lot of pressure to prove to my parents that I can handle myself, as I'm the first in my family to move away for university(and first to go to university). But I can't help but feel I'm letting them down, especially because of the financial investment it took to send me here. Sometimes I think about moving back home just for financial reasons, but I feel like I'm too far into my degree here to move, and I don't think I could handle living in my household given how it is now.

Ah yeah, I'm feeling pretty anxious right now. Any words of advice would help. ",14Feb2018,3
49,"I need adviceee. So my ""best"" friend is being pretty shady. I always make plans with her to hang out and I look forward to doing it but she always bails right before we're supposed to go out. I'll tell her things I've done recently that I'm proud of but then she always either tries to one up me or she ignores me entirely. Whenever she does something good I always support her, I never bail out on her, im never rude to her and I never minimize her feelings, yet she never does the same for me. We're both in university, and I always help her study and send her notes when she needs them, but today after our midterm I left because I was unaware we still had class after, so she called me and asked me where I was. I informed her that I went home because I'm not feeling good (bronchitis) and when she asked if I was coming back I said ""fuuuuck that"", in a joking tone. That pissed her off for some reason and she said ""well I'm not fucking feeling good either and I'm still staying"".  I was like ""okay sorry, can you grab me the notes though?"" She replied ""I fucking guess so"". I asked her what her problem was and she said ""you're my fucking problem"" and hung up. She's made me upset to the point that I've started getting mad at her for the things she's doing and she's making ME feel like the crazy one for being upset. What do I do? We've been friends for a long time but it doesn't feel like she values me the same way that I value her. I would never do the things that she does to me to her. I'm pretty much her only friend and nobody I introduce her to likes her at all. I'm just sick of being treated like shit all the time. Do I drop her or should I wait and see if she calms down?

53,Hey guys! I need a little bit of advice on this. So a couple of months ago I had surgery for a cyst in my ovaries. I’m all fine now but im supposed to keep up with checkups and doctor appointments and whatnot. Last month I was not able to attend because of work. This month I was feeling a little sick so I decided to let my managers know that I was gonna go to the doctor. They said it was ok but to still show up. As I was coming back I was also taking advantage of the trip to mexico (I go to mexico to go to the doctor) to bring my dog with me. On my way back I was going to buy his supplies really quick but ended up taking a long time. It was already late enough and I still had to go home and change and drop him off. So I called and lied that the cops had stopped me and didn’t let me drive back home because I didn’t have a license. (that actually happened to my friend) He said to take the ticket to him tomorrow as evidence. What do I do? My roomate has a ticket under her name but it has the date and it says speeding. She says to use it but I’m scared He’ll see the date and the name. Help please!!!!,14Feb2018,2

I've been this way my whole life, but now that I'm in college I'm noticing it more and more. I'm usually very nervous and anxious around people and being quiet is sort of my safety net, as whenever I try to be the person doing the talking, I feel like I'm annoying and coming across as a bit arrogant. 

I only have a small circle of friends that I can actually feel calm and myself around, but I'm slowly losing contact with them as they've all applied and are going to different schools and most of them are now in relationships and I feel like if I just spitball my problems at them, I'll be weighing them down as they have more important things to worry about.

Essentially I feel alone, and in a few years all my friends will have left me behind, and I won't have any sort of relationship because I'm socially inept.

63,"So an introduction, I am going for a graduate degree at my college, second semester now... my undergraduate and my previous graduate degree I kind of tried to get involved in student activities, maybe not as much as I would've liked. The truth was that sometime during my early undergraduate, I got pretty severely addicted to social media/internet fandom and started spending a lot of time on my phone/laptop etc.

Also cue that with being shy in the first place and so understand a lot of times I greet new situations I immediately 'duck' into my phone or laptop so I can loose myself instead of having to deal with whats in front of me. Its been like that for a while, including the first semester  of my graduate program. 

So yeah ive also been trying to break into two student organizations on campus but the problem is that these people are all new to me and I'm really nervous around new people too. Like I only managed to try to talk to one person in there semi regularly... And the rest of them like once. I've tried the 'hi' or nodding thing a few times, but it cripples my self confidence a bit when people ignore or dont acknowledge.


(In addition theres even one person Im pretty sure hates me for whatever self-imagined reason although I never did anything against them) And this person is in one of the groups Im trying to break into so yeah...

Anyway sorry if this is rambling but yeah I've noticed in my graduate classes this guy from one of the groups used to sit next to me, but now moved his seat so there's an entire chair between me and him, and its the same for the seats behind me where it feels a bit to me like i'm creating an 'island' around me in my graduate classes. 

Anyway...I thought to myself some members of this organization were attending my graduate classes like I said but then I tried to arrive to class early to talk to them. (I put my phone away and turned it off early) 

Of course its like everyone's already known each other for a long time and everyone's already friends and stuff... and its hard for me with conversations (bc im hearing impaired and wear hearing aids, but then this double doesnt make sense bc one of the people there has a hearing aid too but is deep in the friend group in this organization)

(Also valentines day again has kind of amped up my feelings of loneliness a lot)

Anyways...im trying a few different things. First off is therapy to try to have someone real to go bounce off my insecure feelings. Im also trying to be more involved, like I found fund raiser thing the organization has and signed up to help which would give me a reason to sit with someone from the club for a few hours and maybe talk ....idk if thats gonna work or not (as the person I am sure dislikes me also signed up for the hours I did, so its three people including me at the table during that time)

Anyways, im just really upset that im blowing it, in my second semester, that they've already made up their opinions on me...(i tried breaking into these groups in my first semester but was less then successful due to my habit of retreating behind my phone) And im scared of wasting my last college experience before going into the workplace as well.

71,"My last roommate often said ""everything is better when you're high."" Those words have been echoing in my head ever since. 

At the time I was glad I didn't feel the need to get high, because going off to smoke took time out of doing whatever the thing was she was doing ( for example my ex brought her puppy over and my roommate left to roll a joint and basically missed the whole time the dog was awake). 

But since knowing both the roommate and the ex with a puppy I dated another girl who smoked weed all the time. To summarize a really long period of confusion, my ex thought I was really naive for never getting high and that it's just part of being an adult to use weed(/alcohol depending on the circumstances) to enhance everything. It got into my head, and I couldn't walk through the ravine without wondering if was doing it wrong. Those things that brought me inner peace suddenly made me feel stupid and worried.

I know stoners have a bias, because they have like an exceptional liking to weed lol. But the general population likes it too and gets bored pretty easily sober. I'm starting to feel like I'm really odd for not needing it and for feeling peaceful and happy in the moment sober. I also feel like I'm ""missing"" something, like I'd achieve a deeper level of understanding with the universe and what it really means to appreciate nature and art if I did it high. 

I've since started smoking weed and it's kind of hit and miss for me. Sometimes it makes things interesting and fun, sometimes it just makes me anxious, often it makes me depressed, and sometimes I just feel bored because I can't really do anything and I can't focus. I do think things like forests and looking at art would be enjoyable high.

Ultimately I have this fear that I'm really childish and that's why I still find enjoyment in stupid things like leaves changing colour and snow falling softly in the evenings and even going to the zoo. Most people seem so bored with life and weed seems to unlock meaning for them. I don't know if I just haven't grown up enough to hit that boredom that comes with maturity. I'm sure I would enjoy at galleries and greenhouses high... sometimes I worry if I did it often then I wouldn't enjoy it sober, which feeds back into me stressing out even more, because then I think I'm stupid for not wanting to be reliant on weed to have the ""full"" experience. And I feel even more childish for not wanting to let go of finding things fun sober. 

And because I keep talking about how /stressed/ everything makes me about that I know some people are going to comment saying I need to chill and get high right now lol. But I also wish I could just go back to doing whatever is zen for me sober and not worrying that I'm missed out on something greater. I wish I could go for walks and not feel like a child for enjoying them. My ex really made a point at snickering at me for how naive I was for being so sober for so long (I drink socially all the time but it has no emphasis in my life) and condescendingly pointing out it was ""cute"" how I didn't have to be high to enjoy things.

I was at a greenhouse today and it was honestly so nice and relaxing especially in this cold weather but it reminded me of how all the stoners i know like greenhouses too and I started feeling dumb for the whole experience.

:/ 

tl;dr I still have fun and relax sober and I'm self conscious that this makes me childish. I also feel worried that if I enjoy getting high too much I won't be able to enjoy the things I used to anymore, which also makes me feel childish because I feel like I need to let go of sobriety, so that it wouldn't matter if I had to be high for everything.

Over the past several months, I've been participating in the chat less and less as I've been making massive changes in my life (ie new job, new city, etc...). 

Today when I hopped into the chat and saw something serious was going on I asked what happened. My friends confronted me and said I never read chat. I basically agreed and said I didn't have time right now. They continued to say how I don't give a shit about them and that I'm always interjecting with new topics/my own problems. This pissed me off since I really do care; I just can't keep up with everything. They're not wrong about me changing topics but I've been so overwhelmed with my issues I can't mentally/emotionally handle anything else. 

What they said hurt me, so I basically told them that I'm not responsible for making them happy and that I need time for myself. If that means not giving a shit about things that drain me then I guess that's what I'll have to do. They continued to go after me saying that I'm selfish and heartless. One of my friends tried to tell them that they need to be considerate, but they ignored her and kept coming after what I had said. I felt so terrible, so I left the group chat.

Now I'm just sitting here and I can't get it out of my head. I'm so hurt, broken, and overwhelmed with life right now.

78,"Ok so I've been in a long committed relationship with my bf for 6 years. We've also lived together for a year now. He's 27 and I'm 25. We don't talk too much about marriage though when the conversation has come up in the past, we both agree we want to and want to wait until we have better jobs. Our relationship is overall pretty good.
However I've recently reconnected with a professor I had last semester and I've begun crushing on him, HARD. He's 36, cute, smart, and tells me he cares a lot about my education. He's even told me I was his favorite student last semester. On Tues/Thurs I have a break between classes and he has office hours exactly at the same time. He's told me I'm welcome to hang out in his office if I wanted to. It's a large office, for a few faculty members. However, during his office hours no other faculty are present, so it's just the 2 of us. He's told me it's normally just him and I'm more than welcome to hang out whenever I want. I even emailed him one night, nervous I'd be bugging him by stopping by, and in 3 minutes he replied ""feel free to stop by and keep me company."" Like I know friendly teachers but this wording ""keep me company"" has me hung up if he wants to be more than friendly. We don't flirt, in all honesty I get so nervous with him, but he has asked me about what I'll be up to outside of school that day or over the weekend, so he's clearly interested in my life past school. And when we sit, he always leans his body towards me. And on top of all of this, he and I happen to have our next classes at the same time and in the same building so we walk together and chat along the way. He's the one who initiated that we could walk over together. 
I've started fantasizing about him and even when my bf and I have sex, I imagine it's this professor. I love my bf but I really want to hook up with this teacher, I can't stop thinking about it. I even want to ask him to hang out on the weekend, but I'm scared he'll reject the idea. And worst of all, I don't feel guilty for wanting to do this. The only guilt I have is for not feeling guilty in the first place. I've never cheated before and never thought of doing it until recently. I don't want to end my current relationship because I love him and want to marry him, but I can't shake my want to hook up with my old professor. I dont want to persue anything with this teacher. I have no idea what to do, accept any advice, and needed to get this off my chest badly. ",14Feb2018,2

Recently, I was speaking with a friend of mine, who ended his relationship, but he ended it on a rough note. The reason why he ended it, however, is completely understandable. *He didn't want to be with someone who he didn't plan to marry.* And now, after hearing that, I've been kind of thinking about that. I don't know if I see myself marrying her. We're two different types of people. She's an introvert, and i am very social. The thing is, she doesn't even talk much one-on-one. I don't think I can marry someone who wouldn't be able to converse with me very much, and now I think I might want to end things. So, I need advise how to end things **without hurting her**. To make it more difficult, i'm the first guy she's been with. Do you have any ideas?",14Feb2018,1

So I have this girl who went to my high school on Snapchat, we talk every now and then, the other day I asked her to hangout sometime, she said she's been meaning to ask me but has just been busy with school and stuff. Today, I asked her to hangout and she said yes. So she came with me and a few friends to go out to eat. It was awkward a bit a few times, I'm a shy and kinda awkward guy naturally. So my friends said there was a few key points that show she might be interested. So, they left eventually and left me with her so she took me home. While in the car she kinda just started telling me about last relationships and stuff without me asking like she was supposed to. She also gave me the aux and said if I wanted to show her any music I could. ALSO, she had to pick up her friend from work, but instead of just dropping me off first and then going to pick her up, she took me to pick her up, then drove to the next city over to drop her off, then drove back to my city to drop me off (she lives in the next city over) so she tried to make more time with me it almost seems.

I love watching movies, especially 35mm/IMAX 70mm, so I was thinking to study film archiving which is restoring and preserving film, their is only around 10 schools in the world who teach that and one of them is UCLA, but the acceptance rate is 18% in general !, but before getting into UCLA, I need to get an associates degree and major in something else and that’s my problem, I don’t really have many interests beside film and soccer, (don’t want to coach), what happens if I major in English or journalism, communications, etc. but then can’t get into UCLA to get my bachelors to get admitted into their graduate program of film archiving which is a master degree in library science ?, I was thinking into falling back into trying work as a theatre manager as a living, don’t know if that pays well enough to live on my own or later on support a family ? !!!, Other interest that I have besides film, is talking to people and getting to know them better and what they’ll like to do with their life’s, and studying their personality and I always ask myself “the why question” why are some people like this or like that ?

85,"So I have an employee of mine, mid 20s, hard worker, reliable and the guys great with his staff and the customers. He supervises at one of my cafes. I trust him to close and do deposits and run the place in his best capacity. Overall, he’s a good guy and I value him as supervisor. 

Tonight has me in a bit of a conundrum and I wanted to see if I could get some outside advice on what I should do and why. 

I dropped in at 9pm tonight which is not common of me only to find him nowhere in sight. Only his support employee was present and thankfully the cafe was not  slammed but it was steady and because he wasn’t there, I stayed and helped. When I asked his closing support employee where he was I was told he was in the bathroom. 40 minutes go by and I ask if this is common. To which I’m told that he texted his employee moments ago to apologize that apparently “it was a big one and he’s sorry it’s taking too long.”

I’m a little upset to be honest. If he failed to punch out while using the restroom for what amounted to be almost an hour by the time I left, (and I never expect for anyone to punch out to take a shit. It’s a different story for using company time for almost an hour though) Moreover if I hadn’t stopped by on happen chance, this means the guest experience would have been poor because one person can’t do everything all by themselves. I finally leave close to ten with a nagging feeling I’m being lied to. Sure enough I was. 

I asked his closing employee to have him call me from the store phone ASAP. Twenty minutes later he calls. He tells me he has to honest, that he left the store and the closing support employee was just trying to be a good guy and cover for him. He explains he needed to leave to get a prescription filled. I ask why he failed to reach out to me and let me know and his reply was that he was scared I’d get mad or something. Now mind you, I work hard to be a supportive and understanding manager and I tell him so. I asked if he honestly thought I would not support this need of his and his reply is that no. He knows I would have been okay and done exactly what I ended up doing and that was inadvertently cover for him. 

So here’s the advice I need. In our corporate organization, leaving the job without any communication or approval from management is terms for immediate termination. He left without letting anyone (his manager) know. I have two choices. Report it to HR like I’m suppose to which will result in termination (which I don’t want, he’s a good guy. But If I don’t though it shows favoritism and has a chance of bitting me in the ass) or have a heart to him and let him know the risk I’m taking and try to work establishing better trust. 

What would you do? Why? 

Edit: spelling
Edit 2: I took the advice below and asked him to bring the prescription in tomorrow and he said he didn’t have one. He just bought Tylenol and tooth numbing agent. I’m growing more and more uncertain how to proceed. ",14Feb2018,0

So today (in about 3 hours) I am moving house for the first time in my life [23F]. The council are demolishing my building and have re-homed me so hence the move. I wanted some basic 'what to expect today' advice from the moment the movers come to when they leave me with a million boxes at the other end. Any tips on how to unpack would also be great. I have a lot of my mum's stuff and I'm downgrading in size. 

Also how do you deal with the move emotionally? My mother passed away very unexpectedly just over a year ago and I succeeded her council property as I was also living there. As it has got closer to the move my emotions have been all over the place. I don't know how to deal with leaving my childhood home where I have all these memories with my mother. This place feels like home, what if the next place doesn't. I've had the new places' tenancy overlap so I've been at the new property so I have managed to redecorate absolutely everything and ordered lots of new furniture to make it to how I want it  rather than just living in something my mum decorated to her taste. It will obviously take a while before I see that as a home rather than just a house, but what if it never feels like a home? 
Any advice or comments will be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.

91,"This is pretty vague and at risk of becoming a r/AskReddit thread, but I was curious to hear other people’s thoughts.

I’ve been talking to a guy for a while and it’s clear we’re both attracted to one another. The only thing is, we are pretty much polar opposites in our religious beliefs. 

He’s a die hard Christian, goes to church every Sunday - even when he went on a trip to Vegas, and he’s still a virgin at 23 because he’s saving himself for marriage. 

Me on the other hand, I’m an atheist; I don’t believe in God and I never have. 

The thing is, he’s pretty much my ideal type. I find him extremely attractive, he’s so sweet and caring, we get along amazingly, the textbook definition of my “dream guy.” 

The only thing that’s acting as a gigantic barrier is our religious practices... or in my case a lack thereof.

Prior to January I was very excited and had assumed on January 5th he would pay some of my loans, as promised. I waited, with nothing, and at the end of January I awkwardly approached and asked him if the loan help is still an option. He said yes and that was the end of the conversation. On February 5th, he still paid nothing. I feel funny asking him again because it's a kind gesture and in the past he made it clear he doesn't like to talk about money things. He has done a lot for me and always stands by what he says he will do, but I have to know if he is still helping me, so I can start chipping away at my loans on my own otherwise.

97,"Hi, I'm not completely sure why but I strongly believe I'm just one of those guys who'll only be able to attract women by solely chasing money (wealth).

Secondly, I have male friends (it's relatively easy for us guys to be friends with one another) and no female friends.

Thirdly, I try to always look presentable (shower, get haircuts, shave, not fat) wherever I go but maybe women just think I'm ugly.

Hell, there are even hairy fat guys out there who get girls.

I'm convinced some guys just need more than personality + confidence to attract/get women, I **think** money is the answer.

I also want to give you guys some info about me (this might help for better advice):

I've been working as a Night auditor and only have around $4.4k saved up (need to buy a good car and move out).

The only hobbies I have are playing guitar (complete beginner, not that good) and browsing the web.

She told me she’s extremely shy, and I know she isn’t a catfish based on some personal information that I won’t share here.

Been lurking here for a while.
A few months ago my friends took me to a prostitute. I thougth that maybe it could be great to experience it finally. I was a kissless virgin back then. I went with them and went to the prostitute, and I went it. To be honest? It wasn't that good, I almost didn't get a boner and didn't fuck her for a long time. Didn't feel a lot. I didn't really enjoy this, it was pretty dissapointing also. Didn't really felt like fucking her.
Now the problem is that I ever kissed a girl. I had ""sex"" but I never kissed a girl. This thing been bothering me for a lot of time. I am pretty dissapointed. Pretty ashamed. I want to know if that counts, the sex was shit and there was no desire (probably from her too).
also, people like to ask others if they are virgins, when they had sex for the first time, who, what etc. I really have no idea what to say. 'Yo I had sex with some chick"" but then they will ask me when I kissed someone, and then I'm fucked. Why? Because a lot of people knew that I was a kissless virgin, I didn't have a problem with saying it.

As I know prostitution is not very socialy accepted, so I don't know what to tell.

Can you guys vote on the most effective options?:

1. Write on my arm

2. Have alarms/alerts throughout the day to remind myself

3. Try finding others to talk to

4. Stay out of the house

5. Have them blocked on my phone this week

6. Please give me your own advice if you can.

117,"I am 30 years old living with parents in Spokane wa (I’m embarrassed to admit that), for awhile I’ve been planning to move out and live with my best friend in Los Angeles however he bailed by moving in with his ex gf. The plan was easier to execute to move in with a room mate due to costs but with that out the window I have no idea how to move forward with my life. Long story short I am over due for a huge life changing move, I need to figure out a plan for myself. I only have about 12k saved up.

I’m not very confident and I’m what some would call very sheltered and a late bloomer. I have no education, I can’t drive and I am all out of ideas. Everyone thought I was moving soon and I really prepared my mind to go through with the move and bottom line is I really wanna be out of my parents house.

I know my problem is very complicated but I’ll be happy to answer any questions any of you have so that I can receive better advice.

What would you do in my situation?",14Feb2018,2
118,"I'm a twenty year old college student. I'll try to be as concise as possible, so if you guys feel I've missed something important I'll try to add more. I'm going to try to objectively write everything I want to say without rambling too much (I find it tough to write exactly what I am feeling). I've been throwing off asking people for help for about a year or two so I'm happy that I'm at least able to that now. I know my text is not good, so please tell me if you want me to elaborate on something. I don't find it easy to write what I feel. I can say it, but for some reason I find it tough to write.

Td;dr : I've lost all confidence in myself and don't find any motivation to wake and do something in life, and don't have the discipline to do it as well. I don't feel like I have an identity as a person anymore and I just want to know how to be a normal person.

REAL POST STARTS HERE

I feel really pathetic for no reason. I don't deserve to feel sad with all the help my family and friends have given to me, but yet I do, and this makes me feel even worse. I feel pathetic that I don't wake up on time for my classes. I feel pathetic that I'm not making any progress on my research work even though I know exactly what I need to do. I feel pathetic that I submit half completed assignments. At this point I don't know why I even wake up and go attend classes when I barely listen to them anyways. I don't find the motivation to wake up at all, and I just feel even worse when I think about how much effort my parents put in for me to have this life and I don't even fucking wake up to go to class. I contemplate committing suicide about twice a week( I don't have the guts to do it anyways)  and this again makes me feel awful because i don't want to let my friends and family down by being a loser. My plan right now is to commit suicide after I pay back whatever my parents paid for my tuition since childhood. I just feel that there is no meaning in life for me. 


There is not one reason I can find as to why I should be sad, but yet I am. There are millions of people who have much worse lives but still are happy. I have a lot of friends and am considered a pretty cool and funny guy by most people. I'm very active in sports and some of the student council stuff as well as music, so I'm an average person. If you saw me, you wouldn't have any idea I was feeling bad. I'm an average student when it comes to grades, and that is mostly because I don't put any effort. And that is where I think my main problem is. I never put any effort in anything at all. I do all my assignments in the last second (I don't even do them completely), I study for exams in the last second, I do my research work in the last second before meeting my advisor. It's not like I don't know I have to put effort, it is just that I don't seem to be able to make myself do it. I'm smart enough to realize what I have to do but somehow am not smart enough to do it, with is even more pathetic than anything else.

I also have severe self confidence issues. The only time I felt truly happy was when I was talking to this one girl from my batch in college. I had a massive crush on her but she ended up dating someone else. I never got to show her that I liked her or anything because I was too afraid to be rejected. I honestly don't see the worth in dating myself. I wouldn't fucking date myself, much less, be friends with myself. So if I don't feel like I am worth something why would this perfect girl feel any different. When she broke up two years later(around half a year ago) I was so happy. I've never felt as excited I'm my life as the time I've talked to her. And then my best friend told me that he liked her and wants to get to know her and stuff, so obviously I can't try to date her, but then again I still have all this low self esteem issues which is pretty bad so it's not like anything would have happened either ways. It just feels like I am such a colossal fuck up at this point.

I have a perfect family with amazing upbringing, really cool friends, really cool batch mates in college, really friendly seniors and juniors in college, and I still fucked up in life. I messed up, when it was near impossible to. I feel so worthless and I just want my life to end. Sure people will feel sad now, but in the long run at least I won't be such a huge disappointment to more people. I have already started hanging out with my friends less so that when I do finally decide to go, it'll hurt them less. The reason I post this is because I want to try and at least be a normal person up until the time I decide to go. If I'm happy by then, then it's cool, otherwise I think I'll just commit suicide and end all this torture.

I'm sorry this post is so shite and doesn't convey anything useful that could make you help me. It's just really tough for me to put in words what I feel. I also don't have anyone who I can talk to irl about any of my issues ( it'll be too awkward). I might not reply to quickly if comment, but I'll try my very best to do so.",14Feb2018,7
119,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, so tell me if it is but anyways

I'm a highschool student, and I love the teacher, but he's had these sporadic comments and behaviors that concern me.

First, sometimes he'll blurt out his marriage problems, which is pretty normal, I've had tons of male teachers mention their marriage problems. But the detail this guy goes into with it and the way he speaks so miserably about it hits me. He's also mentioned how his wife has problems with conceiving, so his one son is all he has but there's a possibility he'll lose him. There are days this guy just radiates sadness and I can tell he's trying his best to keep up appearances and still teach. He's also thrown hints of a drinking problem out there

Second, and it may take away from the fact that I find him a good teacher, but he's very vocal about how he hates what he's currently teaching. He took one semester of the subject he teaches in college and took the AP class no one wanted and does the other dirty jobs no other teacher wants to do because he desperately needs tenure to pay off his 90K of student loan debt that keeps increasing due to interest. And this loan debt issue is something we as a class hear about daily.

Third, he's also very vocal about how his family has sort of disowned him for leaving the Mormon church. Sort of adds to the marriage issue because his wife is mormon. I remember once I asked him to chaperone my club's overnight field trip and he told me he really wanted to because he wanted to get away for a bit but ultimately couldn't because he had to go up to Utah, seemed bummed out about it.

I don't know, maybe this isn't my place, but I love this guy, there are days he tries to pick the whole class up emotionally because he cares, but sometimes his issues are glaring, and I don't want him to start feeling worse.",14Feb2018,1
122,"So some backstory. I am a security guard.

Ive been having a really bad past couple of weeks. I have been depressed for quite some time, and recently my girlfriend of four years ended with me, and was with another guy within a week. This has NOT helped my depression, nor has my job been helping. I work alone at night which has not been good for my thoughts. Thank god I am not armed or I may have pulled the trigger on myself already. I am not an angry guy at all, never even been in a fight or done anything like this before. Tonight at work, I lost it. Valentines day is today, and that threw me over the edge. I punched the wall at work, and created a hole in the wall. I am still here now waiting for my shift to end and freaking out about this hole. Do you think I am fired? Should I call my boss immediately in the morning? Should I schedule a meeting with HR? The site that am at already is on shaky ground with my company. I am afraid this might lose the contract. I have been at this site the longest compared to all the other guards (2 years) and never have gotten in trouble before. I was planning on moving in 3 months, but that may have been thrown out the window too. Please help.

About 4 months ago I started getting very panicked all the time and it branched maybe into some form of anxiety. I’d wake in the middle of the night because I thought people were trying to get into my house, I’d have to go check all the window and doors multiple times a night and I started having some minor trouble sleeping. For the last 2 months or so I’ve been having increasingly bad night terrors that are me being attacked, i’ve had two other vivid dreams that don’t seem like the other ones, they feel like I’m watching someone else but I know it’s me where I’m the aggressor and am hurting or killing people or mutilating animals or other horrible acts. Most recently my girlfriend tried to wake me by grabbing my arm and I woke up in a violent panic and starting punching at her but I snapped out of it within a couple of seconds. I’ve done a very good job of hiding this from her before now but now I don’t know what to do and we haven’t talked about it yet. I’m not one for getting help and actively try to avoid it, that was the way I was raised, and my family would think I was crazy, so I want to keep this as private from them as possible.

126,"I wouldn't describe myself as flamboyant, but I don't really know how else to put it. I'm somewhat frequently mistaken for being gay, which I don't really mind, but I'm starting to wonder if it's a turn off to potentially interested women. I think being in the military, even though it's just reserves, helps to somewhat offset this, but I'm curious if it's maybe time I start shifting my personality to a little more serious version of myself. 

I'm usually quick to make fun of myself in a light-hearted manner or post kind of questionable stuff on my snapchat story. It's hard to describe, but for example, I posted a pic of my roommate and I both shirtless on our couch drinking wine. There was nothing gay about the situation, we're comfortable around eachother like that, but I found humor in the situation so I broadcasted it as I thought others would find it funny, which they did. However I couldn't help but think after posting it, does this make women look at me and think I'm a less suitable male because I don't really take myself seriously? I've been struggling recently with women in general and I guess I'm just looking for an answer. Do women view the jokesters/less-serious members of the friend group as nothing more and just friends, or am I reading too much into it? ",14Feb2018,3

130,"TL;DR  ***I trained someone, they got their probationary evaluation earlier, was given $1 raise ($11 to $12), he argued, got a $3($11-$14), and is now making nearly as much as I am($14.50), and is making more than I ever did on that machine after 1y 1/2. I was supposedly moved to highest paying machine.  Boss comes back from trip tomorrow.  What to do?***


So about 8 weeks ago now, I trained a guy to take my job running a machine I've ran for 1y 4m, as I was ""promoted"" to team leader and was put on ""Highest paying"" machine that the company I work for owns. 

My coworker got his probationary evaluation earlier than usual (6 weeks in, instead of 8) because boss was going on a trip for 2 weeks. 
Our second shift supervisor pulled him into the office with the boss and they were in there for quite a while. 

He comes out, comes over to my machine, all the way across the building, and tells me he was given a bump from $11 to $12, but he argued with the boss, threatened to quit, and got bumped from $11 to $14. 

I started out at $11 as well, at 8weeks I was bumped to $12. I worked my ass off running production, even jumped on another 2 machines, boss seen and bumped me to $13.  After I had trained him and went to the ""Highest paying machine"" and got promoted to Team lead, I was bumped to $14.50.  I close the building at night, I manage 3 other employees, I've worked there for 1y 4m, and he got bumped to almost my pay just because he argued?

He puts out about 1/4th of the production I ever did on that machine.  He slacks about, makes jokes about quitting, he's only been there 8 weeks now. 

I'm torn on what to do. My boss comes back from his trip tomorrow.  Do I confront my boss? if so, how do I go about doing it? How do I bring it up?

131,"Back Story: 
My memories are really foggy for years between 6-9ish 
I know it's normal to not remember some stuff but I don't seem to remember ANYTHING. I have memories from younger than 6 and older than 9.. 
I also remember that without having been told what sex is, I knew what it was. I started masturbating really young. I also remember this 'friend' (my age, female) who would kiss me/touch me when we would hang out (from 12 yo to 14)
As a teenager I started having rape fantasies (seemingly from nowhere, I wasn't influenced by anything as far I can remember) I also started having trouble connecting with people and struggled with eating disorders in highschool
During university, I battled depression and self medicated with drugs and alcohol. I wasnt dating like the rest of my friends .. so much so that I am now in my late twenties and still a 'virgin' - not from lack of opportunity but I just can't seem to be able to and I chicken out.
I still have rape fantasies. 
Recently, my home got broken into and the 'intrusion' sent me in a frenzy! I felt violated, I felt like my something (more than the martial shit) was taken away from me. I was so overwhelmed that I stayed in bed for days but as the days passed, I kind of just had this epiphany - I can't call it memory because I dont remember for fact but I just FELT like something happened to me when I was young and I can't figure it out and i cant stop thinking about it, it's killing me.. it's driving me nuts. I can't afford to go to a psychiatrist ect because where i live i dont have health insurance and they cost 150$ an hour.. Can someone please give me any input? what do you think I should do?

134,"**Backstory:** 

About 3 years ago, we met in a class that we were both taking, and kinda hit it off. We had talked that night till the wee hours in the morning and it felt like something special for the both of us. We had continued to see each other almost every day for the next week until she broke the news that she decided to go back home halfway across the country. I decided that I liked her enough to suffer through the heartbreak after 30 or so days and just see where it all landed. 


30 days later she's gone, i'm heartbroken and we still continue to talk and skype, but I just have to know where we stood. ""She loved me, but wasn't IN LOVE with me"". It hurt at the time, but I made my way through it the best that I could. 


We remained friends through chatting and about a year and a half after she left, she had made the decision to move back to where I was to start a career. I helped her out the best I could to make her transition as easy as possible and to make her feel comfortable cause moving halfway across the country for a career is a scary ass thing. 


About 3 months after the move she brought up the idea of us being in a relationship. At the time, we were both in a very bad emotional place, and there were times that she would unload or come to me with problems that would weigh heavy on me and it felt like ""work"" that I wasn't equipped to deal with on top of my own emotional shit. I had told her I didn't think it would be a good idea as we would end up just killing each other. She agreed (maybe reluctantly?) and that was the end of that conversation. 


Fast forward about a year or two, and things have gotten better for both of us emotionally. We were both better people who had grown from our issues, and a big part of the reason for that was because we had each other to come to and rely on. (She even lived with me for a while rent free, while she got back on her feet after some bad financial stuff) We were close, we were having fun, it was almost like we were in a romantic relationship, without explicitly saying so. Watching netflix, hanging out at each other's houses, going to movies, general relationship-y type stuff. 

During this past winter, in the back of my mind, I had thought to myself, ""Maybe I should ask her if she wanted to give this thing another go"". But ultimately I had tabled that cause she was out of town, and things were going well the way they were I didn't want to shake the boat. 

**Current situation:**

About 2-3 weeks ago, she hit me up with a message about 2 in the morning, which was odd for her, and she replied that she had just come home from a date. Cool, she's been on dates before and it never really bugged me. I let it slide, but there was definitely a pseudo-prick in the heart that i didn't feel. Another night while having another text conversation, she slips in that she's going over to the guys house (4am) and I try to play it cool, but the pseudo-prick has turned into something bigger. This was like a little worm that has been digging around my head for a while, and on Sunday I wanted to try and surprise her at work because I hadn't seen her in a long time and I kinda wanted to hear her voice. Big mistake I think, cause that just made things worse. A glut for punishment, I had texted her later that night to see how things were going with the other guy. ""Things are amazing. I'm really fucking happy"" -- slash slash goes the heart. I think the thing that hurt me the most was ""He just didn't match my blueprints"". I know the type that she usually goes for (tall, white, and somewhat pretty) and this guy was basically the same, except asian. (For context she's caucasian, and i'm asian, average height, slightly huskier athletic build) At one point I too  didn't fit her normal blueprint but what was wrong with me at the time (3 years ago). It made me feel down on myself, and really low on self-worth and unlovable. Just got home before posting this and found out that they had made it Facebook official and she's in a relationship with him. That's when the heart absolutely broke and why i'm here. 

I have already sought solace with a couple of friends via phone, and have calmed down emotionally. The lady in question knew something was wrong with me lately and asked about how I was doing. Knowing that we had already made plans to see Black Panther on Thursday, it would be best if we discussed there. 

Let it be clear, I am happy for her to be in a new relationship. She is a wonderful person, and she deserves to be happy. I'm just feeling like complete shit right now. I don't know if its unresolved feelings for her (which i don't think it is, because if she breaks up with this guy, I don't really see us going into a relationship. I'm at the point now where If i'm in a relationship i want it to be the ONE and I dont know if she's the ONE). I think what Im looking for is some ""closure"" of some sort. Our last two years has basically been a romantic relationship without the label, and it feels like we've broken up and maybe I just want to let her know how I feel? I value our friendship, and owe it and her an explanation of what's been going on lately. She is a wonderful person who I would hate to lose as a friend and If I keep these feelings in it may just happen.

135,"Today my friend was showing everybody a really embarrassing photo of me on his phone. I may have gotten a bit too personally invested in this situation so I shoved him. I meant to give him like a playful shove as to move him away from the people that wanted to see the photo, but in the moment I didn't realize that he was standing in front of a staircase (going up, I didn't push him DOWN the stairs). He landed next to the stairs, with his drink all over his hoodie, phone and earphones slamming screen-down on the corner of the stairs, and slightly dazed from hitting the ground. I helped him up, picked up his drink, phone, earphones, and walked him to the bathroom without noticing that he wasn't directly acknowledging me. He told me to fuck off when I offered to pay for his phone. When we walked back to get his bag to go to class, another friend began trying to bait him into play fighting him. My friend straight-up punched him in the gut (he is notorious for holding grudges and for being over-protective of his phone). 

The worst part is that the phone and earphones in question was a two year old Samsung galaxy s8 and Beats by Dre earphones, money thats hard for a high-schooler like me to get their hands on.

What should I do? The money doesn't worry me so much but the fact that I might never be considered his friend again worries me. The way I see it, the only way to get back our friendship is to literally buy it back.

Any suggestions?

Let me start by saying these are my friends of around 2 to 3 years. We usually joke about stuff saying like ya mum gay(im au ok so no mom here) and all that, but I have one friend who takes it literally and says, ""At least my mum is employed and I see my dad"" I told my friends once that my mum was unemployed and looking for a job (she has one now, I'll get to that). And well, my parents are divorced.

I had literally no idea how to respond so I said, ""At least my grandma ain't dead."" Probably a stupid decision on my part though.

I take criticism very seriously. Yet when I choose to criticise someone, I have made it so that I comment the smallest practical mistake or behavior - and even those only when they cross my personal bounds. 


To me that list of ""criticism"" - he called it that - doesn't look like criticism, but an attempt to shut me down (he often retaliated with the remarks above after I had commented some behavior of his that I disapproved of (e.g. why do you walk out of the room when I'm talking to you, please don't speak so loud, please don't make such comments, you're visiting so often that I can't deal with my own stuff anymore, you speak so much of yourself and I feel like I can't say anything at all). 


I took his comments seriously - I always do - but I fail to see the practical side to these comments - as some of them were plainly untrue and there was no solid behaviors of mine that were to correct - at least the failed to elaborate when I asked specifically. 


So, here's the question - is he just really bad a human stuff or is, what the list has, legit criticism? ",14Feb2018,1

148,"Hello,

i feel like the quarter life crisis has hit me hard.

I don´t know what i want for the rest of my life. I have a good job, but after 5 years it feels dull. This was never my dream job, but after all a good job to start my work life.  
The big problem is, that i don´t know what i want to do...

As a typical mid 20s i like computer games, esport and everthing in that regard. not much more big interests. i feel like a jack of all trades but no specialist everywhere. i cant fascinate myself for anything long enough.

I started studying marketing &amp; sales part time, just because i dont want to stay at the same spot. i dont even know if i want to work in marketing &amp; sales. (could be, but i just dont know)

It starts to get into my head very bad... I want to quit my job, but dont know what to do then.  
I want to leave my girlfriend, because I dont know about our future, because I dont know about MY future...

How should I know what to do, when my only interests are in a branch which is flooded by young employees and living in a country which has little to no impact in esports/online gaming",14Feb2018,3

150,"My boyfriend and I are both pagans who worship certain gods and goddesses. I mostly base my practice around my matron goddess. Today I was talking about how I believe he and I are soulmates and that she helped us get together.

He told me that he's never met anyone as religious and devoted to one goddess as much as I am and that he's worried my worship may get in the way of our relationship. This really shocked me and I couldn't help but feel offended.

I told him it's just my belief and that I don't expect him to believe it, but that I don't understand where he sees the problem. He explained it calmly several times but I still couldn't wrap my mind around it. Then he said he's worried that I'll start giving my goddess credit for everything good that we do and I told him that won't be the case. He said he doesn't care about who or how I worship but that he's worried I'll overdo it.

The topic somehow changed to the question of who I love more - her or him. I told him I love them both equally and that seemed to really hurt him. I said he can't make me choose between them and that I don't want to because I feel that if I said I love him more, my goddess would be disappointed but if I said I love her more he'd be hurt. That's like asking a Christian whether they love God or their s/o more. 

To this, he replied that they'd all choose their s/o because all gods want humanity's happiness so they wouldn't mind. I got really sad and angry and ended the discussion with ""I don't want to choose and you can't make me."" He said he's used to this anyway which I interpreted as ""I'm used to people putting others before me.""

I really don't know what to think or what to do and I could really use some advice. ",14Feb2018,0
151,"So for some background: I’m a 28m and my sister is 27. She has two wonderful kids and since I work out of state, I relish any chance I get to go home and see them, buy them gifts, spoil them, typical bachelor uncle stuff. 

My sister has not been as financially successful as I’ve been. She raises her kids with what she’s got and never ceases to amaze me with what a wonderful job she’s doing as a single mother. I’m more than happy to send some funds her way if she asks and moneys tight that month. I’ve always told myself she deserves to get that sort of help if she needs it. The kids happiness and upbringing is that important to me. 

So for Christmas, I got my niece and nephew a copy of Minecraft. I play it from time to time and like the creative outlet it provides. That was my logic for my niece and nephew. Give them a chance to express their creativity without having to buy a new LEGO set or craft supplies. I can also make a server to play with them since I’m out of state. 

Well in Mid-January my sister had yet to install it. I ask her why? She tells me that she doesn’t feel it would be beneficial to the kids. She tells me a couple more reasons (excuses?) as to why she hasn’t installed it. 

After pushing some more, my sister let’s out “I don’t want the kids to end up like you!”

I was legitimately stunned. At a loss for words. I thought I was being a positive male role model for them. I help her out financially. I’m a positive and upbeat guy. The narcissist in me thought “Who wouldn’t want to end like me? I’m middle-class successful and happy with my life”

Well I haven’t spoken with her since. I haven’t seen or spoken to my niece and nephew since.

The advice I’m looking for is: what could my sister have meant by not wanting them to “end up like me”? What could I do to mend fences with her? The anger I’m feeling at her words shouldn’t extend to the niece and nephew I adore so much. 

Stories of your experiences are also more than welcome. I wanted a lot of different perspectives. ",14Feb2018,15
152,"I have no idea where else to turn because no one in my life seems to know what to do either. I suffer from an undiagnosed condition that causes me extreme pain every single day. I am enrolled in  high school currently in my 12th year. Sitting for long periods of time is insanely painful to me, and it is very difficult for me to attend classes. I have had this pain for 5 years now, and only recently has it been severely affecting my grades, because of the fact that I'm in grade 12. I miss quite a bit of school. I'm talking sometimes whole units because I'll have been in the emergency room or bed ridden for days on end. In no way do I want to be missing this much school, and I push through the pain to attend when I can. But there are more days than not that I'll have been up all night, unable to sleep due to the pain, or days I can't even walk. I am a relatively intelligent student and I still am able to achieve honours, but I am looking to get much higher, as my desired area of career is in science and chemistry. My teachers, principal, and all of guidance office knows what I'm going through, but I have not received any accommodations. I don't even know what they could do for me. Keeping up with homework is also difficult, because I cannot even sit up to work on it most days I miss. I am currently being assessed for what it is I might have, but I live in Canada and the process is extremely slow for any kind of care.

Except, this time I actually felt something different. I felt for the first time, unconditional fucking love. It made me happy to see her happy. It made me happy to know that she knew that I loved her. It made me happy when she’d tell me she loved me too. 

It felt so fucking real. I was willing to put my heart on my sleeve for this girl. I never once wanted anything in return.

*My boyfriend and I have been together for eight and a half years.

*I often write erotic literature using a few characters I've created. 

*I RP (not sexually) with a friend and we publish our work so it's more like writing together. 

*This friend also writes erotic literature and I allow her to use my characters/IP. I used to use hers until my boyfriend forbade it. We do not exchange the fics with each other but simply post them publicly for our followers to see. 

*Boyfriend considers this cheating because he feels a piece of me is in my characters. I disagree. I feel I put a lot of work into my characters but don't have any real characteristics I share with them. 

*Boyfriend demands both she and I stop writing erotic fiction using each other's IPs or we break up and he tells everyone I cheated on him. I do not want to as I feel he's being controlling and thus unfair since I do not feel like that is what I'm doing.

157,"Hello r/Advice.

I am here for .....drum roll....advice.

I have been a husband for a bit more than 2 years. Leaving with my wife for almost 7 and a father for almost 5 years.

We've always had arguments. At the beginning I use to yell a lot (a trait that I inherited from my father) but when she asked that I change that I tried and did. ""Of course"" I cannot change my temper completely and I might have an occasional burst of temper. But nonetheless, I made an attempt of changing. And to some extend I succeeded.

Also I have 2 ""sins"". Video games and weed.

When we first dated, I was smoking everyday, several times a day. And at that time she had no problem with it (occasionally she would even join me) When I became a father, I stopped that but usually liked to light one after my son when to bed.

Same thing about the video games. I was what you can call a hardcore gamer 7 years ago, doing competitions and playing at least 5h hours a day minimum when I played (I was working in the movie industry (like her) at the time so hours and schedule were not really a thing). And of course I changed all that.

Now I play between 2 and 4 times a week (at night) at most and I don't smoke on any regular basis whatsoever.

But in the last weeks or months it seems that whatever I do it is not enough.

We've been struggling for some time now with money and I was doing jobs that really annoyed me (nights time or very uninteresting) but they had monthly paiement and I had to be providing for my family. 6 months ago I finally had the opportunity to start a job that would allow me to be happy and to evolve with a career project (I stopped being a camera operator for several reasons but switch to my other passion which is video games). This opportunity implied moving to another country but since it is her birth country (and we thought about coming here a long time before that because we want our son to know this part of his culture) is was a ""one stone, two hits"" type of deal.

My problem is the following :

Two arguments ago, she gave me an ultimatum :""you stop smoking completely or this family is done for"". By the way, I used to smoke cigarettes for a substitute since my heavy smoking days, but after 3 cigarettes a day I am not enjoying it. The taste is not my cup of tea. Since we moved here, I started going to the gym every working day to get in better shape. I also tried stopping smoking cigarettes (started again after 3 months because of a very big argument). And I was smoking my weed maybe once a week or when I went out with colleagues (which is like once or twice a month) in the past months.

On the other hand, I never asked for too many things because I have always loved her the way she is. Except for some things we disagree on our son's education. Once again, we've had argument about that, and whenever we talked about those, I usually cave in or just shut my mouth and let her do her thing if I can do mine. But she promised things that I am still waiting for while the deadline is long due (like staying in our son's bed for him to get to sleep. Just so you know, I have no difficulties putting him to sleep ""the old fashion way"" which is with a story and a good night kiss and the door just a bit open). I am the ""strong"" figure of our couple. And most of the time when limits need to be given, I am the one doing it. But I also know that when my back is turned or I am not there, the limits don't exist anymore (like no TV/iPad at diner, etc...)

I have tried and stopped my sin for her, but I feel like it is just a lie that I am not confortable in. I want to do it again. Not in any regular habit whatsoever but in the weekends or with my friends. Or when I know that I will spend the evening online and that she'll be asleep long before me. It doesn't affect anyone but me like this and it also good for my back (a misplaced bone for 10 years). In the period of time I was doing so without telling her (like a year ago. I know that wasn't a good thing to do but I was avoiding an argument. I came cleaned since then), she did not really see the difference and my temper wasn't such an issue (on the contrary, I was less on edge).

Lately I went out once and because work was closer from my friend's place I stayed over and that was also a big argument, It feels like every time I am doing something ""selfish"" it is the end of the world. But I have taken some awful jobs in the past and I have done everything that I can to keep us happy. Nonetheless ""selfishness"", which is not something I am known for, has become her main argument for what I am doing wrong.

Money is still an issue and we cannot allow ourselves that many recreation or fun time. I am always trying to take my time for any expenses (my parents gave me money for a bike as a birthday gift last july, we were too much in the red zone financially so we spent it and I said that we'll buy it when the time comes...still waiting) but she wants our place fixed (it is an old appartement that we need to remodeled completely) asap and that put us in a difficult situation the past months. She was unemployed since we moved here but this is about to change. And she was doing most of the commodities in the house (I am away 10h a day because of work) and I tried to make everything manageable for her so that she can have some time of her own. Now she can go to some ballet classes before her work training but I had to take early shifts in my work so that I can go and get our son from school.

I don't want to be the guy saying that I am doing everything for her and she is just asking for more. Because she is doing a lot for the 3 us. But somehow, I am trying and I think that I am doing what is requested of me. It's just that some things are going a bit far when I am already doing a lot (but once again so is she). The difference is that I am not asking her to change her habits or to be different. I want her to do what she likes and wants and not forbid me of being myself. When I married her I wanted things to go on forward but I never thought that I had to change completely. I have change and I am trying to be a better person every day but I do not want to be restrained in some image of a man that she wants me to be. Without being able to enjoy life the way I see fit.

So I am here, asking for advice to you guys because I don't know how I should feel anymore.

I don't want to ask my family because they always take too much a side (not especially mine but only one of them is very impartial, the thing is he never had any problem with his spouse or with money so he can't really put himself in my shoes even if he is a very good analyst).

I can't imagine myself without my family but I do not want to be unhappy and limited in the parts that remain ""my"" life.

I know that making your wife happy is the key to a happy marriage, but I do feel selfish when I say this : I also want to have some time to enjoy myself.

174,"Hey Reddit, this is my first post and from my phone. So I came to Reddit for the opinions of helpful strangers. I got out of a relationship about 6 months ago today, and I’ll give a little background before I get to where the question comes from. 
    Her father passed away a few years ago, and she was still finding out how to accept and cope with it. She also played division 1 sports in college, and played sports her whole life so when college and sports were over she felt lost, and I suggested she take up coaching at her old high school to not feel so detached from what she loved. (Which she eventually did.) 
       We met through mutual friends, and started dating after going out for drinks a few times, and she was staying with an overly possessive friend of hers (The kind that can’t understand why she won’t spend all her waking moments with her.) and through the beginning it was tough, but we had fast, deep feelings for one another as we both had said, so we worked through it but it definitely left some strain. She then started a rigorous teaching job for Americorp and had to live in an inner city area that wasn’t so pleasant. 
      Because of this she was severely depressed, and I offered for her to move back to the area with me until she found another job and was able to have her own place and stand on her own feet. It was great when she moved back, I got her a job working for my mothers office (which she stayed at and enjoyed.) she seemed happier, but soon grew resentful of me because of sharing a living space. (Makes sense, but I also gave up my privacy, and it was only temporary.) 
    When she finally found a place, I helped her move in and was happy for her, but could tell she still was distant with me. I gave her space, let her have time to breathe her own air and we only texted. She soon said the spark was gone and we needed to break up. She broke up with me in person, said she wasn’t ready for a partnership, and needed time to enjoy life. I was hurt, and she still tried to talk with me and I wasn’t rude, but I was angry and upset so I wasn’t ready to be best buds. Then 4 months down the road (we had still been talking, and I came to terms with the situation that she needed to be happy herself before being happy with someone else.) I text her and ask if she wanted to grab coffee, she responded that she thought it was a bad idea, that she was seeing someone and was really happy, she still really cared for and admired me,  and hoped I could understand. 
    She had deleted all evidence we were ever together on all her social media’s, and that was where I called her out feeling like it was bullshit. I told her that if she really cared why would she delete all photos of us together, and that if she wasn’t ready for a partnership why is she back in a relationship a few months later? She said it was unexpected and that it wasn’t bullshit. I said that I really tried my best to be there for her and care for her, she responded with “It wasn’t anything you did, I don’t know what you want me to say.” I finished by saying “I’m glad I was an easy scab to peel off.” We haven’t talked since, and I’m over the relationship, but the part I want to know is was my reaction childish jealousy or was I justified to say such?    
     I’m an adult, and will apologize if so, but after everything I did in our relationship to help her improve with her general happiness it leaves one feeling used and hurt, especially when someone else gets to be with them after all the hardship is said and done. ",14Feb2018,1

My class in general is a bit chaotic, alot of people don't care and have given up/generally just bad students. Not to say i'm much better but I definitely care. My teachers have outright said they've given up and have told people they aren't ready and should probably quit. This is impacting my already not so strong mindset.

I lack discipline, and I don't know how to learn how to be disciplined. To do the work I need to, even though the subject of the essay is  just really not my thing. Showing up to class completely destroys any motivation I have for that day but the pressure to attend classes is incredibly high, I did outright tell one teacher simply that, and it seemed there was no problem but I know that will not last. Other reasons that have been affecting me is that, other than my teachers not appearing to give a fuck/help other than when it seems like they might be in trouble, is one is so incredibly disorganised things are given out late, or parts of the criteria just missed, and another being out for a month with surgery, a replacement is in position but it's not nearly the same. The outlook of the whole course is bleak.

If anyone has either been in a similar situation, or knows any other subreddits that could better help me, anything at all. I'm willing to check it out.

I just simply cannot focus on my work from all the stress and negative feelings and thoughts I get when i go to do it, and i shut off. I fell behind, just like everyone else in the class but felt picked on a bit, it was a bit of a snowball from there on out. 

If more information is needed feel free to ask, this post is a bit messy so i apologise, that's just a reflection of how I feel right now I suppose.

180,So I’ve been a hairstylist for 5 years and just got a new job at a new salon to be the salon manager. So basically I’ll still be taking clients and doing hair but I’m also running the whole place I’ve never been a manager before and I want to try to be the best that I can be without coming off as a bitch or like I’m on some sort of power trip. Any and all advice on how to do that would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!,14Feb2018,1
182,"Since graduating from Uni last year and starting to work and make money I tried to enter the dating game after a lifetime of no success - unfortunately this has only continued and arguably gotten worse. In Uni I'd at least get the odd Tinder meet-up but that doesn't even work anymore. OKC and POF have proven a waste of time - in 8 months I've gotten ONE date off these sites which went nowhere. Women in bars aren't interested in speaking with me - I may try approach but they act so standoffish and aloof (which I'm sure is how they treat a lot of lower-quality men), and it completely turns me off from further attempts. I can count on one hand the times a girl my age has initiated a conversation with me (even just platonic context). I don't understand - am I really THAT ugly? Been growing my hair out a little bit as of late. Posted this on photofeeler yesterday and i got like 88% attractiveness which was a bit of a shock to me, considering my online dating results and how women seem to treat me. I'm just wondering what a guy in my position has to do - at this point OI'm beginning to wonder if there's something physically or psychologically wrong with me.

184,"Hello everyone, first time posting here. So my situation mainly revolves around my ex partner and I. So I'll give a little background and then dive straight into the story and current situation.

So I moved about 700 miles away from my parents house a year ago, a few months after I graduated high school to live with my grandparents. Well, I'm not an overly social person and have no friends in the new state that I live in. My university work is purely online at my previous university so I do not have that to go to find people to interact with. I did decide to try to find friendships and possible relationships through Tinder. Well, the first and only one I met is now my ex that I have a complicated relationship with. She is currently pre-operation transgender from male to female. This really doesn't bother me as I always have known her as a female and therefore doesn't seem strange to me. Our first ""date"" was driving the 700 miles back to my hometown with me to visit friends and family for about a week. This was back in the first week of December. While on this trip, we decided to begin formally dating. Only down side to the whole relationship is that my major depression and anxiety begins acting up when I drive and she lives an hour south of me. She doesn't drive so every time we wished to see each other would be me driving down there, staying the night, before driving back up. This took its toll on me but I dealt with it for the time. I would come down there about every week or two. First week of January, I got a new full time job. So now I'm going to school full time, working full time, and began exercising to help with my depression and anxiety. I decided to break up with her and explained that it was because I just did not have the time for the relationship because my schedule is full. I also have slowly learned that I am rather not relationship focused nor able to properly display my feelings. I made the stupid decision to allow her to move into my apartment with me at the beginning of April. I do not want a relationship anymore but I do not mind her living in my apartment due to being out of the house most the time.

How would I break it to her that I do not want a relationship with her but continue to allow her to live with me because if not, she'll be homeless?

If you need anymore info to help me, feel free to ask. Thank you.",14Feb2018,1
185,"Hey ladies and gentlemen, so this is going to cover basically what's happened in the past few days.  My wife (25) and I (29) have been together for 8 years and married for 6.  We have two children, a 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy.  Our marriage has always been up and down, but never reaching the point of self destruct really. So here is how everything happened:

About 18 days ago, my wife had a super early term miscarriage. 
 When we noticed that she was late, she took a couple of pregnancy tests a few days spaced.  The last one actually read pregnant and she got excited.  I actually panicked and couldn't show much of anything.  She mistook this as not caring and once the miscarriage happened, she didn't expect me to be there for her, which I was trying to.  I've never been able to really express myself emotionally or romantically very well.  I grew up in a pretty bad house and my parents never got along. I never really learned how to be ""that guy"".  Well, for the next couple of weeks, she was really dismissive and distant.  We would still hold hands, kiss, and sex once but it didn't feel the same.  Something about her felt disconnected.  I thought nothing of it, like usual, and kept on with my life.  There were times where things were back to normal, her giddy self would come out and we would be able to have fun together, but after an hour it would go away.  It only started to concern me when she started pushing herself away from me when we were in bed sleeping. She would bring in a different blanket and sleep on her side with it.

I confronted her on Sunday and she finally broke down, explaining that she was done.  She was unhappy.  She felt like she depended on me too much and she felt it was a burden on me, which it was not.  She said she didn't think I was capable of caring, loving, or being romantic.  I apologized and tried to reconcile but she ""had her mind set"".

Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep after that.  She went to work the following days, with us just exchanging ""Hey"" and ""See you later"" but that was it.  I couldn't take it and last night I told her that we needed to talk.  She sat down and the first thing out of her mouth was her mind was set and she wasn't happy.  Now, something about me is when I was little, my parents fought constantly.  I used to hide in my room with my computer to escape it and it became a terrible habit that grew on me.  During the last few days, I came to terms with it and realized that my gaming addiction has drawn a glass wall between my wife and kids and I and I want to fix that.  I told her that I recognized the toxicity in my life and I was ready to give it up to keep her.  I pleaded for another chance, that I was done being dumb, stupid, and neglectful.  I told her I realize that I've never been truly romantic and I've never tried to swoop her off of her feet, like I once did long ago.  She fought and fought with me, explaining that she was done but also kept asking me how I felt I could change things and what I could do to fix the marriage.  I felt like she was letting me in but was trying to hold herself against the idea.  After about an hour of explaining myself, she broke down and told me I'd have one last little chance.  She seemed super regretful about doing it, as we've had these issues in the past but it never came to a head like this.  Divorce had never been brought up.  She truly believes I don't know how to change for her, but I really do.

What can I do?  I know the marriage is super tender at this point, and I'm scared to even touch her.  I got upset when she said she wanted a divorce and asked for her ring.  It somehow felt ""official"" for me.  She was super reluctant to give it to me, but ended up doing so.  I want to give it back to her and work on things but I have no idea where to start or how.  I'm terrible at romance and I'm truly scared to lose her.  She's been my savior and my life.  I don't want to screw this up. I want to do things right this time.  I know this post is all over the place, but so are my thoughts.",14Feb2018,1

191,"So I worked as a teacher and just handed in my notice. I've only worked as one for seven months and thought I could stick out the year but that's just impossible. My workload is insane (7:30am I get in, home at 9pm and I work through the weekends and holidays) and I'm somehow still not progressing.

What do I do for the next four weeks? Am I qualified for administrative work? Am I going to be ok? What should I do as a career instead? What job do I get now? 

There's not an immediate financial issue. I know it's the right choice but it is definitely a lot to deal with and any help from people who have been through something similar would help.

Edit for clarity:
1. I am applying for anything and everything at the minute to tide me over
2. I am clueless about what to do long term or what I'm even qualified for - I have excellent high school grades, an undergraduate degree, and also my teaching degree.
3. The issue is less about the workload itself and more about how this workload is still not helping me progress, and still making me feel miserable - as though I'm shovelling time into a black-hole and getting nothing back as I'm still shit at this job haha. ",14Feb2018,3

194,"Hey everyone
I can't think of a better sub or place to let this out. 

I'm in my final semester of college. Everyone's cracking up good jobs (a lot have already started working full-time, while some are interns). It hadn't been of much importance so far, but recently, all my good friends got placed at various good companies. That felt a little weird, but I got myself together in a couple days and was focused again.

Here's where it went rough from. About 20-25 days later, my girlfriend also started working as an intern at this good place in a sales profile. Decent compensation and all. It has been a week, and stuff has started to take a hit. We're barely able to talk and connect for half an hour a day. When she's at work I can simply not call/text, and its just that she also stays busy and taking time out hasn't been easy for her I think. I understand she might still be adjusting to the new routine (stays out of home for 13 hours), but I've been feeling really weird.

I don't know what to do. The sudden shift is hard to adapt to, and I feel I have to push myself to even have that 45-60 minutes a day. I feel a bit lesser for some reason, and listening to how good the work is, and the colleagues are friendly, and about all the food and benefits and everything, I am maybe a bit jealous, but more than that I feel a bit lesser valued. Some way that I should be more open to negotiation. I don't want to talk to her about it either, because once we very briefly talked about it and she was like ""you can do it, you've got potential. wait for your time"" and all, but we all know that hardly helps. Even then, it didn't feel like she was willing to put herself in my shoes and understand. She's a bit too focused, happy and involved within her new work.

I keep thinking about it multiple times a day, and it drives a spear through my concentration and focus. I really need to be working to land a very decent job, but I can't. Talking to her (even during that bare hour) has suddenly become less enjoyable, and less connecting, since  it feels like the effort has to come more from my side. I feel like going away from home, not talking to anyone for a few days and going somewhere in the mountains for a few days as an excursion. But I realized this tendency to withdraw and isolate might worsen the situation.

I need to get my shit together and I don't know how.

She started pushing me away for these friends, and ends up telling one of them she would be friends with me in a week or so.
I was hurt that our friendship was a joke to her, and said some things I regret. It has been about a month since this happened, and I figured now would be a good time to try and patch things up. I don't know what to say to her. It kills me knowing that wd may never be friends again.",14Feb2018,2

203,"This is guna be a long post, sorry in advance.

Where did it *really* start? I duno

As a baby my mum (never have met my dad physically) always said I was the easiest baby to take care of, I didn’t cry much and I was a pretty happy go lucky kid until 3rd grade or so. I liked playing with my friends on my street, Girls in my class were crushing on me, I played tons of video games but it was with friends a lot too. 

I had been playing lacrosse since I was in 2nd grade. I liked it quite a bit and I was ok but only ever scored a couple goals in my life in both box and field lacrosse. I mainly just didn’t like the pressure of tryin to score and upsetting my teammates so I was an assist player and defense. 

I got a bit fat and pretty self conscious even though I was working out and playing a lot. I thinned out in my teens though

I had serious issues with feeling guilty about things kids don’t feel guilty about, that really molded my personality.  I once carved my name into the underside of a bench with a rock. I immediately felt so bad and anxious and guilty and ashamed over something so tiny. Everyday I couldn’t get over what I had done, this went on for three months where the anxiety and dread, that I couldn’t explain, ate at my soul. I was in the supermarket with my mum and began crying and confessed. I felt better and it wasn’t a big deal after that. This happened a lot of times.

For whatever reason i isolated myself from just about everyone in fifth grade. I fell into a bout of depression that was so severe I would get in bed at 5pm so that I didn’t have to be awake any longer than possible. I escaped into book and video games in the day

I had a pet dog who had died the year prior. I think that’s when it really started. After a while I believed he was reincarnated as my stuffed dog who i took with me to school everyday in my pack. 

Eventually I tried my first attempt. I sliced my fingers with the apparent hope i would bleed out. I didn’t understand why i did this at the time, but my mom immediately got me into therapy. 

I was dreafully terrified at therapy sessions. I had three a week. I just cried and cried and didn’t even understand why whenever i went. I thought i was broken. I developed a lasting phobia of doctors and therapists. 

I eventually lied and lied about my depression until I convinced everyone i was just “different and quiet” but not depressed anymore. 

I kept that a secret for a decade later. It got worse, i became totally withdrawn from life. I developed fake online personas that i could escape into. I eventually lost the ability to communicate effectively in real life. My social skills stagnated. I developed rabid social anxiety and self conscious issues

began stealing my moms liquor and went to school half drunk. My mom confronted me a bunch but she was a trouble child so she thought it wasn’t really an issue

I broke down when i was 18 and asked my mom to take me to the doctor to get medication. I was put on Lexapro and Xanax. Yes, they gave an 18 year old over 400-500mg of Xanax in the span of a year or two. I used it sparingly but still quite often when i had to communicate with real people. Xanax was just perfect, it made me normal. 

I should mention i graduated high school with straight A’s because of how hard i was on myself. I got a full tuition paid scholarship to university. 

At uni I never had friends in real life, still don’t (6th semester). People terrify me. 

I was living off money from a relatively successful but kinda illegal website, I’d say over 100,000 usd went through that paypal by the time i turned 19 and shut it down. Most of it went back into advertising and maintenance. 

I got this terrible ear infection that totally corroded my eardrum, it hurt so bad. My mom gave my hydrocodone and the doctor prescribed me some other opiate. 

Boy oh boy, that bottle of 50 hydrocodone my mom kept stashed in the cabinet did not last long that summer. To this day some of my fondest memories are nodding off at 4am watching movies and playing Minecraft. 

This is where i realized, wow I am an addict to drugs. I never got my hands on any more opiates after that. 

I went through a bad bad breakup with someone. I didn’t cope and broke down. I went to therapy and the psychiatrist. They prescribed me all sorts of SSRIs, xans and klonopin. I went to therapy twice a week with a counselor after i told my mum i felt like dying sometimes (all the time)

I did however start taking kratom, a mild opioid, that I purchased online. I still have a few spoonfuls a day. 

I got really into alcohol. I started brewing my own apple juice and wine. That shit was gnarly but goddamn I’ll be damned if it was at least 13% alcohol.

I turned 21 and now I’m a total alcoholic, in university, with no real passions, stuck in a major I have to complete that is so difficult with a 3.1gpa, no friends to speak of, no interest in making friends, an undying love for all things benzo and opioids, fear of change, and love for depression since I’ve never known anything else.

All I do is work my 2 jobs. And take my dog for his needed walks and loves. 
I don’t see my friends anymore, they don’t even text now. I can’t afford to go out and see them and do the things they do. 
I’m behind , never getting anywhere. 
I start to climb (1 step forward 2 steps back). 

Just recently I would of finally be ahead of bills by a whole paycheck. Which is huge. But instead my car decided to fall apart right when I got the money and it literally used it all. I had to actually borrow money for a loan just to pay the rest. It’s just getting frustrating and exhausted and I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I am thankful for what I have. 
A roof over my head, my dog and car. 
But that’s it. And that’s not what life is about and I know that. 
But I don’t eat, can’t afford to. 
I stretch out meals for as long as possible. Eating once a day. My dog needs to eat. So he comes first. No worries there. 
I don’t see my friends, all they do is spend money and go out. I can’t do that at the moment.

Not sure what else I can do to get myself ahead of the game again.

206,"Yesterday I used this app called OfferUp to sell digital merchandize to an individual. It was some audio software. He says it isn't legit and that I'm ""faulty"" for selling it to him. When in fact, I know 100% that it works fine. He sent me a video of the problem he's encountering in the program and says that he once bought another program that's used for the same purpose and never once had to do all this ""extra"" work so he thinks I ripped him off. The thing is though, its a really simple thing to fix. After you first install the software it has a LOT of on screen events going on in a demo song that showcases the programs capabilities. I know how to fix it its literally so easy but tbh the dude is in like his 40s or 50s and doesn't seem to understand what I'm telling him. I asked him basic shit like what settings he was using and how much GB his computer is and he thinks just because his computers hard drive has a lot of space that it should run perfectly... 
Now here's the real kicker, he knows where I live. I was so confident that the file worked fine that I had him come to my home and I already spent most of the money. The item was 100% legit and worked. The only reason it was slowing down his computer and acting ""choppy"" and ""skipping"" as he put it is because the demo track eats up a lot of CPU. 
So yeah, am I obligated to give this guy anything in return? he knows my address but he doesn't know that I'm moving within a week or two lol.

207,"So, I'm in my second semester of college and things didn't go so well for me last semester; I barely passed 3 out of 4 classes. My issue is pretty common, procrastination, but this year I want to work on it and get better about doing my work consistently. However getting started seems to be more of a problem than I thought it would be.

After I've resolved myself to start working I have to work myself up to starting, it gets to the point where I am physically resisting to start my work. I start experiencing high amounts of stress and I start having mini freak-outs. I start feeling a discomfort in my chest and the room starts feeling several degrees hotter than it was before.  I manage to push through then I'm alright, I don't feel stressed and I can move along with my work as long as I don't break focus.

If I stop I just can't get back to it even after resolving myself to work consistently. A break that was supposed to be 10 minutes could go on for 10 days until I have my next burst of work. Admittedly, its like this in other parts of my life. For example, I don't clean my room until I get tired of seeing the mess and clean until the rooms spotless, but then I let the mess build up again and the cycle continues.

I'm starting to think I might have an aversion to any work. Hell, I can't even consistently commit to my hobbies outside of video games. I can't practice piano for at least an hour a day, but I can somehow spend hours practicing a game like league of legends and spend even more time learning about how to improve at it.

I've heard a lot of the advice given for procrastinators, but I couldn't even commit to that.

209,"Hey all. [27F]. Long story short, my dad has always wanted me to follow in his footsteps. I wanted to be a teacher, he convinced me to get a business degree. I wanted to get a marketing job straight out of college, he convinced me to interview with his friend at her company in his industry in a business support position so I could move into business analytics. I got a marketing and communications position next (second job), he wanted me to leave and get into a more serious analytical position. when I told them I planned to move across the world, with my now husband, he was sending me jobs in our home state trying to convince me to stay. 

So now I live in Europe, I’m looking for a job, it’s been promising, and every time I check in with my parents, I let them know about all of the marketing opportunities I’ve applied for and been interviewed for. Today, my dad sent me three financial/business analyst positions at his company in my country and he seems not to hear me when I say I’m looking for a marketing position. One of them was a senior position I have no relevant experience for. Then he sent me a position for a senior sales support position and is the step before sales (at an insurance company, not for marketing) and if I tell him I’m trying to find marketing, he just glosses over that part and tells me I’ll have more opportunities in the company once I get in and when I move back home in a few years, I’ll have even more opportunities. 

I have a really close relationship with him and my mom and he’s always been a “helper.” I know he’s just trying to be nice and wants to help since I don’t have a job. I’ve always been a people pleaser and have a hard time telling people no because I don’t want to hurt their feelings and I especially don’t want to hurt my dads feelings? 

TLDR; how can I get firmly get through to my dad and handle his repeated attempts at changing my career path that I’m not interested in going into analytics like him and I have a huge interest in marketing without completely hurting his feelings or coming off like a bitch?",14Feb2018,0

We talked like once in November and twice in December. In November, I asked if there was anything wrong, and she said: ""I feel lethargic, I'd rather stay in bed than anything else."" She also said she wasn't attending classes at the time. We had laughs here and there but that's it. She recently had lost some weight and said: ""I wanna have a big booty."", I laughed a little and gave her tips on exercises she could do. This was December and we kept talking, then she stopped again.

I'm really worried because she has attemped suicide in the past. The last message she responded to was me saying that I admired her and that she was strong, she responded with a heart emoji. She's been reblogging stuff on her Tumblr regularly.

225,"Hello all, hopefully it’s ok to ask for interview advice on this sub. I’m a Senior Marketing Executive that has been looking for the step up to Marketing Manager for a year. 

Last week I found the perfect position, I hit all their desirable experience required and I currently work in their industry. Even better the pay is a massive increase and they are close by. Basically, I massively want the role.

They want me to prepare two presentations, the one based on my competency “what will you do in your first month as manager” I can handle. However the second one is a little different...

“Within 15 minutes please present your “heraldic shield” (coat of arms). This can be presented in any format. This should include your motto, your strengths, your greatest achievements and key skills. Please also present how this links your ability to bring added value to our Marketing Manager role. 

The objective is to find out more about you and what you can bring to the company and to showcase your ability to communicate and engage through alternative methods”

I can talk about these things fine but the method is alien to me and makes me wince a bit thinking of putting this together.

Has anyone dealt with anything like this in the past or has any ideas how to wow them?

TIA!",14Feb2018,1

227,"I have a brand new leased car. 2017 Honda civic. I took it for it's first oil change in August. (It has 10,700 miles). I don't drive it much and rarely on the highway. It is mostly for commuting to work. 

Yesterday I drove it on the highway and heard a scraping noise. I pulled over and saw the skid plate was hanging down. My first thought was I must have hit something. But then I noticed it was held in place by zip ties... 

So my thought process is that the dealership broke it during the oil change and instead of telling me zip tied it in place. And driving during the snow may have broken a zip tie loose. 

I'm at the dealership now and they will look at it. But because it was 6 months ago they are already acting like it wasn't their fault.

Is it there fault?

Should I demand a new skid plate and they pay for it?

Should I accept them bending it back in place and securing it with more zip ties?",14Feb2018,1

229,"Last week my employer sent out a notice to all employees stating they implemented a new adoption benefit policy that enables employees to take advantage of the following benefits if they adopt a child:


$5000 reimbursement to help with costs

Three weeks paid leave (70% of salary) 


In the policy it states that in the event both “parents” work for the company, the benefit only applies to one “person.” 

With that said, it doesn’t specify if only pertains the the mother, inferring it could apply to the father, should he be the one to take advantage of the benefit. 

Just like most companies in the US, my employer doesn’t offer paternity leave. So here is my dilemma ..... how the hell can they offer a man three weeks paid leave when they adopt a child but no paid leave when they have a child of their own??? 

I sent a email to my benefits department and the director called me in the phone and basically said they don’t anticipate many people taking advantage of the new adoption benefit and that It would take a while to implement a paternity benefit but he doesn’t think it would happen due to costs. I asked him for a follow up email because I want his response in writing. 

So what are my options here? I’m about to have my second kid in April and feel there is a big issue here and that I should be able to receive three weeks paid leAve instead of having to us my PTO and apply for unpaid FMLA.

234,"TLDR; Bf and his ex co-owned a dog. Now he's dead and she wants the dog but I'm concerned she is incapable of taking care of it due to possibly current and definitely past use of hard drugs. Her parents are involved, but may not know the extent of her problems.

How do I make my argument to get the dog without just shitting on her in front of her parents? They know she struggles but I'm not sure to what extent. Should I confront her one on one? I think she'll deny everything. How can I get the support of her parents without being a total insensitive asshole? Is the dog rightfully hers regardless of my or my bf's wishes?

Edit: Adding the questions to the top.

Long version: Okay I'll be clear. My boyfriend killed himself almost a month ago. He had a horrific childhood and always struggled with depression. I met him when he asked me for help getting off of meth. He got clean, broke up with his gf that was using, and took their dog with him.

Of course his ex assumes the dog should be hers, but she's had no problem letting me take care of it while she tried to get her shit together after his death. My boyfriend took care of the dog alone for 8 months, paid for everything, and she still tried to take the dog from him recently before he died. He was going to give up anything and everything to keep that dog out of her hands. The dog was the only thing that kept him alive some days and he didn't think she could take care of it.

She was the one who got him hooked on hard drugs and she refused my help when I tried to help them both get clean. After he broke up with her she moved in and began dating their mutual friend who as I understand it was supplying the drugs. She hasn't outright said it but has implied that she is clean and said her bf is trying to stay clean as well. They live in a trailer with another mutual friend who seems more responsible.

It's sensitive because technically the dog is hers and she has a very close emotional attachment to it, as does her whole family. She and my bf dated for a very long time. But I am terrified the dog will be neglected. Every time I see the gf she is very pale and sniffling a lot. She is constantly sick. She couldn't get to his place to help clean it out, often because she could not afford the gas to get there. How can she possibly afford a dog then, on top of her two cats and snake? I'm clean, responsible, have a steady, salaried job and a house with a big fenced in yard.

I approached her parents about this a while ago, leaving out the gory details (drugs and money problems) and they agreed that I was better suited to take care of the dog, but that the wounds of my bf's death were too fresh and to put off the topic until we were all starting to heal. 

Now she's asking for the dog back. We're about to meet at my bf's place to clean it out, which was her job mind you, but apparently she couldn't get anything done in the past 9 days while I was out of town and unable to help her. 

How do I make my argument without just shitting on her in front of her parents? They know she struggles but I'm not sure to what extent. Should I confront her one on one? I think she'll deny everything. How can I get the support of her parents without being a total insensitive asshole? Is the dog rightfully hers regardless of my or my bf's wishes?",14Feb2018,2

I was a pretty good student in the high school with pretty good grades (in Slovakia, There is 1 to 5 system of grades, with 1 the best and 5 the worst. First 3 years I had straight 1s.) Then, when I was 17-18 I started to going out with my friends, started to drink a lot at the weekends and stuff. All my motivation and my drive to study was lost. I finished the high school with average grades and went to an Uni to study IT. Well, for the first few weeks of the semester I was trying to write the notes, to do the homework, to code in my freetime etc. Then, It all started to go back to the old me - not trying, not taking notes, partying a lot on fridays, doing stuff that isnt important.. we all have been there in some time in our lifes I guess. The worst part is, I hate that I am not doing anything, that I am just wasting my time but I cant do anything about it. I am just procrastinating more and more. Well, I also found out that I dont want to be studying IT. Well, I really like hiking and I go hiking from time to time with one of my friend. In Slovakia there is a lot of mountains, so there is a lot of good hiking paths and stuff. I am really enjoying this part of my life. I would say about myself that I am a very positive kind of person I love when people are positive and are happy and such. I am also trying to get fit a little bit more I am jogging from time to time. But the most important thing is that I am not giving any time to improving myself as a young person that wants to have a successful life. You know what I mean? I just procrastinate. Well, back to the topic that I dont want to be in IT. I was telling everyone for last 7-8 that I want to be a programmer or somebody like that. The truth is I was just lying to myself. I have never taken IT and coding as my hobby. I havent code a single line in my High School just for fun or as it should be my hobby. Now I am thinking that I am going to start the Uni again but to study management. As I wrote, I am kinda a positive person in some way, and I like to talk about things about how to motivate people, how to be efficient etc. The thing is I need a serious help how to change myself... I know what I am doing wrong with my life and what should Ive been doing. The thing is I am just not doing it. I am thinking that I should see a psychologist or something to help me with this. To help me with not wasting my whole life when I have the idea how to live, but not doing it. Please help me, have you been through stuff like this? What helped? What should I do?",14Feb2018,1

I’m a 13 year old Danish boy, and I’ve dealt A LOT with deppresion. I have been bullied my whole life, and never gad any *real* friends. I had like 5 friends, but they all started changing alot (yes, I know they’re going through puberty). I still have like 2 *friends*, these two are very childish, and very weak at making decisions and such. My lost friends are getting fuckboi-ish and trying to get all the girls attention, and dress Gucci/Supreme-ish. They start calling me wierd and depri (short for deppresed). Don’t get me wrong, I would like a GF too, but my eyes are fucked, my jaw is super wide and my hair is, and has always been, a mess. So to summarise, I’m extremely deppresed and don’t have any friends.
Where can a boy like me get REAL friends, who appreciate my existence? I can’t go to bars, and i would like to lose some weight, but I’m very poor, so I can’t afford to go to a gym, but I think that’d be the only thing that would motivate me.
Because I’m shy, where/how do I get real friends?

247,"Our small company has been going through some financial stresses recently – we have contracts signed in the pipeline but the projects keep getting pushed back so we haven't received payment for almost two months. This is very stressful on both of us, but I'm coming here for advice on what I should consider the limit of stress expression should be, what is the line that shouldn't be crossed.

Of course, the main solution here is to find a financial solution that would bridge our dip in funds and carry us over until the next project launch, but with approaching the next month of no payment plus now not being able to pay for our insurances for March, the stresses have risen quite significantly. I understand that.

I handle my stress privately, but I do have the capacity to let go, cry in front of others, or raise my voice in a discussion. I do not like this and I try to immediately take responsibility for my expressions, and when I sense the upcoming day is going to be very stressful for me, I will try to alter my environment or my headspace to accommodate while not allowing the work to fall through the cracks. My partner does the same, except he is far more emotional than I am and, in my opinion, could benefit from introducing similar methods to handle stress. He can be reactive (going from completely fine at 9:00am to having an anxiety attack at 9:30 after reminding himself of our account fund numbers, despite already understanding what those are). He also suggests solutions based on the immediate feeling of stress he is having, such as looking for another job or accusing us of not seeing eye-to-eye. 

This has happened so often that I now openly call his bluff and just look forward to the following conversation when he has sobered up. The discussions there are usually very productive and allows for us to plan out solutions and strategies what would be best for one other and the company. It is also here in these post-reactive conversations that I am reaffirmed that our company foundation is strong, we do have funds in the pipeline that we can pay ourselves back for the missed paychecks, that he does actually believe that our partnership is the best solution and we are contributing a lot to our industry as a team. 

I already know this, and I feel I have a better understanding of how to handle immediate reactive emotions – they are temporary, but still very relevant to the larger issue. I can offer support and I never try to dismiss the content of which the stress is based on, however, these outbursts have been interrupting our workday momentum – which brings us to today.

I have known my partner for years and we have worked together wonderfully at past organizations. I understand stress is very, very high right now and I try to empathize with his perspective. However, today, as we were working from his place, the stress got so significant that I felt physically unsafe for the first time. 

We were discussing a project needing changes, which would require his specific expertise. I think that on top of everything caused him to lash out, act ""aggressive"" (his words) by standing up and walking toward me firmly while telling me to ""get the fuck out"". I was trying to grab my bag and phone while also trying to explain that I was leaving but just needed my things, and he continued to walk toward me. I ended up leaving a few items behind and walking out. He didn't follow me to the door, he sat back down part of the way through my packing and went back to work while angerily mumbling to himself. 

That was the first moment I have felt physcially unsafe around him. I try to empathize and see where he is coming from, but in my head it is unacceptable to allow someone else to feel unsafe due to your own emotions. On a typical day, I would say the idea of him harming me would be unimaginable – I don't expect him to threaten me or actually harm me. But this instance is causing me to question that confidence. 

He's since apologized and tried calling me over and over asking to talk about our situation (the financial issue causing the stress). I don't know if I should let this instance slide and treat it like another stress-induced reaction or if I should consider other actions. There's more I can say about how I am feeling, but I think this post is long enough. An outside perspective would definitely be appreciated here.

TLDR: Partner and I have been feeling stressed over our company's financial situation. He has always expressed stress in ways that disrupt but ultimately bounce back to maintain our productivity. However, for the first time, this particular stress-induced reaction from my partner left me feeling physically unsafe for the first time. I don't know if I should treat this outburst with empathy like the other outbursts or view it in a different light. 

I truly appreciate your advice. Thanks in advance.",14Feb2018,1
249,"So ... I am a very anxious person, especially when it comes to things related to health. I'm always thinking that in the future the doctor will diagnose me some kind of serious illness, I'm almost sure of that, but right now go to the doctor isn't an option.

250,"(Posting from mobile) 

So, to start off, I am 23 years old, I recently left a job of three years where I was supervisor, right under general manager/owner and moved into a position as an assistant/entry level position in an entirely different field of which I have never been exposed to (radio broadcast) in late November. I also got married (two weeks after starting new job) to a wonderful,beautiful woman with two beautiful children (8 yo son and 3 yo daughter) who I hope to both adopt one day. And now we also have one on the way (YAY!!!).

Anyways, I had a lot of things under control and figured out at my last job and it was an okay transition from worker to supervisor. This job, not more than a month after I’ve started they have given me the jobs of: Janitorial services at the studio on Tuesdays and Thursdays, facilities maintenance, assistant/ resident engineer, remote broadcast set up and tear down, tending to the transmitters (e.g. janitorial and light maintenance), errand boy for bank and mail runs, parts runs, public file upkeep and management, general handyman, checking transmitter readings logs for mistakes and deteriorating power output/efficiency/whatever to see if they are in need of repair, I think that’s everything.. but no doubt after posting this I will think of some more. 

As you can see, from basically being born yesterday into this brand new field, I’ve been thrown into a volcanos. If the above list doesn’t make it seem that way, I also get calls from all hours of the night and day from the consulting engineer (my supervisor) to go back into town (I live 30 miles from where I work) to turn the power down on the transmitter so that if ice builds up on the antenna it won’t burn up due to reflected power. And these remote broadcasts have me working late so I am usually pulling a 10-12 hour shift during weekdays and then also working weekends remotes where it’s a few hours (not bad but I still have to leave my family and commute). I haven’t been able to spend more than 3-5 consecutive hours with my new family since starting this job. A little more insight, the previous guy whom I replaced was there for 30+ years, so I assume he gathered these other job requirements throughout that 30+ years and didn’t get them all out on him at once, he also spent his whole life working in this field. Also, I get $800 per 2 weeks salary, no overtime pay, with $25 per commercial remote broadcast (those that are paid for by a company to promote their business), however most of these broadcasts are promotional so I do not get paid for most of them.

My wife and I hate it, my kids hate it, but it’s the only job that pays enough around here that didn’t require any prior experience. Going back to the old job is not an option.. for mental and physical health reasons. This job feels worse though... I hardly get any time with my family and we haven’t been able to plan any trips or outings, and my wife and I haven’t been on a date since we got engaged (not counting the honeymoon). And when I do get home I’m too tired and exhausted to help around the house.. I play with the kids and try to spend time with her as much as I can when I get home because I’m always ripped away, and then after playing I’m especially exhausted. The wife is of course exhausted too because she keeps the kids from fighting before I get home (you know brothers and sisters especially with that age gap), she’s carrying a baby, and she works with emotionally disturbed/special needs/juvenile criminals at our local alternative school. Which she is also very new to. So she’s just as exhausted as I am, if not more.. 

Sometimes I don’t even get to go to church with them. Thankfully we have been able to go a lot recently. 

What advice can you give me? I’m so overwhelmed.. I want to be a good husband and father and also be able to provide for my family.. I just don’t know what to do..

263,"So about 4 weeks ago I confessed my feelings to this girl in my class. We ended up going out on a few dates and kissed a couple of times. After that she told me that she isn't ready for a relationship right now because she's in a really bad place (which I believe because of some things she told and I saw) she also said the she doesn't want to ""lead me on"" and that she ""wouldn't be a good girlfriend"" 

I told her that I understand and that maybe when she's ready we can get together. Since then we've been hanging out almost everyday and I've met her family. However recently I've started to think that maybe I should move on because of some things that have happened. 

First off, she told me that she cut a guy out of her life that she loved. She was really in love with him and said that he ""choose someone else again"" I should mention he's a few years older than us (we're in highschool) so I think maybe he is just trying to let her down gently because he knows it would be wrong to be with her but that's just a guess. I mention this because it most likely (to me) means she is waiting for this guy to give her a chance and so she wouldn't want to be with someone in case that chance ever comes. 

Secondly, she has told me a few times that I should move on now ""Before we fall in love and can't move on"" and that she would try to set me up with someone. I. have no problem with moving on but I want to make sure it's the right choice. As for her setting me up with a friend, I feel like she could be trying to make me move on? 

To be honest I'm not really sure if I really do like this girl or not, she is a nice girl but whenever we're together I just feel...nothing inside. I mean we have a good time together but I don't really feel anything when I'm with her. Also I've started to think that she is using me for the attention I give her since she is often alone and she has a lot of problems with anxiety and depression and says that I make her ""feel safe and comfortable"" 

So my question is, should I move on? Should I just cut off contact or maybe take a few days to myself and stop spending so much time with her and giving her this much attention? 

This post is probably a mess and terribly worded and I apologize for that. I guess I'm just trying to get some outside help, I'm only 16 so I know that I still have a lot to learn about relationships and people in general. 

Tldr: A girl told me she isn't ready for a relationship but recent events have made me wonder if it's worth it to wait around for her. ",14Feb2018,1

268,"I work with my mom for a small company (&lt;50 people) and we both work in the same building but have different managers. She is currently trying to find another job and has stopped talking to everyone who works in the building. Before she would joke with everyone and be in a great mood, however now she just comes in and does her job and leaves. For the past few weeks, she has been telling me that she is looking for another job (and as of today she landed a new job, but it doesn't start for a few weeks). So now she is taking unnecessary sick days and vacation days to drain, while also telling me she isn't planning on giving a two weeks notice. I've told her that she needs to give a two-weeks notice (she's worked for the company for 10+ years) because I don't want them to look at me and think I'm just like her and have a negative view of me. We are nothing alike and I get along with everyone who works here. I am just conflicted on whether to let her manager know what she is doing and to inform the company so they don't look at me and say ""did you know?"" I am unsure what to do.

 tl;dr: My mom who I work with for a small company is being rude to everyone and is leaving her job of 10+ years without notice and leaving me conflicted on what to say to the company so they don't have a negative view on me.

269,"I have turned to this sub for various questions about choosing studies with varied success. Now I'm back for one of the final steps: choosing where. Again, I'm pretty desparate. I've set my sights on going in the Game Design direction. Now I have two (or maybe more) choices on where to go do this:

I can stay in my home country of the Netherlands and study in a different city than where I lived most of my life - in Utrecht. Utrecht is one of the top 3 student cities in the Netherlands with loads of activities and life. The program here is 4 years at a University of Applied Sciences. I will get a Bachelor of Arts degree when I finish it. Costs per year are roughly 2.100EUR for tuition fees, books etc. excluded, so that's not more than 8.500EUR for the whole program. The program is in Dutch, which may be a slight disadvantage for me.

The other choice is Vancouver. I will be going to a community college there, and be rewarded with a Canadian diploma. The program is 7 semesters, for a total price of 31.000EUR, books etc. also excluded. Vancouver is a vibrant place for game design and arts in general. My big dream is to someday emigrate to Canada, so this would bring me one step closer to that. 

Of course I have to be admitted to both schools, and for Canada I also need to be cleared for a student visa. That means that neither schools might not be an option, depending on if I will be selected. I'm currently looking into the admission exercises. I've already been in contact with both schools, and both still seem to have a place for me if I act quickly. Let's just neglect the admission and visa requirements for the next part.

If the cost of the school in Vancouver wasn't so enormous I think the choice would've been easy: I'd go to Canada. Then again, the level of education would be a bit lower I think. They say that a Diploma is roughly comparable to two years of University of Applied Sciences. Another reason to move to Vancouver is the beautiful scenery around the city. I love mountains and nature, but also cities. Another reason against it would be that I'd be moving to the other side of the world. I can't take a lot of my stuff with me either.
The study program seems pretty incredible to be honest. You're being taught Game Art and Design but you'll also have a lot of connections with students of other faculties. Film and TV has always been a huge interest of mine so I might be able to get connections into that field more easily there.

Honestly, writing this out, Utrecht doesn't have many advantages over Vancouver. One would definitely be cost. Not only tuition fees but I think cost of living are much lower too. I am at least 100% sure that I can get a loan for studying in the Netherlands. I can probably get a loan for studying abroad but that's not as sure. I'm going to call the organisation soon, it's something I've needed to do either way ever since September. Another thing is that I'd stll be living relatively close to my family. All of them would live roughly one hour away, if not less. I've got other friends studying in Utrecht too. The big disadvantages are that I will be living as close to nature as possible, but Dutch nature is not really a thing. It's a bit of hills and fields, heavily regulated. Another one is that the school is in a relatively boring, non-attractive neighborhood, while Utrecht is one of the most beautiful cities in the country. I will visit the school March 21st so by then I'll have an idea.

My biggest internal debate is cost-to-reward though. A 31k diploma vs. a 8.5k BsA degree. I will be paying the rest of that money mostly for the experience, which I might end up hating after all. At least when I stay at home I'll have the option to back out. (That part is also a disadvantage, because I already backed out of one program because it was the easier way to go. If I have little options because I'm on the other side of the world, I think I'd be able to motivate myself better)

What do you guys think after reading this? Any helpful insights? If you say ""follow your dreams"" I'd know what to do (that is, I'd go to Canada), but the rational part of my mind says that might not be such a great plan.",14Feb2018,2

275,"Hi, I’m in the US 

I had to leave high school because of health issues , and got a high school equivalency diploma a few months ago. 

I’m going to college soon but need advice on things I should know or **classes I should take**. 

I’m interested writing, poetry, and philosophy but very open to other options or even trying out things I don’t think I’d enjoy. 
I read business is a good choice (thoughts?). 


I feel like my situation might allow for more *flexibility* in terms of classes since I’m so young. 

I’m worried about how others will react to me because I look VERY visibly like a 16 year old if not younger ( small, short , skinny ). 

Also, I’m afraid they’re gonna think I’m some kind of genius when that is not the case. 


I don’t know if I should take the SATs or ACTs because I plan on going to community college for 2 years and I’m pretty sure it’s unnecessary. Should I? And going to community college first is a smart choice right? 

In terms of math I am behind but the college I’m looking into has a placement test and one of the results is high school math ( I have a family member TERRIBLE [worse than me] at math who took this ). 

To be honest subjects aren’t hard to me ( not to sound cocky ! ) **if** I study, which I plan to do. 

Biggest Strength: 
Writing ( any advice on what to do on the mean time to advance ? Maybe books I should read ? )

Biggest Weakness: 
Science 
Being social

We are not close, I would not consider her one of my friends. 

I'm getting married in September and my parents are really pressuring me to have my sister as my maid of honor. I have told them that I don't want her standing in that position or giving a speech, who knows what she would even say! I've caved and attempted to reach out to her 3-4 times in the last two months so we could finally exchange Christmas gifts and I figured I would ask her in person. However, she's blown me off and either not responded or told me she'd let me know when she's available. 

I'm so incredibly torn on this situation. On one hand, I believe that the maid of honor position should be given to the person closest to me, not just handed to someone because they are related. But I also know, that if I don't ask her, she will always hold a grudge and any potential we have for a future relationship would be shattered.

291,"My son has just turned seventeen, he is academically good in school and works with his father during the weekends but his behaviour recently is concerning to be simply brushed off as ""boys being boys"". He is normally quite a reckless person and hasn't shown a lot of respect to authority in his teenage years which is why I think he done what he done (which I'll get into in a second). But I don't know whether to not to send him for an psychological evaluation, and also hearing the opinions of strangers on here interests me.

He is still in school but he, and four others, have been held in some sort of detention thing during recess (really, he has to sit in a room with his friends, who are also involved in this incident, until the school decides whether or not to kick them out). And so far, it is not looking good because the school has recently taken a serious approach to bullying.

Basically, my son and his friends have apparently spent months laughing at their own offensive jokes towards a teacher at school (none of them attend his class, but they noticed that he is thin and have made fun of him for it for really no other reason other than their own amusement.

Last Friday, my son and his friends apparently printed out a picture of an unnaturally skinny person and photo-shopped the teacher's face onto it. They put it on his desk and he later found it. So the school checked CCTV and they got caught and had admitted the jokes the had made and my son doesn't seem remorseful at all about how much he offended a staff member.

I never listened to this but they put a sound recorder in the room they are kept in and they've told amongst each other jokes about him involving the holocaust, that he's puny, and scenarios like he's in a police shootout and gets knocked back after firing a shotgun etc etc.. (even know my son is naturally thin as well)

I spoke to the headteacher about this just on Monday and they said that if he doesn't apologise or understand how much insult he and his friends have caused, they could have grounds to dismiss him from the school.

Now, I really don't know if they can expel him for saying things behind a teacher's back. For the picture they made, yes, but it seems to me that they're just jokes and they never directly said these things to the teacher. What could they do?

301,"Hi all.

The general context goes like this: I graduated from university last June and was lucky enough to secure a reasonably well paying professional job, which just so happened to be close to my family home. This wasn't strictly the plan, but I've been living with my parents since with all the advantages that come with that.

I'm very unhappy in my job. It's not that I'm struggling just having a job per se, but the nature and demands of the work are totally contrary to my personality. I have no respect for myself or what I do, and can't see myself lasting in it too much longer.

A further complication is the fact that my girlfriend lives around 6 hours away and has her own busy schedule. The only time I'm really happy these days is when I'm with her, but this is becoming harder and harder to squeeze in and generally quite costly for us both too.

I'm putting a lot of thought into quitting my job and moving to be considerably closer to my girlfriend. It's not just being nearer to her though - it's a city which I know and love, and living away from home was a really personally fulfilling experience during my university years. By contrast, I have very little love for my hometown or the surrounding areas, and whilst I appreciate living rent-free and all the other advantages, I don't think staying with my parents brings out the best version of me.

The only thing stopping me from doing it tomorrow is the thought of my professional future. I'll almost certainly want to change professions, but it's a city on the smaller side and opportunities aren't always easy to come by. Holding out for an offer for a better job could see me waiting a while.

I've considered blowing it off and taking any old work I can as long as it gets and keeps me out there, but I'm also worried about what impact that will have on my future job search. Leaving this role after 6 months and going into bar work or whatever probably doesn't paint me in the best light if I'm looking for more white-collar work in the future.

I'm pretty clear on what my options are, but I'm honestly just lacking the confidence to pick one and stick to it. Do I tough it out where I am? Doing that, job hunting, and maintaining my relationship sounds exhausting. Am I overthinking the damage quitting will do to my resume? I've heard plenty of horror stories suggesting that's not the case. Am I being a fool for even considering giving up a cushy salary and a cheap ride from my parents? Maybe, but how does that weigh up against my personal wellbeing?

Thanks for taking the time to read that - I'd be interested to hear a few outside perspectives on this.

309,"Some background:
I'm the primary renter in a 3 bedroom house. I've lived there for 4 years, and have had several roommates come and go. The two roommates I have right now have both been living with me for under a year. There's no lease, we're all just month-to-month, and the rental agreement is in my name. I'm more invested in the ""house"" stuff  - I take care of the yard, deal with the landlord, provide furniture, etc.

The Situation:
(*this post mentions attempted suicide. not to do with myself though)
My partner recently found out that their 2 roommates who are a couple will be having a child this June, and my partner has been asked to move out when the baby comes so the parents can have the house to themselves.

My partner and I were planning on moving in together soon, so now that they have nowhere to live starting June, it's natural that they would move into my place. They can't stay in my room however, since my landlord requested no more than 3 people live in the house, and my partner and I also have very different living styles (I have ADHD, they have OCD) so having separate rooms would probably be the only way that it would work.

So for my partner to move in with me, I'll have to ask one of my roommates to leave. Originally I was going to try and be as fair as possible by keeping roommate #1 since they've been living with me longer than #2. However my partner has a complicated relationship with roommate #1 and won't feel safe or comfortable living with them, so I'd have to ask #1 to leave in order for my partner to move in. And I get it, I can't imagine the two of them creating a harmonious living situation together, it's just one of those situations where you can tell that two people would be like oil and water, even though they're both fine people in their own right. 

The issue I'm having is that I can't figure out how to tell roommate #1 that they have to move. They have pretty serious mental health issues, which I've personally never had a problem with, but I know that they take rejection *extremely* poorly. They also survived a suicide attempt a few months ago, and I wouldn't want this situation to trigger another act of self-harm. They're also on vacation right now, and hitting them with this news right after they get back would probably be a hard blow to their already unstable mental health. I'd give them until June to find a new place though, which I feel is very accommodating since legally I only have to give them 30 days. I want this to go as smoothly as possible for them.

How do I ask them to leave in a way that is fair and makes sense to them? We've never had issues, so this will probably feel like a serious blindside. I feel like if I tell them that they have to leave instead of the roommate that's been there for less time, it will come accross as ""you're not good enough and we don't want to live with you because you're mentally ill"" which isn't the case. My partner and I both struggle with mental illness and I would never hold an illness against someone. But if they ask why they're getting kicked out and not the other roommate, I don't know that I could give them an honest answer that wouldn't feel like a super personal attack. Not to mention if I create a hostile situation between us, we still have to live together for several uncomfortable months while they find another place.

What makes this situation worse is that I also have PTSD and anxiety, which in combination with my ADHD means that I'm really bad at asserting myself. In emotionally stressful situations my fight/flight/freeze response kicks in, my brain just freezes up and I can't think or speak properly. I've been having panic attacks even just thinking about how to approach this situation.

I hope I'm not a terrible person for considering asking my roommate to leave? I mean my partner has been put in a similar situation and they don't hate their roommates for it. Both situations are kind of just a circumstance of people wanting to settle down and advance their relationship, and that being incompatible with the existing living arrangements.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! If I decide not to kick out my roommate, I either have to move out and find somewhere with my partner (which will be very difficult, we're both poor and they have 2 cats, so finding a pet-friendly 2 bedroom in our price range will be almost impossible. I also don't want to lose this house because it's the only rentable house around that has it's own basement that's not a separate suite, which I use to record music / put on house shows, and I've become really attached to my garden over the years.)
Or, my partner has to find their own place to live, which I fear would put a strain on our relationship, since it might come accross like I'm prioritizing my roommates or my house over them. And again finding somewhere that will allow 2 cats might be difficult. Both my roommates are single, have no pets, and make more money than me, so I know they'd be able to find a place easier than us.

Thanks in advance!!

310,"Hi Advice,

I'll keep this short - I'd like your advice on confronting a new tenant about paying me money they owe me. Long story short, I wanted a new tenant in once I moved out - they have been living in my place since 2 Feb. I have paid rent to the agency until 22 Feb - representing a total of 20 days. 

The new tenant also has not properly signed the new lease paperwork, which includes a bond transfer form as well as the actual tenant transfer. She is not doing anything in a timely manner, and I would like for her to do it ASAP - but she has other plans. 

She is a very grumpy person normally, and she is impossible to confront without her taking whatever it is personally. She is 19, and all our housemates (including myself - the outgoing housemate) are between 22 to 25. The reason why I mention this is that she is fragile and takes everything as a personal sleight - I don't want my reputation ruined because of her.

What would you do - how do I confront her to pay me the money she owes me for rent, the bond transfer, as well as get her to properly sort out the paperwork?

Cheers.",14Feb2018,1

314,"Around New Years I went to hang out with my friend and his wife. That evening he had to go to work so I stayed and hung out with his wife. It was nothing out of the ordinary as she is a very good friend too. We end up getting very drunk that night and I made a move. This quickly escalated into sex. Both of us were immediately filled with shame but we kept it to ourselves. The following weeks I was having trouble with the guilt I was feeling so I sought advice online. Most of the advice I received was to be the first to tell him if I wanted any chance at keeping the friendship. Out of respect for his wife I decided I'd wait until she told him and until that time I would just pretend my best like it never happened. A few weeks ago she told him. He showed up at my house unannounced, shoved me around and hit me until I explained what happened. There was a part of me that was actually relieved this happened as I felt a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and finally felt punished. The problem is I have had a very difficult time channeling my guilt. I wrote and mailed him a letter a few day's after and never heard back. I'm sure he wants nothing at all to do with me. The problem is that I am now all consumed with guilt. It's the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last I think of before I go to sleep. How should I manage this?

318,"First time Reddit poster. Advice definitely needed. Quick summary at the bottom. 

For background, we are in our early twenties. Dating for around 7 years married for 1.5 years. I have been employed full time since I graduated college. 

My husband went to a small university out West and got a BS in English in 2016. We currently live in the Midwest and he has been unable to get a job. 

He has applied to tons of jobs in the field and outside his field (retail, fast food etc). He has applied for part time and full time jobs. He was gotten a few interviews but never gotten a offer. He has had our friends who work as managers mostly in the banking industry recommmend him and look over his resume only to find a dead end. He has some experience editing the college magazine. He has worked in construction on the clean up crew in his teen years and worked at Sodexo on campus through college. 

 After a few fights, he agreed with me and started volunteering. He volunteers at a theatre in town and has been for about 6 months. 

Long term he would like to be an author and has been submitting things. He and I are on the same page that until that provides a full time job and check he needs to work another job. 

All of this is wearing us out. I have been pushing for him to consider going back to school and becoming a paralegal. The thought being he could capitalize on a clear field and the program would set him up with an intership. 

 It's been frustrating to say the least and been the cause of many fights. I hate being the sole breadwinner and struggling with trying to find a new job. (I am keeping my current job until I have a new one lined up). He has communicated that he is frustrated. 

So what needs to happen differently? He would be happy with be able to land any part time job to start out. 

Long story short: Husband hasn't been able to get work since moving with me to the Midwest. He has gotten a few bites outside his field but no job. What needs to happen?  ",14Feb2018,0

I'm a 22 white male from the US who is about to graduate university with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I have grown up with a substantial amount of privilege, especially financially. I already have a fairly decent nest egg, with a small amount of inheritance expected each year for the next few years. and I've also been privileged to have studied outside the US 3 times during my time in university as well as an internship outside of the US. In addition I will be graduating university with no debt. I have been very lucky, with a lot of international experience and I am in a very good financial position.

My dilemma

There seems to be a big push from people around me my age to go and travel. However, I did that a lot during my time in university and feel being outside of my university during my time in has made me feel I haven't had the time to develop anything substantial, which makes me want to settle in a place so I can work on something and grow myself and my connections with people. Having spent so much time away during university made me feel I didn't develop too many strong connections. At the same time, I look very wistfully back on my time abroad.

It is great pay (about $90,000) and I think it is something I would enjoy enough and could see myself doing for many years without burnout.

When I was in high school, I was a top student and everyone, including myself, had very high expectations and goals for me. It was always the plan that I’d go to university right after high school graduation and get a high paying job.


Flash to the future: due to changing my mind a couple of times about the uni program, instead of starting uni at 18, I started at 20. Which was already bad enough, as I was older than my classmates. But things continued to get worse. After 1.5 rocky years in uni, I dropped out. I spent half a year working and I prepared to return. When I did come back, I was doing great, but an issue in my personal life triggered a major depression crisis. It was so bad that I had to drop out so I could come home and get help. 

Still, I begun to recover from the episode, and I planned to start studying at my local community college this fall.
Somehow, however, I missed the application deadline for this fall and the program won’t open again until Sept. 2019. 

So, here I am now, about 25 grand in debt with nothing to show for it, and back to living with my parents. No job, no boyfriend, barely any friends and five years of my life completely wasted. And now, I’m destined to waste another year since I cant re apply until next January.

Please, I need advice on what I can do to make my situation less bad. I’m obviously going to get a job, but I am not sure how I can continue to live with myself knowing that in the best case scenario, I’ll start my career at 27, while my brothers - a lawyer and a doctor - started theirs at my age right now!
