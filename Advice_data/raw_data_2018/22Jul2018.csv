0,"I’m 16 years old and am working for like a year or so in a grocery store and I hate it.

I hate it SO much.

I do get (differing from how much I work) 150-280 €.

I really hate it and EVERY single day BEFORE having to go to work I already hate my life, that bad.

What do I do?

I do wanna retire but to do that I need to work for a whole month, which isn’t that bad but I still don’t have another job?

Nothing seems do able for me because i’m only 16.

I wanna work hard as FUCK and get money, I wanna do the most difficult thing I can do at max to get money, not placing groceries in front for an hour or 3, it sucks so bad.

Is there any job I can do as a 16 year old? I hate biking, and I really think of doing a black work (which basicslly is working without a contract) and deliver pizza’s and stuff, I will be riding a scooter, which I officially can’t since you need a license but heck I might risk it.

Life is so annoying, knowing you gotta work so many hours for so little while lucky people like Rappers, Youtubers get enough per month for doing the things they like.

Can’t I make money off of creating mods? Like custom maps, custom games in a game, making some maps to sell to some people from a website (have seen some expensive maps)

Honestly, I hate my life already, the fact that a car is almost unobtainable for me says enough, alot of my friends dad drive a very good looking car while we have the worst one to date...

What do I do, anytips, anything I can do online to make money, even if it takes alot of
Time, or what job should I do here.

2,"Preface: I'm going to try to go as wide in explaining this as I can to help you better understand the story. Forgive any words that have been written to no direct correlation to the story, up to you what you decide to take out from what I'm about to tell you, and how you wish to help me with the information. Likewise I'd like to apologize for any grammatical errors or weirdly structured sentences as english is not my native language, and it is currently 1am as I'm typing this.


To tell you a bit about myself, I have never been in a serious state before in my life. I'm only 18, so I've been lucky enough up until this point not to have anything more serious happen that would largely upset me. I have a family of 8 members, that's 3 bro's and 2 sisters, so it's pretty large. When it comes to cousins, aunts, uncles, I have a lot of them too. All in all I mean to say I've been surrounded by plenty of people pretty much my whole life, I've gotten used to all sorts of social interactions. I switched between schools 1 year ago, and my life was looking extremely well and a lot better than before. It was a special time. I met all these people that were very fond of me, and I was fond of them. Basically I was happy at that point and everything was great. So the school year goes around, and as it ends (late june here), me and my family get hold of some.. extremely horrific news. So one evening of that time I was in my room, enjoying myself, suddenly my brother storms into my room and tells me to immediately come to his room to see something, and shows me the local news page. What I saw was then was the last thing I'd thought I'd see, out of all the things imaginary.  


I read the title of the article he was showing me, it was about our cousin me and this same brother used to hang out with a lot as children, and even as teens. The article wrote that my cousin, his full name and all, had gruesomely murdered his girlfriend using a knife, and described the ongoing details.    
Just taking a look back at how that evening felt was.. indescribable. It's a very unsettling headline, and to know the person behind it is a relative of yours, and one as close to you as that.. I don't think I'll forget how that evening proceeded to go. I saw colours of my parents I'd never seen before, just my dad phoning all our other relatives, telling them the horrible news of what seemed almost unbelievable. To share a bit of backstory, our family is not a ""bad"" or as you'd call it, a ""weird"" one at that. As short tempered as we come, we are pretty peaceful people. But it was always something about that cousin that seemed off a bit with him. He was through his years of growing up often a target for mockery, but he didn't show like it brought him down so much. He laughed off with the people. But he was weird in social situations.. awkward. the typical, geeky, awkward person you'd say is bullied in school, if I go by the stereotype. My brother and I used to hang out with him as kids and through adolescence, but in the last few years we heard that he'd actually started doing drugs and meeting with some strange people. If I can recall, though I'm not 100% sure, he'd begun taking drugs 2 or 3 years prior to this happening. And once he'd begun doing that, we started seeing him less, not that we'd know about it, we just sort of grew older and started to go in separate ways.  
So if I continue down the line of when we found out about this news, at the time I was still with my girlfriend, I sort of absorbed this news as something horrible and moved on. My life hadn't really endured that much of a change in the following 5 or 6 months after that. I thought about it every once in a while, thinking how horrible that is still, but not that it'd take some kind of effect on my mental health.


These 6 months go by, come November I end the relationship with my gf, saying I kind of didn't feel like continuing the relationship. It had nothing to do with what happened 6 months prior, but I felt like I didn't feel happy in the relationship anymore. Those were personal reasons between us I guess, nothing to do with my mental state in that time (atleast I think). After that ends, I start getting a bit more time to myself. I didn't think that was bad, after all I was getting a lot of attention from people after I changed schools and that went on for roughly a year, so I thought I just kind of needed a break from everyone or something. So, come December (this was in my 2nd school year now), I'm all on my own. I didn't have any special bonds with my friends anymore, like I used to have, they just disappeared. I didn't feel like I wanted to hang out with people, and I didn't feel any guilt in that at all, which is weird for me, cause in every stage of my life (until then), I was really prone to being lonely - I'd get upset over the first notion of recognizing I was feeling lonely, and I'd rush off to my family or whoever, just for company, so I didn't feel isolated. So I just feel this 'neutral state' in my head, I didn't even feel like I was still developing any sort of common sense, I was just browsing the internet, doing whatever, and hopped on to bed. No talking with people on social media, nothing. And this went on for months. In school I didn't feel like I wanted to talk to people. Instead of being with a group of friends like my 1st year, I always only hung out with about 1 friend, and that was it. And I didn't feel any guilt over it. Only in about April I started to develop some sense of 'I should really start going out more, and having a nice social life again'. During all this time I was questioning myself what's going on with me? Am I going through some really weird teenage phase and this'll just pass me by? Is it possible my ex girlfriend 'contaged' me with some of her depression she had? But that doesn't make sense, I was never sad around her. I was always uplifting to her so she'd be happy around me too.  
This wasn't a terrible phase though, it was just, I was just sort of doing nothing. And feeling nothing. I didn't feel necessairily really sad, or good. I just felt like there was an emptiness. So I refused to believe my cousin was the reason behind this now. But it was. It was my subconscious mind feeling this sense of despair, and I begun to spin thoughts in my head such as 'How could this happen to him, we used to hang out together even, now he's sentenced for 20 years'. Uncontrollable thoughts like that, and in everything I was doing I'd see myself being similar to him, even though me and him were completely different. Over my life I could always deal with bullying, I was pretty laid back, and it's not like I'd get huge amounts of bullying myself. Learning from my brothers, I learned common decency and how to appear somewhat sympathetic to people, it's what made me able to form all sorts of bonds with the friends I had. Needless to say this cousin of mine had little knowledge of how to do that, he was introverted, and a typical geek (he was even hyperintelligent and a genius when it came to math and was able to solve all sorts of equations noone else in his class could). Images of what must've happened on that fateful day appeared in my head, as I'd heard some things about that.. cause of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, where discussions were going on. Thoughts all of that nature. Absolutely horrific.  
This troubles me still. It's july now, so the summer break. I still think about this from time to time, unwillingly, even though I've developed a much better pattern of things I want to do in my free time. Now I've changed to reading more books, exercising a lot more, etc. But it's hard to put my mind to something, because I can't focus for a long time. Sooner or later some provoking thoughts will make their way to me. And when they do, I do my best to make them disappear instantly, but even then it already ruins my mood to a pretty bad state. I try to be productive, but it's almost like I don't even feel like it. And I want to. I have never told any of this to anyone before. Not even my brother, or a friend, parent, anyone else on the internet. I sort of kept it bottled up, hoping it would go away. If I do say, it's gotten better now than how it was at the start of 2018 (after that December). On top of wanting to do a lot more for myself,I also started to improve on my social life about 2 months ago, but I learned that my *social skills have literally depleted since I started getting isolated*. This is what I'm scared of. I was never like this before in my life, and I don't want to lose my social skills that I had before (in that stage before isolation, I felt like I was literally sympathetic to everyone around me, strangers included.. that was the vibe I thought I was getting from them) nowadays it's like I'm sympathetic to barely anyone. And I can't say it's cause my apperance is any different. My logical explanation is that it might be the change of body language I'm not even aware of or just the neutral vibe I'm giving off like I've just been through a huge mental breakdown. And that ofcourse is extremely different than what you're like after being widely social for weeks on end. My point is I'm trying to be a lot more social again, but I'm struggling to gather the strength I had to have such social skills in the past, which allowed me to be so social in the 1st place. I want to do it, but I forgot how to. Currently I have about 1 reliable friend (during the summer break) I can call up to get out with, but I'll see how my social interactions will improve when school starts again, given I now actually have the will to talk to people actively again.  


Something important to note - A couple hours ago before I started to write this thread, I wrote down some things that bothered me, and I was really able to get the point. I feel like I really accurately described my feelings in the notes, so I'll paste them here.

  
///  
What troubles me:  
 * Getting ignored in a friend group, or even in a direct conversation with 1 person. Not feeling like I’m able to come back strongly enough to make them regret it.  
 * Not feeling like I can come up with responses in a way so people will admire you more. I feel like I lost the sense for it.  
 * Not being able to focus. Stuff constantly on my mind bringing me down, and making me insecure, shy, paranoid. I can’t seem to be able to clear my mind. I often experience headaches.. and drousiness.  
 * Blaming myself for all these things. Wanting to improve so badly but not being able to get a grasp on it cause I cant focus. Feeling even worse over the time I’ve spent in this state so far already instead of living my life normally.  
 * Because of this, fearing for my future. How will I ever get in line again normally.  
 * Feeling so hopeless over people I’ve pushed away cause of the state I was forced into, and how I’ll ever be able to fix this.  
 * Feeling so lonely and not knowing how to keep people beside me, and worst of all, half the time not even registering I’m lonely, just a presence of lack of communication. This is the most horrible state I’ve been in in my life.  
 * Occasional horrible imagery in my head I can’t so much control, even if I feel great at the time, I’ll remember about it and it’ll ruin my mood instantaneously.

3,"TL;DR My mom and I keep fighting. She constantly attacks my character. She is impossible to please, no matter what I try to do. She says awful things about me and uses anything she can to hurt me. I'm starting to fall into a depressive and emotionally fragile state. 

My mom and I have always been very close to each other. I've been home from college for the summer doing an internship during the week, and working retail on the weekends to make money. Most of our arguments stem from us making comments back and forth. We'll be talking about something, I might say something that she doesn't like and she'll start yelling at me, and vice versa. If I go out with friends after my internship, she gets annoyed that i'm not home. If I stay home, she gets annoyed that I am in my room and not spending time with the family (her, my dad, and two younger siblings). We constantly fight, because she regularly attacks my character and calls me disrespectful. I feel that she just constantly yells at me and no matter what I do I can't seem to please her. When I try to tell her that I don't like what she is saying to me, or have a conversation about our fight she tells me that I am being disrespectful and not following parent's orders. In her exact words ""she is the lady of the house, and children are not disrespect their parents or they will be thrown out of the house."" My dad will then get involved and take my mom's side. It is frustrating that my parents just constantly keep on telling me how much of a disappointing child I am and tries to pick out all my flaws. If I ever tell my mom anything about friendships, relationships, or situations going on in my life she'll find a way to bring that up in an argument to validate her point and basically use it against me to throw it back in my face. I can't trust her, and then she gets mad and tells me that i'm sneaky for not telling her things when I am just trying to protect myself. When I try to stay out, stay in my room, and distance myself away from my parents to prevent fights, they get even more mad at me and constantly try to come back even harder to provoke me, they don't leave me alone. I had a trip to Europe to celebrate my bday before I head back to school in August (it was going to be the highlight of summer and I was looking forward to it) , but now that's in jeopardy because of us fighting (even though I have the funds to pay for it, she won't let me go). I need help, my summer is not fun and I can feel myself coming home and lying in bed depressed that I am not enjoying life and have nothing to look forward to. I have nowhere else to escape, and no one else to talk to about this. I can really feel my mental health deteriorating. I used to work out, eat healthily, and socialize with friends. All that has now stopped ever since my mother and I starting fighting. Please help, I don't know what to do, her words really hurt and I cry all the time. This is all so unusual for me. ",22Jul2018,1
4,"After plentiful attractive men my whole life, I have hit a rough patch of being single for years. 

I have self improved. Therapy, art, fitness, healthy cooking and eating. I go to college. I work. I have many hobbies. I attend events and change up my schedule regularly so I will be in a position to meet people. I am not fixated on dating. I take months on and off of “looking” for someone. I am just wondering why this is happening. I am on tinder, hinge, bumble, match, and POF. 

I have put the effort into dating. Many online did not look like their profile and were pushy with sex initiation. I have gone on many bad dates. I actually just got home from one. My friend set me up on a double date whom my date did not say 1 sentence except to curse out the waiter. He responded to my initiation of conversations with nods and made her boyfriend pay for his food and activities. 

TL;DR: How can I get out of a dry spell when I seem to be doing everything in my power to find a boyfriend, including taking time apart from looking?",22Jul2018,1
6,"I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

7,"Is it wrong of me to rat out my boyfriends dealer?

I’m super done with my boyfriend smoking pot, I can’t freaking stand it. He spends an insane amount of money on it and he put me in jeopardy the other day when I borrowed his car and drove around with a packed bowl. I talked to him about it and he said he would stop, but I’ve asked before. I know his dealers name and address, I know it makes me seem like a twat but I don’t know what to do.  We’re so close to having a baby, and I love him but our baby is more important to me.",22Jul2018,0
8,"So around 30 minutes ago my sister came upstairs (after a night of drinking lightly) and we started having a conversation. It's started with regular banter until we started talking about more serious things.

I'm 15 and my sister is 19, our parents used to treat my sister like rubbish when she was my age, preparing for exams. They would tell her she'd be living in benefits and she'd be a failure. This took a massive toll on her now as she had secretly been going to therapy (for anxiety and depression) whilst at university around 3 hours from our family home. She has a boyfriend that is basically the best for her in all ways, so she said about the therapy to him first. It was only until a few months to maybe half a year that she 'confessed' to my parents (but only about the anxiety). At the beginning my parents seemed to care but they suddenly and very recently started using it against her, practically blackmailing her. My sister left the house last weekend after being told 'we' would rather not have her here, then my mum said ""I'm going to call the police on you because you have anxiety and you'll go off and drive into oncoming traffic"". 

Just now my sister told me that she'd only told her boyfriend that she also had depression. I was extremely shocked and am worried. But the amount of time she spends away from home at her boyfriends makes me get worried about her well being. Not because she'll ""go off and drive into oncoming traffic"" but because I know she wants to be at home but there are constant arguments. I have no idea how to deal with this new information and how to possibly help her or to comfort her.",22Jul2018,1
10,"## ma flaky friend advice please

So  i have a best friend who i grown pretty closed to in the last 2 years.  Hes helped me in a lot personal shit and  hes come over to my place   several times to hangout. theirs just one big problem. I'm a very flaky  person. today was a rip festival in the city of Brampton Ontario and my  friend.  I promised i go. so i told him i go. this is the second time i  bailed on him. this was because when i woke i heard my brother balling  his eyes out assumed his girlfriend broke up with him because he was  talking with his girl on his phone. so i canceled because i figured i  would hangout with him just to help calm down. only to found out a  couple of hours later that there still together and now friends is  pissed at me(with good reason).

The thing  is in the past year ive made alot promises this year i didn't keep  relating to school and shite. anyway. im worried my friend will stop  hanging out with me because this is the second time i bailed on him last  minute. i made several other promises to other  3 friends to hangout   but bailed due to forgetfulness, waking up late and not planning ahead.

advice please",22Jul2018,1
11," I might be overthinking this whole thing but after 3 months of dating this wonderful girl, she broke up with me. She told I was going too fast and she wasn't looking for that kind of relationship. She seemed very sad about it,  I tried to cheer her up during our dinner afterwards but she seemed out of it. I told her I would like to be friends but she said I should hate her. 

 In the next couple of days I started receiving  mixed signals  which I thought were strange

4 days  after the breakup she texts me memes (which we sent each other all the times) and tells me she is listening to Sparks (a band I recommended she listened to months ago). We text each other for about 6 hours non-stop. I dont force the conversation by the way she keeps reeling me into the conversation. 

  Later her best friend who I have never talked to follows me on instagram

   Then I see she is listening to the playlist I made her when we together

 Then she recommends I listen to some songs including Nights In White Satin by The Moody Blues where the chorus literally is (I love you, yes I love you) and Never My Love by The Association where the chorus is ( You wonder if this heart of mine will lose its desire for you, Never my love)

  Sorry I wrote so much but this is my first real relationship (I am 15) and I really want this to work out. All of our friends say  we were made for each other and are meant to be together. I love this girl so much and if she wanted to get back together I would in a heartbeat because I have felt very sad in the last two weeks since the breakup. 

My fear is that if she does not love me anymore and I am grasping at straws here I will drive her away by pursuing a relationship. That freaks me out man. Thanks a million if you read all my rambling. Have a nice day. ",22Jul2018,1
14,"I honestly never thought I’d be posting something like this but here we are. My son is 13 and has Oppositional Defiance Disorder. He fights me on EVERYTHING right down to whether or not showering is necessary. 

So he watched a Youtube video recently that painted Hitler in a more positive light and made it sound like the rest of the world are a bunch of brainwashed sheep that are made to believe he’s some sort of monster. I am pissed. His main point he said is that Hitler tried to sell the Jews before the holocaust really started up in an attempt to save as many as possible. I’m like WHAT?!?!? He won’t show me which video it is so I can’t see exactly what is said in it. Either way, I’m disgusted. 

I was wondering if there were any documentaries that anybody knows of that details the holocaust but also has a lot of information on Hitler and his involvement. I know there’s lots of documentaries out there but I’m not sure which one would have the information I am looking for in particular. My mom thinks we should watch the diaries of anne frank, I haven’t seen it so I’m not sure if that is exactly what I’m looking for.

Any and all suggestions will be welcome.

17,"So I created a shipping label online on the 6th of this month with the proper ship to, sender, and return address. A few days ago I received notice that the package was coming back to me because the sender refused to accept the package. I looked up in the tracking number and saw that the recipient asked for it to go to a customer service location for later pickup and after five days it was sent to me as ""recipient refused package""

I called the recipient who stated he had never received the package or any notice. So I called customer service who just repeated verbatim the information yielded by the tracking number. I asked to speak with a manager she told me she would have the UPS facility call me within an hour - never received a call back. 

That's fine,  it's a bit of a headache but whatever i'll just use a different courier when it gets back to me. Today I get an email saying that my card had been charged again for the send back and that it was going to a completely different address. 

Called again today and they told me that the information they had in their computers was different from the return address on my receipt. On probing they also stated that they could not reroute the package to the correct address nor would they refund me for the declared value of the package ($1400 that I paid insurance for)

When I sent this package I used an account from when I had a different house in a different state, but amended the address. In fact I have a signed receipt in my hand from UPS with the correct shipping information and return address. 

The customer service line was useless and just repeated the same thing over and over telling me that I should have updated it online in my account (which I did as shown by my printed receipt) and the manager I spoke with told me the same thing. 

So i'm going to go to the local UPS customer service center on Monday and find out what I can do. But I ask you, what can I do? Do I have any recourse? As for my old address, I know no-one in the area that can help me as they have all moved too. ",22Jul2018,1
19,"  
I'm enrolled in Connecticut's Medicaid, but I'm currently a coding bootcamp student in Utah with no health insurance for this state. I've gone  to urgent care and they've tried to redirect me to other urgent care places for help so I don't have to pay , which was thoughtful but I'm worried that I need to be seen by a doctor sooner rather than later.

The discomfort in my side has gone from unnoticeable and mild ( April 10th) to uncomfortable and constant (two weeks ago). If it were on an index it has gone from 2 to 4-5. Most of the time it just feels uncomfortable or tight, but sometimes I have a sting in my upper right abdomen, sometimes on the left of my abdomen, and very fairly near my belly button or kidney.  I've been a heavy drinker for several years and am assuming it's related, so I've cut down a little. I went 5 days without drinking, and I still felt the uncomfortableness. Then I flew on a plane, so I had two wines and two beers over several hours. Nothing really changed, just the same constant uncomfortableness. After 3 days I had two shots before bed, the next day I said fuck it and had six beers . There aren't really any other symptoms I can pinpoint, because they're not consistent. I've had some yellowish stool after eating a lot of fatty food and I felt very nauseous before flying, but it was only once.

I feel it's not bad enough to go to the ER, but I also feel that it's unhealthy to not be seen by a doctor. I Also don't want to wait for there to be an emergency. The first urgent care I went to doesn't accept my medicaid, the others may. I don't think planned parent hood would help, and I panicked and bought a multicare plan (thinking it was insurance and feel duped). I'm going to cancel. I'll need time to look into new plans now, so I can find something sustainable and don't make another mistake (doing now).

Either way I'm cutting down on drinking, because it's not healthy. A beer with dinner every once in a while, a few drinks with friends once a month and that's it. Even if it's unrelated I'm still determined to change my lifestyle. Right now I need to take care of my ""pain"". What do you recommend? Am I overreacting?  I'm a male, 28,  and overweight.",22Jul2018,1
21,"So A Little Over 5 Months Ago, I Got Strep Throat For The Second Time, Within Two Weeks Of The Last Time. I didn't think Much Of It But When I Thought It Was Over, I started hearing a ringing in my ear. I was also having breathing problems whenever I would even walk up or down the stairs.

This all started happening when I got sick and I know they are related. I've gone to my doctor, an ears, nose, and throat specialist, I got an M.R.I and nothing showed up, I even got my blood tested (Although they threw away the blood half-way through testing). My doctor told me I might have asthma, but other than that I'm perfectly healthy. No one helped.

I don't know what to do, the tinnitus is driving me crazy. My mom has accused me of making up these problems to get out of school. I don't know what to do at this point. I think that the strep has stayed in my system or something, or gone into my lungs and ear canal. I'm no doctor but I know the strep is still with me, the medicine didn't exterminate it completely. That is probably due to my complete failure of an immune system. I'm just completely unhealthy in general, I haven't exercised in like 2 years and my diet is just wack. So I know for a start I should start exercising and eating better but is it normal to just get asthma from Strep? What else can I do?

TL;DR I got sick with Streptococcus and I've had tinnitus and asthma since. I've gone to many doctors and nobody knows whats wrong with me. Might be because I'm an idiot and don't take care of my health.",22Jul2018,2

The speed limit sign was directly in front of the house I was delivering to. From the house to the corner was probably 50 feet, 100 absolute max. There is absolutely no way my shitty 1999 Camry would’ve made it up to speeds of 45mph, then back to a complete stop, within 75feet (we’ll average it out). 
“How would I of even been able to get that fast before having to stop?”
“Defying an officer? Would you like another citation? Because I don’t think you’d be able to afford that.”
After this I began bawling as I was already having a panic attack, having never been pulled over before. So I just shut up, stared ahead, took the citation from him and waited for him to leave. I was cited with going 45 in a 25. Is the best bet just to hire a lawyer? Is there any way this would be amended? Or am I screwed with a ticket because some jack ass cop?",22Jul2018,1
24,"My boss did some false reporting that resulted in an employee missing a large chunk of paycheck.  She tried to push back his start date to cover some paperwork done late (no way to avoid it, situational, not her fault).  She wanted to do this by falsifying timesheets and claiming it was MY fault.  She said this to my face.  I was distinctly uncomfortable with that for moral reasons.  I checked with her boss, who agreed with me, then I sent the true timesheets to corporate.  They were horrified, but thanked me for bringing it to light.  I really just wanted to make sure this kid gets paid.

Here's where the trouble really sits:  I am a temp.  She is the contact for the temp agency.  She is the one who approves or rejects everything.  If she says to leave now, I am effectively fired with no recourse.  I don't think that will happen, since her boss thinks I am doing a great job.  But it could seriously tarnish my reputation.

I left my last job over a similar situation, after only working there a few months.  It took a long time to find a new job because  of that, and I may have to go through it again.

I made sure I had copies of all paperwork showing what happened, because I hope that even if she tries to ruin me over it I can try to clear my name.  Other than that, is there anything I can do to make this easier?  She won't be fired, and if I am able to stay things will be extremely tense with her.  How can I make this work?",22Jul2018,1

28,"Tl;dr./short version: I want to move to Nashville simply because I want a change of scenery and it would be cool to be around other musicians, and it seems like an awesome place for that. I don’t see/want a career in music, but I just want to be around others who enjoy playing/writing music like I do. Would this be a stupid idea to just move there for the hell of it?

So long story short, I’ve [25M] been living in my current city for 7 years since college, and I’m ready for a change. My original plan was to apply to full time jobs and move wherever I get a full time job. (Edit: I just recently dropped out of grad school so I’m unemployed right now.)

The only job I’m currently interviewing for is in Nashville. I’ve been through a few rounds of interviews and the recruiter tells me they’re still quite interested in me, but I’ve been interviewing for that job for about 3 months, so I don’t know if I’m gonna get it.

But since I may get that job, me and a couple friends went up to Nashville for a visit, and long story short, I loved it. It was so awesome being in an area with such a high concentration of creative talent. Like I don’t ever see myself pursuing a music career or anything like that, but music is definitely one of my passions, and it would be great to be in a place to have such a broad group of other musicians to collaborate with.

So as far as planning for if I don’t get that job, I’m kind of thinking that even if I don’t get it, I still may move there. I do have a couple friends in the area as well (one I’m kind of close with, the other I haven’t seen in a while but could see myself reconnecting with), and I have a little bit of passive income, so I can float by with a part time job until a full time comes into play. Also, I’m considering going back to school in a year or two, and there are some good programs in the area.

So put simply: if I just up and moved there to just work part time and have fun, would that be stupid?",22Jul2018,3

32,"So I'm a 25 year old female. I moved to San Francisco about a year ago because I was feeling really stuck in life and wanted a fresh start. My sister lives there so I moved in with her. I didn't really know anyone in the city so I thought I'd start making friends by hanging out with my sister and her group of friends. They're a good group of people and we've all become really close and they all accepted me in their group. One of them I became especially close with. I'll call him Alex. Anyways, so Alex and I became pretty close, pretty fast. We both had a lot in common and shared the same sense of humor. We just understood each other. I felt really comfortable around him and it was really easy for me to open up to him about a lot of things. We had a lot of deep talks about various things... He helped me get through problems with family, friends, work and relationships. He gave me some really good advice and comforted me when I needed it. I also did the same for him. He came to me with his own problems and I'd like to think I helped him work through those as well. Long story short, we became best friends and were pretty inseparable. 

So, when I first moved to San Francisco I was dating here and there but nothing really went anywhere. Dating just wasn't going anywhere and I thought it might be good to take a break for a while. I've had two serious boyfriends in the past but obviously neither of them worked out. The first one was my high school boyfriend and we broke it off because we both were going to different colleges and wanted to focus on what was important. The second one ended because we just weren't getting along anymore. We couldn't find time to see each other and would fight all the time. We just fell out of love and decided to move one. Anyways, so after trying dating for a while in San Francisco, I took a break and decided to focus on what was more important like my career and my friends and family. This meant spending a lot of time with my friends and that meant spending a lot of time with Alex. Long story short, I developed a crush on him that turned into something more. I always found him attractive since I met him but I pretty much found out he was gay the first day I met him. But I just feel so close to him in every way we spend so much time together and we just get along so well. We're the perfect pair. We also are close physically. We cuddle when we watch movies and we've pretty much seen each other naked at this point and it's never been much of a big deal. But when I think about my future, I see Alex in the picture. He makes me want to quit dating forever. I would be so happy spending my life with him and I'd rather so that than ever try and go back into dating. We are just so compatible in every way. We agree on every big topic about life. We agree on political and religious views, we agree on having children and marriage, we agree on plans for the future and where we want to live, we agree on everything! He just gets me and I get him. There's no issues between us. I just love him, fair and square. But, obviously we can't ever be together. He is 100% gay and there's nothing I can do to change that. I don't ever want to lose his friendship and even if I can't be with him in the way I want, I still want to have his friendship. But how do I get over these feelings? Sometimes I can deal with them but other times it's so difficult to look at him and know we will never have any relationship. It's hard to be in his company sometimes when I have these thoughts. It gets really painful. I try to focus on my work or other things but it doesn't seem to work. I just don't know what to do and how to deal with this! Please help!!! Thanks ",22Jul2018,2
34,I was at a friend's apartment last night and I accidentally backed up into someone's vehicle. There was a small mark on their truck but mine had some damage. I got scared and my friend told me to drive off so I stupidly did. I know I should have stayed and called the cops like I am supposed to. There were people outside and they called the cops on me and the cops were looking for me. The lady whose car I hit told the cops she wanted to handle the situation herself. My friend told the lady whose car I hit and the lady wanted to talk to me so I went over there a couple hours ago and talked to her. She told me she wants $300 for it by the 30th. She told me that this is between her and me and not to tell anyone. My friend told me that you can pretty much guarantee that lady's word but I'm still scared. I told the lady I felt like going down to the police station and shit but she told me not to do that and that I didn't have to. I guess the police filed a report or whatever. I am just terrified because I don't know if the cops are still after me or what. I have insurance and stuff but I'm just terrified. What should I do? I live in Wisconsin. ,22Jul2018,1

Eventually I left for college and she stayed home to finish community college( about 200 miles apart). 
 This is her last year back home and she is thinking of moving up north about 300 miles, so in a year we’d be 500 miles apart (Cue 1988 hit song by the Proclaimers).

50,"Last summer I dated a girl who had/has many mental disorders. These disorders include severe anxiety, depression, bi-polar, and occasional eating disorders. And I was pretty good at helping her through the issues that these disorders brought. We dated for about two months before she broke up with me over “compatibility issues” but it was really just because the school year was starting and we went to different schools. After breaking up with me she insisted we stay friends, but I was reassured by many people that it was not my responsibility to participate in a relationship that I didn’t want to be a part of.

Flash forward to this summer; I have a new gf of almost three months (who is a much better fit for me) and ex is intrigued. Ex calls me multiple times a week asking if I want to “get coffee”, eventually I cave and we go out one morning. Ex asks me about new gf before I knew ex even knew about new gf, and wants to learn as much as she can about new gf. All the while ex is telling me just how great she’s doing. I’m genuinely pleased to hear ex is doing well.

But then, the incident. I finally decide to nut up and take new gf to a social gathering that I know ex will be present at. Ex decides to introduce herself to new gf while I cannot intervene in any way. I’m mad, new gf is freaked out, but ex sees nothing wrong and proceeds to ask new gf for her phone number and new gf complies; trying to be polite. Ex starts texting me and new gf mercilessly, asking if we want to hang out and if we’re at all uncomfortable with her talking to us. We answer as best we can without saying no outright. 

A few days later I text ex that I’m a little uncomfortable and need some space, and she immediately texts new gf asking if she can “talk to him (me) about it”. After that I told new gf to stop responding while I find a way to tell her that we’re not interested, but I’ve still got nothing.

53,"For context, I am on a high school sports team with 10 other girls. It is a solo sport, so  we’re not technically a “team” in the traditional sense, but we’ve always liked to think ourselves that way. This year, four of us (including me) are seniors. Every year, the seniors choose what theme our homecoming float is going to be, and us current seniors had come to a conclusion on what we wanted when back when we were sophomores. 

Today, when we mentioned our big idea to everyone else, they HATED it. Which is totally fine, we can tweak it, no big deal. But instead of just saying they don’t like it and being done with it, it kind of opened the floodgates. The other girls started to talk about how they practice hours and hours *every single day* and are so much better than us, though we’re older. One of them even said she dreads going to practice with us because she “has to watch the upperclassmen try to play.” I won’t go over all of what was said because this post would be way too long, but let me just say it went on for a good while.

Personally I have no problem being worse at a sport compared to someone younger than me, but finally understanding that they don’t see us as equals off the field did hurt- especially when they told us they’re “the heart of the team” and that once we’re gone they won’t be held back anymore.

I really don’t know what to do about this. I’ve known since I joined that these other girls didn’t like our grade level because we’re not as serious about the sport as they are and joined our sophomore year as a group of novices. But I didn’t know they thought *that* badly of us to literally call us names to our faces.

Should I even attempt to fix this? Your advice is appreciated.

But within the past year or so I've noticed that my anger levels have risen to the point where I'm starting to believe I've got anger issues. I've heard of many ways to concur anger, listening to music, writing down your feelings, taking a deep break and counting, and countless more, but the problem is they don't work. Music used to work but now it doesn't. I don't write in a journal because I become paranoid that somebody will find it and read it, which has happened, but also because that also doesn't relieve my anger. Taking deep breaths and counting takes my anger down a level but still, I am irritated, which leaves me open to more anger. I don't have any actual hobbies because I can never seem to find one interesting enough to do for long, so doing something I like is a no-go. The only thing that HAS fully rid me of my anger was violence. I used to cut myself but it would always leave me sad after, along with scars, so I refuse to do that anymore.

70,"Hi there.

So this is a bit of a long story so here it goes.

Back-story:  Parents are both immigrants of Asian decent from different regions. Mom is 45 and dad is 65. My dad is my ""step"" father although I consider him my father since I've known him since birth. I'm currently 19 pursuing a career in medicine with 2 years left on my bachelors. My father is a business owner which he runs with 2 employees and my mother.

So here is the issue, my father's health has been recently declining in the past few years and getting only worse, he wants to sell the business and move back to his country to live out the ""rest"" of his life. My mother doesn't want to move back with him as she wants to stay around my brother and I and she doesn't know that country due to regional differences. My father said my mom could just stay here with me if she wants, he is 100% dead-set on moving back with no way to change his mind. But I don't know how it would be viable.

My father has been having difficulty selling the business and doesn't know what to do. I considered offering to run the business and ""own"" it if he wants to move back. But that would mean giving up my education with no forward looking goal, and I'm really not sure if I want to do that.

I don't know what to say or do, my parents are both arguing and stress often due to the unknown ahead. I was planning to move out of state for school but now I don't know what to do. I want my family to stay together but my parents are always disagreeing about what to do. I see no positive outcome from this, especially with the emotional attachments that come from this. I'm worried about my fathers health and my mothers well-being, I don't want to leave them alone but I also don't want to do nothing with my life. I live with my parents so figuring out where to live/etc would be another hassle.

I'm sorry, I don't know if this makes any sense but I'm extremely anxious and nervous about this whole ordeal and have no idea what to do. 

Thanks for anyone reading, sorry if this was annoying.

TLDR: Dad is sick, wants to move back to his home country, mom doesn't want to go. Parents have attachments to business here, not sure what to do due to education.",22Jul2018,1

About 2 week ago she told me she wasn't feeling anything anymore and said we should try to be friends. I tried to understand, but being the inept asshole that I am I still had some hope that it might go back to how it used to. We talked a lot still, being able to speak for hours on end, but I had doubts to whether or not we could stay on good terms. Last night I went with her and her best friend to a concert, got blackout drunk and told her a lot of stuff (mainly how I couldn't function without her and how I've been having nightmares since we ""broke up"", you know the usual stuff). I made an dumbass out of my self and most likely upset her immensely. We didn't part on good terms, and as I got home I just went to my room and collapsed on my bed. I was woken up by a text from a guy that she was friends with, telling me how I should just accept the fact that she doesen't feel the way I do otherwise there will be some "" bad shit"" going on (and knowing this guy that threat wasn't and empty one).

73,"Tonight is a self hate night. 

I opened my high school year book from 2014. I had a really hard time in HS- Socially,academically and psychologically. 
Everything and everybody seemed to tell me I wouldn’t make it. 

Even though I’ve done better than anyone expected, I graduated my state’s flagship college with zero debt and a good GPA, got a *professional* job offer paying 45k a year 60 days post graduation and am fit enough that I routinely get flirted with...

But I can’t shake the feeling of being a failure and worthless. I have a fantastic body, socially I’m adept when I choose to have social interaction, i’m considered smart, I’m going to be able to support myself financially.. I’ve outdone 80+% of my HS peers, many of my college cohort, both my sisters and according to my father- him too.. I’ve proven wrong everyone (except myself) that told me I’d be a failure. I’ve overcome hurdles smarter, wealthier peers haven’t.. 

But after opening this year book a tsunami of regret, self hate,bitterness, lost opportunity, failure and stagnation hit me like a wave. 

If I had been better then I could be so much better now. What was I thinking, why was I such a fuck-up??!? Why do I still feel like a fuck-up?!? Why am I living in the past..?? I deeply deeply regret not making more of my time in HS.. but then I remember how helpless and barely hanging on I felt... argh.. i’m just full of despair tonight.",22Jul2018,1

79,"Immediate Edit: title is a bit dramatic. Didn't proof read it after typing everything. Can't change it now. My bad. 


Hey fellow redditors,

To start off, I have a successful career with a good salary, so no financial issues so to speak. My relationship with my son is great, no issues there. I'm on good terms with his mother, no issues there.

I have only had 50/50 custody for a year. I graduated college 2 months prior. Everything was great for a while and I was content with my situation. But the past few months especiay have been tough. 

I haven't been in an actual relationship since I was 20, and only one sexual relationship that was brief and about 2 yrs ago. My friends are all spread out and often busy. I have no friends or people I know that are my age with a kid and single or are free. I feel isolated.

Couple things I feel I should mention. I have gone through periods of depression, especially because the mother of my son gaslighted me and cheated on me and it really messed me up for a while. But I was able to come back from it and it's a thing of the past. I also have ADHD (went through EXTENSIVE AND LENGTHY testing to confirm this, and am prescribed medication accordingly). 

I work as an Engineer and enjoy my job, though it is challenging and tiring (I work 9-10hrs per day on average leading multiple people and working several projects at once). But aside from when I have my kid, which I spend the whole time doing things with him and teaching him and having a good time, I will just come home, go to the gym, cook myself some dinner, watch something for 1-2hrs, then go to bed. Weekends without my kid are the worst. I have gone periods of 48hrs not saying a single word out loud. I have no one to have any form of continuous conversation with. I used to visit my parents all the time, but my attitude is becoming negative around even them, which I imagine is due to not having a relationship with anyone outside of my family. So I tend to not visit as often. It was almlst every weekend for a while. 

I have tried dating/friends stuff (Tinder, Bumble), and don't use social media other than snapchat. No luck. I feel like I lack self confidence, even though I know I'm at least moderately attractive. I get told repeatedly from women at work that are in a relationship, spanning from my age up to age 40+. I am always positive around others and have it as a goal to make others smile/be happy. I'm an introvert by nature but have learned to put myself out there. And I'm not afraid to strike up conversations. And I enjoy deeper, or at least extended, conversation. 

At this point, I just feel like a weirdo. I used to be able to do small talk, but lately the feelings of self doubt and loneliness have made it difficult. On top of everything, I'd like to find a meaningful relationship with someone my age. I want to grow with someone, and explore with them, share my life with them. I feel like, unless they are a single mom, they just become immediately uninterested because I have a son. This narrows things down considerably. Adding to the fact that most of the single moms my age that I have come across absolutely do not have their lives together, nor is their environment/background something I want to be in or bring my son into. This is just my experience, not generalizing here. 

I still have standards in a woman as well, and preferences. All of these factor in. I want to be clear that this is important, as I don't consider this a ""beggars can't be choosers"" moment. This is not that situation because I'm not just looking for anyone. Though I'm also not looking for the perfect-super-duper-amazing-zero-flaws one.  I also want to be clear that I harbor zero ill thoughts toward my son, but I know, based on only seeing him every other weekend during college and also somewhat from the last true relationship that I had, that if i did not have a kid, I would not be writing this. 

Now that we've gotten past my poorly written, poorly detailed book of a post I haphazardly wrote... 

I am looking for some guidance. I don't  think I need therapy based on everything. I just feel like my situation is distinctly unique. I have done hours of digging on the internet, and nothing comes very close. It's frustrating. I genuinely crave a connection. And I try. I have put myself out there but have been unsuccessful almost 100%. I don't really need to have a serious relationship. Honestly, at this point in my life, only being 23 I'd be fine with a FWB type of relationship. I just know that I can't ""casually"" date. I need one end or the other, based on who I am. 

Let me know whether more info is needed and I will make edits for it. Thank you for reading. 

TL:DR 
I've become lonely when I have free time due to unavailability of friends, inability to find/want new friends, and inability to make a connection with a woman my age (serious relationship or FWB). It's affecting my behavior and driving me insane in a non-mental illness way. Non-kid me would be living the life any way he chose to imo. Wow this is a bad tl:dr lol

83,"**TL;DR:** Girlfriend and I want to buy a house. Our apartment lease is up March of next year. It's our first house. We don't want to make stupid decisions. Any advice is appreciated.

My girlfriend and I are in our late 20's. We've been living in an apartment for a couple of years together. As of right now, we pay about 1,100 dollars just on rent. With a combined income, I think we can afford a house together. Our credit scores are pretty good (mine is better with a current 760 credit score). The only debt I have is my car, which I pay about 250 dollars a month at a 3% interest rate through my bank. I've never owned a house, and neither has my girlfriend...so we'd be first time home buyers. Realistically, by March, I'd expect to have 9,000 saved up for a down payment, but I definitely won't save up enough for 20% even if the house we buy is under 200k. I work 60+ hours a week Monday through Friday, so my girlfriend would be doing the majority of the paperwork and whatnot. We're thinking about getting a real estate agent. Also, we don't want an HOA.

Honestly, I don't know what to expect. I hear it's a long &amp; expensive process, so I'm just curious on things that I should consider, look into, think about, whatever you feel is important for me to know. Like I said, I don't want to make bad financial decisions. 

Keep in mind that my apartment lease isn't up till March. If I break the lease, I have to pay a certain amount depending on the lease agreement, etc etc.

I never had friends after graduating and stayed inside for 2 years with the deepest darkest depression I’ve ever experienced.

He’s 23. He is immature and weird but I’m very closed off and we connected super well and I love that he’s opposite of me.

90,"Hey all, so, I honestly don't even know where to begin. I'm a 24 year old woman who is on a first ever vacation with only my mom (43), and younger brother (13) and sister (15). This is the first time that our mom was ever able to afford to take us all somewhere.  It's extremely complicated but long story short, my mother lives in her own little world is constantly breaking my siblings hearts. She blames others for e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g. I don't know what to do. 

I went through the same thing when I was younger as our mom is an alcoholic, and kicked me out (I moved in with my dad) during my senior year of high school. It took me until I was 20 years old to realize that my mom will never see things we (including the rest of our family) do, and her main goal is to be our friend rather than our mother. However... if anyone were to actually see how their home situation looks (torn-up floors, mold, dog feces, broken tv/doors/lights, etc.) I'm sure my brother and sister would be taken away from our mom. In a round about way, I guess this is what I need advice about? But like I said, it's complicated. 

My sister and I just spoke about their situation. She's constantly upset anymore, and my brother has major anger issues which causes further problems. To be honest, we are a family full of anxiety, depression, and anger.  My sister is always telling my mom to not come home ""tipsy"" and to smoke less cigarettes for example. Our mom though sees it as her children bossing her around. She just gets pissed off and storms off saying how she's sick of her children trying to be her mom rather than her kids. My point is, it took up until a few years ago for my mom and I to have a real relationship. I struggled as a teen, up until when I realized that I just needed to ignore her and accept that she will ALWAYS blame others for anything that goes wrong.

During our trip, our mom keeps freaking out and telling the kids that they are the reason that she is desperate for a cigarette (when she runs out) and things like how they make her want to jump off a bridge. 
My sister and I just sat on the beach for hours while she told me how she feels. I'm so heartbroken. She cares so much about our mom, and all she wants is our mom to enjoy our vacation. I feel like this is all so backwards and I just don't know how to handle it. While we spoke for hours, I couldn't help but just tell her that it's sometimes best to ignore mom and accept that she's always gonna let us down. It's horrible but true. 

Anyways, I'm just looking for advice I guess to give my sister. She thinks seeing a counselor or therapist isn't necessary, and I just don't know how to handle this aside from giving her harsh and sad truths about our mom...
PS. I'm leaving out a ton of details. Our situation is extremely complicated. 

Edit: I exhaustedly rambled and definitely shouldn't have. I'm upset and want to have another talk with my sister tomorrow.

She knows a lot of people from my job and lately I’ve been having a few people mention this to me along with a lot of my coworkers giving me glares and negative looks. The thing is I got a full std test a month after she and I broke up and I’m clean, I’ve never had an std in my life. 

I’ve gotten a lot of negative impact from this socially, I almost got uninvited from a friends wedding because she told the bride to be I had cheated on her and given her Chlamydia. Tonight she messaged me, 5 days after my friend said something and said there was something we needed to talk about, I told her that we didn’t need to talk because I had never cheated on her and I didn’t give her any stds and I’d appreciate it if she didn’t spread rumors about me, she become really hostile and starts telling me she’s just being honest to people and that she told everyone she may have got it from a different partner, she has been sexually active immediately after our breakup with at least 5 partners. Her logic is that it was me because Chlamydia can remain dormant for a while and she said the doctor said she had it bad so she must of had it for a while. 

I tried explaining to her that I had got a post breakup test and that it wasn’t me and she shouldn’t facilitate rumors that would negatively affect me, she called me a liar and said that I was being a dick for telling her she was being immature spreading this rumor without at least consulting me about the situation first. She doesn’t understand why I’d have a problem with this and when I told her she caught it from someone else and that she was making her problem my problem her cousin started threatening me on Facebook saying he was going to give me a beatdown, I’m not too worried about that so I told him to grow up and blocked him. 

I’m just worried about repercussions from this rumor and I’m about to make another appointment to get checked again even though I’m certain I don’t have anything.

I have a nice stomach but I feel so so depressed. I’ve never been with anyone (haven’t met the right person) and I feel like no one will ever want me. ",22Jul2018,2
105,"Just for the record, we are engaged and we love each other. We have a great relationship, spend plenty of time together, never fight ( just you natural little couple arguments) and we both work a ton. I am very attracted to him of course but I've become shy with engaging in or initiating In sexual acts with him. We haven't been intimate in about a year now. I would like to but I feel shy or weird about it now. It would be awesome if he was more aggressive but he's not.  How do we start up the spark again? 

Normally I'd say there's an issue with our relationship but there's really not. We are both totally healthy and happy. Somewhere along the way we lost our sexual draw. Maybe he feels weird about it too. I almost feel like it's because we know each other too well know. When you first start dating someone there's a lot of mystery and it's fun. Has this happened to anyone else ? I'd like to get back into it. Normally I'm aggressively sexual but have felt apprehensive...like I'm not hot enough or something",22Jul2018,0
106,"So I had a friend from the ages of 7-9... 

    He was a boy about 4 years older than me who treated me like a little sister. We quickly grew close and became good friends.

    One day while we were outside on his trampoline together, he asked if I wanted to see something ""cool"". Being a curious child, I of course said yes. The boy began taking his shirt off, and his pants off, and I found this funny. He hen suggested we go under a blanket, which we did. That's when he removed his final piece of clothing, along with him asking if we could try something called sex. He then went on to describe how it worked, and at this point I was already both disgusted, and confused. I turned away screaming for him to put his ""thing"" away, which he quickly did. 

    When I frantically got up to leave, he grabbed me and begged me not to tell my parents. I was terrified at this point, so my only reply was to kick at him and run back to my house. I didn't tell my parents after the experience due to my own guilt. 

    For some reason, I continued to hang out with him after that. He seemed completely unneffected by this, which slightly confused me at the time. 

    Things went on like normal, but I still remember multiple questionable times. Times when he'd ask to have sex with me as a ""joke"". Times where he'd tie me up when we played cops and robbers. Times where we'd give eachother massages which he suggested. 


To this day, I still haven't wrapped my head around the situation. I don't know if it was sexual harassment, or simply a young kid being curious. All I know is that it doesn't help me sleep at night.

107,"I live with my mum and I’m a stripper but she won’t allow it. I’m also studying to get a degree and have another job as a cover. 

I only live with her because I feel sorry for her and my brother killed himself so she was suicidally sad and didn’t want to be alone. 

Whenever I want to go out to strip, i dont know how but she knows I’m going out to strip. I hide it pretty well but the problem is she goes through my handbag, she goes through every tiny corner of my room to always try to check if I’m still stripping. She has gone through my private things and bags before and found loads of cash, slutty costumes etc so she probably still does go through my private belongings and that’s how she knows. 

I don’t know what to do because whenever I leave the house she looks at me angrily and suspiciously and I get anxiety about even asking to leave the house.

I don’t want to lose my mum, but I want to be a stripper I don’t want to live my whole life based ok her rules. 
If I move out now without a proper job or finishing my degree, my mum has already said she’ll cut all ties with me and she’s not joking.

109,"Long story short: our family dog is 13 and recently we've noticed that he's been losing a lot of weight. We didn't become too concerned, until yesterday we discovered a quite large and round mass on his abdomen. My family all pretty much knew what this means and what we will have to do very soon.

Over the past few years, we've known that we will have to prepare for the inevitable day our dog passes as he's gotten older, but I don't know if I can handle this. My family is already going through an extremely stressful and uncertain time, and I can't handle losing my best friend. I literally grew up with this dog. I'm afraid that I could (literally) have some sort of mental breakdown if we have to let go of him anytime soon...

I was wondering how people deal with the loss of their pet and how can someone prepare for that loss at all...",22Jul2018,6
111,"So first things first, I'm going to be very blunt on everything that went on with him, and I'm trying to figure out how he can leave this hole he trapped himself in.

First, he majored in a very useless degree called Exercise Science, which apparently it's about what professional trainers do or something but he never practiced it, he's totally out of shape and honestly since he graduated in 2016 he probably forgot 100% of what the heck he studied in college.

  
End result, he owes 25 thousand dollars in loans to his university in East Coast.

Next, after graduating and desperate to find a job, in August 2016 he managed to get in touch with a friend all the way in West coast (California) who offered him a 40k job as a chemist, though, the job doesn't really rely on knowing chemistry too much, and it's pretty much a labor job carrying around heavy stuff through the lab and prepare solutions according to specifications.

Although that sounds good, his dad forced him to buy a car before moving to California on the promise that he (the father) would pay for it. My friend insisted to his dad to buy a cheaper car but his dad was stubborn and asked for a big car and told him to shut up and just drive since he'd pay for it.

End result, his dad got in an accident and needed his son to pay for the rest of the car. That was in September 2016. 2 years later and not a peep from his dad about getting the bills again. He now owes 25 thousand dollars in a 4runner with a terrible mileage (about 18 mpg in city, 21mpg on freeway). He definitely cannot afford the car.

Next (yes, there's more), the guy managed to find a girl ""interested"" in him. Problem is, she's an immigrant here on a J1 visa. She's pretty, but she's from a country with lots of problems and clearly doesn't want to go back. She lived in the west coast for awhile, now she lives in Florida. Both of them do sort of a distant relationship, they met through a common contact between the two. They've went out on less than 20 dates total, and kind of hit it off. Chances are very big the girl is interested in him to become a U.S citizen, though, she seems nice (I don't personally know her).

End result is marriage. The guy wants an excuse to be left alone from his family and some people and the excuse he finds is to get married. I told him that was a bad idea thousands of times but he ignored and says he's sure about it, but I'm not gonna touch on this. It's his decision, let him do what he feels it's best.

Lastly, with all that said, he's going to get married next month and his immigration lawyer is going to order him (for sure) to move in with her immediately so it won't look like she paid him to get married. He doesn't want to live in California, he's miserable here because the rent is too high, he can barely afford gas (he lives sharing a room with me and he's almost 30), and his job is shitty with no way to move up.

The next couple of months will be fatal. It's a crossroad on the dudes life. He wants to afford a house, he wants to afford a family, but he cannot. California is really brutal for people like him because there are not a lot of jobs that he can work with.

He's willing to move anywhere (I gave the idea of him going to Florida and work as Uber driver for awhile until he finds a job he can replace it with), as long as the rent is cheap, there are places for jobs, and the gas is cheaper as well. Right now his plan is to get his girl in California and live here until he gets a job offer in East Coast, but I told him that chance is 0% (or close) since he got here out of luck from a friend's referral, and that won't repeat again unless he knows someone who can help him there (which he doesn't). He doesn't know what to do.

Should he risk moving to another state without a job and start from scratch ? Maybe work uber for awhile until he finds something? Or just remain on the plan he currently is? What do you guys suggest?

tl;dr friend of mine has about 50 thousand dollars in car and student loans to pay, he's getting married next month with a girl living in a different state and needs to move in somewhere to live with her as soon as it happens. He definitely cannot afford a family in California the way he is (bad job + loans), cannot afford housing and barely afford his car. He eventually wants to own a house one day with his family. He can either move out of the state, or stay in California until he gets a job offer from another state (though this is unrealistic af). He really doesn't want to live in Cali, but he's stuck. What should he do? ",22Jul2018,1

And I still live with my parents(I know people around my age usually get their own space but I don’t live in place where rent would cost 1/3~1/2 of my salary, and my mom is ill so I can’t easily just move out).

The life I’m having now is just boring as hell. Since my working hours is 2:00~10:30 pm(media work can’t have normal 9~5 working hours lol), I usually woke up at 9:30 am and then have breakfast and go to hit and leave at 12:00 then finish lunch before 1 pm and go to work. After I got home from work it’s usually 11:30 pm and I just sit on coach relaxing till 12:30 and go to bed waiting for next day to come.

I feel like my life is definitely not the best for someone in 20s. Plus, I’m kind of a introvert so I don’t really have friends to hang out and my working hours just make it harder to know new people. Sometime I watch TV and see people around 20~30 having fun, get drunk, hang out with friends I just feel jealous and mentally exhausted and feel like I’m living life like an lonely old man(but thank god I’m super healthy). And I start worrying when I’m older, I might have less chance to make friends, enjoy life. 

I’ve considered about getting  another job but I don’t have many experience on my resume so I failed at some interview before. And I’m also worried if I just quit this job, i might lose touch with coworkers, and get more lonelier, socially awkward.

121,"My mom is on disability pension due to the fact that she suffers with depression and schizophrenia. My mom hates her life, and because of that she has been spending almost all of her money she gets from her disability on a psychic/fortune teller from India.

She says she's doing this to make her a better person, and my mom thinks she has psychic powers. My mom hasn't been getting better, she aggressively talks to herself, and her room is a pig sty. She's constantly broke, and she's making herself financially poor. The reason it bothers me is obviously because she's my mom, and also because she asks me for money constantly, and I of course firmly refuse everytime, so she ends up borrowing money from the bank and druggies. The only time I give her money, is for her to do chores if I don't feel doing it that day. I refuse giving her any money just for the hell of it, because she will just become dependent on me like a freeloader, which she was when I did give her money. I keep convincing her that she is wasting her money, but she won't listen, she still continues to do without hesitation every month.

123,"Hey guys. I'm (17M) in a situation I'd like a bit of advice with and here it is. 

I'm from Romania but I've lived in the Netherlands for the past 7 years, going to a British School. Guess you could say I'm pretty much a hipster/city dweller as far as my subculture goes. Back in Romania for the holidays, I'm now at my grandma's village for a few days.

Here I have this friend, Ioana(18F), who I've known since we were babies because our parents are friends and I went out with her last night through the village. Thing is is this village is kind of a bad area as in some fighty people live around here.

Anyway, while being out this guy we can call Alex (23M) she knows joined us from the street and started asking for a phone from someone to play music on. I didn't know him at all and he seemed kind of sketchy but usually I hang out with people I know better so just instinctually I offered mine, not knowing I was gonna involve myself more with him.

Then Ioana kind of feigned being sick to go home from him and us two walked her together. After that he asked me to stay a bit more and I thought for some reason I should, cause why not, he was being relatively friendly. Kind of a bad mistake.

Then we were walking through the village and found this guy's house who was sitting on the doorstep and playing music really loudly and we went in the yard. Alex seemed to know the guy and told him I was his cousin. 

For the next two hours we hung out out there and drank a lot of beer and smoked a lot. Usually I like to drink a little when I'm with friends and maybe smoke a bit if I haven't done it in a while, but these guys were passing that shit around...like, really fast. So I partook because of the peer pressure. Throughout the stay it was clear we couldn't really relate to each other very well, we just were different kinds of people with different kinds of lives. It looked like they thought I was 'not one of them'. 

But the guy (let's call him Martin) was friendly and smiley all the way. At one point he took out a baseball bat and brass knuckles and a pocket knife and started play-swinging them around. He kept talking about how he would beat people up when he wanted to. 

Then we left and when I asked Alex why he said I was his cousin he said I would've gotten beaten up otherwise for acting the way I act (not only I don't relate to these kinds of people, but I don't know Romanian that well because of 7 years in the Netherlands, so I really just could not communicate well with them. You could feel the culture gap).

Then we hung around a bit more during which time he said he had a very short fuse and if I had said one word out of place tonight I would have been in a ditch right then. At around 3 in the morning we both got sleepy, and he asked for my number, which I gave after all he said about violence, and then we went home. 

Now it's the morning and he's called me a few times already. I don't want to hang out with him anymore, or smoke and drink that much, or be in yards like that guy's with the brass knuckles. How do I distance myself away from Alex while still being able to go to the village I spent so much time as a child in and which I consider a special place, and also not pissing him off?

She's only 20 years old, and so is this guy, according to her. 
Apparently she feels like she's wasted her teen years because I put her in homeschooling instead of a public school, but that was to keep her from getting pregnant.

127,"Okay, so I was in a group of friends it was me a gay M with 3 Fs. We were all close since high school and have had some minor fights or arguments, but nothing ever huge. Last year around October 3 of us were planning a group trip to another country. Since I had the money and felt it was a good gift I ended up buying the airplane tickets and airbnb. I thought it was an appropriate gift knowing how close we were. I assumed wrong because one of the 2 girls thought it was too big of a gift and cancelled. I kind of got mad at her, but I got over it after awhile. The other one was shocked, but she was excited and ready for the trip. The trip wasn't until January, but by December I had gotten a new job and was kind of broke so I knew I wasn't going to be able to go to the trip. The one that was still going asked me a few things about the place we were staying at a month before the trip. My dumb ass got nervous and started avoiding her and not responding. A few days later when I finally got the courage I told her in a text that I was so sorry but I wasn't going to be able to go on the trip. I didn't have the money and had not planned out anything well I told her.

In hindsight now, I know I fucked up and should have been upfront with her. Instead I ignored her and made everything worse. Anyways she blew up on text telling me that I should have been honest and responded instead of being shady af. I knew I had fucked up so I didn't respond because I didn't know what to say.

After that her and the other 2 friends stopped talking to me. They would hangout and do things but never invite me. I know I fucked up but I did not think I would lose all my friends over my stupid actions. I decided to give my friend some time to cool off and tried talking to her a month later, but she wouldn't respond to my messages asking if we could talk. After another while I sent her a text that said '""Can we please talk?"" and she finally responded ""No""

I want advice on what I should do now? I feel pathetic because it has literally been around 6 months since January and I have not moved on from the situation. I still care about all 3 of them but I feel like they hate me. I'm not sure what the one that is mad at me feels because we never got to clear the air...should I try to contact her one last time? I want to go to her house and knock on her door and just apologize and fix everything between us. My family and other friends tell me it's a bad idea but I don't know what to do. Do you think I have any chance of salvaging our friendships even though so many months have passed? I would think after all this time she isn't mad at me and would be willing to talk? I just wish I had never ignored her, but obviously I can't go back in time....what should I do?

**TLDR:** I got in a fight with a friend after cancelling a trip last minute. Ended up losing an entire friend group because of it. I tried to apologize but she wouldnt see me in person. It has been 6 months and I still want to try to talk to her in person. Is it too late? Any advice?

My mom told me that my sister is using me and told me to think for myself. She then ask me what my sister did for me. I’m not sure how to respond to that without starting a fight. We lived together before and I never felt that my sister used me in any way. She does ask me to do things like cook or clean to do my share, since she and her boyfriend (now fiancé) tends to do those things if I don’t do them and told me to get a job so I can pay the bills (I didn’t have a job before living with her).  At times she does get lazy and ask me to close her door or get her something to drink. I don’t mind since I did those things for her since I was little. We decided to live with my mom to start looking for a house, and my mom knew we were looking for a house. My mom told us to finish school first before looking for a house, and we did just that. When living with my mom we didn’t have to pay bill, since my mother and father would do just that. When my mother had trouble paying the bills, she would tell us two or three days before it was due (this was when my father left to visit family). When my sister and I said that we don’t have money, my mom would get upset. Feeling bad, I would take money out of my savings to pay the bills. She would end up getting mad at my sister for not paying those bills and told me it was a test. My sister end up paying the internet. Before the fight even started, a family member that is very close to my mother became very ill. I think my mom is just lashing out due to stress, since she is helping paying the medical bills.

132,"Before I give you the short story, I'll just say I definitely admit I'm probably thinking about a fantasy rather than a reality. I'm aware of that.

I got a new job in 2012 and met this girl there. I've always been terrible with girls but somehow with her, I was smooth and charming and played it cool, and was everything I wanted to be naturally. She had a boyfriend at the time, and I was single. I flirted with her a bit and over a short period of time, we were meeting up outside work, going to hotels etc. Not my proudest moment but you know, it kind of was my proudest moment. The sneaking around was fun, and we actually did connect, had long chats about stuff, and we got on incredibly well.

Anyway, after 4 months of that, with things getting better and better, I decided to be a dick and push her to leave him, and things got a bit complicated and she got made redundant and our opportunities to see each other reduced and she eventually said she was going to try and make it work with him.

I found out after through other sources that his dad died and I guess she didn't want to leave him at that time. I still remain a bit convinced that she stayed reluctantly.

Anyway, I haven't seen her or spoken to her since then.

I've been married, divorced, had a kid, got into 3 other relationships since the divorce and I'm now in probably the best relationship I've ever had. Things are going well.

But I have a vivid detailed dream involving her about twice a week. I subconsciously search for her on Google randomly to see what she's up to. I know her car registration and subconsciously scan passing similar cars to see if it's her.

She's definitely the one that got away, and I think I was her one too.

There's no way for me to contact her or see her, unless by mistake.

I am happy with my partner now but I don't know why I keep thinking of her. It's been 6 years. In the dreams, I'm always incredibly happy and that makes me worry I'm settling in real life. But is it settling if the assumed top option just isn't available or possible?

134,I’m having some issues dealing with the loss of a friendship that I thought was genuine and that it would last forever. We had so many sentimental moments and then he started hanging out with someone else and he stopped keeping in touch and hanging out with me. 14 years down the drain for no reason at all. Has anyone else dealt with his? How do I make it easier to cope with? We’ve been friends since 4th grade and we’re both 20 now and graduates but he just switched up on me and found a new best friend. Now he’s on Facebook tagging this new guy in all of these best friend pictures that he used to tag me in. It really hurts and I’ve already talked to him about all this and he says that he’s just been busy. Doesn’t message me at all like he used too and he says I overthink stuff but..we just used to be so close and I don’t blame the other guy because he’s my friend too but I just don’t know how to move on from this.,22Jul2018,5

136,"My roommate is one of my closest friends. He's funny, offers good advice and he's fun to hang with. 
Well recently I've felt very uncomfortable around him. He laughs whenever I read a news headline about people dying which is obviously not funny. He's suicidal a lot and almost acted upon it a month or so ago. 
Well, here's to the scary part. Not long ago he told me he had a scenario play through his head. *He points a shotgun at his good friend. The friend is yelling please don't, and he shoots him in the head.* He started laughing about it. 
Well recently, he's been reading about serial killers and told me he's always thinking about killing other people or himself. 
I'm very uncomfortable right now and don't know what to do. He's one of my good friends so I don't want to throw him under the bus with my house manager (who has the authority to give anyone the boot whenever he'd like due to a signed contract). He's one of my good friends and we're really close. I also don't have enough money just yet to move out.

137,"A few years ago I was dealing with some stuff that made me really sad. I heard about cutting online and people saying how its super relieving and stuff. 

One day I picked up a knife cause I thought it would help. I was too chicken to do it. I slowly got better. 

About a year ago, I was in pain again. Instead of picking up a knife, I started imaging what it would feel like to actually do the deed. I won't go into detail about what it feels like so I don't accidentally trigger people.

144,"Hi everyone!

A little backstory maybe could help us here:

I'm a 37yo Belgian teacher in dire need of change. 

I have been teaching Logistics/Cross-cultural Marketing/Merchandising and basic level English for the last 13 years of my life, but the prospects of ""securing"" this job (nomination in the network I teach in) is dire to say the least. 

I decided that enough was enough and resigned/refused to continue next year under such conditions, and since have started working towards my lifelong goal of moving away from Belgium.

Single, I don't have any family or relationships that could make me hesitate any longer.

But where do I go from here? 

I am a hard worker, pick up on languages easily,  and money shouldn't be a problem for the next 5-6 years of renting and living expenses.

I just want to integrate, discover, and feel useful to a communauty again. To start fresh.

But that's where I'm stuck. I can't seem to focus at all, and it's been like that for the last 30 days. I'm at a loss for ideas.

I thought of moving to Italy, Chile, Cambodia, ... but each time I get lost in my fear of flinging myself halfway across the globe with nothing to bring to a communauty, where job opportunities are scarce in that domain.

So if any of you great gals and guys have an idea of where an ex-foreign trade teacher that wants to start a new life could go , or if you did something similar and could give me some life-turning advices, it would be greatly appreciated and surely would help me in the next big step towards my own rebuilding. How do I get on about deciding and commiting?

She has a boyfriend who I happen to be friends with. We start talking every single day and this happens for about a month and I start to catch feelings for her, no biggie it’s just a little crush and I’d never act on it. So I go about my life and we continue to be friends. Now here’s where things start to get messed up. The couple starts to argue more and more and the boyfriend seems to start treating the girl with less respect. There’s this other person I was friends with and I let my guard down and trusted them to keep it a secret that I liked this person. I just felt like I had to tell someone. This person goes on to inform the girls boyfriend but not only that they tell him that I was trying to get her to cheat and break up with him. Now considering everything that happened in my most recent relationship this isn’t something I would ever do. Anyway her boyfriend gets extremely mad at her and me and says some things that make her upset. Here’s where the fucked up part is. Apparently she had also started to catch feelings for me and has been losing feelings for her boyfriend. So she breaks up with him and everyone hates me and thinks I’m some demon except for her, she’s the only one who knows the truth and listens to me. Now her boyfriend is heartbroken and she has to decide whether to follow through with her choice or continue to be with him, either way I’m coming out of this looking like an asshole. She feels absolutely terrible about this and doesn’t know what to do, she’s a good person and doesn’t deserve this situation. Is this my fault?

147,"When I was 15, i started a new school. The kids didn't like me for reasons that I still don't know. But they still let me hang out with them because I was a weird and awkward kid. 

After about a few weeks one of my classmates mothers passed away. And because out families knew each other, I was the only one from school who visited her. Although I didn't say much, I was very awkward when it came to death and funerals. But I still visited her (remember this as you read the rest of the story) 

Fasr forward a couple of months and this girl started to get really clingy with me. I questioned it because I knew I was disliked by others and it took me about a year to believe that her friendship could be genuine. As we got closer, I got to know more about her family life. After her mother's death, She had to move in with her abusive father, who would manipulate her into giving him some of themoney that her mother left her. Sometimes she would run away to her sisters house but he would still find a way to bring her back. 

One day she told me that her father was going to pick her up from school and force her to go with him. And begged me to try to stop him. I was hesitant at first but i agreed. I held on tightly to her when he came and when that didn't work I stood in front of his walking car (looking back this very stupid and melodramatic of me, teenagers eh) I even spoke to my teachers and called the police and told them everything. To this day her family hate me for doing this. 

No fast forward to last year and my father past away. I heard nothing from her, I was very upset as she was the last person I expected this from. I then decided to forgive her because only a month after my father passed, my cousin commuted suicide. So I decided to let things go because I really needed a friend at the time. I called her in tears and just wanted to speak with someone. She seemed very upset, but more for herself and not for me. She said that death upsets her too much and she doesn't like to think about it. Well imagine how I'm feelings after losing two family members within one month? And imagine how awkward it was for me to visit her at age 15 when I didn't know what to say or do, but I still made the effort to go and see her. 

Anyway I decided to end the friendship after that. Although she did apologise and I have accepted it but have stuck with my decision to not continue our friendship. I just can't help imagining that something else will happen to me and she will fail to be supportive to me. 

But was I wrong for doing this? Could she have some sort of trauma relating to her mother's death and in unable to cope when even strangers die? Am I wrong for thinking that my feelings go first when I'm grieving, despite how upsetting it is for her to be reminding of her mother?",22Jul2018,0
148,"First of all: Trigger warning. I'm aware my opinions are wrong, and I WANT to change them but it feels impossible. Here we go. 

I'm jealous of girls who have been raped. I haven't been raped and I feel like it's because I'm ugly, undesirable. If a man rapes you it means he wants you *so* much that he's risking jail just to have sex with you. When the  ""me too"" thing was going on, all my classmates were posting how they got groped etc and feeling sorry for themselves. I felt so left out and hideous, no man has even catcalled me. I don't get why. 

I also feel like girls who get raped deserve it. Not always, if it's a child or an innocent girl, or as a part of a violent crime. But if it's a girl who's sexually active, goes to parties, and wears tank tops, she's already a slut so why is it a big deal if someone wants to have sex with her? If she doesn't want it, she's just being picky. Too bad she didn't enjoy the sex, at the end of the day that's what it is. Sorry whore but you fucking deserved it. 

Okay, that was all I needed to get out. I don't know how to change these views because I know they're wrong. I don't know how they started, no one's taught me these views and I'm genuinely confused. Whenever I read about rape I get so angry but for the WRONG reasons. I'd never tell anyone irl about these views because I'd be shunned. But if I keep them to myself they'll just grow. 

What do I do?

By the end of the year....i noticed that for some reason i started gaining interess in her ....
I decided to come clear about it on the way back when i walk her to the bus stop.
I didn't (i was the shy guy).
So i kinda give up that... But 2 month later *em* contacted me saying she wanted to meet...i did 
Since both of us went to different colleges we had time to catch up....still i didn't say anything.

We kept seeing each other every now and then
Till last week were i decided to do it for real this time 
I meet her we started chatting like we always did ... Till one point where i decided to do it 
So i asked her if she know that i had feeling for her... she said she did and she know that i didn't say anything cz i was shy
I felt optimistic and decided to keep going and told her if i should take it to the next stage and i would like to date her.
Her um answer her me hard 
She said it's for the best if we stay friends
I smiled yet it hurt inside .. And asked get why?
She replied that she think i would change if we were partner also she still dating someone and things aren't same as they were before she dated him (between them) yet she doesn't want me to change.

158,"Long post because I'm bad at explaining things in a short manner - TLDR at bottom

Some context, I'm FtM transgender (born female identifies as male) and came out at work in April of this year. My manager(s) and (most) coworkers have been super chill about my transition, except for an older lady in my department. We work in a grocery store and she was transferred over to my department due to racism towards her coworkers in her previous department.

I have informed my department manager, the lead hand, the assistant manager, and the store manager all on separate occasions. Nothing has been done. The least they could do is tell her directly that I'm not comfortable with these comments and leave it at that, but they haven't said a word to her. It's making me stressed and anxious about coming to work. I don't want her to be fired, I just want her to know these comments aren't appropriate, especially in the workplace.



Comments she's made about my trans status include -

* ""Don't bother trying to 'pass', you'll never escape your XX chromosomes.""
* ""You'd fit right in with those ladyboys in Thailand""
* ""You and your dad should have a father - daughter night out. Sorry, I meant father *person* night out.""
* ""I met a transman at dollar tree today. I told **her** about you.""
* ""There's two transwomen in the store. Do you want to come meet them?""



She goes on these long rants about how taking hormones (Testosterone) will ruin my life and it feels (to me at least) like she's implying that I'm making the wrong 'choice' by 'choosing to be trans'. These comments are slight paraphrasing, though they are all separate incidents and apart from one or two, all of these were brought up out of nowhere on her part.

* ""You like to draw Kred? Be careful you won't be able to draw after you do hormones""
* ""You'll lose your ability to draw or walk or talk""
* ""You won't be able to write anything after you start testosterone""
* ""It's rare that a trans person is sane after hormones. Don't trust what you see on the internet""
* ""Doctors are paid off by the government and by big pharma to prescribe you testosterone to make you go insane""
* ""Doctors are paid to put people into mental asylums""
* ""Doctors intentionally prescribe you too much testosterone so your body can't handle it""
* ""Doctors prescribe you too little testosterone so you think nothing is happening and you go insane""
* ""Doctors give you testosterone so they can give you anti psychotics when the testosterone makes you suicidal""
* ""Doctors will lock you up in a mental asylum so they don't have to think about you while they take vacations paid for by selling you testosterone""
* ""Testosterone will give you cancer""
* *""Trans people are depressed because of the hormones the doctors give them. Not because they're stigmatised or oppressed. As a woman growing up in the 60s and 70s, I was oppressed! But you didn't see us being weak and killing ourselves over it.""

*this comment is a shorter, heavily paraphrased version of an argument we had which is why it reads weirdly

These are not all the comments she has made to me. In the past few weeks she's stopped making these comments directly to me but has been making the same comments about me behind my back to my coworkers.

I don't feel comfortable coming into work, especially seeing as my department manager schedules me with her 2-3 times a week, where I'm alone with her for upwards of four hours.

**I HAVE TRIED TO ASK HER TO STOP BEFORE**

She responded by cutting me off and blaming it on completely unrelated things (blames her behaviour on our department manager, on the store manager, on the lead hand, on a 15 year old coworker).

This also is not the biggest series of drama/incidents with her either. I'll probably do a separate post looking for advice on how to deal with that.

Though that didn't stop me from googling his name time to time to see if he was still kicking.

Fast forward to October 2011 when I was in my early 20's. I googled him like I do every six months or so and found his recent obituary. In it was listed his wife at the time, my sister's and my name, along with another sister; my half sister. I knew I had one just never was able to find her. I assumed she was married and had a changed last name, to which I found was correct as her married name was on the obit. 

I found her on facebook and created a fake account to ask her if she was [father's name] daughter, and if she had any sisters by the names of [mine and my sister's name]. She immediately responded yes, and that she had been looking for us for years. We clicked almost from the start and a week later I flew to visit her.

Fastforwarding to March 2017 and I did an ancestry.com kit.

Fast forward to February 2018 and suddenly I had a new relative match on ancestry: A cousin who's name I didn't recognize. I messaged him and he told me he had been adopted from birth and was looking for his birth parents. Long story short he was the son of my father's sister, and she put him up for adoption when she was 16. I asked my mother if she knew anything and she said no, a child was never mentioned. 

That was when she decided to tell me that I have a half brother running around out there. Apparently when he was young my birth father was in the army and stationed in Oklahoma. While out there he knocked up one of the local girls and when she refused to get an abortion he peaced out. The only thing I know about the potential half brother is the base my birth father was stationed. We don't know the woman's name, and he wasn't around for the birth so we know nothing other than it was a boy.

Has anyone ever had an experience like this? Is there any way of tracking him down? Honestly I've been hoping he would have done one of those DNA kits, but so far it's been no good.

tl;dr: I may have a half brother running around. Should I try to find him with little to no information?

173,"So this is something that’s been bothering me for quite some time. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years and we’re getting to that age where planning this stuff actually matters.

My problem is, I am in love with my last name. A huge part of this is the fact that it’s a very uncommon, very Italian last name. The main reason though, is that my dad passed away when I was 18 and I only have 2 sisters. We only have 1 guy cousin with our last name and he’s younger/hard to predict what will happen. My dad’s death has given me a huge appreciation for my last name, especially because my parents were praying to finally have a boy.. but they got me, and my first name is based on his as well. 

Any time I’ve brought up that I would maybe like my future children to have my last name, my bf is completely against it. He’s definitely avid on them having his last name. And I hate to say it but I really hate the name. He actually has a very interesting Central/South American background that you would expect to have a more “exotic” name, but his last name is one of the most generic boring American last names (no clue how that happened). 

I’m just getting to this point that I really don’t know what to do if/when the situation arises. I still know if we get married I’m “supposed” to take his last name, and I’m just like 50/50 on it. Obviously I could live with it, but I just feel like I would be missing a huge part of myself. And then if I were to have children, I feel like I could have this really weird resentment about them not having my name. Hyphenating is not an option, both of our names are too long and sound really dumb hyphenated. If you’ve actually read this far, I would love to hear any input because I just don’t know what to (maybe do) in the future!!",22Jul2018,1
174,"Yo I’m a guy with a habit of putting my foot in my mouth. I’ll usually apologise and do all that bit, Except after doing so I have this mixed feeling of “oh come on I made a joke about lemons, you know for a fact there was no malice” vs “oh shoot What if I’m a garbage person?” and have this weird angel-from-buffy style brooding thought spiral of resenting both myself and the person offended - not that it’s their fault usually - (as well as taking a mental note that Janet has lemon themed trauma, don’t discuss lemons in front of Janet*.) sometimes to keep it spicy I remind myself that I’m a white guy and therefore almost predestined to be a politically incorrect creep yada yada yada (untrue scheme but still).







meanwhile the person going through it has usually completely forgiven and forgotten the situation. this goes on until I get snapped out of it. It’s got the added bonus of me almost going into “oh shoot I’m gonna say something stupid” alert around some minorities/women even tho I have no desire to, no overt anti minority sentiments, and would genuinely like this human if I wasn’t on alert mode, because I’m worried I’ll become “that one white fuckboy from sociology class whose creeping me out.”

Maybe it’s linked to my reluctance to take criticism and advice on things both trivial and serious (but mainly things I value) without feeling either slightly insulted or like it’s a reflection on me instead of my friends trying to debug my behaviour.






Obviously this creeps into my head flirting with women that haven’t established a chill with my presence/occasional loose cannon-ness, luckily for me ~bisexuality/cute boys, and nice girls I already know who think I’m kinda chill~ Also exist, so I can flirt and joke and be chill without issue most of the time, it’s not a major issue, but these things bother me.








Also I’m taking any replies with a grain of salt because ya can’t replace good mental health services with internet strangers







if ya want I can make up some deep seated lemon themed trauma to make the example work 😜

About a month ago I was at 58kg or 128lbs at 5'5/165cm. After some dieting I'm now hovering over 55kg/121lbs. My goal weight is 53kg/117lbs and I know I would be able to achieve that before I resume college next month. 

However, my parents and close friends have been telling me that I am ""thin"" enough and should just maintain my current weight. They also tell me how they are concerned over my obsession with losing weight and that I'm sick for thinking I'm overweight in the first place.

I would be OK with stopping at my current weight but I can't help but feel like I've failed at reaching my goal since it has always been 53kg from the start. It was the weight I was at when I was around 15 or 16 years old. I've included some before and after photos below. Please be nice

198,"I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

204,"Hello, 
I have a 13 year old sister who is too attached and clingy to my mom and me.  Most of the day she does things she could do in her own room, but always wants to loiter in other people's rooms. When she's in someones room she wants to invade others' personal space by being on them, being clingy, and just generally any physical contact including hugging. At first it's cute, but it becomes a hassle having a 100 lb girl lay on you for an hour.

I used to think she was just overly affective but lately it's been getting really weird. She doesn't want to leave our rooms. I didn't used to mind when she was in my room, but now she just sits in there with me for hours everyday. It seems harmless until I tell her to get out. I tell her to get out nicely around five to ten times. She doesn't give a response and I leave her alone for a good ten minutes. I continue asking her to get out as it is late at night most of the time, and I want to be alone to get sleepy. I start to get annoyed and angry that she will not get out and begin aggressively demanding her to leave. She still ignores my responses and either stares blankly at her phone or lays in silence.

I begin to poke her and give her nudges to get out or even slightly push her off my bed. All she does is lay expressionless as she allows me to yell at her or nudge her out. Everytime it ends with me having to drag her seemingly lifeless body out of my room. She makes her body go fully limp and when your almost done pulling her out in fustration she retalliates by either cussing at me or unnecessary violence. Keep in mind that all I do is poke or pull her body out and I ask her to leave for a good hour. I do not hit her and I don't even cuss at her, even in anger.


Every time, I am left with a couple of scratches or I'm completely exhausted. She does this exact same thing to our mom, even the cursing and violence ( my sister doesn't hit my mom like she hits me, but she pushes her away and cusses at her). I do not understand why she reacts this and acts completely stubborn until someone gets tired of her shit. She then proceeds to come in our rooms the next day and proceeds to make a big deal when we don't want to deal with her. 


Most days I wake up she is sleeping in my bed with me. I've explained to her many times that because i'm older and a boy she shouldn't do this, but she persists. She even tries to bribe into getting me to let her sleep in my room. She is super defiant and stubborn which has caused her to have to repeat the seventh grade. I can't help but feel this behavior isn't normal and she is way too overreactive and spiteful. Is there anything medically wrong with her?


TL;DR: Sister never wants to leave family alone. As a result of asking her to leave our rooms, she makes her body completely limp and doesn't make an effort to respond. Her defiancy has caused several issues besides the ones detailed in post.",22Jul2018,4

206,"Me and my friend go back for several years. We became friends our first year in high school and got closer and closer before we graduated. We haven't seen each other face to face in a few years, but we've talked on-and-off on snapchat for years. Conversations ranged from ""how've you been"" to deep life stuff. So we haven't been super close, but she's always been happy to talk to me and we've had a lot of fun before.

Here's where things get a little tricky. Truth be told, I've been attracted to her for a while. Recently, we've talked a lot about sex and she once mentioned that she had wondered what it would be like if we had sex. Now, I've taken this at face value as an innocent ""what if"", but part of me wants to believe that she has a level of attraction towards me. This isn't the first incident. There have been slips like this in the past. 

Now, this is why I am here asking this question. The last few times I have tried to schedule a time for us to hang out (grab lunch, drinks, etc.) she has always been super on board, and then cancelled shortly after. This last time, when I asked to reschedule, I got no response. She's always had a valid excuse, but the lack of communication and effort on her end leads me to believe that she just doesn't have the desire to stay in contact with me. We talk less and less, and it's a rare occasions when she actually returns my messages on snap chat or text. 

Given our history, I'm hesitant to walk away. She's always lived a busy life, so I want to believe it's just that. But I'm not convinced that's all there is to it. I think we've just grown apart and she doesn't feel the need to try and make this work when it was barely anything to begin with. I called her out about it before, and she responded (3 days later) that she had just been really busy and we are ""really good"". 

I'm getting tired of trying to carry this relationship, and as much as I want to stay friends with her, I don't want to do it if she's not gonna make any effort. So what do I do? Do I giver her more time? Do I call her out again and tell her how I feel? Or do I just walk away? ",22Jul2018,5

211,"Right now, I'm renting a room in my friends' house (they're a married couple). We lived together before, when they were helping me out, but now I've moved back in to help them out.

Generally, we all get along pretty well. However, there are still these odds things that pop up.

One example is that, they take trips fairly often. I really love having alone time, and I assume others do as well. As such, on the rare occasion I've taken any sort of a trip, I try to give them exact details on when I'll be back at the house.

However, despite asking for ETA's in the past when I know they'll be gone for several days, they've always been vague. For some reason, it's almost like they're trying to ""catch me"" or something; they're clean freaks, so I always try to clean before they get home, but they'll get pissy if the house isn't spotless despite coming without a heads-up.

Yesterday, I very explicitly asked them via text to let me know when they'll be back. For some reason, they refused to answer, saying they were sure, but to ""go ahead and expect us late tonight"". Something about that just seemed very unusual, and of course they didn't get in lastnight.

Am I the one being weird? We're all adults, and I just feel like it's common courtesy to let people know when they can expect to have the house to themselves. It is their house, but I've also moved back in specifically to help them out (and truth be told, while its cheaper than living on my own, I've dreaded living with them for some reason). It feels like a lack of respect from them, that they seemingly go out of their way not to let me know.

Or maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing? For that matter, is letting me know when they plan to get home from a trip an unreasonable expectation? I mean, it is *their* house, even though I'm paying my share of the rent.",22Jul2018,3

214,"I graduate college in 4 days with a BA in criminology. I was rushed into a decision on my major and I chose something I thought I was passionate about, but the more classes I took on the subject the more I grew to hate it. Then last year, I was diagnosed with some pretty severe mental health issues that would make most government criminology jobs impossible for me to get anyways. I have no idea what to do. I feel very lost and upset about everything and it's really starting to sink in now that I've wasted 5 years of my life getting a useless degree.

I've always been passionate about creative things. I love drawing and photography and film. It's far too late for me to go back and get a degree in any of those things now though, and I can't exactly afford 2+ more years of school anyways since my scholarships ran out. I thought I could maybe get a job in a creative field without a degree, but even the simplest jobs I'm applying to have steep requirements. I wanted to maybe apply for the local art center but even that requires a BFA in art. The only thing I can think of is maybe freelance photography, but it would probably take me years to be able to afford all of the equipment, let alone build up a good enough portfolio to get customers. All I have now is a DSLR that's over 10 years old.

I also live in Atlanta, which is quickly becoming a huge hub for the film industry, but again, any job I think looks entry level requires something crazy like 5 years of relevant experience. I interview very poorly as well, so I'm not sure I could charm anybody enough to bypass those requirements.

218,"Hi! Throw away account and my first time really asking for advice here. I'm a trans girl and have been struggling with some of the things that come along with that for a long time, one of the big things being acceptance. My family isn't very accepting of trans people and because of this I never came out to them. Over the past year or two I've been creating content online, mostly on YouTube and I've managed to build up a decent sized viewer based and have been making money via patreon and ads. However, all of my viewers know me as a guy and it certainly factors into why I have an audience in the first place. 86% of my viewers are females and allot of my videos in the past have sort of catered to that demographic. What I'm saying is that I have a largely female audience and the reason for that is because I've made some videos that some girls enjoying seeing guys make (I know that sounds kind of weird but I don't wanna say what I do and have a chance of anyone some how finding my content through this post). So I've very worried if I come out as trans in a video and start being myself on my channel that my already established audience is going to stop watching, and how would I even do it? I want to work on having a more passable voice but I feel like if I go from sounding like a regular guy to trying to sound more feminine that everyone who is currently watching me will stop.

223,"I really can’t tell at this point. I’ll try to keep it short. I’ve known my friend for like five years and she’s always been extremely mentally ill (she refuses to accept that when it would help her to do so). Lately I’ve come to the conclusion that she is attention seeking at least a little bit. She’s very obsessive with anybody she decides is her best friend, so since I am right now her best friend, she comes to me every time anything is wrong or going badly. She is a self harmer and she will sometimes message me “I can’t” in the middle of the night. If I don’t reply, usually something bad happens. If I do, nothing does but I have to spend hours sorting her out, which I shouldn’t have to do and do not want to (I’ve done this with many friends and her and the amount of abuse I’ve gotten from my mentally fucked up friends over the years has led me to not being able to help anyone or wanting to anymore). Every time I bring something up to her that is problematic that she does, she uses it as ammunition to hate and hurt herself instead of being logical and just fixing it. If I tell her spam calling me to get my attention is unnecessary, she will have a meltdown and mentally or physically fuck herself over. Well the other night I told her I didn’t know for sure, but sometimes she seemed to me like she was attention seeking and I wanted to know if she could do some introspection and see if that was true so we could fix it. She said it was true. She hurt herself, and I had to call her so she didn’t do anything worse. I’m over it. I told her I’m taking a break for a while and not coming back until I feel like I can deal with this shit again because I’m mentally ill as well and stressed and don’t need this shit and I’m working on putting myself first when I need to instead of letting people fuck with my head. I had to leave. She was very upset about that and I had to force her to promise me she wouldn’t be dead when I got back. Took forever to get that promise out of her.

Now for the thing I need an opinion on. Is giving a friend constructive criticism on their personality or things that they’re doing, even if they are pretty hurtful (as having someone validate that you’re an attention seeker is quite hurtful) a negative thing? Should I have not done that? I’m not looking for that it’s not my job to fix her. I know. I’m not involved behind pointing out shit that very clearly needs fixed for her to get better. I can’t get any more involved than that if I want to be okay myself.

I felt terrible that I hurt her but I think she still deserved to hear it even if it made her flip the fuck out. In the moment I thought maybe i made a mistake because I remember learning bad things that I did and how horrible it felt to feel like a monster when I didn’t mean to be. I tore myself apart, she’s doing the same. Except instead of finding out through introspection like I did, she found out through a friend telling her. I don’t know. Was I wrong or is her reaction skewing what I think I should feel?

I feel less bad about it than I did when it happened. Now I’m just confused. Anyway, thanks.",22Jul2018,1

226,"**The Situation:** 
Some years back, my grandmother suffered two strokes. The first one she was able to recover from within reason, but the second one did a lot of damage. My grandmother still has control of her body, but she has been left with brain damage. Her behavior and capability to understand things has severely changed. She has essentially de-aged to the mental capacity of a two-year old. She has a lot of behavioral issues, including hitting and not using the toilet (she wears Depends but will frequently remove them). My parents currently live with my grandparents, and because of this proximity, my parents end up with most of the burden of caring for my grandmother. My grandfather also takes care of my grandmother, but he is well into his 90s, now. My mother has five other siblings, and they help when they can, but still my mother is the one who is currently closest to this issue since she lives with my grandmother. A huge problem with this is that this is a very stressful situation for my mother. She has had to deal with and do so much that she has, some days, sat down on the couch and just cried. So much of it has to do with her constantly being faced with seeing her own mother end up in this state. 

In an ideal, utopic world, my grandmother would be placed in a Home, where she could be cared for by professionals 24/7 and my mother and her siblings could have a lot of the burden lifted from them. But my whole family is very concerned that if my grandmother ends up in a Home, she will eventually be abused (maybe hit or neglected). In fact, we did have her in a rehabilitation center for the elderly after her second stroke. One day when my mom and aunt went to visit, they found my grandmother in a dress that had sleeves attached to the arms of a chair so that she would be restrained. Apparently my grandmother had been restrained to that chair for at least an hour, probably longer. To add to my family's fear, two great uncles I had both ended up in a Home, and they were neglected and mistreated. None of these things have given my family much confidence in trusting a Home, so they do not want to have my grandmother placed in one. They're very afraid of what would happen if they're not there. 

To add to this, the cost of keeping my grandmother in a Home year after year would be phenomenal. I don't know what my grandparents' insurance situation is like, but I somehow don't think it would be enough to cover it. Not enough to place my grandmother in a Home that's good enough quality. 

For a short while, we did have a nurse come to take care of my grandmother at home,  but my grandfather didn't like how the nurse took care of my grandmother, so he demanded that the nurse leave and he fired her. 

My family is very against sending my grandmother to a home. There's next to nothing I can do or say to convince them to do it. But I have, repeatedly, asked that they think about hiring a nurse again. Even if it's just once a week so that my mother can take a break, and perhaps the nurse can give some professional pointers on how to handle my grandmother when she lashes out. 

My family is concerned about hiring a nurse, though, because they are afraid that if the nurse sees my grandmother hitting, then the nurse will report it and the state will come and take my grandmother away (then, I suppose they would place my grandmother in a Home owned by the state, which is guaranteed to be low quality and will most likely end up placing my grandmother in a situation to be abused/neglected behind closed doors). I'm not sure how legitimate this fear is. Another concern is considering how my grandfather reacted to a nurse last time. He is actually pretty controlling, and he might decide to fire the next nurse we hire again if he's not satisfied with the nurse's care (he even nitpicks at how my mother and her siblings take care of my grandmother at times). 

**What I Need Advice On:** 
How do I find a nurse (in the U.S.) to hire for one day a week who can handle an elderly woman with dementia and behavioral issues (hitting, kicking, grabbing)? The nurse would need to also clean and bathe (again, toilet usage would be an issue... just, the whole gamut). What terms could I drop into Google search, for example, that could lead me to some websites that offer home-nurse services that could cover these issues? I want to try to research and find one so that I can bring this information to my family for their consideration. I believe if we split the cost for the nurse's one-day-a-week wage, we could manage it, and my family is at least open to this idea. But they worry about the above issues. ",22Jul2018,1

232,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost four years, and things have been incredibly rocky lately, so I'm not going to waste time talking about the good vitrues of our relationship.

This ended up long. I apologise.

Boyfriend=BF [35]

Travel Loving Best Friend=BFF [26]

Exposition: BFF loves to travel, she's been overseas several times and lives her best life. I support and appreciate her, and I'm incredibly happy that she has the means and ability to travel and experience what she can. I love vicariously through her; I have severe anxiety and agoraphobia, coupled with physical health issues and a child. I do not have the means to travel, nor do I have the drive. My anxiety is so bad that I don't drive a car.

 *Someday*, I **will** get on a plane to cross the ocean, but not today. Or tomorrow. Maybe I'll be ready after a few more years in therapy, but that's where my mind is at concerning travel. Right now, *maybe* I'm capable of doing to Washington DC to visit my other best friend.

Last August, a dear friend of mine passed away. My best friend's best friend. The three of us had been friends since early middle school. My BFF had already planned a trip to Germany and Amsterdam for a month in October, so she kept those plans. The trip was cathartic for her and really helped her heal, and I truly believe that it is a healthy way to cope - BFF has *both the means and ability to do these things*, traveling for six weeks was in no way detrimental to her life. She didn't neglect others responsibilities or bills or work or relationships.

Then, in December, my BFF lost her *little brother*. I can't even begin to imagine the pain she must be experiencing. I've tried my absolute best to be there for her, and I truly believe that she should cope the way *she wants to cope*, as long as she's not being unhealthy or self destructive, and it's my *duty* to be unconditionally supportive during this time.

She decided to go to Italy for a month to get away from everything, and because she loved Italy the first time around. Again, she had the means, the opportunity, the time. Her boss was absolutely understanding, so were her clients, so it didn't interfere with work. She rented an apartment for a month at a *fucking steal*, so she saved thousands in housing costs, she uses a travel rewards card so one leg of her flight was free, like, *she got this shit*. She spent a month drinking wine and eating pasta and getting away from the start reality of loss for a while.

*Before she left*, I lost my mom, and it really sucks. I self isolated and I've been playing an intense amount of video games and smoking a bunch of pot. Coping in *my way*. Since she came back, I've been surrounding myself with my support system and reaffirming my relationships with my friends. Then I lost another friend, my BFF in DC's cousin. This year has been very, very rough.

My boyfriend has an issue with how she's coping because, ""you think it's healthy and it's obviously not so I'm worried that you'll take off and ""run away"" like your BFF does"". He's been incredibly judgemental about *everything* she does, and he claims that he cares a lot about her. 

It's her brother's birthday this weekend, so she took the weekend off. She drank with me and a few other friends on Friday, we had a fire and stayed up late. I **think** she might have driven to the beach last night/this morning, because her brother loved the beach. My BF thinks that it's *wholly* unhealthy that she took the weekend off with the intention of getting drunk at least once, and she *obviously* being irresponsible for taking the weekend off - even though she works six days a week and only has a day off in the middle of the week.

 Every time he talks about it, he gets defensive, upset, judgemental, and I'm *fucking sick of it*.  I lost a good friend, someone I watched grow up, my mom, *and* another friend in one year and now I have this dude acting like I'm going to split to take a trip that I can't afford and that *I don't even want to take*.

I don't know if he's jealous of my BFF's experiences, has a crush on her and is acting out, or is just being mean, insecure, and insensitive - he told me that he didn't want to deal with my ""emotional shit"" a few weeks after my mother died. Or maybe he hates seeing an independent woman. He sees sickly, mentally ill me daily, and he's scared that I'll find independence once I'm better. He's even expressed displeasure that someone younger than him can afford such a lifestyle instead of being proud that someone younger than him can afford such a lifestyle.

*Am I* being ridiculous? I firmly believe that my BFF is being pretty damn healthy, especially considering the alternatives like sleeping for a week straight like I did or spending fifty hours trying to romance a hot blue alien in Mass Effect.

How to I explain to my boyfriend that he has no damn right to judge my BFF for how she mourns her brother's death?",22Jul2018,4
233,"Growing up, my mother always favored my little brother over me. He was clearly her favorite. Anyways, when he was younger he ended up moving with his dad while I stayed home with my mom.

234,"I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old named Heidi Falconer - if the name sounds too 'fake' do tell) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

237,"I've been stuck on all of this for a while and I'm really not sure where to go next, but before I state my current situation, I just wanna give some background info so you can see why I'm feeling this way.  
I was an only child til the age of 10. My parents were emotionally abusive which I think was due to miscarriages. I had started losing close family remembers around the age of 6 all the way up until I was 15, when I started to distance myself.  
I always had quite a lot of friends until the end of elementary school, transferring into middle school. I got involved with friend groups that would love me for a while and then suddenly turn their backs on me for the dumbest reasons. I finally thought I had a good friend, only to find out she was kind of a stalker. I moved schools several times and sort of gave up from the middle of 8th grade - the beginning of 10th (Around the time that I had started college early).  I spent all my time on the internet during those years, which got be absolutely no where. I was lied to, had my nudes leaked, dealt with death threats, and just so much more. (Before I start to get insults for the nudes, I just wanna clarify that I was on several different medications for depression, anxiety, bipolar, and ptsd throughout this time. None of them worked out and almost all had awful side effects. Thanks to these, I'm left with plenty of short term memory issues. I had never sent nudes prior to all this and I have talked with others who were on those pills and had similar experiences.)   
Throughout 10th grade, I had a solid group of 3 friends. They were the first people I came out as bisexual to. One of the girls in that friend group had decided to turn against me and start to make people think I made her suicidal. The girl had her own issues, I was aware of that from the beginning, but I swear I never did anything that could have upset her that much logically. She was the attention whore type as well, lying about being sexually abused and constantly starting pointless drama. My best friend that year was from Spain originally and moved back at the end to be with her girlfriend. I have one close friend now and most days I'm too depressed to even message him or make plans.  
Over the years, i struggled with self harm. I regret it entirely. Even now, months after it's over, I still have people asking what happened to my arms or if I'm okay and I can never wear a bathing suit without being self conscious.   
In December 2017, a month before my 16th birthday, I was given mood stabilizers for Bipolar. The effects were awful. I was more irritated than usual, I didn't feel right. One day I did my makeup all festive for Christmas and put on my Christmas sweater. I went to show my father because I was proud of how it came out. All he said was ""Shouldn't you be doing homework?"" and I was absolutely devastated. It set something off inside me and I had one of the worst mental breakdowns and outbursts I've ever experienced. The doctor said to immediately stop taking those pills, which I did. Ever since that day, I haven't felt the same.    
I've felt a little better, but everyone tells me I don't try to get better anymore like I should. I started playing piano again. I had a 4.0 GPA in my college classes. I applied for two jobs. I'm getting my license this week. I draw more now. I read. I try to help out when I can. I'm planning to graduate early. I'm trying to be healthier. None of this is good enough for my parents.  
Two days ago was my 3 month anniversary with my long distance boyfriend. Today we broke up because he's getting grounded for months and he was the only person I really talked to anymore.   
There's so much more to this story, but I don't have the time or space to write it out. I don't really know what to do now. I'm unhappy. Pills and therapy don't help. From what I've read, there's not really a whole lot to do about my disorders anyways? I can't make friends because it always ends bad. What the fuck am I meant to do?",22Jul2018,1

The fourth entry point is the front door. The environemnt is very calm, and the bulding is a couple of blocks from the city center (not a big city).

I was thinking of placing a camera on the balcony to deter and be warned live in case of someone attempts to break in, as well as a security system inside with alarm.

Do you think this could work? Is a security ccvt better to deter crime or worse (ie, by indicating there’s valuable stuff inside)?",22Jul2018,3
242,"So this might be more rambling than anything but here goes

About two years ago, I was in a really unhealthy and toxic relationship with a girl. It was really bad for us both, and I became incredibly depressed after we broke up. But as time went on I started feeling like myself again, and I’m happy to say that I’ve put it all behind me now. 

So obviously I wasn’t in a relationship for about a year and a half afterwards, but I got a lot more comfortable with myself and who I am on my own. But towards the beginning of this year, I met a girl who I knew from some classes we’d been in together. Long story short, we hit it off really well, and have been dating for several months now. 

We really enjoy spending time with each other even if it’s just having lazy days in, we hardly ever fight even over small things, she’s easily the most caring and thoughtful person I’ve ever met, our families really like each other, and we’re just generally very compatible emotionally and physically. 

I just can’t help but feel like she’s someone I’d be happy to spend the rest of my life with, but there’s also the other part of me that says I’m being naive. But I mean, you have to know sometime right? So I guess I’m wondering how one does know something like that. 

And just a disclaimer, I don’t plan on asking her to marry me tomorrow or anything. It’s just something I’ve been thinking over on my own. We’ve talked about it some and I know that we’d both want to wait at least two or three years before we’d want to get married. ",22Jul2018,1

247,"First of all, some context. I cannot just avoid this person, nor ignore him outright. He has offered a room in his house for me to stay since he goes to the same church I do, and being a recent college graduate with a new job and no friends, its the best and cheapest offer I have gotten. I have little to no choice as every other option is too expensive and I cannot afford it. 

Some context:

the person is mid 40s unmarried (no divorce, by choice; or according to them, a regret)

they are keen on giving advice but also has a tendency to shoot down any sort of optimism, claiming that the world will wrong you and there's nothing you can do about it.

They are obsessed with the idea that because the world wronged him, he projects himself on every single younger person, assuming that it will play out the same for them.

 This person in generally is just draining to be around and talk to, and he always defaults to the ""I'm older so I know more and you're wrong because you're still young ."" argument to extinguish any sort of input from my end. I feel like there's a limit to how much you can use that reasoning.

249,"I have come to the conclusion that my husband is narcissist. Nothing is ever his fault, if things don’t go his way he throws a fit, he uses my words against me, etc. He does struggle with mental illness. He was diagnosed with anxiety and depersonalization disorder. I have tried to help him but he won’t help himself. He also tells me I’m the reason for his problem, so I left him. To me it made sense because I figured I would just eliminate his problem and let him heal. I never intended for this to be permanent. 

I left him when he wasn’t at home. He never let me leave when he was there. He would block the door and take my keys. He would even take my phone when I would try to call for him. It got to the point where he would punch holes in the doors and threw things at the wall. I’m afraid that it will eventually be me instead of a door or a wall. 

I never intended this to be permanent. I wanted my marriage to work, but I wanted to give him time to heal and then we would work on us. But he won’t accept that. He said that if I don’t come back today he is going tomorrow morning to file for separation. He won’t go to marriage counseling. He agreed to do it but only if we went to someone that he knows. I wanted to go to someone neutral. It’s like it’s either his way or no way. He won’t compromise with me. 

Am I right for leaving? Should I have stayed by his side? I didn’t feel safe staying with him because I never knew what I would say that would make him angry and go into rage. Is he a narcissist? Sometimes I feel like I’m the one who’s toxic, but then I don’t really understand what I’m doing that’s so wrong. Yes, there’s some things that I need to work on.

I was terrified because I thought I was just dealing with a tall and fairly athletic girl (she’s also kinda thick) but I totally underestimated me. She quickly wrestled me to the ground and put me between her insanely strong thighs while taunting me. I struggled as hard as I could but I got destroyed. I literally cried out in pain but i could do nothing against her insane strength and power.

256,"Main guy has had depression for 2 years and enters university where he meets a new group of friends.

He meets this girl S who is kind and understanding. He soon begins falling for her and then tells her about his problems. She gets a bit overwhelmed and soon gets closer to the guy’s friend H to which the main guy is jealous.

All this while, the main guy and JY are at odds with each other despite being very similar people. This is because the main guy is a prick and is a sidekick to G who seems to have the hots for JY despite her disinterest.

Couple of months pass and soon the main guy starts talking to more people. He soon summons up the courage to talk to the pretty and friendly JW with her hardworking and cute friend D. While it was awkward at 1st, they eventually started being friends.

Summer soon shows up and the main guy went to work as a journalist. His friends mostly decided to intern as well.

At 1st he had been keeping in touch with S but eventually work stress causes her to berate him that he has been too overwhelming and annoying with the constant messages. S asked him does he do this to everyone, and the main guy says he does it to quite a number of people. As such, they fall out and they stop talking for a while.

He has been keeping up with JW for a while and this is where he starts falling for her due to their shared interests and her enthusiasm always seems to make him smile.

Year 2 starts with S and JY being more distant while D and JW seem to be closer. As a result, the latter 2 have effectively replaced the former 2.

The main guy is beginning to realize his feelings for JW and eventually writes her a poem and gets her a necklace. He sneaks it into her bag but it kinda gets unaddressed for a while.

All this while, the main guy earns a bit or ire from DX due to him rejecting her project idea and then being a bit too annoying in trying to patch things up and being a friend. 

Months pass and after a fancy dress event where the main guy had made great memories and had fun taking pictures with S, JW and JY. 

Soon enough, valentines had come and the main guy felt he needed to address the JW situation. So he decided to get a white rose to symbolise 'New Beginnings' either as a couple or as better friends. Well he was shot down by JW but the 2 remained quite amicable and good friends afterwards, even if she got a bf the very next week.

After some insightful talks, the main guy's best bro HL realized he had feelings for S. The main guy still felt super guilty about alienating S and supported his friend. The guys both then tried to build/rebuild their relationship/friendship with S.

S was kinda put off by HL's advances and felt a bit awkward with the main guy's reconciliation. S did eventually open up a bit more and she felt more comfortable and thanked the main guy for breaking the ice again.

Lately, D and the main guy had decided to work in the same place together. With D's workaholic and focused nature and the main guy's scatter brained and borderline ADHD tendencies, there's bound to have conflict. Well the main guy unsurprisingly had gone over to talk to D quite often to her annoyance. D tells this to S who actually got quite amused and understood that some things don't change but told him not to disturb D while she's working regardless.

257,"I’m a mid twenty aged male. Alright so first off this is an alt because it’s rather embarrassing. Ok the story, I broke up with my girlfriend of one year 4 months ago for a number of reasons, I thought we were civil about it but I got a message from a close friend about 5 days ago saying “hey man there’s something you need to know” apparently she has been going around telling people I gave her Chlamydia. She knows a lot of people from my job and lately I’ve been having a few people mention this to me along with a lot of my coworkers giving me glares and negative looks. The thing is I got a full std test a month after she and I broke up and I’m clean, I’ve never had an std in my life. 

I’ve gotten a lot of negative impact from this socially, I almost got uninvited from a friends wedding because she told the bride to be I had cheated on her and given her Chlamydia. Tonight she messaged me, 5 days after my friend said something and said there was something we needed to talk about, I told her that we didn’t need to talk because I had never cheated on her and I didn’t give her any stds and I’d appreciate it if she didn’t spread rumors about me, she become really hostile and starts telling me she’s just being honest to people and that she told everyone she may have got it from a different partner, she has been sexually active immediately after our breakup with at least 5 partners. Her logic is that it was me because Chlamydia can remain dormant for a while and she said the doctor said she had it bad so she must of had it for a while. 

I tried explaining to her that I had got a post breakup test and that it wasn’t me and she shouldn’t facilitate rumors that would negatively affect me, she called me a liar and said that I was being a dick for telling her she was being immature spreading this rumor without at least consulting me about the situation first. She doesn’t understand why I’d have a problem with this and when I told her she caught it from someone else and that she was making her problem my problem her cousin started threatening me on Facebook saying he was going to give me a beatdown, I’m not too worried about that so I told him to grow up and blocked him. 

I’m just worried about repercussions from this rumor and I’m about to make another appointment to get checked again even though I’m certain I don’t have anything. I’m scared that my new girlfriend is going to hear this and it’s going to impact our relationship. I’d like to just show the results of the new test when I get it done but I don’t think that will quell the rumors.

258,"**TL;DR:** I've known this girl for probably 6 years now and was always comfortable around her, just never really dominant or confrontational I guess. Basically there was a conflict between her, my girlfriend and myself, which started lightly, still meeting her on some occasions like usual and believing she is an alright person.

Then like 3 months afterwards and after my gf explained to me her side more exactly, I understood that she deserved an apology from us, but this took really long to be realized so I only later finally explained to my friend everything in detail. I decided to send a text, because it would have been very hard to hold a speech about every point and detail about it without having to repeat myself, and because I thought this way she could reflect on it better. The text was long as shit, but also diplomatic and understandable. It also wasn't a declaration of ending the friendship or anything yet, I just wanted an apology and explained why. She didn't take it seriously at all though, refused to do it and has already had more than one chance to understand and apologize, so obviously we quit it there. I realize that a text is probably not intimate enough and almost cowardly, but I had my reasons for it besides any kind of social anxiety. Since she's been rather disrespectful and scoffing when talking to me since the friendship ended, I know that meeting her in person would likely be very irritating and uncomfortable, because she wouldn't try to ignore me and instead taunt from a distance, but unfortunately she lives nearby to where I usually hang out and isn't unlikely to appear.

259,"People below us let their two year old stomp and sprint across their apartment for hours on end, especially early in the morning. Below us. But we hear them loudly and clearly and it shakes things. 

They constantly complain about our dogs, who are very quiet and well behaved. Their total sounds of the day might be half an hour out of their kid’s eight plus hours of sprinting. Since apparently they can’t locate the outside world apart from our landlord’s email. We have proof of doing things to calm any small amount of barking.

Recently we were called into the office like petulant grade schoolers, and threatened to be evicted if we didn’t stop “stomping back”. Yeah, I admit I stomped my way across the house to help them get the message. I’ve even spoken to them. 
Landlord said we would have “all of this” on our records at a “snap of a finger”. We have very clean histories for a reason. Our landlords have enjoyed us and many people here really seem to like us. She said the people below us were complaining of barking. I said that was impossible. We have evidence of stopping it, we have evidence the collars (no hurting involved) work despite the fact we don’t really need them. 
So she backtracked and said “oh, well... it’s the whining.”

Dog has been very softly whining for no longer than a minute at a time at scant hours of the day. We have evidence of what they do when we are not home. This has also been temporary, because he is injured and has stitches. 

She threatens this because she is friends with the woman below us. When we asked the landlord why she was doing this she said “two year olds will be two year olds”.

Okay. Dogs will be dogs. Take your gremlin outside maybe ten fucking minutes a day?

Yeah, we could move out. But we don’t have the money to. Our apartment is almost always spotless. Many people here see we are being singled out and targeted for no reason. 
Reports of our dog being “aggressive” also came in. From who, how many? No clue. 
What we do know is our dog is not aggressive, and many people actually went to the office to say “what the fuck” because the accusation was ridiculous.

I want to know what I can do. Anything. Petty revenge, going over my landlord’s head, id like to know my rights on this. There has to be something illegal about this.

This relationship I’m currently in is like something out of a dream, we both click so well and haven’t had a proper argument yet because we are both able to discuss an issue before it gets out of hand. I sincerely believe that she loves me as much as I love her.

Anyway so my current dilemma, first of all I want to say I’m pretty sure that I am overthinking things and making mountains out of mole hills, so I want to get another opinion.

So she (my gf) went to a social event that included mostly distant family and a few extras. She got super drunk, to the point where she was unable to read/write messages towards the end of the night. She had befriended a man we will call Z. Later in the night Z offers to take her out clubbing, to which she said she doesn’t have any money to that he offered to pay for the night. I told her if she went I would be worried because she didn’t know this guy 2 hours ago, as much as it could’ve just been a friendly gesture I told her to be careful. She didn’t end up going and went home later that night. 
The next morning her younger brother asked her if her and Z were dating (although the brother and I get on fairly well) and her father asked if i knew about it.
Now that last part is the bit that has triggered what I believe is me overthinking things. So I wanted to get an outside opinion. My thoughts go as far as to why would her brother say that and why would her father ask if I knew about it?",22Jul2018,2

270,"TL;DR: how would you choose a University course to study when you are equally interested and capable in both the Arts and the Sciences?

Long version:

I am trying, as best as one can, to gage a path for my future as I am applying for University in the autumn. My quandary comes from finding the right balance in life, and so, which course of study to pursue. I have an avid interest in the Arts and would love to study English Literature or Philosophy, but at the same time I have difficulties justifying the value of studying these subjects against Physics or Computer Science - which allegedly I have a similar degree of interest and competency in. Therefore I am now attempting to outsource my problem to the reddit community.

My problem does not lie in the popular ‘finding your passion’, ‘following your dreams’ or ‘ensuring my economic stability’, as I am fairly confident that I will eventually be able to sustain myself and contribute to whichever field I choose to pursue, and have no anxiety about pursuing any type of profession. Neither am I looking to eliminate, say the Arts, out of my life by choosing to study Sciences, but am merely looking to find the right balance of practice to lead a fulfilled life where I can equally feel I practically contribute, in whichever minimal way, to the development of the world - but simultaneously find pleasure in the day to day activities I am engaged in.

In more practical terms, I would love to be involved in political drama and writing within the Arts, as say a journalist, author, or screenwriter - but I have a hard time seeing culture as anything else but commentary upon things created or enacted by other individuals. On the other hand I am avidly interested in the development of Machine Learning, Neuroscience and Astrophysics, since these areas appear to be where human understanding of the universe is empirically pioneered today - but the idea of being confined to offices or labs performing endless hours of advanced mathematics does not feel appealing.

I have attempted several thought experiments, like creating a vision board of people throughout history I admire (which continuously feature Nicola Tesla, Elon Musk, Immanuel Kant and David Foster Wallace), or hypothetical near-death situations where my priorities in life would become abundantly clear - but none have succeeded so far. I have also done research like attempting to gage what society appears to deem important by, for example, following where funding flows, or browsing lists of ‘successful’ or ‘intelligent’ people (which continuously keeps referring to individuals with STEM degrees).

From what I have gathered so far subjects like Literature appear to offer practically more engaging jobs, like war journalism, but continuously sees budget cuts and has its relevance questioned (paying £28,000 to read dated Old English and T.S. Eliot) - whilst Physics or Computer Science lead to perhaps dull office jobs, but renders its graduates able to empirically develop the world, through say, contributing to the development of AGI.

I am aware that I am making rather generalised claims (which perhaps might even be faulty and contradictory) - but I hope I manage to get my dilemma across. My inquiry relates to all of you out there who hopefully have far more experience within these fields than myself, or have gone through similar problems, and so, might be kind enough to offer your personal perspectives on this issue.

All the best.",22Jul2018,2

276,"I’m a 27 y.o female. My sister is in her mid 30’s. I’m one of 5 children and my family tries hard to stay close-knit, but it’s hard when everyone moved multiple states away from each other. 

My oldest sister has been with her boyfriend for around 7 years and they recently decided to marry. 

My husband and I eloped and I don’t really believe in weddings, but that isn’t the reason I’m not going. My husband is in school (not working) and I’m a teacher. We definitely can’t both afford to go (she is getting married in Brooklyn and we live in Florida). 

So both going is out of the question, but I have pretty bad anxiety traveling to New York alone (idk the train system, cabs, and know nothing about the area).

I told my mom all of this and she gave me the whole, “She’s your sister, you need to go” speech. Then she told my brother who said he’d pay for it, and now my other sister is texting telling me to let my brother pay for it and to please go. 

I mean, it’s not like I’m actively not wanting to go, but we can’t afford it and my anxiety going alone would make it an unpleasant experience. Is there anything I can say to make them back off and/or understand? I feel like a wedding invitation is just that. I shouldn’t be pressured or guilted into going, that’s why it’s an invitation and not a requirement.",22Jul2018,1
277,"I recently (23F) purchased a house with my then-boyfriend (26M) and things were good. We moved into a house that needed a lot of work doing but was livable in condition. Anyway, fast forward three months and we'd been having arguments on a weekly basis about everything anything. He was super difficult to live with and I don't say that just because it was a new situation; he has a low stress office job and would come in from work only to want to sit down and play video games or watch TV whilst I'd come in having been on my feet all day and have a million things planned to do in my head, including cook and sort myself out for tomorrow. He'd demand that he was tired and wanted to have 'down time' but that never included me. Anyway one night, he came in and did the same thing and I had so much to do and he wasn't willing to help me in the slightest. He flipped and when I wanted to talk to him, he completely lost it because I turned off the tv and sat infront of it (he called this controlling behaviour, me wanting to have a conversation without distraction). He launched the remote at the wall with force, destroying it into pieces, and continued on a rampage of breaking and smashing everything in his wake. I shut myself in the bedroom but had to lean against the door as he kicked and cursed to try and get to me. I got the entire thing in a voice recording, including him screaming he wanted to kill me. I managed to contact a friend for help who alerted my mum and then my mum came over, by which time he had scarpered after tidying the mess up a little.  
It's now a little over a month and I am back at my family home where I was before moving out but the larger items I own are still in that house. My ex has still been in contact and I somehow managed to swing him round to returning the paperwork to the house that'd he'd taken. He is now living there alone whilst bills come out of a joint account we have. He has also previously agreed to paying his share of the mortgage whilst I pay mine but he is to pay the bills as I'm not there to use anything and warrant paying but has now gone back on his word. Today, he has worked out that I had the intention of getting the paperwork (which is still in the house) so I could clear my name but he thinks I have taken it. He is also now currently in a position of poor health where he can't get to the house to do anything but has instead taken to harassing me via text. He has accused me of all sorts and has told me I won't be getting a penny from the house. We can't sell it yet as we have a fixed term mortgage for 2 years (which he chose) and it would cost us too much to leave the existing contracts right now. I also do not want to get involved with him personally at all because of the dangers he imposes. What on earth do I do now? I want to be out of this situation in the easiest way possible but he's making it impossible and his parents are contacting me in the same sort of way without any help towards this?!",22Jul2018,1

After I told her that I just didn’t want to make it a big deal during that moment she began to get really angry and call me a “bitch” and a “pussy” that doesn’t know how to stand up for myself.

281,"1. No boyfriend/partner.  
Short but intense relationship, it was only two months but we saw each other daily and it felt like it was going to be something special, we did a lot of cool things together and had a lot planned. But we started having arguments, he'd refuse to listen to me and started accusing me of saying things I wasn't, he then started trying to convince me I was suffering memory loss - when confronted he broke-up with me, later getting nasty and cutting all contact.  

2. No friends or social life.  
I met him via a meetup group, I'd been a member of this group for longer but he integrated himself very quickly and has become a popular member of the group - I'm not close with them at all and a lot of the unofficial get togethers I was invited to were a result of my dating him, thus this now means it feels like they're more his friends. I've no friends, I started going to meetups to address that and this is the only suitable meetup locally, so with this break-up it looks like I have to lose this group and I'm back to no social life and no idea how to meet people. There's so little to do locally to meet new people, and while with him I had someone to hang out with or do things with.  

3. No kids/no future.  
I'm 35, a woman who wants kids, to have found someone who had felt so right and who had seemed so committed (albeit he turned out not to be) then lose them is a bit of a hit. So as well as dealing with the confusion/hurt/doubt of a great relationship going so badly wrong this way, and the daunting idea of having to once again enter the horrors of the dating world, I'm not stressing out about finding someone new and doing so in time to have children - thus I'm going in to an overly dramatic meltdown over my whole life, future, and worth.  

4. No job/no future.  
I was living abroad, when I came back here I found as well as no friends etc. I also had no cent work experience to b able to get a job, it took me time to work past my depression to start looking into voluntary work but I've gotten no further forward. I work volunteer roles but still can't get into paid work because of disabilities that make it hard to job search, gaps in employment, not knowing what the hell to do with myself, etc. This obviously means no life and no future: no money for a social life, not appealing to potential dates, no worth, no chance of kids.

In short my life is shit and I don't know how to change it, I'm depressed and my disabilities (autism and adhd) make it very difficult to be able to see steps to take to change my circumstances, this 'existential crisis' is long-term but being with my last boyfriend did pick-up my mood...that relationship failing and the ramifications have had a knock-on effect of reminding me just how terrible my life is right now.

282,"Hello everyone!

I'm an expat currently living abroad in East Asia teaching English. Before I did this, I had just finished school, so I have been adjusting to making new friends completely outside of school in a new area for the first time.

I've been struggling with this. At first, it was easy to make friends. However, many of the friendships I initially made were shallow and fleeting. One specific instance, when my closest friends here all ditched hanging out with me on my birthday to go clubbing with this girl they were all into, comes to mind, and I feel like that instance hurt me deeply and made me very skeptical about other people.

Being a black foreigner also has contributed to my anxiety here. People are friendly, but I do get stared at/pointed at/laughed at on occasion. Add to it that I understand the local language, and sometimes I just feel so conscious about how I come across here and feel disgusting.

My question is this: what advice do you guys have for breaking these mental barriers to both make friends and lead an exciting life? By exciting, I mean a life doing things you love to do despite how busy you may be (I'm at work the majority of the day, and I live in a relatively smaller city so there aren't many events going on).",22Jul2018,5

It's only been 2 dates and I'm still getting a feel of him but I'm thinking if this guy was really into me, he'd want to see me more on the days he's free.

284,"Hey, first time posting here. Sorry if this post turns out to be long.

# My background

I am 21 y old.

In High school I had depression problems due to my dad's sudden death when I started High school. Before that I was good at math, painting and I liked learning. In High-School I lost it all, insanely bad grades, my average was C/D.

And most problem is that I was a negative and very angry person. I was aware of it, but ""did not care"" due to my glorification of misanthropy. I know it was edgy, but I guess I was just unfortunate teen. Only good thing from that time is that I've picked up a guitar and learned how to play it.

When my High school was about to end, I have formed a honest perspective on my life and what I want, and stopped blaming anyone for anything, except me for my life.

After that, I decided to get my life back, and due to my country's system of applying for uni, I somehow got into university for studying physics, which was my only interest, and I thought I was good at math, so why not. 

# The Problem

I failed 1st year so hard, it was the eye opener to the real world and my place in it, I've seen people going through it with no problem, and I was stuck at what is considered easy subjects. Haven't even tried ""hard"" ones. 

My first long-term girlfriend left me after a year of relationship, she couldn't cope with my depressive personality. And that made me even more anxious.

I went first year again, but did not go to uni at all, I was not sure if it is right for me, and  went to try to find work. Seeing how work makes you passive I got motivation to study my math again.

I studied for my math for 5/6 months (I had to go over really basic algebra, and get up to Calculus 2 because I didn't do any math at my High school, especially nothing like Calculus). \*Hardest and most disciplined thing I've done in my life

I felt like I had it all, but because I didn't go to my uni that year, I could only pass if I ace the exam. Which I almost did, but I had 38/40 points. 40 meaning I pass. 

It was kind of a success, because I was self taught only and made it to 38/40. But still, no real results. And I still have a option to start fresh in October 2018. and go from beginning and this time go to all classes.

But I am so afraid of failing, and so sick of not seeing results or anything I do impact my life/income. I am so afraid, that I have starting to teach my self coding. As I thought, failing freelance won't cost me nothing. My mother paying for my university every year so that I fail costs money and my mental health. 

And now I am spending my time learning to code, it is much easier than math, but I feel like I am really wasting my time, although there is no real indicator for it. I have feeling everything that I do, or I have a control over is meant to fail.

I also have a band which I manage for about 2 years, and we still don't have like anything done to show. 

My confidence is ruined, I feel below everybody, and that is really new for me.

Why I am posting this is because I actually really love life, and I love various topics and reading about them, and reading in general. But I don't seem to have any impact on life. I see my self like a bug in other peoples eyes, I really don't want to become a passive person but I am failing at everything that can give me an active life in future and passing time is killing me.

285,So i have to make a big decision regardless of whether I'm comfortable with it or not. So half a year ago i got offered a temporary job (for about a year) in spain . Sounds good right ? I thought so too therefore i accepted it without a second glance. Mostly because i was so sure that i'd fuck up my finals majorly but oh wonder i didn't. So now here's my problem i want to study law at a good university and 4 of my really good friends -one of which is my best friend for like 10 years- want to study there too and 2 of them want to study law . Because it's easier we decided that we move together and i really want that you know? I don't know what to do because on one hand this job in spain could bring me so much more but i don't know if i feel mentally and physically ready at the moment to move to another country and live there on my own because i suddenly developed some quite tiring medical problems. If i moved in with my friends i'd have a really good support network right there and i would be studying at literally my dream university . I need some objective advice please .,22Jul2018,2
286,"So I woke up this morning and felt these strange sensations erupting from inside of me. I winced and rolled around in my bed, squeezing my midsection. Hunger pangs. Big time. That's the worst thing about being hungry all the time. Anyhow, I'm having a little bit of trouble deciding how to cure this rather unpleasant sensation.

I'm pretty sure I want a three course meal with all the fixins, but I'm not sure. Maybe just a single entree, a la carté? It's kinda late for breakfast, so maybe I'll go for a luncheon or a light brunch? I'm a bit choosy in how I eat, so perhaps a buffet style meal will suffice? If I go for the half-rack of ribs, maybe I can flip the selection of meal items around and do breakfast for dinner? No, no, heh - that'd be wild. Not on a Sunday night at least.

Speaking of dinner, what should I have for supper? I was thinking maybe some barbecue with two sides. If I don't include a dessert item, maybe I can set an alarm and get a midnight snack? 

You know what? I think I just talked myself into a little snack. I'm more of a meal guy, but I've always wondered what it's like for snackers. I don't know if there's any sort of portion control or calorie limit on what constitutes as a snack, so maybe I should just hold off until I can get a main dish with generous helpings? 

Buuuut, you know what? I don't need a stupid snack. Silly me! Why didn't I think of that sooner?! I could just have a treat instead! I've never really had one, but I guess it's implied that you disregard any portioning or serving size. I could just do that. Ooooh, it feels so dirty to sneak a treat in so close to a meal!

Now that I look at the time, yeah - it's way past brunch and is now closer to standard lunch. Darn. Well, maybe I'll prepare myself a treat some other time. Lunch portions are usually smaller than supper or dinner, I'm pretty sure of it. When I order a lunch meal, should I ask for a double portion just in case?

Anyhow, there goes those hunger pangs again. I could use some advice!

292,"My car was parked on the street in front of my house.

My neighbor while backing out of their driveway, ran into my parked car.


They have been my neighbors for less than a year and we have exchanged pleasant greetings of hand waves and hellos on a few occasions. It has never progressed beyond this because they do not speak English, and I do not speak Spanish.

They called a friend who showed up a few minutes later to translate for us. Since this is their fault as my car was legally parked, and they hit it, I ask for their insurance.

They don't have insurance. I'm thinking that I should call the police. I'm pretty sure that if I do call the police, this person is going to jail for lack of insurance and probably being in the country illegally, but I'm guessing. I share my concerns for their lack of insurance and tell them that I am feeling like I should call the police since they don't have insurance.They tell me that they will pay for the damages to be repaired. I am hopeful, but hesitant to accept this, but I do. I ask for us to sign an agreement of fault and promise to repair the damages. We write up something simple, and they, the interpreter, and I sign and date it. I make copies for all.
I also find out during this time that they do not have a driver's license when I ask if they have something with their name on it to prove they are who they say they are. They provide me with a simple state ID. This confirms my earlier suspicions.

Several days go by of finding a body shop that can do the work, getting a few estimates, and arranging to take it in. I get it back a week later. They pay for the repairs. I am glad for this of course, and happy that we didn't have to go to someplace where it would have only resulted in loss and pain for all involved.

It's been a week and I was thinking about writing a thank you note/letter/card to them expressing that I am grateful that they stepped up to resolve their obligation to me.

I am not sure how to word it so as to not insult them. I could keep it very simple and avoid all risk, but I would like to convey more than a simple thanks.

Any wordsmiths out there who can appreciate the unique situation and apply their insight to craft this missive would be most appreciated.",22Jul2018,1
293,"Myself and 6 of my other college friends are living in our college's city for the summer, and this is the first time we're doing so. We're within 3 miles of each other, and 4 of them live together in one house, and the other 2 live by themselves. We're all within the same friend group. The issue is they have barely ever wanted to actually meet up. In the past 3 months of our summer we've met up maybe 3 or 4 times, each with about 2 hours of actual time together. I've been asking almost every single weekend if people want to hang out, along with stuff we can do, but if I'm lucky I'll get a 'I work tonight' from 1/6 people.

And I mean, I'm not just saying 'Let's hang out', I'm saying stuff like 'Hey, our meeting had a LOT of leftover pizza, who is feeling a pizza movie night? I could bring it to your place' or 'Hey, let's go hiking like we did last year that everyone had fun with' and literally no response, or a quick 'I work tonight'. Hell, even a 'Hey, I have a bunch of alcohol if people want to drink with me' gets nothing, and these are to people that enjoy drinking. I'd assume my friends don't want to hang out, but in the 3-4 times we have, I actually got a personal text from someone inviting me, so I don't know if it is that they don't want to hang out or not.

I have been editing videos for my sports podcast for over a year now, but I have always wanted to pivot and begin directing, shooting, and editing music videos so I thought this was the perfect opportunity. During the initial shoot, the artist’s models that she brought for the video were amateurs as well and were not really taking it as seriously as the artist. I got some good footage of her but overall the footage was mediocre at best. The artist wrote the video and it is honestly quite complicated and confusing. Shortly after we shot the video I began editing but the artist then began pestering me (almost every day) about updates on the video saying that she was gaining notoriety and thought if she waited too long she would lose her small following. I finally finished the video about a week later and sent it to the artist. She then responded with a LONG list of changes she wanted made and asked me to do it all in one day or I will not be paid. I am reaching out to the reddit community because as a rookie I am not entirely sure how I should handle this situation and I am also not sure how a standard transaction between the videographer and music artist is supposed to go.

298,"(tldr at bottom)
this happened a couple nights ago and I cannot stop thinking about it I feel so dirty and gross I’m just in regret and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ll start off by saying I’m in a committed relationship with my girlfriend of 7 months and we are absolutely in love we’ve been on and off for a few years but this time has been serious and I wanna marry this girl and she feels the same if not slightly stronger about me it’s great. 

Anyway my best friend whose also a male and I got talking about our sexuality recently when he came out as bi to me (he knows I have a girlfriend he’s my best mate and I tell him all the type how much I love her) and we just talked about that and I explained that I was open to experiences with the same sex etc but nothings ever happened. He later asked that day if I wanted to try something but I declined as of my relationship that I’m absolutely committed too and I’m head over heels for this girl.

so this brings us to a couple nights ago. He, Myself and a few other buddies go to a small get together at one of our friends just to drink and hang out as the night goes on I drink a fair bit and am the worst of them all I notice that my friend the bi one has barely drank so I know he’d be tipsy at most the night comes to an end I’m stumbling falling into chairs etc not in good shape but myself and my best friend are staying at this guys house just in the top room which is disconnected from the house. We get into the pullout couch and he’s freezing and kinda cuddles up I make nothing of it as he is shivering but it does feel a little weird tho. We talk a lot about life and our friends and I was really drunk so I don’t know how it got to the situation but he puts his hands down my pants and starts playing with my dick he asks me if it’s ok and I nod. This was a mistake I don’t know why I nodded it felt good but I didn’t want that at all I know for a fact if I didn’t drink this wouldn’t have happened. I face away the whole time but we continue to talk normally while he’s playing with me.  He asks to touch my ass and I say no he also asks to kiss and I say no he also asked me to touch him I say no this is the furthest that’s happening. I should have said enough at this point I should have never nodded but at this point it was happening and I wasn’t even that aroused so I let him explore the experience just touching me. He then asked to smell my penis which was weird so I said no but he insisted I said no why but he took off the covers and sniffed it anyway. Then he put it in his mouth I should have pulled away but I was so drunk I just let it happen I really didn’t know what to do here. After this he finished me off and I instantly felt like absolute shit I felt dirty I felt guilt I felt shame I felt like I’d been taken advantage of especially the next morning when he said he planned to show me his dick. I told him this was to never happen again and to not say anything about it but when we woke up he tried to pull down my pants and tried to see my flaccid penis when changing even when I said no repeatedly he stood there it was actually really scary. That morning I left that house in his car and he dropped me at my girlfriends we had an amazing night out and I felt really happy I know all I want is her but I couldn’t bring myself to tell her but I think I need to. She cheated on me before we started dating (we had an agreement to be committed at this stage) but she was stupidly drunk and called a friend to help her and she was taken advantage of so maybe she can understand.

What do I do though do I cut off contact with this “friend” do I tell my girlfriend please I need help I feel confused dirty horrible guilty I feel like shit.

I always aced sex ed in school and I went to a ton of LGBT/planned parenthood workshops so I know what I’m doing. I’ve only ever had sex with two people, and this week I fucked the second person. His body count is the same as mine, and he’s 17 (We’re only one grade apart, I’m going to be 15 very soon).

We first fucked 3 days ago, and we were both smoking at the time. We used a condom and it was great, we hung out for quite a while and he took me home late at night. The next day, I was in his neighborhood so my friend drove me to his house at 10. I snuck into his “traphouse” (lmao his backyard shed). I came in and we fucked twice from 10pm-4am. We slept in there and had sex the next day, but from really rigorous sex our condom broke just as he was cumming. I didn’t feel anything, and he pulled out decently fast. I can’t afford plan b and I’m legitimately terrified. We both laughed it off. It’s the next day now, and I have checked my scarily accurate period tracker (flo) and apparently I was/am at a super low chance of pregnancy at the moment.

308,"So around 5 years ago I met this girl through a friend.. we only hung out a few times that year, only when my friend and her would hang out.

They begun to grow apart later that year. so I didn’t see her again.

We never really grew that close, but both seemed to admire each other.

I tried to keep in touch here and there in the years to come, but nothing really came of it.. probably because things were still slowly do ssolving with my friend and her.

Anyways, this past May I emailed her out of the blue, kinda prepared for more of the same where
the conversation doesn’t go anywhere, but this time things are different..

She’s actually replying and we’re having actual conversations. Usually she would stop replying after a couple emails..

I’m no longer involved in that friends life at all, and she knows that, so maybe it’s just the right time.

She’s carefully replied to everything I sent; about one month ago I was
going through a very tough time with negative friendship things..

In desperation, I emailed her and said to her that I want to “spend time with you in person; either by you or out here doesn’t matter”

Meaning, she lives a few states away and that I’d be willing to fly out to see her. Before they email, I sent this long email explaining how I just want someone to love and grow with, as well as just talking about summer, life goals etc. I got pretty deep with the conversation.

She came back with this response, that I have posted below the dotted lines; we are both in our late 20’s fyi.

——————-

Hey sorry I'm really bad at responding to emails because I never go on there on my computer just my phone and it's a different app and all.

I'm glad you're doing better. Just keep your head up and youll find someone to grow with and enjoy life. Just takes time, I mean I haven't found anybody yet either. I'm not looking I'm just living my life.

Well I'm waiting on this job with the (*edited for privacy) that I think I got but it's a ——- job so it's taking forever to process all of the security clearance and shit. Really frustrating so I think I'm going to get a temp job.

The vacation was an absolute dreammmm. Went camping in the mountains too (my profile picture) which was also amazing. I was sad to leave, fell in love with that country.

Yeah I mean, I'm in (*state she lives in) and I'm broke af but if we are ever in the same city of course we can hang out.

———————

I should also point out that after I emailed her about visiting, I quickly emailed her back saying “ignore that previous message, was out of character and I shouldn’t have sent it.”

So with all this said, what do you think of her stance towards me? (She’s very guarded with men, so keep that in mind)",22Jul2018,3
309,"I'm sitting here today at 25 working for a seasonal company making the most I've ever made in my life. But obviously working 6 months out of the year and having another 6 months with the best unemployment in the country. Still would like an ideal year-round job


I just rather stay home my parents house and do nothing. But I do plan on moving out with the smallest budget possible of $820 all utilities included. And in Massachusetts that's nothing cuz of the cost-of-living specially around the Boston area where I want to move.


How do I help myself when I don't want to help myself. I've gone on a few dates recently these women say I'm attractive. These women say I'm funny. But I don't see anything. I talk old at 25 I talk like I'm 50. Because of all the isolation. Pretty much the last 4 years and sporadic sex with girls


I just feel stuck and I just feel like I can't find a job more than 35000 a year. And that's the reason I feel so depressed but it's also the reason why I'm doing nothing. even with seeing a counselor my mood hasn't changed and even with getting a couple meds my mood hasn't changed. Every moment I just want to cry especially when I'm alone and it makes me feel like a broken toy in public and I always come off angry when I'm just depressed and upset with myself



I don't know how to fix this and I doubt anyone can give me the answer I'm looking for. I don't want to be like this I want to be better but I feel like I'm going to waste my youth because I'm just wallowing in despair.

I told her how I feel about her drinking and how it's going to effect her health in the long term but she says she is fine.

I don't want to get to age 50 and have to take care of her because she has to have a liver transplant from it. Or has a weak heart from it. I want my wife to be healthy and happy.

315,"First time poster here, and I'm just extremely lost. A bit of background, I'm heading into my senior year of high school and I know that the first few months of senior year will be filling out FAFSA and college applications, but the thing is I'm so scared.

I don't know what I want to be, I always wanted to be a veterinarian ever since I was little, I love animals and I love helping them. But now that I'm in high school my love for history blossomed and it made me have second thoughts; I'm not sure if I want to be a veterinarian or a high school history teacher.

I'm scared about the future. In my family, I've always been the one who gained a lot of academic success. It wasn't until i made it to high school that I realized that I will have those moments where I will fail and need to accept it. 

I don't know how to drive and I've never had a job because my family always told me to focus on my studies more.

I'm just afraid I won't survive college, that I won't be able to do well in it. I'm scared of the future, I'm scared about my future career, I'm scared of being a failure to my family. Honestly I'm ultimately afraid of making my dad disappointed, he would always tell me stories of his youth about how he never had the same academic opportunities as I have now. He's essentially one of my main reason why I want to do so good in school and I'm afraid I'll just disappoint him.

What do I do? I really need help, summer is ending quickly for me but I'm still so clueless. ",22Jul2018,2
316,"In years past, I never really hung out with anyone. I mostly studied and stayed at home. This past year I started hanging out with some seniors (I’m a junior) and we became great friends. I lost 100 pounds as well, and now am in the best shape of my life. It was a good year.

But now that they’re graduating, I’m worried about what will happen. I am taking very *very* difficult classes and I feel like I wouldn’t have much time to be with people anyways, but I doubt I will stick to that once the year starts, and I’ll probably end up feeling lonely. Which also worries me because going over to their house and hanging out instead of staying home watching tv (and usually eating) made probably the biggest impact on my health and helped me lose weight. So you can see why I’m scared about what’s gonna happen when they’re gone, since I don’t ever want to get overweight again. The thought of that happening makes me terrified.

I know I’ll see them again and spend time with them, and I’m not trying to replace them. I’m just looking for some way to tide me over so to speak.

Then there’s relationships and/or prom. I am somewhat determined to find someone to go with, and now it would be much easier after losing so much weight. But the way my school (and most others I’m sure) seems to work is that you really need to be social and hang out with people in order to be ‘normal’ enough to be in a relationship. And being with friends obviously helps to meet more people (but my school is pretty small so I know most of the girls anyways).

I’m the kind of person that everyone kinda knows. People talk to me in class and are always nice and think I’m funny, but I rarely am invited to spend time places. At lunch I usually eat and talk with our football players since I played in middle school, and I probably know them the best since we used to hang out sometimes and have similar senses of humor. I’m sure if I asked them they’d say yes, but I just feel very awkward kinda inviting myself to spend time with them.

What do you guys think I should focus on to fix these problems? And I’m sure I’m overthinking this but I just don’t know what most people normally do. Any advice helps

So we walked our dog around the premises and our dog found some rat poison out in the open that was next to a container that said ""Poison: Do not touch.""

Well, my dog thought it looked tasty, so he took a bite. We were very worried about him getting sick from it, so we went to a emergency vet hospital in our hometown, and they did a Activated Charcoal treatment, and he's on Vitamin K for the next month.

I feel I should be compensated for this hotel's behavior of putting rat poison out in the open right next to a poison box. The hotel puts it out themselves because they were able to tell us the exact brand and kind of poison that they use.

319,"I've no friends and limited options to make friends, so I joined Meetup - locally there's only a small number of meetups, but one is perfect for me in terms of age-range and interests. So I went to meetups but I didn't get on too well because I'm really socially awkward, I'd just kind of stand around near these people and talked to a few of them, but although I didn't really make friends it still means someone to go to gigs and clubs to.  


A new member started coming to this meetup, he integrated very quickly into the group - the group has a group chat on Facebook and the core members go on unofficial nights out etc. all the time - this new member became part of this core group of people: he went to unofficial nights out, stated his own movie night at his place, was invited to house parties of other members, went to a music festival with a few members, etc.   


I stated dating this new member - it was like a dream at first, but we started having augments where he'd get emotionally abusive, when I confronted him about his behavior he ended our relationship.   


While I was with this new member he invited my to this meetup group chat on Facebook, on a few occasions I'd be invited to unofficial get togethers with them because I was dating him. Now we've broken up this group feels more like his group, even if I don't invite myself to the unofficial get togethers and avoid him on official meetups it still feels awkward. I don't think I'm close enough to those I've talked to in order to still have an 'in' with the group.   


I've blocked this ex on Facebook but I can still see him talking on group chat, honestly it kind of upsets me seeing that and knowing I've basically lot this group to him now - should I just leave the Facebook group chat and accept this loss?   


It may not seem like a big deal but going to the meetup's has been my only way to socialize, also I'm a bit worried about people potentially talking about me when I leave the group (as ex turned out not to be who I thought he was, maybe once I leave it'll start up that conversation and he'll lie to them about me).",22Jul2018,1

I'm at the point of my life where I stopped listening to music I enjoyed , or playing videos games I loved because I feel these entertainments belonged to a different person who died. I feel the time I spent playing these games or listening these music I was such a loving person. These memories should stay with that person who died once he left his homeland (In my opinion) instead of this new one. I'm serious and not joking. I'm completely disconnected from reality. I miss the 90's so much, I miss all my friends, I miss my homeland and the house I grew up in so much. I miss being young and careless. The best phrase to describe myself is an empty figure who puts up a facade.

I went to a counselor and explained my situation to her. She told me I'm suffering from extreme depression, and I need to help myself go back on track. She suggested medications but I refused to take them duo to side effects. She said I'm way too deep inside my head, and I need to rebirth myself. She told me my old self was a beautiful happy person who died, but can be birthed again. She told me to start living a new life and don't cling to the past.

The thing is, I get hope, nostalgia and happiness when I remember my old life. If I try to forget my old life for sure, I become more miserable.

322,"Okay so I turn 21 in 2 weeks. My girlfriend hooked me up with a job that pays even better then my old one, so of course I took it! The thing is, this job is in Downtown LA, WAY closer to her house. My parents live in a suburb (where I grew up) almost 50 miles away. It makes way more sense to move in with her and only have a 10 mile commute to work. Her parents love me and have an extra room, and would only ask for a few hundred every month (a price for a room that cheap in LA is a bargain). 

So I broke the news to my parents. They are not happy. They are trying to make me feel guilty. My dad is telling me he is hurt that I would give a few hundred for rent to someone else, when I have just been living there for free all these years (not true btw, I always help out with things financially and I pay ALL my own bills/insurance). My mom is very religious so she thinks its wrong to move in with a SO before marriage. She is just crying and keeps blaming this on my gf as if its her idea and she is trying to take me away.

I made a list of all my financial obligations and I will be able to get by comfortably. My side of the move is looking great. Its my parents that are having a hard time with it. Again, I’m just about 21 now and its time for me to become independent, but they will never see it that way. I love them very much, but I need my freedom.

For context or whatever, about a year ago I tried to move out, with this same girlfriend. And they were pissed and told me to wait a few months and see if this is really a good decision...well its been well over a few months, its still the decision I wanna make, and they still act the same.

324,"Hey,

I really want to know what do you think I can do with this situation, I'm quite lost.

I'm a producer, I do music. I love to compose music and to create sounds with the synthesizers. But I hate to arrange songs, and to do mixing. I can do few projects a day, I'm really creative, but when it comes to make an actual full music with transitions, clean the frequencies blablablah... it is just boring. I just love to explore music, to make good sounding things, meet the unexpected.

I would love to make a career based on improvisation, but well, I don't know anyone, except in jazz or classical, who did it. I've got some ideas of doing shows where people will just listen to improvised electronic music like Henrik Schwarz with Bugge Wesseltoft. 

But, is it sufficient to make a living from it? I don't need much money, I live a modest life and happy with it. But yeah... Really scared nobody will listen to my shit/pay for it. 

What should I do? Is it a good idea? Do you know improvisators who win enough money to have a shelter and eat? Maybe being a street artist. I love to be on stage btw, I love being with people.

329," I don't now what to do. It's been going on for 4 years now. Kids in my neighborhood call me names every time I walk by. I'm afraid to do anything. I don't respond in any way, you'd think they stop, but they don't. I started cutting myself again, I started smoking again. I don't know what to do. It's summer time, so I hear their voices every day outside. I can't even work on anything, I have a personal project of mine I haven't worked on for weeks because of that, because I'm constantly afraid and uneasy. I'm 25, but I look young and everyone sees me as a kid who is not capable of anything in this world. People my age have kids, and I have this dreadful feeling of never being independent or free. I can't even grow a freaking beard or something to appear more grown up. I'm afraid of confronting those kids. There are several reasons for that. Firstly, they tell insults (same insults they told since I was 9) when I don't see them, or am too far away, I'm too much of a wimp to yell at someone in front of the whole neighborhood, in front of people, people that I know, in front of other adults. Secondly, I'm afraid of being seen for that pathetic adult which I am, if I don't respond I can pretend to others that it's not directed at me. But if I start to respond I confirm that I am that worthless excuse for an adult. I don't drive a car or never had a girlfriend. Hell, I've never even kissed a girl. 25 and never been kissed, strangers treat me like shit, even kids think I'm shit. I feel like everyone thinks I'm a laughing stock. I have a job, and people still treat me like this, people on the street look at me like I'm an alien. Why do I even bother. I feel like I'm still a kid who'll never get to grow up, whatever I do. Girls have been interested in me, but I've always been to much of a pussy to do something. I feel like a hobbit or something, someone you'll have a really hard time picturing having sex or even kissing a girl-hobbit. It's easy to pretend that it's nothing or that it doesn't bother me, but it does. And I can't share it because nobody listens. I've been bullied throughout my entire childhood, they used to tell me it'll stop when I grow up, but I'd doesn't, it just goes on and on and on into the eternity. I die every day little by little, I don't feel like myself anymore and live in constant fear of being picked on. I feel like nothing, worse than nothing.

335,"Rent for next month is $1,680. It is due on the first. I have around $300 and the insane price is because I go to school around San Francisco, and a percentage of that is my security deposit.

$720 is the remainder of my sec deposit and $960 is my actual rent. 

Are there any options out there for a very desperate student (no/bad credit) who has yet to find a job? I have already reached out to financial aid and they said they would get back to me. What are some other options??? Last resorts....

337,It’s summer right now and I’m having a really hard time dealing with my parents. They constantly force me to go to our cabin almost every day and I have to take a bus to get from there to the main town of my country (helsinki). It’s really affecting me and my friends and girlfriend. I’m 16 and they won’t even let me stay at my house in helsinki because I have to be at the cabin. I have mentioned it to them but they refuse to listen and insist that they only feel like they are on vacation if they are at the cabin and I’m there with them. It’s driving me crazy to the point where I’m going to start walking 45+ min to the bus station to get to the town so I can see my friends and girlfriend. Does anyone have any idea how I can get it in their heads that I hate being at our cabin because I don’t have a social life there. ,22Jul2018,1
338,"So I'm a 16 year old boy and have known this girl from a summer camp I've gone to since I was 12. Every year we've gotten friendlier to each other. Last year we would spend a lot of time with each other joking around and laughing. I thought there was something nice going on between us so on the last day I told her I liked her, to which she responded we live too far away, mind you it's a 30 min drive. I took it well but was very embarrassed. We kept in touch all through the year, sending pictures on snapchat and texting eachother. This week was my 5th time with her at this camp and on the first day, she was happy I was there, helping me set up my tent so we could do other things. After my tent was completed we went to her camper that she had been able to use through her grandparents. We talked for a long time in the camper, and during this talk she mentioned that her boyfriend that she met from work would be coming to visit the camp and chill with us. We left the camper but ended up going back in it at night. We ended up going to the camper together during every lunchtime and evening for the whole week. Not to mention that much of the time spent out of the camper was still time spent together. We never became romantic with each other, dispite what the other campers and camp leaders assumed, and sometimes inquired about. Maybe it was the fact that she would always braid my hair during lunch that made them wonder. Our time in the camper was sometimes spent talking about fairly personal topics and family issues. There was also lots of joking and music reciting. On some of the days there was her boyfriend there with us, but we got along well dispite the internal frustration I had with him. On other days when we were alone, we went on long walks through the country roads surrounding the camp. One night when we were in the camper, she explained to me a very personal situation she is going through that is greatly impacting her life.  She told me that the only people who know about this are her boyfriend and now, me. Now that camp is over, I really miss having such a positive girl full of compliments and humor in my life. She is such a wonderful person that I want to be in my life for a long time. I am fine with only being friends, but I still fancy her, and I'm curious as to how I should persue once her and her boyfriend break up. I really don't want to ruin our friendship but I would love to fill the void in her heart that her boyfriend would leave. My question to you is: how should I persue in this relationship in order to hopefully create a romantic one in the future? Thank you.",22Jul2018,3
339,I am a mom for 3 wonderful boys. I am wanting to divorce my husband because he cheated since i was pregnant with my first child and through out my other 2 pregnancy.

340,"Long story short, I had to leave my housing situation and my landlord agreed to move my lease end date/the new tenant’s lease start date to August 1st. I found the new tenant myself and she agreed to pay prorated rent in July once she had access to the unit. She didn’t tell me she’d gotten keys from the landlord last Wednesday and therefore had access to the apartment—I found out when the landlord called me about something else.

Is it fair for me to ask her to start paying prorated rent from the day she was given keys? I’ve been out of the unit since June 30th and she had told me she would move in as soon as possible, so I let her work that date out with the landlord since he needed to do a walkthrough to assess damages and that process had nothing to do with me. I think it’s fair because the unit is hers now and she could have moved in at any time—what do you guys think?

TL;DR: should I ask for prorated rent from a subletter beginning the day they actually move in, or the day they were given keys and full control of the unit? ",22Jul2018,1

344,"(Long Post)

So I don't normally get on craigslist often, and especially do not browse around in the casual encounter section either but being a single male who can be categorized as being funny and gullible who's not the best at dating, I thought I would see if anything interested caught my eye.

One post I came across was titled 'WF (white female) to service WM (white male)' with the description stating ""college WF looking to service WM and be a good girl"" (link to original craigslist add at bottom of post).

My first instinct was that this was a woman who probably enjoyed being with random guys with no strings attached. I responded to the email saying I was interested and I received an email back saying ""send face pic and cmon over anytime you need your cock sucked And a tight wet cunt to CREAMPIE! I will take care of your needs. just swing by and put your man meat thru my red sheet and let me take care of you. I'm in downtown Atlanta near Georgia State University, where i am a student. NO TOUCHING OR TALKING, JUST GET SUCKED &amp; a TIGHT CUNT TO CREAMPIE AND GO, THAT SIMPLE....NSA.""

The first thing I want to point out is the caps lock phrase about no touching and no talking. Pics were attached and what was sent were pics of quite an attractive female, maybe around mid 20's, brown hair, she looked very nice. Pictures of the red sheet were included. Basically this person wanted me to fuck her through the red sheet, cum in her, and then suck me dry all without seeing who she was at all. Again, no talking or touching was what was said by her.

Me being honestly surprised that something like this was happening to me I emailed back saying that this was an offer I could not possibly refuse and sent some pics of myself. The next email is when things start to get weird. This one said ""Call my friend Nick for address and info (XXX-XXX-XXXX) When u get here my door will be unlocked for you, u just walk in, unzip, put cock thru the red sheet and i will give u an amazing blowjob and when your rock hard i will turn around bend over and press my tight wet cunt on your cock thru the sheet and slide you inside of me so u can fill me up with your sperm, and this is total NSA, no talking or touching unless you need to grab my hips for leverage while your pounding me. that simple.""

My reaction to this email was that it was simple, a risk, and an adrenaline rush which might be something that could spice up my boring life. So I called Nick and he was very straightforward and blunt about the whole endeavor, explained that this was a fetish for the female, and stressed that anytime I wanted to come over and have her I was welcome with open arms. I originally thought that ""Nick"" was a middle man for this procedure in order to keep anonymity among both parties even though the pictures which were sent to me showed her face and full body. I was given the address, got in my car and made made way to down town ATL not knowing what to expect.

I reach the complex and call ""Nick"" again for the gate code and how to get to the specific apartment. ""Nick"" told me that the door would be unlocked and the red sheet would be right on my left, to take my pants off and let her do the rest of the work. As I was opening the door a part of me wanted to leave right then and there as for all I knew I could be murdered. But alas, I entered found the red sheet, took my pants off and stuck my dick in hoping for the best.

So things get started, ""she's"" sucking me off and she tried letting me fuck her, I was really having to stand on my toes in order to get the proper leverage. I was worried about not talking or touching as I was told not to do. So things are leading into one another, back and forth from oral to traditional and back again. During this she starts to kiss me through the sheet and talking about how I was making her feel and asking if I liked that and what not. At first I was into it then the more she kept talking and asking me how she made me feel the more uncertain I became about who this person was on the other side of the red sheet.

What tipped everything off was that she told me to put my lips through the hole. I did, and lips met mine and I immediately felt some facial hair underneath the bottom lip. I instinctually asked if she was a man and she said ""of course not keep fucking me."" I didn't think anything of it but I was starting to get out of the mood because of how unsure and confused I was beginning to get by this whole ordeal. She started to notice this as I wasn't fully committing to the sex and asked me if I wanted to fuck her face down on her bed. I said ""Im not sure, you don't seem like the person who I was originally going to meet up with"" Her reply was ""don't be silly I just want to make you come inside of me baby""

She then told me to close my eyes and move to the left, I did but did not keep my eyes closed. Granted it was very dark in the condo but out came a person who did not have the same skin tone as the girl who I thought I was fucking and definitely had a dick. They were just wearing a wig and ran to the bed. I had no idea what to do so I said that I was probably going to leave and that I was being lied to. The person made no attempt to convince that she was female, just saying that she promised that she was. I was beyond uncomfortable so I left. This person was making me do things which I did not sign up for and I was tricked.

I called ""Nick"" as soon as I got back to my car and I told him to be upfront with me about it and demanded who I was actually with. Nick swore to me that she was female and that I was freaking out. Nick said that she wanted me to come back inside and finish me. I asked if Nick was the person I was with in that apartment and he said that he was in a different location. He kept telling me that I should go back and get what I came for, that she would behave properly staying behind the sheet and that I would enjoy myself.

Me being so confused and scammed I told ""Nick"" that I was no longer interested, that what he was doing was not cool, and that he scammed me into thinking I was with someone else, and after asking for the truth he continued with the scam trying to lure me back in. So I left, now knowing that if I make an attempt to meet up with someone from craigslist again, to have a face to face interaction before anything goes down as I was tricked. I still have the phone number and address and I don't know if I should take this matter into my own hands and hold this person accountable or what. I suppose that's why I'm posting this, to get a second opinion to see if I should attempt to do anything about what this person did to me. If anyone has any thoughts, questions, or ideas please leave a reply. 

TL;DR- I reached out to a craigslist ad of a woman offering sex through a hole in a sheet, pictures were sent of her face, body, and the whole set up. I was convinced and went through with it. Started having sex with the person and slowly realized I was fucking the man who was apparently ""middle manning"" the whole ordeal. I still have the location of the place and wonder if I should expose the person for lying and taking advantage of someone like me to prevent this from happening to another poor person.

348,"[19F] I made a mistake when going on a summer trip, and the feeling of guilt &amp; frustration in myself is driving me to what feels like borderline depression. 

It all started when I met this friend (I’ll refer to him as M) of one of my longtime friends. M &amp; I have a lot of common interests, and I genuinely thought he was a nice guy from the multiple conversations we’ve had in the past from online. I could only talk to my friend and M on social media, as I moved away from the area. We all originally planned to hang out when I visited the area, however, my longtime friend had to take a last minute trip out of the country which left just M &amp; myself to hangout alone. I hung out with him twice on my 5 day trip. The issue is that I was physically attracted to him, and was drawn into him with our many common interests - and I’m in a relationship of 4 years. I went into hanging out with him with good intentions as we had talked about grabbing some food and exploring the rest of the area. He never took me to do any of those things. I feel like I was mislead and used.

Long story short there was a misunderstanding, I wasn’t super clear on my relationship status, we got caught in the moment, and my dumb ass cheated. M &amp; I made out and played with each other for a few minutes and then I asked to be driven back to my hotel after I started to realize what I was doing. I’m not the type of person to do this at all. I’ve only had one relationship, which is the one I’m in right now. I’ve never hooked up with anyone before and I don’t usually open myself up to someone like that which makes this even harder for me to get past. M &amp; I haven’t spoke ever since and he deleted me from social media once I arrived back home. Right before he deleted me, I saw that he was already taking a different girl out, and this really hurt me due to many reasons. 

I confessed to my boyfriend about what happened on the last day I hung out with M. I told him we kissed and he didn’t want to know what else happened- however, he did forgive me. His trust obviously went down, and he’s insecure about me hanging out with single guy friends which is totally understandable. 

Ever since that has happened, I have felt like absolute shit and feel like such an idiot/an asshole. I’ve lost the motivation to do mostly anything, can’t eat as much due to the lack of appetite, make up excuses to just stay home, can’t sleep because I keep thinking of what happened, and don’t find enjoyment in doing the things I used to enjoy anymore. My boyfriend has been trying to tell me that it was an honest mistake and to try to forget about it, but it’s extremely difficult for me. I can’t even enjoy spending some time with my boyfriend because I just feel too guilty about it.

I apologize for the lengthy description, I’ve tried to shorten it as much as I can including important details. Please give me advice on ways to overcome this.

349,"My brother has an illegitimate daughter who I found out about a few years ago. She was conceived when he was a teenager and in a relationship with the woman who would become his wife.

Is wife doesn't want my brother to have anything to do with her and would kick him out if he contacted her and  Their 3 children know nothing about her.

She added me my sister and brother on Facebook again. 

What am I meant to do ? I would love to talk to her but if we broke the silence then it would likely cause the end of my brothers marriage. His marriage is precarious at the moment especially seen as it appears he has a drugs problem and has milked my parents for 30 grand over the years to pay off his drugs debts under threat of killing himself if his wife found out and kicked him out. He also recently lost his job because he's an intimidating asshole at work. 

So I'm reluctant to rock that boat. I honestly think she's better off without him but feel like an asshole who is ignoring a teenage girl. 

I'm gay and have no children, maybe oil should leave her my house when I'm gone to say sorry. 

So is it right for me to ignore her ? If I don't and speak to her it'll likely cause a cascade of events.

353,"Unfortunately I'm part of a big wave of emigration from a fucked up country. 10% of our population already left, and I want to be the next one but everytime I hear something related to emigration I get discouraged: two girls got burned with acid on the face, everytime the emigraiton laws get more restrictive and the legal paperwork more expensive... It even became common to look for people from especifically my country to pay us less because many of us are desesperated to find a job as soon as possible, you can find advertisements from companies asking only for people with my nationality.

357,"So I [19M] have a crush on this friend of mine [19F]. We met about 3 months ago in college. I found her attractive from the start and became interested in her after we first hung out. However, I shortly found out she was taken. And of course I believed she would be better off dating me than the dude she is currently with. 

Up until a couple weeks ago we didn’t hang out a lot.  But that changed. Over the past two weeks we’ve hung out 4 times. The first time was getting ice cream and walking the waterfront.  The second time was a few days later where the two of us went to the beach for the afternoon.  The third time we got some bubble tea and sat by the waterfront again. And the fourth time was yesterday when we went to city for the whole day and a baseball game at night. 

I was being a bit flirty with her like an idiot. We honestly had a perfect day doing fun things and taking pictures and stuff. Just normal friend things like bantering and playful roasting.

Fast forward to the end of the night.  On the ferry ride home she was very tired and cold. So me being the nice guy I am asked if I could help her in anyway. She replied with “you could give me a blanket” which I didn’t have obviously.  Out of nowhere she leans on me. And I’m absolutely blown away by this. Not really knowing what to make of it I put my arm around her and sort of cuddle as lays in my arms. 

This goes on all the way until we disembark the ferry on the other side and head to my car. As we walk to my car she’s very quiet like she’s stunned about what just happened. I was too. On the drive back to her place to drop her off she asks “did anything happen back there? I don’t really remember much” To which I replied, “yeah you leaned against me and we sorta cuddled.” In her explanation she stated that she was really tired and mistook me for her bf once she leaned against me, that it was like a dream to her. And that she wasn’t trying to give me a signal or anything. At this point I’m crushed. I was so happy while cuddling her and now my heart is being broken as she breaks this news to me. 

Once we get to her place we park and talk for like an hour about our feelings for one another and we talk about her bf.  We go over a few things like if we were to date what would happen in a few years when she transfers to a different school? She’s not a believer in long distance relationships. It was like she kept trying to convince me that I wouldn’t want to date her. She even told me, “you’ll find someone better than me. Just imagine me, but way better.” She ends up saying that she can’t date me because:

1. She’s dating someone obviously
2. If she were to break up with her current bf, that I don’t have some of the characteristics that she wants in a bf (just personality things, not looks)

We agreed to stay friends and just act like nothing happened, but I just don’t know what to think at this point. I’m obviously very stunned and upset over the range of emotions I’ve experienced in the past 4 hours and don’t know how to process it. 

I have a feeling she knew exactly what she was doing on the ferry. I feel like she likes me. It was a perfect time to cuddle so she leaned on me. But as we were cuddling she probably felt guilty for doing this behind her bf’s back so she came up with that excuse to make it not feel as bad.  She’s told me in the past that she doesn’t see herself being with her current bf forever and that a large reason she doesn’t want to break up with him is because things are complicated in his life right now and she doesn’t want to hurt him and make is life worse than it is. But what we did yesterday is something way worse than just breaking up. It was borderline cheating. No, it was cheating. 

I just have this feeling that we both have the same feelings for each other, regardless if I have all the characteristics she wants in a bf.  If she were to break up with her bf I wouldn’t swoop in and ask her out right away. I would give her time to recover and think things over. I want to build our friendship into a relationship.  I even told her this.

I texted her today and said that in order for me to fully get closure on this I have a few questions for her.  I even asked if we could meet up to discuss them in person.

358,"TL;DR: My brother has been unemployed since the start of the year, is unmotivated to go back and is acting mentally unstable.

I think it started in late December of 2017. He had just broken up with his girlfriend of 6 months maybe. Then on January 1st when he got back to his job after the Christmas break, he found he had been ""laid off"" from his job as a net developer. Ever since then it has been a downward spiral. Without going in too much depth, as of July 2018, he has been put on and violated a restraining order from his girlfriend, spent 4-5 hours in jail before my parents bailed him out, has started taking Zoloft (an SSRI) and has increased its dose to 75 maybe 100mg within a month. He was originally prescribed 25mg by his doctor. He hasn't worked for 7 months now. Goes downstairs every half an hour to smoke a cigarette and for the past week or two, my family and I have now caught him smoking weed. Drinks 4-5 cans of Redbull in a day. When we scold him or tell him not to do these things or even physically fight him, he just smiles and laughs and says absurd things like ""now it's legal in California. I can do what I want."" I don't know if it's his meds acting out but he reads a bunch of stuff on the internet about mental health and then acts those symptoms out in reality. Lately he has stated that I have split personality. I won't smoke weed and cigarette but this bad boy needs it. I can't do him wrong. This is one example of the things he says out after reading about them on the internet. AND HE IS 28 YEARS OLD. I guess these are the things he does in a nutshell. I believe he is mentally unstable but my parents think it's just his medicine combined with weed and cigarettes that is making him this way. I know no one talks this much and this way from just this.

I can either work part time, or load up on college courses at my local community college (to finish up my pre reqs). 

I just got a position for a part time job where I only work Saturday’s from 9-5, and get paid higher than minimum wage. I’ll make around $500 a month just from Saturday work. I MIGHT work a random weekday every once in awhile if needed. So if I chose the working option, I would get a job where I would work M-THURS with some variation.

The reason why I would want to do this, is because I plan on moving out in Augus-September of 2019. And it would be nice to have a good chunk of savings. (Already started on this) 

For college, I want to major in Kinesiology with intent on going to PT school. If I were to load up on classes at the CC, I would probably take mainly science classes to get those out of the way. 

I’ve gotten advice from both sides and am wondering what other people’s perspective on this is!

I had a dream about shawntel. We met again after years. We were just hanging out at first then we strated to really get close for some odd reason. The dream felt so real. I wanted it to be real. I was in love. She also felt the exactly same way. Tge only thing that bothered me in the dream is she had a crazy guy that I met when I first saw her after years. It was at a party that he was throwing at his house. You can tell He is obsessed with her constantly bugging her. Or coming out of nowwhere to tell her hi or do something weird. I didn't know that she had a stalker tyoe guy  until me and shawtel started to feel eachother like we did as teenagers. Me and the guy weren't friends, I didn't even know the guys name. Then the scene just switched it was Me and shawntel walking, we were planning on leaving when he came to tell her to tell her bye. He's telling her bye and all that. Then tries to kiss her she then ducks and advoids the kiss. Looking at me so Im sure she wants me only. That was the dream so far. There was much more but the dream slipped away. I wish I remembered. I wish it we're real. If you read this one day Shawtel Thompson. Just know.... I wish I would've married you...... 


Overall I don't understand why I had a dream about Shawntel as she would never give a chance again. We have seperated roads years ago. I also told her I loved her in the dream. Witch has me feeling regret, sad, guilt because I didn't make her mine....and told her how much I really liked her..... I messed up and my mind knows it. I know it.....


I don't know why that dream had feeling like this when I woke up. I just added her on facebook after years of not talking..... Im lost and don't know what to do ... 😪",22Jul2018,1
363,"So I just graduated high school back in June. It's been almost a month and the halfway point because next month is the start of college. So my problem begins with my parents, who insist me not start college (wait untill spring semester) because they don't want to waste their money on my college tuition, who they say will be a waste of time and money (I'm going to a CUNY in NYC). I plan on majoring in CS. So I'm mostly done with all my college things - I'm ready to attend. I enrolled in all my necessary classes. All I need is the tuition, aka physical money. The deadline is the 30th or else my classes get cancelled. They will not pay my tuition, or allow me to join the US Army to reap the GI Bill tuition benefits. They also won't allow me to take out loans as they don't want their names to be co-signed. Also, I don't qualify for any financial aid. Their combined income is at $200,000+ 
What are my other options  (if any) besides working? I have no problem with working full time 40+ hour/week. I am willing to do whatever it takes to go to college. ",22Jul2018,1
364,"Hi everyone! I just want to write this somewhere because I don't know what else to do and I'm scared.

I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for almost 6 years. 2 years ago we almost broke up because she met someone that she could talk to and who really understood her. They clicked and they both wanted more than to just be friends. And frankly, our relationship lacked some kind of communication or something. It was like we never could go out with friends since we had different ideas of fun. I would want to watch a movie, and she would want to go out to a festival or something. We didn't break up but we had a big talk and decided we would work on our relationship. She said she won't talk to her friend anymore and we both tried to talk more and fix our relationship.

Time passed, and things were actually looking good for some time, but last couple of months we started to fall apart again. We both pretended everything was OK but we knew it wasn't. She started messaging her old friend again. I know this since I secretly read her messages. And I was talking to other girls too. The reason is, we both wanted someone to talk to. We never cheated on each other because we loved each other and we still do. But our relationship was troubled and we knew it.

Then, last week, we really started to fall apart. We were so suspicious of each other. She thought I was having an affair. I thought she was having an affair. There was no trust in our relationship. I would read her messages and saw she's chatting with her old friend, and then I would chat with some girl I knew liked me. Then she would read my messages and chatted with her friend... It spiraled out of control. We were very suspicious of each other. But we still pretended everything was fine. We didn't know what to do.

4 days ago I told her if she wanted to break up with me I would understand. This was because I really thought she didn't want me anymore and it hurt seeing her talk to other people and ignoring me. She felt the same way - ignored and alone. So the next day she came to my house and started crying saying how it's over. And we are breaking up. We cried and talked that night and came to the conclusion it was the best for both of us.

The next day she left for work and she left some stuff at my place which she wanted to pick up the day after. I spent that days sad and confused it was my first break up, and she only had one boyfriend before that, but our relationship lasted almost six years. You get used to a person. My family knew her. Our mutual friends... A lot of things changed all at once.

The next day, she was on a trip to enroll in her UNI. This was a long trip (about 3 hours in one direction with a car). She went alone and somewhere under all that stress - the break up, the college, work... She started having a manic episode. When she came back from the trip she sent me a message saying she's going to pick up the stuff from my place. I told her I'll be home, but it hurt really bad - I imagined her talking to her friend and meeting him and falling in love while I was alone at home and I couldn't take it - so I sent another message saying I'll be out with friends and went to get drunk with my friend from work.

She came to my house to pick up the stuff and talked to my parents who instantly saw something was wrong. She was acting weird, and they even asked her if she was on drugs. She was going through a manic episode. She told them how she saw God when she was on her trip, and how she gave some gypsy 100$. She was also hugging them and saying how she's feeling great... My parents were worried and told her she should go home to her mom who's probably worried. She told them she will, but instead she - thinking I went out with a girl I was chatting with - went to her friend and they slept together.

I came home pretty late and my parents were already sleeping so I went to sleep too. When I woke, they told me about how she acted the last day and it really worried me. My cousin has actually been diagnosed with bipolar and I knew what it looked like and so did my parents, but I thought my girlfriend was maybe just being crazy and it will pass. I called her and asked her how she's feeling. She sounded really weird... My heart broke when I heard her speak. She sounded nothing like herself. She said she's feeling great and I can't tell her what to do and I should leave her alone.

I felt terrible. It was like something got inside her and changed her completely. I remembered my cousin, and how we all didn't see the signs on my cousin sooner. I felt so scared for her. I wanted to meet with her after her work but her mother called me and cried on the phone. She said she doesn't know what to do about the whole thing... So I went too look for her on her workplace. It was closing time when I got there, and as soon as I arrived, her boss told me my girlfriend lost it and she had to fire her.

I hugged my girlfriend and asked how she's feeling. And she was just smiling and telling me how everything is OK and she's never been happier, but it wasn't her, it was just someone who looked like her but acted completely different. Then she told me she slept with another man and had a long talk that continued even more when we went to her home and talked with her mom and stayed up all night talking, and crying. 

The condition she's in right now is breaking my heart. She showed me some videos she took on her trip to UNI. She was talking to herself and recording it, then using the auto-edit feature of the phone to process the video and actually thought she saw some higher meaning in those videos. She took all these weird pictures and talked with so much people randomly and freaked them out. I just keep thinking I lost her. It's like she's there but closed in a glass box, and I see her and just can't get her out. 

And the worse thing is, I blame myself. If I payed more attention to her, if I just talked about everything. Everything would be normal.

Now everything is a mess. I'm crying as I'm writing this... Because I love her, and I just want her to be well again. I know our relationship had to end, but if I had to choose between being in a bad relationship but knowing she's well and seeing her like this, I'd be with her forever.

I've been watching some videos today about bipolar disorder and it describes her symptoms extremely well. Also she's acting just like my cousin did when she had her episodes. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I really think she has bipolar.

I don't know what to do.",22Jul2018,5

Some things I'm weighing into the equation are traveling to florida for the thanksgiving(the airport by my school is small so the ticket would be quiet expensive).

378,"Hello everyone!

So I'm basically 19, just finished my first year of University. I completed the year at a place I didn't really wanna go, so spent the entire year at home with my parents and studied over the internet. Safely secured a 79% in the year. With this grade I'm not switching University. Sounds all good so far and it really is. 


However I've found myself become really sad and isolated from everyone. I'm a shy person in general but not an introvert I would say. During my time at High school I had probably about 3 best friends. However as the time there came to an end I tried to keep talking to them and keep in touch as we all went separate ways. Everyone is back in the home town now and I've messaged them all multiple times in the past month and asked to hang out. However yesterday I saw on social media that one of the friends had a birthday party. Which he told me was family only and these ""best"" friends I thought I had all attended. Not being invited I got super sad and cried myself to sleep honestly. 

I just want some advice from someone on what to do with my life? I study hard cause I wanna achieve the best for myself however I'm very lonely and I'm not sure how to make friends since they where all from my class at high school. It's s hard not having someone to talk to. I try spending time with my family which helps but I still need someone. I don't know if that sounds selfish. I just thought i'd post here to see if anyone has any wise words. I worry i'll just be alone forever. 

Thanks in advance. ",22Jul2018,1
380,"Life has too many options and not a lot of time.

I used to play video games all day and that gave me a sense of purpose and meaning but no one likes that kind of person. I couldn't be creative.

But since February I decided I wanted to become a character animation and go to cal arts. I've been drawing every day since then and since a few months ago I've been drawing all day every day using all the time I can muster. But lately I've been listening to music and I took a break to play video games with some friends and I thought, what if I get to the end only to regret that I didn't pick the right career? I thought maybe the grass might be greener on the other side. I might end up liking going pro in a video game rather than becoming a musician or a character animator. I don't know I'm such a mess right now. I might just feel this way because I'm tired of working so much and I want to stop,  but I feel like if I stop I'll ruin my chances at my purpose in life. I know that I'm young, but I want to go ahead and start working hard for something so that when I graduate from high school I have some knowledge and some preparation for what I want to do. 

But I don't like many jobs, I feel like I would love playing at coffee shops and making music, but I would miss out at being a character animator that could do something. I just need god or whoever to come out of the sky and yell at me what my purpose is. I wish I had 3 lives, one where I do each thing, or if I could do all 3 at once, but there's only so much time in a day and only so much life to live :(, I can only pick one to be great at.

I’m 22 male. I come from small city in one of European countries. About 3 years ago I started studying. I had to move to bigger city where the university is. Distance between my small city and city where I study is about 200 km (124 miles) so I could easily travel by public transport every weekend to spend time with my parents. After about a year and a half on university I met this wonderful girl, we fell in love almost instantly. We’re together to this day and everything is fine with our relationship, we started planning our future. 

Now to the point. I have a problem. It’s a problem inside me. No one knows about it (well now You all will know). Me and my girlfriend are living together in city where we study. Semester is over now, we have a holidays so like almost every student we want to go to our homes to spend holidays with family. The main problem is me and my girlfriend we come from different cites what that means is my family city is about 450 km (280 miles) from my girlfriends family city.  I want to spend some time with my family especially my mother but on the other hand I also want to be with my girlfriend all the time. 

I think I’m a bit homesick but I have no idea why after this years on university this is happening now. Recently I miss my childhood so much. Also my girlfriend is coming to my city sometimes but now she has a full time job so it’s almost impossible for her to come. 

So now I travel between my home and my girlfriends. I'm tired of it already. I feel like I need some time rest. This whole situation makes me anxious. Maybe for some of You it’s may seem like a not big deal, but it’s tearing me apart and I need some advice. ",22Jul2018,0

So the months go by, I’m a good listener it’s part of my career description as well. Since the time I knew her her bf was pretty verbally abuse. Putting her down and making her feel awful all the time threatening to kick her out.  I listened and tried giving her advice or confidence that she didn’t need that in her life no one does. But she doesn’t really have the self esteem to break away from him. So one day we are hanging out and she makes a move on me. I got so caught up in the moment I went with it.

I feel like we are more in the relationship now and I want to be with her but I’m just so afraid she will find someone else when she’s with me and lie and justify it because of of x y z and I can never tell her about these concerns because she  is so quick to defend. And also i have heard stories about her from her friends and when I ask her about them I’m not even accusing I’m just like hey did this actually happen? And she gets defensive and said I can’t believe you would believe I would lie about or do that. So my advice is am I Getting played ?

He's lazy and always ""busy"" so I came up with my own solution 4G unlimited data so I could do all my research for college work because no internet = no online homeworks being completed. Any way we move forward to now where I have finished college and I decided I wan't to take a gap year to go traveling and to enjoy myself. Of course he was having none of it, his reasoning ""you won't get a job if you're inactive for a year"" funny that 'cause I did 3 years at college and most of my friends did 2 years, what does this mean well it means they finished a year earlier than me and believe it or not they are now employed after taking gap years  👏 👏 👏.

So I have been looking to apply for jobs because if I don't he's now decided he's going to kick me out of the house, however I am going to Manchester for an event in a month and 3 days, he has resorted to making my life hell until after the trip, or having me cancel the trip and get a full time job. Why? Well because ""it takes longer than a month and 3 days to get a job so you better get applying"" which it does in some industries but for someone who is looking to work in a very open job route such as accounting or a department in the financial segment of a business I personally don't see how waiting a month before applying is going to cause any harm. So why don't I apply now anyway? Well if they ask me to start prior to the Manchester event I don't want to be that guy to say oh yeah sorry I can't work these 3 days here. I cannot see how that would go down well at all. Making demands during an interview surely isn't going to go down well, like ever.

I have recently stopped working with them as an independent contractor (delivery driver) after 3 years and seriously look back an question some of their shady practices. 

For reference, this is in California, and after the recent law changes for Marijuana use in the state on july 1st, our grow house was raided. I heard through other coworkers and not even from my actual bosses. Recently I've known my bosses have been under stress and with the city even trying to ban medical use that i live in, it seems the company is trying scrape together to reestablish itself more ""legit"" if you can even call it that. It's been around for a while but I know that the boss uses the mail services here in the US to send THC products across state lines, and I know that as medical, everything has to be tested and nothing is. Some of my patients have gotten sick from the products and have been refused refunds, and I've left over disagreements with management and being their longest running driver.

Feeling a bit better, the thought of losing the foot is in the forefront. and being that I was told this was a ""real possibility"" after my latest talk with the doctor, I just want to know from those who have lost limbs, how did you get your mind right?

394,"Oh, this is going to seem so bizarre... 

I don't like genes, to put that out there. 

Genes are the building blocks of humans. Essentially, they program you -- and every bit of what you do, and what you are is determined by your genes. Am I the only one who finds this distasteful? 

Inheritance and genes make me less... myself. I genetically have a certain disposition to certain behavior, tastes, sounds, etc. My appearance, even my personality are ALL partially genetically driven. 

I am at the mercy of my genes. Because of my genes I am a certain way -- a way I don't want to be. 

I think to myself, ""Can I override my genetic dispositions?"", but then I also think -- ""Are my genes the reason why I dislike having genes?"" It makes me feel helpless.

I want to be 100% me, not 50% one person and 50% another. It pains me to know that my intellect, and even some of my talents are hereditary. I'm just riding on someone else's genetics. It's not MY doing.

If it were my choice -- I'd forego genes altogether but... you kinda need those to live. That's annoying. 

Anyone else agree? Or understand what I am meaning? ",22Jul2018,0

We said we would text each other after (where we both talked about how we enjoyed meeting eachother and stuff). 

However, over the next few days I felt really panicky and anxious (e.g. did I say something stupid during the date, did the date even enjoy it at all?) to the point where I could hardly eat or function throughout the day. To make matters worse, after sending them a typical message sating that they'll do well in a job they applied for, I've received no reply in the last few days and fell completely lost and confused about what is going on.

I feel that my options include; - messaging them in a week or two asking if theyre still interested in talking - continue waiting an unknown amount of time waiting for their reply (which I'm currently struggling to do) - completely give up on this really nice person

403,"Disclaimer: Language used.

I've asked for HELP so many times. But it gets to a point where the more you say, help... help... help... the more people begin to ignore you and see you're just a desperate no life. People treat desperation in this world, absolutely horrible. It is not even humane it's sadistic. Then you got some people telling you the same fake same bull crap over and over.

And after it all, you can no longer be heard, your opinions don't matter, your feelings don't matter, your voice doesn't matter and your existence is meaningless. This is how I've felt for the past two years of my life doing home school in high school.

I got no friends, I got no girl friend, I do nothing, I take showers, I clean my room and I eat, it's getting old, it's already old it's a clock just repeating itself, I can literally do nothing and EVERYTHING will be the FUCKING same. No matter who reads this and disagrees, IT WILL BE THE SAME. I see no point in anything.

Every girl I talk too, every one of them, just online they completely ignore me or send one message and thats it, here's a interesting last note. I've met about one hundred thousand people online for the amount of time I've been online, all of them treated me with contempt, no compassion and no respect. I get blocked, ignored etc. I get judged horribly. And most of all people tell me the old ""I don't know you in real life, so I don't need to treat you like a human"" that's everyone I meet. Can you understand if you were in my position, how you'd feel? So It's birth rights, I have to be born with it in order to be treated in existence.

I am completely tired of always meeting people who are all already taken, linked and have a bunch of friends, because those people do not give a single shit about you and are the most ignorant people ever. No one has time for me, no one has respect for me, no one interacts with me. Even if they did it would just be bad people, weirdos or toxic people. Doesn't help at all. 

Every community has rejected me, I lost all passion in anime, games, deleted most of my accounts and feel unaccepted.

Every girl just treats me with contempt and neglect. I'm wondering if this is how the world is. Cause I don't want to get a wife or have a life then.

My parents divorced when I was 10. My father remarried when I was 13 and had more kids. He forced me to visit until I was 16 then he gave up. I do not speak to my father ever. When he is in the same room I ignore him.

This wasn’t a problem until my grandparents demanded I invite them to my graduation or they weren’t coming. I disinvited them and invited my mother’s husband’s parents instead. Then the arguing with them got really bad, so for awhile I was polite to my father when I had to be.He texted later and asked what to bring to my birthday party. I said “Nothing you’re not invited”. His wife told my grandparents and they  confronted me. My grandmother got really upset and started yelling that I wasn’t acting like part of the family and that until I was ready to I didn’t need to come around anymore.

They said I cause tension which confuses me because I don’t do anything. I’m not rude to my father or his new family, I just ignore them. They’re not my family so I won’t engage them. 

This is causing problems with my aunts/uncles and my 2 favorite cousins too. They aren’t very warm when I come around and I have a feeling they’re talking about me behind my back.

409,"I'm writing a drama story, and one of the main characters (a human girl of 8 years old named Heidi Falconer - if the name sounds too 'fake' do tell) has an unusual weakness - she's allergic to H2O. She has to avoid water at all costs - for example in the story, one time she accidentally drunk a mouthful of water, and went into anaphylaxis, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse. She has to wear a special spacesuit like apparatus in case it rains as a single drop of rain will kill her, for example if she gets a single drop of rain in her mouth by accident, she will go into shock.

She also has to avoid things like surgeries, her parents told the surgeons not to use any water on her as she's allergic and the surgeons took them seriously (in a world first - beforehand the surgeons always used water while operating on a patient), but after the surgery she had to be put on a medical drip (having water injected into her veins), and then went into anaphylaxis because the drip was water based.

She hydrates herself by drinking 4 small glasses of milk or orange juice a day, which because of their chemical composition bring her no harm. She's 100% healthy as long as she avoids H2O as her immune system sees H2O molecules as foreign. She becomes famous in her country because of her allergy, stealing the hearts of residents near her.

Another aspect to the story is she becomes a tragic hermit after a gang of cruel thieves break into her house and steal her 'spacesuit' and tear it up. She was born allergic, and while in her mother's womb she was kicking around a lot in pain.

\- I was living with my parents while doing college

\- Major issues with parents arose

\- I realized I needed to move out, so I stopped college and started saving &amp; paying off debt

\- I planned on moving into a van (not like a hobo... see /r/vandwellers)

\- I bought a van and started setting it up

\- Things got real bad with parents, so I moved in with a friend's parents

Now I'm not really sure I even want to move into a van. I was only planning on it out of desperation. I've considered apartments, which may be fine temporarily, but I would like to be able to afford my own house as soon as possible.

My financial situation is this:

\- No debt

\- 2 years of college done

\- $1000 in savings

\- I have a cargo van that I was converting into a camper. I could probably sell it for $5000 - $6000, then get a beater car for $1000.

\- $1000 montly income from my part time job (could get another part time job to supplement this)

\- I work part time at a tech company. I started as an intern, and they liked me so I am now part time. I unfortunately can't work there forever because my dad (who I've had some major issues with) works there as well, but it will look really good on a resume.

My boss owns multiple stores and the position that I was offered was taking a while to get started because of corporate and all the financial stuff. So it was putting me in a bind but I still had my other job so it was fine. But then the general manager at his other store quit. My boss called me and I asked if I’d be intrested. It would be good training for me and good practice. I had a day to decide and it was a big descion. The job is about 45 min away so I have to drive about an hour and half every day and I work 9 hours a day. I decided to take it because I wouldn’t be working 2 jobs and would have a break.

421,"Alright. So, I'll try to make this as brief as possible. The mother of my son (now, ex-girlfriend after being together 2.5 years) and I ended our relationship a little over three weeks ago after several months of really serious issues (drunkenness and completely irrational behavior, on my part, and infidelity, partying, and a general disregard for our relationship, on her's). A few days after we ended things she started sleeping with someone else (which I anticipated and have no particularly bad feelings about (we're not together, so do you, kind of thing)). However, the guy she's sleeping with is her manager at the pub she works at, she babysits his daughter, and has, on more than one occasion, let him watch my son (before I knew for sure they were sleeping together). So, my conflict: 1) Am I justified in thinking it's complete bullshit that she's letting a guy that's ""just sex"" watch our son, regardless of whether he's a cool person or not? 2) Is it reasonable for me to think it's ridiculous to invite him to our son's birthday party? Or, should I just ""be an adult"" and accept it? My intuition tells me this is complete bullshit and I should tell her I'm not willing to tolerate it; but part of me says, ""Take the power away from her and just don't give a shit."" Smile in his face kind of thing. 

As co-parents we're great with our son. As long as it has to do with him, everything is more or less civil. Yet, she keeps showing this side of herself that basically suggests she doesn't really care if something bothers me regarding our son. I tell her, ""Hey, I'm not really cool with this and I have as much say over what happens with him as you do."" Her response is slowly becoming something along the lines of ""Tough shit."" Despite the fact that I do everything I can to be accommodating and compromising when it comes to our son (days with him, coming over to get him up, taking him if she has plans, etc.). I'm at the point where I think diplomacy is becoming less and less of an option. Especially if she keeps this shit up.

422,"I'm 21..

I don't really remember feeling happy for more than a fleeting moment..  
I didn't know it was depression but in retrospect I've probably had dysthymia (low grade constant depression) for years.. and I've had periods of severe depression on top of that..

I have intrusive thoughts, I've always liked sad songs.. I have song lyrics repeating in my head 'just put my body in a box', 'wrap me up in Chanel inside my coffin'..

I have thoughts like; run as hard as I can head first into a wall, or drive a scissors through your arm..

Or just I could break a bone in my foot.

I've never been suicidal but I have thoughts, I imagine looping a belt into a noose, tying a knot at the end and sticking it in a door.

I remember the first one, I tied my earphones into a noose without realising.

I watched Kevin Hines Story and started crying, he jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and survived.

I've gone to see psychologists, counsellors, doctors and I was referred to psych.. I thought I had cyclothymia (low grade bipolar).. I'm totally indecisive but worse than that I get fixated on something being the right option and I go hell for leather at that, but it's always dropped in 2 weeks.

I wasn't entirely truthful at those appointments but I was still told to continue counselling.. now I'm home from college I don't have anywhere to go.

I just spend my time writing online like this, usually not in as much detail..

I walked into the doctors office at college and almost broke down when I started talking to the nurse, I was jittering, shaking and stammering..   
I then got into the doctor and all I could talk about was how I'm constantly frustrated, incredibly irritable and how I don't like college, all of which is also very true but I left out that I have a image, thought etc of putting a handgun to my head (No guns in my country), that's painless.  

I think things like 'if I lost a finger (I play guitar) I'd end it all', I've had the same thought about if I was diagnosed with something debilitating or life changing..

I've been truly miserable at college for the last 2 years, between hating my degree and being pushed out by people I thought were friends.

That's when it started to get worse, and I actually sought help.

I'm probably overreacting, I'm not on any medication, but I just want to get off, I want the world to stop and I want to get off.   
I don't feel like a danger to myself or others but I'm certainly not getting better..

But I'd probably go back to the doctor and downplay it so I don't get labelled with a mental illness, or as a threat..

My parents are starting to realise and I don't know if they're going to force me into a meeting/intervention/appointment or something, they wanted me to drive them somewhere I didn't want to, we started to fight.

(I get very anxious about driving.. I can I just don't like it.. I also recently got a car for my 21st birthday as a surprise.. and probably to entice me to get out driving.)

It calmed down, I went to put on waffles, pancakes or whatever and I was told dinners nearly ready.. I wanted waffles and  they took them off me, I broke down crying, slamming my fist off every countertop, kicking trying to put my foot through my wooden door and went to my room crying.. I'm a 21 year old guy.

I really don't know.. I'm trying to move forward, I've changed colleges and my degree (field) so I'll be going there when college starts back.. and I've applied for Law Enforcement, I got through the first stage of tests too.. I don't know whether I should go through with it or not, or if I end up getting diagnosed or going to hospital that I'll have a big red 'VOID' stamp over my application.

I don't know..   
I know of one guy who ended up in psych, I only know because he wrote a post about it.  
He has some condition (not sure what) but he also was depressed, anxious and was losing his grip on reality, so he ended up there for a month or so..

He said it saved his life.

It's free, and I'm on private health insurance..

My siblings will find out there's something inherently wrong with me, my friends might find out..

Employers, anyone of any potential significance.

If I went I wouldn't want visitors, I would rather if no one even knew.

Maybes there's not an actual issue any bigger than me being myself, being lazy and overthinking..

Maybe I do need help, but I can't see how I'll get better at home, I haven't showered or shaved in a week, I didn't sleep until 4am last night, woke and 8 and then slept from 2 to 7pm...   
What do you think?

I'm here for advice so any is appreciated, thank you.

Sorry if this is all over the place, most of this stuff hasn't left my head, I thought I can talk about having no interest, not enjoying life etc. and resolve that and I wouldn't have to mention the severities of it all.

426,"So I’m pretty tight on money and check craigslist community or gigs to see if there’s anything that I could possible earn from. I’m a college student and I work part time so I do this from time to time when my real job can’t pay for my tuition or housing, last year I was in contact with a company.. a female and male best friend duo who explained they do massages in the city ranging from 300-500 dollars. I asked what kind of massages to be specific since the money I’d be making I know logically is way more than a regular muscle massage... we were emailing back and forth for quite some time (all my emails were with the woman) and when it was time to head in for an interview I was explained that she wouldn’t be available, but her male partner would be. I was a bit apprehensive and just never replied back to their offer. A year later, the company emails me again and asks if I’m interested in working with them, my emails are with the female and my interview is supposed to be with the male. For security purposes of their company, they explained that the interview would be held in a hotel.. I have yet to respond to confirm this interview, I know by law happy ending massages are illegal but I’m at the end of my rope when it comes to my financial situation.. I guess I just want some advice on whether this is actually a business or if this is all just some creepy man sitting behind his laptop 😂",22Jul2018,2
427,"Getting a kitten and taking care of it was suppose to be so straightforward

I have been obsessing over cats for many many months now and its beginning to take a toll on me- as if it is pouring over into my social and family life in a negative neurotic sort of way

I feel its not specific to this scenario; that I've always been insanely indecisive (critical thinking?)
It can be very hard to make a solid informed decision sometimes especially with all the information out here on the internet
I feel like I've adequately educated myself about cats, but there's just an overload of information that is manifesting itself alongside my indecisiveness
To my family, I am known to bounce back and forth between positives and negatives before making any informed decision - and sometimes I just get stuck

I know getting a cat would make me happy, I got a kitten in June and rehomed him despite the conflict in my mind telling me he was fine
He was an excellent kitten, and I even went so far as to teach him how to do a few tricks using clicker training (like sit and paw)
I rehomed him on impulse, and almost immediately began crying for hours after she left- reassuring myself that this was the best decision and that I would be more patient and knowledgeable and picky when choosing my forever buddy the next time around

I've been visiting a local shelter and keeping tabs on classified ads speaking to many people about potentially adopting their cat
I can't help but feel like my criteria can never be fully met unless I find a breeder - but it's not so much that I want a purebred; its just that I feel its a for sure way of getting a specific appearance cat with a good socialized environment and genetic predisposition to be affectionate with humans because the parents/grandparents were and so forth

There is a Gray Medium-Hair kitten that I've been seeing and playing with for a couple hours the past few days at my local shelter; and they have since offered to reserve her for me until Monday

I think it looks like a great cat, although I'm a little worried caring for an animal that requires regular grooming (although I feel I can handle it)
I'm worried more so in regards to her temperament, as I've convinced myself that unless a kitten is into me immediately; then that must mean she's shy and won't be the ideal cat I've grown attached to in my mind (a cat that want to cuddle, be pet, sit on your lap etc)
A kitten that conforms to my ridiculous standards of behaviour and physical appearance

I actually feel disgusted with myself for being so picky
I know my mother and sister have been worried about me; because of how much time I've been spending obsessing over cats and what cat to get, and meeting a cat, if I should get 2 cats instead of 1, and finding out what cat fits my criteria 

This is getting out of hand, and I think I need help-
I need perspective 

I hope someone out here can give me some advice",22Jul2018,2
428,"Just kidding. Ok my real problem is that I'm trying to find a song. They play it on a cool rock station that plays rock s9ngs of different decades like the Beatles. It's not like heavy rock. It's a band that I think is biracial or maybe all black? Maybe not. It's a not as popular song, yet still heard of. I want to say from the 70s or 80s. Help!!!",22Jul2018,0
429,"I am just thoroughly confused because there’s this boy and he sometimes refers to me as “baby” randomly. For example, he would answer a question, but put “baby” on the end. 

I don’t quite know how to react when he does this because I don’t wanna misread and think “wow he might like me” so I just ignore it when he says these things. 

Any suggestions?",22Jul2018,1
