0,"Last Friday, it’d been brought to my attention that my coworker, “Ruth”, has been bad mouthing me to a few of our coworkers and it has made its way back to me. 

The way our office is set up I have to see her every day and i feel as if i almost can’t escape a conversation with her. Before last Friday i was already growing really tired of her constantly in my office talking for 15 minutes on things im not interested in, or gossiping about my coworkers. 

I’ll even have my headphones in while I’ll work and she’ll be halfway into a conversation with me before i notice it. It’s becoming a big, annoying distraction and Idk how much more i can deal with it. 

But after last Friday, I no longer want any contact with her unless it’s for professional reasons. 

Apparently she’s been telling people I’m always late and leaving early, I’m always on my phone, I’m never working, etc etc. One of the people she told went and told someone else and they came and told me. I was very offended and upset by this because it’s not true and I’ve explained to her multiple times that my bosses know where i am. (My position calls for me to be in and out of the office so i always send an email to my bosses letting them know of my whereabouts. Since she’s not my boss she doesn’t get those emails). 

A while ago she also told me my position was “nice but not needed”. 

This has been going on for a while but now that i know she’s going around the office spreading false information i feel the need to inform my boss of what’s going on. With my office being next to hers she constantly is walking through my office and speaking to me so there’s no way i can avoid her. I also don’t know how to ask her to quit speaking to me. 

I believe she may be doing this in an attempt to ruin a possible promotion for me. 

Tomorrow I’ve decided to tell my boss about what’s going on before he hears it from someone else. Do you think this is even worth bringing up to him or should i let it go? 

tldr: found out my coworker has been trashing me around the office and I’m not sure how to proceed. ",04Sep2018,6
1,"Hello all, I come to you in a tough situation. I am a 3rd year psychology major. I came to school excited about the major but since taking the courses, I have never liked any and have been doing sub-par due to my interest in other things such as extracurriculars(Acting, Running, Tennis). It has gotten so bad that I am on academic probation this semester and if i do bad again I will be kicked out. Since last semester, I was looking for something to take my mind how much I hated school academically, this was theatre came in. They were having auditions for a play, before this I had never done any acting prior, so I watched other school's rendition of it. After the auditions, I got a part and eventually got to perform and played the character pretty well. Now the school also had auditions for another play and I made that as well, I am 3rd most important character and eventually want to have a lead role in a play before I graduate. The problem is I don't want this to end, I want to do this for the rest of my life , initially I was thinking I could find a production in the town I am working at that does community theatre and do that on the side while getting a real job, but I don't know what I want to even do. My whole life has been about running and I wanted to find something that makes me just excited(acting might be it). The issue is since my first audition, my parents have expressed that they do not like me doing it, so I've been doing it behind their back. So at this point I don't know what to do, should I throw away college and try to persue acting even though my parents don't support it or should I settle for community theatre and find a different major that I may be interested in, but will be supported by my parents(although I had this talk with my parents before and they don't think I should change my major, I could try again though).

2,"I've been going through a period of depression, demotivation, and lack of energy. I was hoping Reddit would have advice to counteract these negative attributes of my day-to-day.

A short background to my situation is as follows:

* I am just getting into my second year of college (majoring in ""Global Studies"" (akin to International Affairs), but the lack of a history of said major in my family creates a disconnect with them whenever I talk about it or whenever they ask about it.

* At my college/university, I haven't found a ""tribe"" or group of people that I fit into. I've tried looking for people that have shared interests, but they seemingly take these interests to the extreme while I am more moderate in my interest.

* While I enjoy my major, I still feel a little lost in terms of a goal or point to work towards. This is because I went into my higher education with the mindset that I wanted to improve myself than to just work towards attaining a specific career. This idea of self-improvement also causes me to feel guilty whenever I try to enjoy myself with hobbies or other things because I feel like I am not using my time wisely.

* Lastly, I am feeling like most things have lost their appeal. All my interests just aren't as enticing or engaging as they used to be. I am hoping someone will have advice to this problem too.

I hope someone has the advice to help me. Thanks in advance for any advice anyone gives me. You spending the time to reply means a lot too.",04Sep2018,1

4,"I drunkenly slept with a long-time friend of mine. Woke up and regretted it a lot because I was sure it would cause awkward issues. Our entire friendship circle found out, but they were all determined to keep it from his ex-gf (I know her through him. They had been broken up for 6 months. But her dad had died about a week before this happened. I’d gone to his funeral, again before it happened.) 

We were all at an out of the country event together a few weeks later, and I spent a fair amount of time hanging out with this girl, because I’m quite fond of her. After we all went home from the trip, she found out that I’d slept with her ex (from a girl who posted about it in a group we’re both in) and found out everyone had kept it from her.  I know from a mutual friend of ours that she was very angry that it was kept from her.

I know I’m a horrible person. I hadn’t wanted her to find out, at all, but especially because her dad had just died. I didn’t want her to be hurt. But with her finding out the way she did, I’m sure she feels horribly betrayed, since we’d been hanging out on the trip away. I don’t know what to do. It’s been a month and we haven’t been in contact (because she lives a few hours away from me and I don’t know if it’s right for me to send a message of apology or not. I didn’t want to upset her even more by being in contact when she felt betrayed.)

Should I apologise anyway, even over messenger? I know the friendship is probably beyond salvaging (I wouldn’t want to be friends with me if I were her), but I do think she’s owed an apology. But I don’t want to upset her by getting in contact if she’d rather be left in peace. ",04Sep2018,2
5,"My boyfriend and I are going to be moving in together soon. We've been dating for almost two years. I told my good friend and her boyfriend about it and they said, ""You don't know if you're compatible until you start living with someone."" That really freaked me out. I didn't even really think about us having big problems- I spend two or three nights and entire days at his house per week, we've discussed the ""big"" questions (marriage kids finances etc). I asked my boyfriend about it because he's lived with two exes, and he said the only difference he found was that you become more aware of your partner's bowel movement schedule and their chore habits (or lack thereof), and that the reasons him and his exes broke up had nothing to do with the fact that they were living together. My mom even told me she didn't start living with my dad til they got engaged- my cousin didn't start living with her husband til after they were married. But what my friend said has me worried. 

Is what I'm worried about dumb? What else should I discuss with my boyfriend before we start living together to mitigate problems?",04Sep2018,1
6,"I recently graduated college and I thought I would take a gap year, or at least some time off, to focus on myself before really committing to a career in medicine. I realized I am still extremely interested in different career paths/hobbies that could potentially become something more (business, tech, marketing etc). I put everything off to focus on myself and seek my interests while I am able to but by being out of school I have realized I have great unenjoyment in not always actively learning something or struggling with rigorous material. For example, I'm seeking internships/learning about entrepreneurship but I feel like I'm not really getting smarter? Its really fulfilling but I have this sense of fear that I'm wasting my time/becoming stupider by the second because some of these interests are more about hard work than the studying I am used to. I definitely still try to exercise my brain by learning a new language, podcasts, reading, etc but I still don't find it to be as fulfilling because it's mostly surface level? I don't know if I really make sense but perhaps its the lack of a structural environment where I can also see if I really cemented new knowledge through an exam. There's also a sense of fear that I'm dipping my toes in a new path that I'm not guaranteed results and thats a bit frightening. I'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced this and what I can do for myself? I would really appreciate any advice! Also, I don't mean to sound like an asshole at all &amp; I'm not saying non-academic paths are not fulfilling/mentally rigorous/etc. Thats FAR from what I'm saying - I'm just having trouble with not have a structural environment that records my progress and mainly struggling with my inner self..idk.

I'm a shy guy and she was somehow making me change that about myself. I liked her more every day, but she never saw me the same way. 

During the last month we rarely texted and didn't see each other in a while. I also found out that she might be interested in someone else.

13,"Hello reddit.

A little bit of backstory incoming. A good friend of mine just broke up with his girlfriend (not exactly sure who broke up tbh, I'm thinking her) not long ago. They were already engaged. They lived together with two cats in an apartment up until the breakup, now he's there alone with both cats.

He is struggling with mania, depression, borderline amongst other mental problems and gained a lot of weight over their years together while she lost weight. He also just got diagnosed with diabetes and some kind of early cancer I believe while he was in a day hospital because of his mental problems.

So after the breakup, she moved out to her mum while he stayed with the cats, but their apartment is a complete mess (which is one reason for the breakup I believe). And by mess I mean you can't even walk into the front door properly, it's really bad with flies all around, weeks-old food and stains on the floor.

I offered my help to clean up the apartment multiple times now, but he just said ""okay"" and that was it, even though he has to move out this week and nothing happened yet. The thing is, he just can't do it all by himself and his girlfriend doesn't help either (at least when they are alone I believe), because them both combined do ""more nothing"" since neither he nor she can motivate the other one to do something. Especially after the breakup.

So what he does all day now is waste her money on drugs, sleep and play video games. He said he'll just tell her he needs the money to move out properly to his parents, but it's going into the hundreds by now just for drugs and occasional fast food deliveries and I don't know how to stop him from ruining not only himself but his girlfriend, too. Besides, they both have high debts already (which is another reason for the breakup he said) mostly caused by him and his impulsive purchases of let's say, a smartwatch or a PS4 just because he felt like it. He doesn't have a job, but she does.

Everytime I came over he emptied several bottles of water (more than 5 for sure), 2 liters each and didn't eat anything really the whole day which I find kind of alarming. He doesn't shower or change clothes, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't really communicate much privately with his girlfriend in the years, just occasional messages, but I like her and we got along well together. There wasn't much to talk about really in the past (and I'm not necessarily the guy to start or let alone keep conversations alive), sadly. We three planned to go on a vacation a couple weeks ago (they asked me), but they canceled everything a week before because of the breakup. Now I didn't talk to her since they broke up and I'm not sure how or even if I should, as it's not like I just liked her because they were together. I want to help them/him/her somehow in any way possible. At the very least I would like to hear her side of the story because I can't believe him anymore, he doesn't seem to be in the now at all, a state of ""fuck everything"".

I'm not even sure if he treats the cats well, they would always jump up and follow me when they hear water or see me going even close to the kitchen (where their food is). When I was in the bathroom once and washed my hands, they just jumped up the sink and drank hysterically. They would also knead on me when I sat down and leaned back, which they never did on him (when I was there at least).

&amp;#x200B;

My struggle now: do I just ignore everything about this, like it's not my business? Maybe I misinterpret a lot of these things, I'm not sure. I can't really talk to anyone about this either as I don't want to expose any of this to people that know them.",04Sep2018,1
14,"So my girlfriend works as a sales agent for a company and she goes to different grocery stores everyday (same 3 or 4 everyday).

26,"Hello, this is my first post here and I made this account simply to “find myself”. I intend to use this account for feedback and ways I can further better myself. I was broken up with in July for reasons unrelated to my life situation and that made me become self aware on a lot of things. I’m actually doing nothing with myself and knowing she’s finishing school in another state and actually working towards what she wants was a real wake up call for me. I do feel she kind of resented me because all I do is work and go home and didn’t go out unless it was with her. Anyways That’s out the way now, so what I need advice on is what the hell do I do with my life? I feel, at times, like I am wasting away at a job just to recover from a financial mistake I made last year. Which by the way, my ex inspired me to fix the financial mistake because we had moving in together plans but they’re gone. Here’s some context on my life situation, when I was 18 and graduated HS, I moved to Washington state from Arizona to be with my mom due to us being separated when I was a child. I’m 21 now and have been here since and the past three years all I’ve done is work and go home and just waste so much time, it’s sickening to me because other people are out there doing shit and I just work and play ps4 and lounge and live with my mom and her husband. I had just one “real” relationship and that’s the recent one. I know this sub isn’t about relationships really but I have to mention it because a breakup is what inspired me to write all this and it’s one major thing I want in life along with marriage and kids. Yes I know relationships aren’t super important but I digress. Anyways back on my plea for advice, I truly do not have any passions really. I have things I’d love to do and fantasize about but I have done absolutely nothing about it. I see everyone going to college but I have to pay off this new car I mistakingly got last year. I’ve been getting a lot of overtime opportunities lately due to being low staffed so I’m taking advantage and literally putting it all to my car. The amount I owe is going down drastically by the month so I am progressing a lot. I’m fearful to even attempt anything like school for example because I have this financial detriment to worry about. I don’t do any sort of hobbies besides video games and I feel like a loser and I don’t even know how I got a girlfriend honestly. I guess I’m funny and sweet but in the end even that wasn’t enough to be wanted. I have suspicions that there’s something wrong with me and people kinda look down upon me because I’m doing life later than everyone else. Please help me, I need input I don’t want to live my life wishing for shit anymore. I’ve felt so weak and pathetic this past month and a half.

Context: Currently starting my junior year in HS and this year I decided to apply for Chinese 3 (I took Chinese 1 and Chinese 2 classes prior). However they only hired one teacher to teach Chinese 3 and the class was filled up (40 students max).

Story: So I was talking with my counselor because of schedule changes for HS and one of the classes I wanted was chinese 3. My counselor told me that the class was full but told me to go to the Chinese 3 teachers room to ask if they could squeeze me in. The Chinese teacher was a nice young lady and I told her about my situation and how I wanted to take chinese 3 and she told me she'll talk with the principal and to send her an email about it to her. So I did and the next day I got an email saying that she couldn't do it and she'll put me on the waiting list. So then I went to my counselor and had to rearrange my schedule again since I had a substitute class (Where chinese was supposed to be) and she said I could choose who I wanted to teacher assistant for. So as I was looking through the list, my counselor perked up and she said what if she could put me in that chinese teachers class as a T.A (teachers assistant). And at that time I just went with the flow and now it's on my schedule. Both my dad and my counselor said not to tell the teacher until I went to her class tomorrow and my mind exploded. (Keep in mind this is not my counselors fault. She was just trying to help me as much as possible.)

Conclusion: Sorry for such a long post and thanks so much if you've read all of it but here's the question: What am I going to do in this situation? She told me she can't add me to the class and the next day I'm going to walk in as her T.A? As a high school student I can't imagine the cringe,awkwardness, and unpleasantness when I walk in there and it's gonna seem like I tried really hard to get in her class.

 I just so happen to work casual shifts at his parents business sorting out receipts and his mum had asked me to go through her texts on her phone to find receipts that employees had sent her.

We live well. Great home, great food, great life. However, my mom and I are extremely frugal.

But these anxieties constantly come up. Should I have gone to community college first? Is there a cheaper school I could’ve gone to? Will the government pay more for me? Am I wasting my time?
     I know this is really long, but I’ve just kind of been rambling. The bottom line is I don’t want to make my parents pay so much, so I’ll probably take many loans. However, will I be able to pay off those loans? Will I find a job I want? Should I transfer out of Cal? I just want to feel secure, that everything will be okay. But I keep doubting that. It’s when these thoughts come in that I miss my family the most. I just want to go back home, get a job, and support them. But I know I have to think of the future as well. Please give me any comments or advice. ",04Sep2018,1
32,"I don't know when it started but I just realized something.
I don't have my own personality. I know it sounds strange but let me explain for now. 

Every time I meet someone I try to be like them. Every friend I made, I made by being similar to them and I don't mean like I was similar to them before I met them but I just kind of went with it.

Imagine a very shallow wave. Like you can barely see it. And then there is a big wave and since the shallow wave is so shallow and weak, it will just go along with the big wave. It's something like that. 

It kind of sounds stupid doesn't it? But I think this is what is happening. I don't know how I really am, cause this is how it's always been since I can remember but this can't be it right?

How can I find myself?

33,"So my SO recently interviewed for and was subsequently offered a new role in policy. His current company is relatively small and his potentially new employer is quite large. He really wants out of his current office, as there’s a new manager that is very poor and contributing to a dissipating and increasingly bleak workplace atmosphere and negative culture.

In his current role he is at a £32k salary and his job title is Senior Policy Officer. But the new role would just be Policy Officer and he was offered just the minimum of the wage range of £28k. I think this range caps at just under £30k before he would need to be bumped to a project manager level before proceeding higher. 

Another thing is this role was advertised as having the possibility of flexible working in our location of Current city vs. Hours-drive-away-city, which would require him to commute. However because my husband is disabled he employs assistants to enable him to work, and so commuting wouldn’t be possible with his PAs being based in the city we currently live — and firing his current three assistants for ones based in the other city is not on the table for him, But the offer and contract they’ve sent is saying his offices would be in the other city. The correspondence made no mention of the aforementioned flexible working stuff. Also, and my husband said this himself, that the daily commute there and back would be too physically exhausting for him. (They already know he is disabled, for the record. )

The pros of the new role versus his current position: Permanent contract, meaning his funding doesn’t go up in the air every three years as it does now. Also it comes with slightly better benefits in the way of pension and other schemes. Being a more permanent contract, he also ought to have more room for internal advancement as time goes on and he progresses in his work. He’s also said he knows most of the people in the department he was assigned to and has said they’re all very friendly and lovely people. But again, this is an office that’s an hour away. 

But my husband is also very soon to finish his PhD, and he’s worked for over 8 years now in policy and has built a lot of experience and skills as such. He mentioned how at the end of his interview one of the interviewers came out afterwards and complimented him on his presentation and even remarked that ‘with his experience he could be working as a project manager.’

So this brings us to where we are right now. We both pretty mich feel that the current offer and contract requirements sent to him is a bit of a step backwards, and right now he is wary. He’s responded to them presenting the issues between the office location and his disability so we’re waiting on a response. At this point in time we’ve agreed that the drop in salary is manageable, IF they were to allow him to work either out of our current city’s offices, or flexi-work between homeworking and either Current City or Other City offices. 

But it is still taking a hit for us all around and obviously we would much prefer them to match or at least come up closer to his current salary, because we are trying to save to start a family in 4-5 years, and this is a significant sum from that in the long run, at least until he were to get promoted/raise. I just hate the thought that if I were to get a job (which I’m currently seeking) the first £200 I earn per month would just be covering our deficit, and the rest is what I have left to pay bills and pay off my student loans and then put the rest into our family savings. And also the thought that if he gets a promotion it could just be taking him back up to where he’s at right now. Plus on top of it all the fact the cost of living has been rising here lately, inflation, etc. 

I guess I’m looking for any tips or advice I could pass on to my SO for negotiating the best deal from his potential new employer. He’s not often had to negotiate his salary or contract prior to this, and I can tell he’s a bit nervous. I’ve never had to negotiate a contract or salary either. But I know how bad he wants to move on from his current office and I don’t want him to unintentionally negotiate himself out of something that might suck for us for now but be better in the long run.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any tips.",04Sep2018,0

40,"Well, tomorrow is the big day, my FIRST day, of University. Everyone’s so proud of me, I’ll be the one of the first in my family to go, this is a big day.

Only, it’s not going to be. In late July, I received an email that my admission to University has been revoked. I don’t know why, I don’t really know how hard my grades dropped off, but I’m assuming at this rate, it was enough for them to take away my application all together. 

So, I’m here. I don’t even know what I’m going to do, I feel absolutely lost, I don’t know whether I can even fake going to University (is that even possible!?). At some point, I’m going to have to be honest with my parents, but I don’t even know what I’m going to say, or how they’re going to take it. 

But, it’s funny, even despite my admission being revoked, I feel like, maybe it’s a sign? I don’t know, I’m not super spiritual or anything, but I feel like maybe University isn’t my path. I mean, if you ask me, and I’ll be REALLY honest, if it were up to me, I wouldn’t be anywhere near a University. I’d be focusing on music (something I’m very passionate about), working my part-time job, and working hard to be successful at my passion. I was more or less  just going to go to University just to appease my dad (and my mom, kinda, she’s more understanding about that stuff). However, life is not fantasy, and I can’t expect anything. 

So Reddit, I need YOUR help, as pathetic as that sounds. What would YOU do in this situation, and how do I approach this and handle this in a smart, successful, and effective way? 

TL;DR University admission got revoked, parents think I’m going to university when I’m actually not, don’t know what to do ",04Sep2018,3

So I’ve been noticing how it kind of stinks like a dirty sock and the bottom of the cast is kind of dirty and worn where it touches the ground. So today she was out in the 90+ degree weather and sat in the hot sun with her little sister while her sister showed animals at the local fair. When she got home she wanted me to help clean off her toes because they were dusty and sweaty from the fair. And the foot portion of her cast stunk so bad that I was about to barf.

I haven’t told her because I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I do love her but it’s making me less attracted to her. I mean I see her as this pretty girl. She always smells and looks so pretty. Then this. I know she can’t really help it. I mean she can’t clean her leg or foot under the cast so it’s not really her fault. Still, even after the cast is gone, I’m afraid I’ll be less attracted to her.

So how can I last another two weeks. Should I tell her? How do I not let this make me less attracted to her for good?",04Sep2018,0
48,"I am a female college student who is currently a Computer Science Major. 

Earlier in my life I was diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression and I was going through High School quickly and without trouble, except in my Junior year I crashed with my depression. While I was on my way to graduating Valedictorian before, after my crash my academics have never been the same. I was pressured by my parents to do as well as I did earlier, and as a result I got into the bad habit of cheating on assignments. I found myself not able to focus in class, either. 

As a child I was never cooperative with the psychiatrist. I would downplay issues and make suggestions on my own diagnosis and never really opened up to them to which I majorly regret as now I have a diagnosis for Generalized Anxiety Disorder when I know for a fact that I should have gotten a diagnosis for Social Anxiety except I insisted my panic attacks were ""random"" and that ""I wasn't anxious around people or crowds at all"". 

After that year in high school things really started to go downhill and I know it. But the problem is, because I've been using artificial ways to keep my grades up, my parents haven't seemed to have noticed anything.

Fast forward to today, many, many years down the line. I've had this long-time creeping suspicion that I had ADHD but I never vocalized my concerns until a few days ago I brought it up with my parents. To my absolute shock my mother's response was: ""Well they did say you probably had ADHD/ADD"". I was so taken aback with that knowledge, especially knowing that I never actually shared concerns about my suspicion back when I was young but the psychiatrist picked up on something on their own. 

The problem is her justification for never telling me: ""I'm smart and It's never impacted my grades"". 

Given the above information, my concern should be obvious. I'm*actually* struggling big time in school right now because I'm getting to the level in my courses where cheating is NOT an option and despite my insistence that I'd like to go back and get that looked into deeper, I was blown off with the statement that ""It's not really a problem right now"" and she'd like to take care of my acne (which to me is super superficial) instead.

Learning that I had a basic diagnosis to work off of has already validated a lot in me after constantly beating myself up for not being able to keep up and always distracted and my parent's rerouting my constant forgetfulness to ""too many video games"". 

I'm over 18 at this point, what can I do? What would be the steps to reach out to someone on my own? How would I go about finding a professional? I am not fully financially independent and I'd still have to partially go through my parents for my health care information but I can try to support my own endeavors if need be. If I do have not-so-mild ADHD as I'm thinking I do, I want to see about get ting medicated so I can actually pay attention in my classes and try to take a hold of my future.

49,"Hi there, I live in australia and am on Youth Allowance, I also work around 8 hours a week at a part time job and casually for another.

I make enough from the part time job to cover what centrelink pays me to search for jobs. And my casual position would give me extra on top of that.

Because of the low hours and uncertain hours of the other job, centrelink still wants me to search for 20 jobs a month.

Last week they made me do an interview for a position I was told nothing about except that it was casual.
So I went in and when asked about my availability I was honest.
I work a few other jobs and as this position is casual I won't be available at all times.

I got a call today saying that not saying I was available full time may count as deliberately sabotaging the Interview which may result in my payments being cut.

At this point I'm considering cancelling my youth allowance and just going It alone.

I make more than they give me, and to keep up with what they want I'll have to search for 20 jobs a month and if I get offered a full time job no matter how bad I'll have to accept and quit my other two jobs, the casual one I won't want to because I really enjoy it.

I think it might be better to go on my own and search for full time employment at my own pace, without the stress of having to search for so many jobs a month.

For the most part, my neighbor is fine — no parties or anything like that, but there’s one thing he AND his partner constantly do that is driving me nuts — they always slam their front door shut super hard, when they leave and when they return. Every single time. Given we are next door neighbors, it literally shakes my apartment.

The most annoying part is that the door is not one of those that automatically locks — you need to lock it. So I don’t really understand why they need to let it slam. They need to lock it either way, so why not just close the door like a normal person?

I’m a pretty non-confrontational person,  and do not talk to this particular neighbor. I’ve never really been in a living situation where I actually feel the need to complain. What is the best way to handle a situation like this? My fear is that doing anything may just escalate it and make matters worse?

Up until recently her only regular interaction with friends was my personal friendgroup, getting together to play tabletop games and watch movies and the sort, but even after years of this and making friends with all of them she still believed herself to be an outsider.

Now that the group can't necessarily meet up as often due to the schoolyear starting up, she's feeling the burn of being lonely and ignoring the advice I've given her so far. Some context includes the fact that she is very severely depressed, anxious, and a slew of other impeding mental conditions that definitely get in the way of her self-image, and the fact that even our relationship started on her move, not mine. (She thinks that she has to be off in some way, that everyone must be actively hating her because nobody wants to go out of their way to befriend her)

It's hard to get through to her about it and we have discussions about it pretty often. She is going into this semester better than she did last year; she has a few friends online who may meet up with her on campus, she has a few groups and clubs that she wants to join, but I can feel the tremors of her insecurity getting in the way again. She hasn't had the opportunity to attend them yet but I fear that she might talk herself out of going, or let the budding friendships die out.

Is there something I can do? I feel like a big part of this is the harsh transition from High School, where everyone was friendly, to College, where not everyone is necessarily interested in getting to know their classmates. She is living on campus but she rarely meshes with her roommates, who are just usually opposite to herself and her interests. Her rebuttal to any of the advice I've tried to give her is that I simply don't understand her situation because I was very well liked in high school, which is not necessarily the case now, and so none of my advice is applicable.

Is this just something that she will have to figure out on my own, or do I need a new approach to helping her? Thus far I've just been encouraging her to attend social events to stay in contact with friends, but I don't feel like that's getting anywhere.

Thanks for any help.",04Sep2018,1
59,"Maybe I am lonely? I just feel like I’ve lost myself in my insecurities and anxiety. When I was younger I was always the first to talk to people and compliment others. Now, I can barely leave my house without having an absolute panic attack. I do what I have to of course, but it’s gotten so bad that I had to quit my job recently working as a CNA because I was having panic attacks. I’ve been trying to find a healthy outlet, but I battle anxiety every single day and my parents think that I am just being a drama queen. I don’t know. I guess I just want to know if anyone else experiences anxiety as I do....  does anyone know of ways to get over anxiety? Especially social anxiety? It’s so incredibly hard to talk to people.

60,"i'm a 15 year old female, and i am more mature for my age. the majority of my friends are all older than me, and a lot of them have started college or even have been in college for a year already. i'm still a sophomore in highschool. through my friend group, i've met a wonderful guy who just recently turned 19 two weeks ago. he's Christian and half Filipino, already two things i usually don't look for in a typical partner, and his age just adds to that list of things i don't look for. i never intended to want to be with him, ironically i thought he was gay when we first met. but over a span of several months, we've become closer and he's one of my closest friends. we hang out all the time and more recently we've been wanting to be in a more serious relationship. he's such a sweetheart and one of the most caring people i've ever met. but what's stopping us is the age difference. he's already admitted that he believes in abstentince and wants to wait til marriage for any kind of sexual activity, and i want the same, and i do trust him completely in keeping his word on that. so even though there shouldn't be any legal issues regarding our relationship, i can't help but to feel weird about being with someone so much older than me. In all honesty, it actually isn't weird for me, but it's the judgements of others that weird me out. i've met his family and they are all wonderful and caring people, and are okay with the idea of us being together. and my parents really like him and think he's a great guy, but want me to pursue with caution because of potential legal troubles. one person who hates me could very easily ruin his life by spreading any kind of lie about our relationship. he is a freshman in college now, so he's starting a whole different chapter of his life, all while i'm not even in my later years of high school. but again, the majority of my closest friends are older and are already in college or seniors in high school, so it's not that weird for me. he's admitted that it scares him a lot knowing that society will try to pin him as a pedophile or something of those regards when in reality we just make each other happy and want to be in a healthy and supportive relationship. i just want to hear some advice from people on here. i already know there will be comments saying i shouldn't be with him and i will take that with a grain of salt. hell, my grandma started dating my grandpa when she was 15 and he was 19 and about to turn 20, and are still very much in love, but that was the 60's and things were very different. i just want to hear people's opinions on my situation.

61,"So my friend(M) recently told me that he wouldn't talk to me anymore if I(M) didn't do some activity with him. He told me that I said that I would do it before and that if I go back on my word he will not talk to me at school anymore, or at all for that matter. I told him I wasn't going to do the activity because I simply didn't want to and it didn't interest me( I also don't remember ever promising to do this with him). So nonetheless he hasn't talked to me since even though I tried to text him earlier about something different to break the ice but he didn't respond then either. It's been two days and I haven't seen him face to face yet so who knows if he is joking or not but I really feel as if he is being elementary about all this(FYI we are both seniors in highschool). He has done this sort of thing before where he threatened to not talk to me anymore and I gave in thus doing what he wanted( another stupid thing I didn't want to do but whatever). I definitely wasn't gonna give in this time so here we are. I used to think of him as my best friend but I don't know what I think anymore. If he doesn't talk to me at school tomorrow I think I'll know my answer but I would really like some outside advice here. What should I do? ",04Sep2018,1
62,"Starting out, no I don’t use drugs other than occasionally pot. It’s been over 3 month since I’ve done that. 

Something has now happened 2 times that’s got me a little concerned. I was at work (I’m a cook) the other day and was holding a plate. Suddenly, to me, the size of the plate starting growing, it got heavier, I had to put it down it got so heavy to me. Before I snapped out of it it seemed to be nearly twice as big as it should have been. 

I figured I’ve been working too much, i work 2 jobs, shook it off. But it happened again today.  Does anyone know anything about something that could cause such a weird altering of perception out of the blue like that?",04Sep2018,2
63,"Within the past month, my baby cousins who are living in our basement, are being harassed by a 9-12 year old kid next door. 

In the first instance, my baby cousins were just playing outside, and this kid shows up and begins to throw rocks at them. Fortunately, my uncle quickly arrived and told the kid to leave them alone. However, this harassment is still continuing on a lesser level, since the kid shouts and stares at my baby cousins from inside his house. 

I don’t know if I’m overthinking, but I feel like this harassment is only going to get worse, and it is worrying me a lot. Additionally, it’s important to note that this kid is allowed to walk freely outside, which makes this situation even worse. 

Are there any measures that can be taken to help meditate these issues? Thank you.

65,"My sister-in-law always tries to offer her ""diagnosis"" about me and says I should go to therapy. I've had a drug and alcohol problem in the past, which is why she seems to try to analyze my behaviors or habits as signs that there is some issue about my unconscious self. The thing is, this is not always welcome. I consider this a boundary violation. The other day she tried telling me I had OCD (she claims evidence of this was my ""obsession"" with drugs and alcohol in the past, and my constant attempts to clean healthy, which I don't see how that means I have OCD to the point where I need help right now) and she would know because she's a therapist. And if I tried to say something, she may try to twist it around to put me in the wrong and her in the right, possibly employing my brother to advocate for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

How should one approach this? I love my sister-in-law, I know she cares about me, and I don't want to hurt her feelings. But I find it insulting and presumptuous that she feels she has the right to invalidate my knowledge of myself while claiming to know what's really going on without a sufficient investigation just because she's a therapist. I disagree with her and there is currently no behavior or habits of mine that are interfering with my life, my quality of life, or keeping me from being responsible for my life. She just views from afar and thinks this is enough evidence of my need for ""therapy"". How do I tell her to back off? Because I can see her trying to use mind games to try to make me doubt myself and think I'm the one who is wrong.",04Sep2018,3

67,"Hi! I’m currently a junior (high school) this year and I’ve been thinking about what I should do for a while. 

I work as a lifeguard, every Sunday for about 6-7 hours and so far I’ve worked every holiday as well. Since I don’t do full time my supervisor wants me doing all breaks too. Lifeguarding isn’t bad, the people there are decent and I’m happy with any money I do get. I get paid minimum wage, but I’m only saving money at this point for stuff I need in the future. 

I’m really concerned about my academics, I grew up in a family where my parents always drilled into me the importance of having a good education and getting grades high enough to help with student loans and etc. I’ve maintained a 4.0, but as a Junior I want a GPA higher than that, and I am dedicated to getting a good gpa and to be chosen as Valedictorian. 

I have a crap ton of homework, and usually I try to cram all of it into Saturday so Sunday can be stress free since I find it difficult to do homework while on the job. I wanted to start up a medical internship or start shadowing a doctor, since I want to pursue a medical career path, but my parents denied the possibility of it because of how much stuff I have on my plate currently.

I also do swim, I used to do 6 days a week but now my minimum is 3 days a week since I spend the time after school to study. I get out of school at 3, and practice ends at 6. 

I feel as if maybe cutting back on the guarding, I’d be able to take up an internship and be less stressed with everything. I’m kind of stuck, and I’m open to any new viewpoints that you guys may have! :)

70,"I use tinder casually. It’s normally for talking/meeting new people, i’m not much of a one night stand girl and i’m not really desperately looking for a relationship right now either. However, if one came to me, i’d go for it. I’m sort of just going with the flow. 

I matched with this guy, Myles, yesterday. We hit it off and we exchanged phone numbers and we have been texting all day yesterday and today. We have slowly gotten to know each other and he is adamant that we meet before he leaves and goes back home, which is Australia. 

He’s a very sweet guy, extremely respectful to a point where i’m sort of thrown off because i haven’t had a guy talk to me this way since freshman year of high school. He’s staying with one of his friends about 2 hours away from me and he wants me to come drive and meet him. I considered this, but i am unsure.

I’m not sure if i’m being paranoid or not (i have anxiety so i overthink everything, plus i’ve seen plenty of tv shows so i tend to mix it all up) but he seems way too keen on me for only being a day. He says things like how he wants to cuddle with me, fall asleep with me, kiss me. I am not a very lovey dovey girl but i do appreciate the affection like any other girl would. The first day we were texting (yesterday) he told me he wants me to drive to where he is and that he would even give me gas money, when i asked him why he wanted me to so badly he said “because you seem soooo nice”, then proceeded to tell me he doesn’t want this to sound like he wants to sleep with me, because he doesn’t, and that he just wants to be respectful. 

Today we chit chatted some more and i explained that wasn’t sure if i would be able to see him today because i had a lot of homework. He was okay with this and asked if i would be willing to come Wednesday after my classes and sleep over. I said i would have to think about it. 

He doesn’t say anything creepy or off-putting, but i just want to make sure i’m not being too impulsive or being stupid. He is super nice and we connect well honestly, i’m just thrown off that he is this into me after being 24 hours, or maybe i’m just damaged from past relationships, i don’t know.

71,"Sorry if this post gets long- I will add a tl;dr at the bottom!

I am a junior in college studying radiography. As a requirement for my degree, I am working (unpaid) at a hospital three days a week and going to my college campus two days a week for class. 

My dilemma is that I am not sure whether to commute or live on campus. My college campus is about 30 mins away from my house but a solid 45+ mins with highway traffic. The hospital that I will be doing clinical at is in the same city as my campus but again is about 45 mins from my house. Normally I would commute to save money, but the issue is that  I have to be at this hospital for 7am (meaning I would be waking up around 5am to get ready to leave for 6am). Similarly, my classes two days a week start at 8am which again means I have to wake up super early during the week. 

By living on campus, I would not have to wake up nearly as early and drive so far for these obligations. However, the cons of living on campus are that it’s about $10,000 more in tuition. I would also drive home every weekend anyways to see my family (living on campus has put on a strain on my relationship with my mom). 

If you were in this situation what would you do?

Tl;dr— college obligations have me waking up at ungodly hours as a commuter. Am considering living on campus. Not really happy with commuting or living. Which is the lesser of two evils??

Hi, so I guess a little bit about me first...I’m a 17 year old dude, I’m a senior in high school, I have a decent amount of friends and hobbies, but on top of this, I think I’m a socially introverted and awkward person. For about a year now, I’ve realized that I’ve gotten quieter as a person, that said I’ve never been known to be the loudest person but I’ve also never been someone who just sort of shuts off. I’m also sort of a lonely person I guess, I mean I have my group of friends, who I consider even family some of them, but other than that, I find myself alone a lot. I’ve had like 2 relationships, but none of them have lasted more than 3 months, they’ve never been too successful. I’ve tried the “hooking up” and fwb thing but that’s never worked too much, as I just make everything weird so much to the point where I feel like it turns the other person off.

Early December of last year I asked this guy out. This probably wasn't the best idea considering he ran an anime porn server on discord and asked my friend out a month prior (she said no.) Not to mention he was a senior in highschool meanwhile I was only a sophomore. But we had a great time. Our relationship was nothing but building each other up and laughing. We had a lot in common and even share similar career goals. It just felt perfect. But then we made some mistakes... pressure was put on our relationship. A lot of drama started all at once. This was 3 months into the relationship. Our relationship crumbled a week afterwards. On Valentine's day we spent the day together, laughed and things just felt like it was back to normal. I though we were gonna last. Later that night he broke up with me. I was crushed I mean jesus if he was going to do that then why give me a false sense of security..? Even though our relationship was fairly short this boy was my everything... I mean shit.. 

Anyway I was talking to one of my friends on snapchat about him in june and accidentally put a picture on my story that said ""Honestly, I miss him tho"" I was mortified but by the time I noticed it his friend had already messaged me asking if I was okay. I told the guy yes and he decided that he wanted to fix our relationship and at least try to make us friends. The guy sent me a message and all it said was"" I'm here"" but instead of being relieved I was mad. This guy crushed me. I mean he just suddenly decides that he doesn't want to be with me on Valentine's day, and did I mention that he broke up woth me through text? I couldn't believe the guy. I was still hurt. I asked him what he wanted and he said nothing. I didn't repond but he messaged me the next morning. I asked him why he even tried to talk to me again. He came up with ""making up with anyone he has wronged"" and I gave him a dismissive 'nice' and then I apologized because I mean I gave my heart to this guy, all I wanted was him. And yeah, our relationship was short but imo it doesn't matter how long you've known someone, what matters is your connection. 
We ended up being friends again and very quickly we got romantic, but in quote from him ""not in a relationship"" that lasted a week. I found out he was talking to another girl even though we agreed to be exclusive*.  The next day his friend texted me asking if I'd seen his story (bc he knew what was going on between us) and I said no. The guy had accidentally put a dick pic on his story that was ment for the girl. I'd given up on the guy by that point. But... its been 7 months since we broke up and I'm still hurting. I haven't been in a relationship since but he has... Is there something wrong with me? Why am I so hurt by this? Why do I care so much..... Like fuck man... I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to relationships...

80,"I don’t fully understand what exactly ADHD is, but I do know that it makes relaxing activities like watching a movie or necessary chores like grocery shopping really hard for my girlfriend. We recently moved in together, so these kinds of challenges have become much more pronounced; just as an example, it is now impossible for her and I to walk through Walmart without her having to touch *everything* — packaging, cups, rugs/mats, towels, the toys, and whatever random, textured item calls my girlfriend forth to run her fingers over it for a moment before I have to pull her aside to keep things moving. Most of the time, it’s actually kind of cute, but I know it stresses her out to get sidetracked so easily and there are moments where my patience runs thin. 

She has a fidget spinner and a fidget cube, but those things don’t really help and she rarely uses them unless she’s in the car. I know she likes slime, which is something she could play with while watching a movie, but it’s not something that can distract her when we’re out and about. She does take medicine for her ADHD, but not as regularly as she’s probably supposed to and due to her age, issues with insurance, her mom’s part in that, and covering the cost of a refill on her prescription are regular problems.

I'm trying to get this to him ASAP, so I'm hoping someone online will know what I'm looking for. he guy who hired me has kind of been bad at having/providing me with info on what exactly he needs, so I've been troubleshooting on the fly with this project. I already have the whole script done, I just need software with the following requirements:

\-Must be free, or free trial with no credit card info required

\-Will give me that specific timestamp format

\-I can upload the audio file I've been using

\-I can copy/paste the script itself and just punch in the new timestamps.

Any help on this would be appreciated so much. You have no idea. I really need this help quickly.",04Sep2018,1
90,"I’ve tried being a nice and pleasant person, one with good moral character and integrity and such, and I think I’m improving a lot compared to how I was a few months ago.

The issue is that I keep doing things that goes entirely against what I’m trying to do. Last week I lied to my friend about trying a game he recommended, and I almost got caught lying and I’m sure it would have sullied our friendship.

Another thing, I’m not sure if it’s relevant, is I keep procrastinating in my work, and it stresses everyone around me out and I hate it.

I’m also dealing with slight anger issues, and having more patience when waiting for something or doing something.

93,"My boyfriend and I have been togehter for a year and a half and love eachother very much. We have a very good sexual relationship and he says he is completely satisfied by our sex, however he brought up the idea of him being allowed to have sex with other women. He would not see the women outside of this and they wouldn't be friends or connected through work or school(he wouldn't being seeing these women outside of their arrangements. He would also set up meetings with them on specific dates that I would approve of and follow any other rules I may give him. 
After I reacted poorly to the initial request he dropped it saying he doesn't need it and would choose me over having this opportunity. We are eachothers only sexual partners and he just wants to explore and have experiences while he is young. The arrangement would end when we decide to get married or at any point I became uncomfortable with it.
He seems okay to drop this but I feel like it is something I want to give him, although I am worried of the jealously I may feel if I let him do this. He also says he woudknt allow me to have the Same freedom but it's not something I am interested in anyways. 
What should I do?
I want to make him happy, but I feel like he is able to let this go? 
Would it be too much for me to think of him with someone else?
How do i know if this is right for me?
I love him with everything and that is the only reason I am considering this. 
Again we have no issues in our sex life and his only reasoning is that he's only been with me and wants to have other experiences. Also that it's a commitment free opportunity that he feels good about.

94,"My moms an alcoholic, so the last few years have been rough. My mom and dad got a divorce at when I was maybe 5 or 6. I’m 13 now (almost 14), it’s the first time in years my dad has made an actual effort. He apologized a million times, and he try’s to get me at his house whenever it’s possible. I love my mom, don’t get me wrong. And I know she’s a good mom and that she would do anything for us but I’ve felt so lonely and unimportant at my house. About I million times a day the thought “no one cares about you” would repeat in my head. It was torture being there, the only living thing that cared about me there was my dog Peanut. I love him so much, he stopped me from cutting a few nights and when he’s around I don’t feel lonely. I feel like I have something that cares about me and needs me.

My dad figured out about the stuff that was happening at my house and he asked me to live with him and his fiancé Cheryl and there kids. I really really really want to. I feel safe there, and there is structure there and a normal schedule. I feel selfish for wanting to stay there, I know I’m gonna hurt my mom and my sister they probably hate me. Everyone keeps telling me “it’s ok to be selfish right now, be selfish” I don’t want to be selfish. I don’t want to hurt anyone, I could care less about what I want if someone I love is hurting.

My mom needs help and I know, so does my stepdad. Their marriage is toxic. I don’t know, I feel like I would say yes if I could bring peanut, but I can’t. And it sounds dumb and stupid to not live there because I can’t bring my dog they said they cant afford another dog in the house, but I can’t live with peanut. I don’t want to abandon him there, I know I can visit but it won’t be the same. I even cry when I’m away from him for more than 2 weeks. You probably think I’m crazy to be so attached to a dog but I love him and I don’t what to leave him. I’ve already had to say goodbye to one dog because I had to move I don’t wanna do it again.

96,"heads ups: I have the worst punctuation 

Backstory I guess, around this time last year I finally met this person I looked up to when I was 13-16 (they’re 4 years older than me) like this person really influenced who I am now, from what I listen to, to my humour, and my aesthetics. Anyways I had the chance to finally meet them outside of the internet and we hit it off so well. We instantly became really close friends and spent almost every day with each other. the first 4 months of our friendship were complete bliss and I don’t think I had ever been happier and had someone I got along with so well. Lately things just haven’t felt the same and I’m not sure what to do...

When we hangout they’d constantly be on their phone texting other people and snapchatting them to the point where I had to stop mid-sentence so they could send them a video. now this wouldn’t necessarily bother me except for the fact that they’ll go hours without replying to me and once they do they tell me “hey sorry I was with [insert person]” and it just hurts my feelings bc like why do they get your attention and I don’t, ya know?

We make plans to do things and then they turn around and do them with others, examples: go to see a movie, go kayaking, go to a nature preserve/park. We’ve made plans to see a handful of movies MONTHS in advance and then a week after it’s been out I ask “hey when did you want to see [insert movie?” and they’ll reply with “oh I already saw that with [insert name]” or I’ll tell them about a cool park we should visit then I find out they went by themselves/with someone else and they no longer have a desire to go with me bc they’ve already been. 

The worst is probably that 3 months ago I had a really bad episode, cut up my body and tried killing myself. I asked them to please be there for me bc I was afraid of what I’d do if I was left alone. They told  me “no” so they could hangout with a boy they met THREE fucking days before this happened. Then they fell asleep so they wouldn’t have to deal with talking to me (luckily I had another friend who stopped what they were doing with their boyfriend so they could be there for me)  later that night after they woke up they told me they’d stop by my house to smoke me out and they brought the boy they ignored me for with them. They made me sit in the backseat and the only thing they said to me was “so what’s wrong with you?” And before I could even reply they started having a conversation with each other about a fucking song that came on and completely ignored me. What really hurts about this is I’ve been there for them every time they’ve had a really bad episode. I’ve spent more night than I can count staying awake and crying bc I was scared they were going to do something bad, I’ve offered to drive to them, I’ve spent night talking them to sleep, I’ve offered money for professional help, I’ve dealt with videos and photos of them destroying their body and all I fucking got was ignored.

In regards to the little paragraph above they told me their reasoning was bc they don’t just drop who they’re hanging out with for someone else. They told me had they been hanging out with me and someone needed them they wouldn’t have stopped hanging out with me. This sadly isn’t true. We had just gotten to a park to sit by the lake one night, literally just stepped out the car, when they told me they got a text from someone saying they needed  this person ASAP and that they had to take me back home. Another example would be one day when they said they couldn’t leave their house bc their parents we’re complaining they weren’t spending enough time with their dogs. I said “okay that’s fine” and later that night I jokingly alluded to taking a lyft over to their house and we could just hangout there. They immediately told me no and that I need to turn around and that they’d pay of rt he ride. I kept the joke up. Eventually they told me they weren’t home, they were with a friend who really needed someone to talk to. Im not trying to say “oh they shouldn’t have been there for them if they weren’t there for me” I’m all about being there for your friends. I’m just (to this day) so hurt that they put everyone else above me and treated them better than they do me.

I’m not one to really care about money and people owing me bc I love to give, even if I don’t have it like that to do so I still do. Since our friendship last year I’ve spent close to a grand on this person. Between buying food, clothes, christmas and birthday presents. You know what I’ve gotten in return maybe $20 total. They didn’t get me anything for christmas nor my birthday, in fact I ended up drunkenly giving them $150 on MY birthday lol. Like I said I’m not one to really care about money or the price of things but it just kinda hurts to know I’ve given them so much with almost nothing in return. 

Yesterday they made a comment involving kayaking with some people and I replied “oh I wouldn’t know I’ve never been 🤠” followed by “we made plans and never did them” [note we made plans to go way way before they was even friends with these people so I’m a little upset they went through with them but never the ones with me] so after I made those remarks they gave me a pity invite and thought it’d be smooth to add that if I went it’d be cheaper for everyone....

that last paragraph is what really set it off for me. I’ve expressed my feelings multiple times to them now and every time I do they tell me they’ll try to change, never really give me an apology, just kind of makes it about themselves and end with “I’m try to be more thoughtful next time” but within a month they always go back to treating me borderline shit.

Now I’ve never really had many friends, or a best friend, I’ve always been more of a loner and kept to myself so I don’t know if this is normal for a friendship or if my expectations are too high bc I’ve looked up to them since I was 13 (I’m 19 now). I’ve had someone tell me that they’re toxic for me and that I should block them but I just can’t bring myself to do that, I love and care for this person so much and keep hoping they’ll change and treat me better but it seems they never do. I don’t know what to do. I’d love to hear others opinions on this.

I know i should find friends through interests such as biking, hiking, study groups, classes, ect. And not just randomly approach people on my colleges campus and ask them to be my friend.

But should it be the same for dating interests? It is always brutally awkward for anyone to walk up yo you and start a conversation. Not many people are good at that. And to me, a 5' 10"", nerdy, sort of overweight but not by much, partially deaf, 19 year old virgin does not seem attractive to people.

100,"I am a second year in High School. I thought it would be easy to make friends in High School, but I've yet to make a single good friend.

I have no family besides my mother, but she works non-stop and sleeps whenever she gets the chance, which is understandable given her hours each day. 

I'm quiet, but I know how to interact with other humans on a basic level. I admittedly have trouble starting conversations. Others never talk to me unless they have a question about class or something else. Past ""How was your day?"" or ""What did you do today?"", I have no idea what else to say and it's incredibly awkward.

I’m almost 18 and I’m in high school. I know there are people that have it way worse than I do. I don’t want to come off as spoiled or that I don’t appreciate the things I have. I just want to be honest on what’s going on in my life, and how I can make things better and hear advice from you all. Especially with moving out and just advice/ideas on what you planned on doing after high school. 

I want to be successful. I’m in cosmetology school, and I get my license once I graduate. I plan on going to dermatology school after high school after years of saving up from using my cosmetology license with makeup. Things may change. I’m open to trying other things. I’ve worked really hard to save up for classes. My parents have helped pay for some of it, mostly because I wouldn’t agree to studying any of the other programs that would be “better” for me. 

My parents are divorced. My dad and step mom are never satisfied with me. It hurts me because I feel like I work really hard. I have a 4.0. I work after school for 7 hours. I’m always tired. What am I doing wrong? I don’t feel like I can express myself around them. At all. If I mention anything about art or my passion for anything I’m interested in they shut it down and talk about what they think is right. My step mom does that most of the time. I really can’t stand her. She thinks I won’t get anywhere in life, and that my ideas are trash. I can’t let these things get to me, but sometimes they do and I really hate that they do. 

My mom supports me. We’ve always been really close. I love her and I support her. But I never really see her. She’s always working and she’s depressed all the time. She’s gotten skinner. Sometimes I really don’t feel like I can help her. 

My mom moved in with her boyfriend. I was helping them move last week. I really liked her boyfriend when I first met him. He helped my mom find a better job and he was always helping her with something she had going on with herself. He puts her in a good mood. 

I thought about moving in with them. My mom was really excited about it because she missed me. I’m always at my dads which is stressful. I’m not close to him and his wife is always trying to start some an argument with me, which he doesn’t even care about.

I can’t move in with my mom and her boyfriend though. I just can’t. I hate talking about this but I need to get this shit out because it’s been on my mind and it’s been causing me so much stress. Sometimes her boyfriend will put his hand on my back and one time he grabbed my ass. It’s weird because, he doesn’t act like or talk in any way sexual towards me. But when he walks past me or if he’s just standing next to me he’ll do that. I don’t understand it. I used to lie to myself and say it was an accident or try to ignore it. But I really can’t now because he does it a lot. And he will talk to me as if I’m his daughter which really makes me uncomfortable. He acts like we’re very close. He buys me very expensive things but they don’t mean anything to me if that makes sense. I can’t tell my mom because she really doesn’t have many people supporting her financially/emotionally and he’s her main support. I want to see my mom but I know if I do her boyfriend will most likely be there. I feel so confused. 

Sometimes I don’t feel comfortable anywhere. I feel like no one respects me sometimes. And the one person who does is someone I never even really see. I don’t have any close friends. I cut off a lot of my friends because of how much I’ve been working and sometimes I just don’t feel like talking to people. I like being by myself a lot. I know that’s unhealthy.  

My anxiety has gotten worse this year. I’m afraid of failure. I feel depressed too. I feel like I’ve been trapped. I feel like running away sometimes and doing what I love. I want to escape all the negativity. I know that isn’t realistic yet. I can’t wait for the day when I have my own place and I can set goals for myself and make my own money. I still have hope. It’s just really hard sometimes. There are nights when I cry a lot and I feel guilty for not talking to my mom. Or I feel guilty for not standing up for myself when her boyfriend would try to do something. I don’t know. I just wish things were going well. 

I know it’s not good to focus on the past. I try to focus as much as I can on the future and the present. I want to change things. I know it’s going to take a lot of work. I used to hate myself because I didn’t think I was smart or good enough. I used to hurt myself a lot. It’s not like that anymore. I really am happy with myself now. I just want things to change I guess.

103,"There's this guy that I work with, pretty cute guy actually, lol. I've been working at the same place he does for almost 5 months now, and he'd never really said anything to me, but he seems really quiet in general. Occasionally I'll catch him looking at me across the room. Now a few nights ago, I was working cleaning the glass on the front doors of the building (I'm a housekeeper there) so I had a clear view of out front. He was leaving for the night, and when he went out I noticed something seemed to have fallen from his pocket, so I ran out to see and it turned out to be a ten dollar bill. Of course I immediately called out to him and gave it back, and he said, ""Thanks, I really appreciate you.""

When I was thinking about it later, I thought it was a little strange for 2 reasons: #1, I've never, ever noticed him leave through the front doors, only through the kitchen (and coincidentally I've never been cleaning the front doors around the time he leaves, either). #2, and again this might just be me over thinking things, but it really stuck with me that he didn't say ""I appreciate *that* "" or ""I appreciate *it* "" which seems to be more common for people to say. He said, ""I appreciate *you*.""

104,"Okay so a little background... I've been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now. We're both 21. I just started nursing school and he works during the week. We used to live together a little over a year ago, but I moved back in with my parents while I'm in nursing school and he lives with his brother. Neither of us is really social, but he has a handful of friends and I don't have any friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything used to be great, but now not so much. We argue all the time now and it's progressively getting worse and worse. I'm almost positive that I don't want to leave him (sort of a codependency thing I guess) but I like to think it's just because I love him. I've been through so much with this guy I don't just want to give up on it all now. He's the only person I've ever been my true self around because I never really had friends growing up and I definitely don't now. Sometimes I feel like it'd be better to just give up on it but I just can't bring myself to. Personally, I feel like we're kinda at a standstill bc I always try to bring up a future and he just goes along with it and changes the subject really quick.  

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem: He's been lying to me a lot lately. For example, I told him I really didn't think he should be smoking weed anymore btw it's illegal where we live (we used to all the time but I quit because of school... but towards the end he started getting super freaked out, and the people he does it with have been caught by the police before, plus he just moved into a new place and his landlords live right next door) so he agreed that it wasn't a good idea and said he wouldn't do it, but he's going behind my back and doing it then lying about it. So naturally, I find out about it and get mad/upset (but who wouldn't tbh). I'm the type of person who would rather the person just own up to what they did rather than lie to me about it. But then he says it's my fault that he lies to me and that I'm keeping him from the only thing in life that he enjoys \[weed\]. I mean yeah I enjoyed it too, but life can go on without it. Then, he blames me for not being able to smoke anymore because I'm in school and that ""ruins all the fun we used to have"". Lately I've been trying to do ""fun"" things like getting drunk or even drink a little bit with him because it's the only intoxicating thing I can do anymore (not complaining, I'm totally proud to be in nursing school) and he won't do it, but he'll do it with his friends when I'm not around.   

He used to be really sweet to me all the time, but now it seems like he's only nice when he wants something. We used to go on dates, go to the movies, or just go into stores even if we didn't have money we'd just look around. Now all we do is sit at home all day. A lot of times I'll be doing schoolwork because it keeps me pretty busy and he'll play video games or something. Sometimes i'll take a break and try to talk to him but sometimes he won't even acknowledge that I'm speaking.  this weekend I had a holiday from school, so I thought we could go out to eat but he kept saying no to anything I wanted to do because ""there'd be too many people there"". I don't know if he's embarrassed of me or what. I ask him if he wants to go to a concert with me in a couple of months because I've never been to one and I even offered to buy him a ticket but he said no because he insists that I wouldn't like concerts. I'm almost positive that I have some sort of depression or mental illness but i've never been formally diagnosed. I cry super easy and I'm always searching for reassurance from him that he actually likes me. I get extremely bent out of shape when he threatens to break up with me (he never does) and he calls me a psychopath like all the time, at least 5 times everyday.

(it wasn't until about 2 weeks ago i found out why they broke up) he cheated on her with another women. so that summer i was certain she was done with him.. she literally said to me ""i have closed a chapter of my life"" while she went on break one day to official end it. so this was it! this was my chance!. we spent the summer flirting, hanging out outside of work. she stayed a night at my house after a crazy party. i was so happy, she seemed so happy. but right about when august hit she informed me that she was talking to her Ex and that they might be getting back together and eventually they did. but she wanted us to still be friends because i mean a lot to her. but i don't know. i'm trying so hard to be the good guy here but when i spend all day listening to her problems and helping her out only for her to hangout with her boyfriend at night, leaving me on read. it just really sucks. should i move on and forget her? or... i just really need some opinions on this. thanks you.",04Sep2018,2

The second one was okay and I had the passion to pursue my culinary dream, but the place was far away from my home, was expensive and my family isn't rich enough to put me in a dorm. Now, I'm in a shitty college trying out Radiologic Technology and I have never felt so repelled by education. It's the first time I'm actually failing a lot of classes. Since I'm a transfer student I don't know anyone, I tried talking to people but they aren't really as enjoyable as my friends. I've only made acquaintances.

To give you some background on me, I live a very sheltered and sedentary existence. When I'm not working I'm in my bed 24/7 on the computer I'm writing this from. While I don't like to blame others, my parents enable me to live this way and passively discourage me from branching out and becoming more independent unless they are holding my hand and taking baby steps with me. That's why I'm 23 and still living at home - I've allowed myself to get too comfortable and let my parents control me.

What I would like to do is to go on an adventure for 5 months - to know what it's like to be independent from my parents and become self-reliant. To go to places and have fun and have great experiences that I can possibly learn from. Then afterwards come back to go to school.

He’s also become really obsessed with it cause he got mad at his brother for accidentally tripping him while getting his phone (and he didn’t even really trip him) and causing him to loose a game.

First I would like to thank the creators of tinder because without them, none of us would be here. Also I want to point out how beautiful this all came together.(almost entirely done by the bride herself). To my surpise, planning for a wedding is no joke people. 

Chloe and I have been friends for 10 years and in the beginning we were inseperable. You would rarely see one of us without the other. Up until about 4 years ago I moved a thousand miles away. I wasnt sure what would happen to our friendship after that, but obviously it went pretty well because here i am. 

I want to keep this short and sweet, so most importantly I am so honored to be standing up here right next to my bestfriend on her big day. Chloe you look like a princess. I think its safe to say that you are not a friend anymore, you are a sister.

130,"Sorry for the lack of details in this post, I’m trying to conserve my anonymity.

I’m friends with an individual with some known mental health issues. I knew this before entering a long term friendship with them. As part of their mental health issues, they have episodes of explosive anger. When they’ve lashed out at me, they’ve always apologized, and I’ve forgiven them.

However, they recently told me of an episode when they became really upset with another individual, resulting in a verbal fight. My friend brought up things that where told to them in confidence by the other party, with the direct intent of hitting the other person where it hurts.  To my best understanding, they are showing no remorse. 

Upon knowing this, it really upsets me to know that they are willing to target a person’s weak point just in attempts to hurt them. Not only do I feel that what they brought up was inappropriate and cruel, it makes me wonder if they would be willing to do the same to me. 

I’ve been really wrestling with the idea of ending my friendship with this individual. While I can acknowledge that what they did is super morally incorrect in my opinion, I can’t help but feel like I’m being overly judgemental and sticking my nose where it doesn’t belong. It’s not as if they did that to me (yet). Additionally, since my friend suffers from mental health issues as it is, I don’t want to cause an extra stress or harm to their overall well-being. I’m not sure if it would be selfish for me to stop being friends with them, knowing that it may cause distress.

Thank you for your advice in advance. ",04Sep2018,2
131,"Flash back a little over 5 years ago...I had just graduated from college and a friend set me up with her dear friend. We went on a few dates and it was fun. I felt a physical attraction but no depth. After a date that I drove 45 mins to see him for literally 30 mins, he had to go to a friends birthday thing. I drove home from that date feeling like we had no future and went to hang out with a “friend” that ended up  sexually assaulting me that night. I texted this date saying I needed time to figure out life a little more but accidentally ghosted him when I met my now husband and started dating him.

I’ve always felt bad about how passively I
 handled that situation but lacked the strength to take care of things. I’m stronger than I’ve ever been and know I will probably see him next month for the friend that set us up’s wedding.

Thankfully, these 3 last months I’ve  been able to rekindle all the ones that were most sacred and important to me but with the most rewarding feeling of forgiveness from them to me. I wanted to kill myself this summer, I stole money and did a lot of things behind people’s backs. I know a birthday is a celebration for another year of being you, and although I’ve come a far way I don’t think I could’ve done it without them.

What are some ways to let people know that although it is my birthday, they’re part of the reason why I still stand strong? Is it clear on what I’m trying to do?

What do you guys think, are we just rly good friends, does she possibly want me to ask her out. maybe she kist doesnt like my friends, and most of her friends are in another homeroom. she laughs at all my jokes, calls me funny and shit. and we jokingly call each other 🅱️estie on snap. bois thanks for sitting through this cringe, what yall think?",04Sep2018,2
134,"I would call myself an exovert. In group settings I'm normally the first to talk, I make jokes, sometimes even of myself. I'm good at putting people into boxes. Friend box, coworker box, classmate box, etc, male or female doesn't matter. But if there is someone I find attractive and I haven't put them in the friendship box yet my brain goes dark. 



Example: I was hanging out with a friend a few weekends ago, he had new friend over. She was cool, she was cute but somehow got it in my head she was married so started putting her in the friend box, got her number, didn't think anything of it. I then find out she's actually single. We've texted someone and she still seems cool. We should be hanging out next weekend and this is where my brain messes up.



First it tells me all my flaws, I need to go to the gym more (started going 2 weeks ago), I'm short, I have a odd voice no one can find attractive. Then it tells me how wrong it is for me to think someone is cute. Just telling them they are attractive is going too far. Doing so shows them I think they are just an object, that I'm just a prevert. More so it's like I think the simple idea of me finding someone attractive is an insult to them and makes me a horrible person. 



I know this is not a good way to think about one's self but I want to try moving past it. Not just to have health relationships with others but to be happy with myself. I've been telling myself I deserve to be loved, so I ask if anyone else has any words of advice?",04Sep2018,1
135," Title says it all, but the problem is that he has had a girlfriend for the past 5 years and even though they broke up a month ago, they still live together. They've been on and off for a while and one day we got drunk and hooked up.

The problem is that they are still very much close. She shows up to our work place and waits for him during his break just to hang out. She calls him whenever he's out late because she's scared of being alone and even though they aren't together, she gets extremely jealous whenever he talks to other girls. The other day she saw some hickeys I gave him and from what I understand, their convo went something like this:

""What are those?""

""We're not fucking so it's not your business.""

So...I don't know what to do or how to feel. He's been walking me home and we have really great conversation and really great sex. He's been asking me our ""label"" and what we are and that we should hang out more outside of work, but I haven't said anything to any of that.

136,"Hi! I’m considering asking out an old ex friend on mine for coffee and i would love some advice

So for background- ex friend [M, 17] and I [F,17] have gone to school together our entire lives. Last summer, our casual school friendship turned into an out of school friendship. He asked me to hang out once during the summer and I agreed. After that, we continued to hang the entire summer which bled into our junior year of high school. We went to the movies, went on drives for hours, went to dinner, etc. During this time i had began to catch feelings for him and everyone at school seemed to think we should get together. Towards the end of our friendship he started hanging with a group of guys that weren’t very nice and started changing his personality. Eventually i told him I had feelings for him and he kinda cruelly rejected me, and ended our friendship. 

After this rejection, we talked a few months later and apologized for how things had happened. Recently, I went to a football game and i happened to stand next to him and we acknowledged each other but didn’t really speak. He has had two girlfriends since we were friends, but he isn’t dating anyone. For the past few weeks (before this event even happened) i had been thinking of him a lot and our friendship and how much it meant to me. 

I don’t know if i want to “ask him out” in a romantic sense, but at the minimum it would be in a friendly way. I figure if he doesn’t want to, i can’t change his mind, but it seems worth it to at least ask. He doesn’t hang with those guys who i felt were changing him and making him negative, and i would really like to maybe see us start hanging out again. I just don’t know how to approach it properly. Do i just ask? Lean into it? I would love to know how to navigate this in a non-pressured way. Thanks guys!!",04Sep2018,1

Examples: 1. She let my dog outside without asking me without a leash (dog is fine but it's like you don't do that shit)
2. She's very loud not only that but she's disrespectful about it I may be downstairs napping and she'll come down on her phone with it on speaker practically screaming and doesn't adjust her volume when she sees I'm napping. 
3. I will be watching tv she constantly asks questions and sometimes even watches videos on her phone loudly without earbuds and disrupts my tv. 
4. Feeds my dog stuff even when I tell her not she'll stop for a while then a week later continues (I told her to stop because once she made my dog choke on a a bone and watched her climb up the stairs didn't even help her up to get to me I had no idea this was happening)
5. She's Very nosey in general will be having a convo with mom or bf and she butts in. Or asks invasive questions

140,"So a little background I come from a very conservative Christian background. We typically date within our own community.

Anyways I had started talking to this girl a few months ago and it was great. We had serious conversations and our times together for the most part were wonderful but about one month into it she started talking about marriage and I wanted to slow things down some at the time cause I got a little nervous cause I barely knew this girl.

We kept talking and it eventually got to the point where we were messaging and hanging out together every day. At this point it was four-five months in. Until one day she went on a trip and stopped messaging me. I wasn’t sure what was going on so I gave her some space and eventually contacted her when I knew she was back I town the following week.

We sat down and she told me that her love for me just wasn’t growing and that she just didn’t see where we were going forward in as a future. Which was crazy to me because the last time we hung out it was talks about the future and talks about how much I meant to her, etc. For some other context purposes, at this point we weren’t an official couple but also had made it known to each other that we were not talking to other people. 

I take it like a champ, tell her that I had things planned for us (was going to ask her to go steady), tell her I had strong feelings for her, but understood and respected her decision and that I wished her the best and hoped that she found someone that gave her everything she wanted in life. She said the same to me except that she wished they weren’t as good as her. I’m not sure if that was a joke but whatever. It kinda stung.

She throws a small get together the next weekend, I was out of town on a camping trip with a few of my bros. And goes to tell one of my good friends about how she decided that we were just not working out and have stopped talking to each other. She also said things like how she knows I’m a catch and will get someone in no time but also that she knows that I was messaging other girls the whole time we were together (I was not)

Anyways I didn’t contact her and just tried my best to get over her, this was my first relationship so I’ve never had feelings like this for someone. About two-three weeks later I see that she’s posting pictures of her and a new guy on Snapchat. That really sucked.

I’m not sure how to get over this. It sucks cause she is part of the same large but small community. She is hanging out with this guy at community events that I feel like I can’t go to because it’s still too early for me to see them together. I’m not venting to my friends but will vent to family about it. Am hitting the gym, reading good books, and doing some light traveling.

It’s been about a month now and I just saw a picture of her with the guy on Instagram and the feelings all came back. Is this something that just gets better with time? I know we weren’t officially together, although she kept pressuring us to be, but do I have a right to be upset? I would never say anything but I kinda am and I’m unsure if I have a right to be.

141,"Ok I know what you probably want to answer; that no, of course not, you're not the only one, it's fine to start a little later. But I have a fairly large social circle of people around my age, give or take a few years, and I literally don't know a single other virgin. I've only told a few people, and they're usually shocked that I am, since I'm attractive enough with an decent personality. Usually when people bring up sex I just laugh and play along, and when people ask for specifics I just say I'm private when it comes to that sort of stuff, since they just assume ive of course had sex. Even my best friend who *was* a virgin, just got sick of it one day, downloaded grindr, and got it over with.  

I'm also a lesbian, which makes things more complicated. All my friends in high school (when we were all virgins with no experience) were lesbians but after going to uni, most of my friends are straight girls and gay guys, so I don't know how it works there, or if my future partner (who would presumably be a gay or bi woman around my age) would be weirded out by my lack of experience. Like, the only time I've kissed a girl is on stage for a play (and I got kissed by a guy when I was sexually assaulted but I don't count that) and that was over a year ago. I've had 0 romantic or sexual prospects, have always had 0, and will likely not have any for a while, since I'm out of school currently because my mental health is in the dumps and the only people I interact with are my family and doctors. I'm also not interested at all in casual sex or anything to get it over with like my friend did.

142,"I've always had this problem of complacency. It seems like I'll only ever take the best of the options given to me, without really fighting for more. This has worked alright for me so far--I have decent friends and a decent life--but the odd time I'll come across something or someone just outside my reach and I'm not sure how to make that extra push to achieve what I want.

More specifically, I don't have too much trouble attracting potential romantic partners, but it's never with anyone I'd really want to attract. And if I find someone whom I really want to attract, I don't know what to do besides the basics and hope they'll make some sort of obvious move on me or fall for me right away.

I'm a pretty ordinary (decent shape, friendly, reasonably attractive) mid 20s guy, and I'm just tired of feeling like I need to wait for someone I actually like a lot to finally fall into my lap.

These problems has made  me feel like nothing compared to other kids in my school. I've never really had good friends, like people who actually like having me around them. I get bullied basically everyday (not physically, just verbally), but I've gotten used to it. I mean, even if i talk to my parents or school counsellor,  it wont help me improve my life, because the only thing which they can really do is move to a new school (might as well stay in my current school because i only have a year left) because i will probably get bullied again. I try to stay away from the people who are annoying to me, but sometimes i just can't.  Sure, some people were nice to me when i talked to them, but I could tell from their expression that they didn't like having me around them. 

I guess  the only option for me now is to find friends outside of school, but i don't know if i should tell them about my personal problems.  Also, I've heard that girls are nicer than guys, and tbh, I've never had a conversation to a girl before, just because of what i look like, and I don't know how she will react when i tell her about my personal things.  Also because I go to a boys school.  Maybe i will try to find some friends in December summer holidays. I do talk to people online, on discord, but that not really having real friends. 

Recently I saw a movie which had this quote: If you want your life to be better, you have to force it to.

145,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

This post is regarding my sexual desires. Tl;dr at the bottom. 

I like myself. I feel really good about my life. But there is one secret I have held onto since I was little. I get off on forced-sex. In this world of fetish acceptance, maybe some understand, but I feel like a terrible person.

I actually remember how it started, no joke: When I was young, maybe around 12, I got this scene in my head of Misty, from Pokemon, being forced to run on a treadmill. The guy making her do it kept turning up the speed until she couldn't run anymore. She then falls into a puddle of mud behind her. 

Later I discovered forced comics. The first time I ejaculated was to one of these.

It has continued like this all my life, to the point where almost 100% of my fantasies involve forced sex. 

Every other aspect of my life is the antithesis. I try to live a moral life, and feel like I do. Morality is a big deal to me and many if my actions are guided by my values and beliefs. But when I am alone at night, in the dark depths of my mind, this is where I go do.

I have thought about it a lot throughout my life. I know this urge came from a precieved lack of control in my early life, and it has followed me here. I understand that feeling like I have power is at it's root. I don't feel out of control in my life any more, but this fetish is deeply engrained. 

I have this conflict, because although I feel bad about it, and it is something I don't want to be part of me, another part of my mind tells me that it is just a fetish and that there is nothing wrong. It doesn't seep into any other part of my life. It doesn't affect my relationships. I don't tell my partners about it. It just sits in a deep corner of my mind. 

So idk. How can I get rid of it? Need I get rid of it? 


Tl;dr: Attracted to forced sex. Makes me guilty. How do I stop? Should I stop? ",04Sep2018,1
146," I am by no means a ""special"" student, and I am completely aware that my teacher has no obligation to change her teaching styles for me, but I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and reduced to tears every single night. I am unsure if it's her workload, assigning only HW problems that don't offer answers in the back of the book, or both. 

I took basic/introductory chemistry five years ago. It was new to me then, and it's still kind of new to me now considering I was never really good at it and only retained the very basic principles. I am currently taking an introductory organic chemistry class which is already extremely challenging for me. We're going over the basics right now and I'm already drowning.

My teacher lectures at a very fast pace, assigns 20 homework questions PER chapter that will be graded when we turn it in for our exam. 20 homework questions doesn't seem like a lot until you see that they each take 5-10 minutes. On top of this we have weekly graded quizzes, and a project due at the end of the semester. 

In addition to reading the textbook thoroughly and studying her lecture notes, I spend about 2-3 hours average a night for this class. The main reason why I feel like I'm not gaining any confidence or traction is because she is only assigning homework problems that don't have answers to the back. She says ""Oh, just do the other ones and check your answers for those."" Does she really think I have even MORE time to do these homework assignments? I already spend a significant amount of time doing the ones that she wont grade. I feel like it's very juvenile for a professor to do this- I understand why you wouldn't want a middle or high school kid just copying the answers from the back, but this is college and I'm paying for it.m If I really wanted to do that it would be a complete disservice to myself and my ultimate grade and I feel like because I'm unable to check myself and correct my mistakes, I have no idea if I'm doing my work correctly or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to approach my teacher at her office hours? I'm awful at putting things into words and I really don't know how to voice this to her without sounding rude or demanding..

When I went for a jog earlier today, I saw them laying down in the middle of the street. I immediately picked them up and moved them to the spot where they usually hangout. After this I immediately knew I had to do something to save them. I truly believe if I hadn’t been there that they would’ve gotten ran over because it was dark outside. I want to take them somewhere where they could maybe be adopted but I know I don’t want to bring them to a shelter.

150,"I'll do my best to keep this short. I'd hate for this to become a long rambling post. I'll post the relevant info, and negate the details. If details are needed, I'll post them in the comment section if someone asks for them.

I broke up with my girlfriend about 5 years ago. She cheated on me during a drunk night out with her friends. We separated and haven't spoken since. From the outside, things seem fine. I have a great new job, I've been promoted, I got a new apartment downtown, I've become financially secure, and I've extensively traveled. But I know that inside I'm not ok. I haven't smiled since we broke up. You may think I am exaggerating, but I'm not. Nothing brings me joy anymore. Nothing. Everything feels like a job to me. Videogames don't excite me anymore. They arent fun to play.  The gym feels like I'm just adding another tedious labour to my already busy day. So I just half ass all my exercises. Even when I travel to beautiful exotic locations, all I can think of is ""I wish she was here to see this."" Even going out with my friends isn't fun anymore. I just quietly sit at our table while everyone plays pool, darts, or tries to flirt with girls. They try to include me in bar games, but I don't participate anymore. I have been on dates, and double dates, since the breakup, but it has never gone past the first date. Not because the girl would't want to see me again, but its just that ""I wasn't feeling it."" And that's the truth. I don't feel anything.

The crux of the situation is that despite my general  life situation being improved, I'm just severely disinterested in everything. I need some advice on how to break out of this rut.

Thanks.",04Sep2018,1

154,"Usually my roommate get along pretty perfectly. Every now and then there are some disagreements, but we usually can handle it pretty well. 

This weekend I hit my breaking point on a couple things. I'm going to start with Thursday, when he decided he HAD to go out to eat (instead of get groceries and eat for the week) get $50 worth of food and alcohol to himself even though he didn't even have enough to both leave an adequate tip (I'm a **server**, bro) and buy toilet paper (it was his turn). Then two nights later, he goes out with me and a bunch of friends, where I graciously bought him drinks. That was on me, if we're being honest. I told him to come and I told him i'd buy him a drink. But that night really took a turn for the worse. It was a pretty traumatic night for the both of us, but at least he got to black it out. The next day, I even bought him food because we have no groceries (wonder why) and he needed some fucking carbs, bro.

Anyway to the point, then after a long day of hangover, sleep and a belly full of Subway that I bought him, he comes out and asks me the question that just fills me with RAGE. ""Hey, so can I borrow like $10 to put in my car for gas so I can go to (a town 50 miles away) to hang out with my friends at the State Fair."" Am I his mom? Do I give him an allowance? 

Look, I can lend my friends and roommates some cash to get gas in order to go to work. I'll give you money for a sandwich so you're not starving and empty from a day of puking. I'll even pay for your drinks while I'm with you. But is it not too far to ask your friend for gas to hang out when you're not even invited? It is. I politely declined and quietly lost my shit.

The next day, as I was working out, he knocks on my door and asks me AGAIN for $10 for gas to go hang out with friends 50 miles away as if I didn't just tell him no yesterday. Like....dafuq? 

So here's where I need the advice. He's a really good roommate other than these few things. Rent is always paid. He always pays his bills...mostly on time. He's fairly clean, probably cleaner than I am. But I know I need to have a discussion about how he treats me like a mom/personal ATM. I just don't know how without him absolutely losing his shit and getting angry at himself. He has severe anxiety and while yes, I'm pretty angry, I don't want him to think he's a piece of shit friend for it. I just want to have a calm conversation with him about how he's crossing a line by asking me for money like that. Even if it would be paid back right away, it's principle. If you want to hang out with your friends the day before payday, you need to manage your money better. End of. I just want to figure out HOW to bring it up before he does it again or it's been so long that he's basically forgotten about it. ",04Sep2018,1

158,Here is a little back story.  They met a year ago through a dating app (yes while he was married) but he initially said he was single). They are both in Their later 20s and he was married in 2013. She found out he was married maybe a month into talking to him but continued the relationship. He would say he was unhappy and going to get a divorce (typical...). After about a year she keeps asking to define the relationship and he says he’s going to try and make it work with his wife so they can’t be together...right now.   She is convinced he’s this great guy and doesn’t want to tell the wife because that would hurt him.  I have been cheated on before and so I feel for the wife.  It’s pretty obvious the husband has done this before and will most likely do it again.  The friend seems to have no empathy for the wife in the situation.  I absolutely think she should know but it’s definitely not my place to expose the relationship. How can I help her see that at some point she should find a way to tell the wife?

159," 

Let’s start off with some background info. I am a 16 year old martial artist, teacher, voracious reader, highly philosophical, and someone wise beyond my years- if I do say myself.

I smoke pot with my friend(s) on occasion, but not to get wrecked or as high as possible, it just helps us connect and let us express ourselves better than we normally would. Sometimes we likely drink for the same reasons, we are very responsible and very well educated, and we know a lot about moderation and hold it in high regard... my friends are very high quality people and are mature to boot, the type of people you keep in contact with your entire life.

Here’s where it gets real, my brother has his own group of friends who are less educated, less quality, closer to an example of your typical teenage idiots. In general they can be decent humans, but they aren’t exactly a good influence on my brother who has always been a follower. Some of his friends are worse than previously described, they are somewhat crazy.

My good friend and myself to a lesser extent have befriended two of my brothers friend who are very nice and very high quality humans, and this friendship led to a hangout on the beach at night. A joint was passed around but my brother was unusually anti social, myself in this group meet is very reserved and observing of everyone else, but not exactly anti social as I would still interact. I have noticed this trend where my brother wonks out when I am with his friends, almost as if he is ashamed of what they stand for, and himself for being apart of it.

Seeing as I am his brother I want to look out for him, because I can see him starting to fall down a slippery slope. I know he’s tried worse things than marijuana and I don’t want it to continue, he’s a follower remember? When I am there he views me as dominant and I can tell by how he acts... and while this weakness irks me it’s better that he follows me rather than his imbecile friends. However when I am not there, he has no choice but to fall back into the loop of going along with friends, because I am not there to exert my presence.

I am worried about his future because I can see him changing for the worse. I can’t really talk to him about it because he lies and says that he’s not stupid enough to do anything more than weed, but I know that’s not the truth. I have decided to confront his friends about it but I need help in my approach. I am very physically intimidating so I can threaten and scare the shit out of them, but would like to know if there are better approaches. Should I leave a warning hanging in the air- leave the threat left unsaid? I could say “you’re not going to do something stupid like getting my brother involved with anything harmful right? It would be better for all parties involved if you filtered yourself around him a bit more”

I don’t know which method is more effective and my father isn't sure either, he said to try my best not to humiliate my brother or do anything drastic in less I know for sure that he is doing something very harmful. I have no qualms kicking his friends asses but I don’t want to make my brother hate me in less I need to, what do I do?",04Sep2018,0

I can get stuck in thought spirals involving a previous trauma. I can get very upset, and sometimes I have to stop five or six times to avoid crying. 

I know the answers: try and talk back to the voice, notice it, breathe (four in, four hold, four out), but it is a lot harder when you haven't slept.

This has become self destructive for me. I dont save properly and it's very embarrassing to talk about this with anyone. All that'll amount to is them looking down on me and telling me to stop, when I think this is more deeply rooted in a social disconnection and masturbation being my drug of choice.

171,"TL;DR: I am taking custody of my 17 year old niece and I want advice on how to best set her up for success.

My 17 year old niece reached out to me recently saying that she is suffering from severe depression stemming from a feeling of isolation and abandonment and has had thoughts of suicide.  

A little background on my niece’s situation:
Her mom (my older sister) had her when she was 17 years old and had raised her as a single-mom.  Her biological father has been non-existent in her life.  Her mom remarried and had three kids with another man but is now divorced with that man.  Her mom started dating again but her relationship with this new guy is abusive and she takes it out on my niece (lots of verbal and possible physical abuse that I won’t get into details about).  My sister recently had a close call with death as she had a miscarriage with this new guy that resulting in a lot of internal bleeding.  

I convinced my sister to give me legal guardianship of my niece so that I can remove her from the toxic environment that she is in and come live with my family (wife, a 15 month baby, and two dogs).  My wife and I both work full-time and I am active duty in the military.  My goal is to provide her emotional support and mentorship so that she is able to at least graduate from high school and figure out what she wants to do with her life.  My niece is currently in Minnesota and is coming back to Washington (state) on Wednesday with my wife.

My short term concerns are:
1. Registering her for school so she doesn’t miss too much class.  Classes start tomorrow.
2. Helping my niece adjust to a new environment.
3. Finalizing legal guardianship (I don’t know what this all entails)
4. Getting her medical and dental care set up.
5. Addressing her suicidal thoughts.

My long term concerns are:
1. Raising a teenage girl (I’ve never done this before).
2. Making her feel like part of the family.
3. Finding out what she’s interested in so I can guide her appropriately.

172,"I would have put “serious” because it really does affect me negatively. I over think so much to the point where I make myself mad at the situations that come to my mind. I guess you can say I make them real(?) I don’t know. This is getting out of hand though. I feel like it’s almost habitual and I really need help breaking the cycle. I’m always cooped up in the house and only work at night time on the weekends. I’m tired of letting my mind reel on into bullshit and I would REALLY appreciate some advice. Tonight, I let it get so bad to the point where I started crying???? Like?? That’s nutty to me. I do take birth control and I feel like it has definitely worsened my anxiety, but I would still like to know what you do to stop yourself from slipping into that mindset.

173,"My friend and I needed a third roommate for our beautiful apartment and after looking for a while we found B. She seemed pretty wonderful and we were really excited to have found someone to share our space with, however her behaviour became strange, and then a little insane. 

B and I moved into the apartment in May while my friend T was already living there. I was living at the apartment with them until the end of June, then I worked for two months in a town outside of my city so I wasn’t around at all besides day visits to run errands. Within that time B began to get frustrated with T about her being messy, and wrote her a letter stating that. T was upset because the letter was condescending and kind of mean (T read it to me and it was hurtful) and B stacked all of T’s things that were around the house outside her door. Her passive aggressive behaviour should have been a red flag but they seemed to sort the disagreement out so I thought things would be better when I returned to the apartment in September. I was wrong!! So wrong!!

A week into August she announces she is moving out and seeking a sublet for Sept 1st, so we have less than a month to find someone while I was out of town and T was working multiple jobs. We were shocked and confused because she seemed really invested in the place (wanted to paint her bedroom) and in building friendships with T and I. It was out of nowhere, there was no fight other than the disagreement she had with T but they talked and seemed to have made up! 

So the next few weeks we spent trying to find someone and meeting with people interested in the apartment, and finally two weeks ago we found a girl who seems really nice and low maintenance. Throughout this time B had been constantly trying to get T and I to sign a letter that would release her from the lease while we repeatedly told her that we weren’t comfortable signing it until we were confident we wouldn’t be responsible for her rent. So the new tenant got approved and is moving in in a few days.

So now I’m moved back into the apartment and T told me that B took a bunch of her things, some of my things, left a giant mold in the fridge that made it leak all over the kitchen floor, and hasn’t paid for internet or hydro from May until now. T is refusing to sign/hand in the letter releasing B from our lease until she returns these things and pays for her portion of internet and hydro. The value of the things she took and the bills left unpaid amount to about 1,000. She also did really petty things like left messes around the house and a broken glass in our sunroom on the floor. She put a cup full of crumbs in T’s bed and swept glass under my rug. 

B is out of town right now and I’m worried that when she comes back things are going to escalate. She never returned her keys so I want to get the locks changed so she can’t steal more things or do worse. Legally, where do I stand with this?? Can I change the locks?? She’s moved out completely but still on the lease, but T said she can’t come into the apartment but I don’t know if that’s true?? Advice on handling this and how to handle someone like her would be greatly appreciated!!!!",04Sep2018,2
174,"sooo basically, at my highschool, in 11th and 12th grade, you’re able to sign up to leave earlier than the usual time. me on the other hand didn’t see this option as i was in a rush, but my counseler had told me i must get my assistant principals approval before the end of this week.

anyways, i’m kinda anxious he’ll ask me why i want early dismissals (if you sign up on the paper they’ll immediately change your schedule) and i don’t know what to say, i kinda just want it to want it. BUT my friends and cousin told me to just say i’m looking for work and ask for my working papers while at it. this is also a good reason why because i honestly just really wanna make my own money.

178,"I’m a freshman in college and I recently started school. The whole “moving away from home” process made me realize that I’m never really going to live there again and that I’m going to have to take care of myself. I know that I can still visit during holidays and live at home during summers, but it’s like I can’t call it home anymore because after four years, I’ll have to get a job and make my own way in this world. I guess it’s just this very terrifying feeling of growing up, having responsibilities, and becoming a separate entity from my parents that I can’t seem to process. 

I know this isn’t near as serious as some of the other stories on here, but any advice on how to get myself past this bump? It’s not ruining my social life or anything, but I can’t help getting sad at night.

Idk, could it just be loneliness making me crave his company since I really have nothing else to think about? I'm not really sure what to do if that's the case.

181,"This girl and I met in a class over a college semester and instantly became friends over the funky conversation and a shared sense of humour. From the beginning I had a crush on her as a person. I grew to become pretty close to her as a friend as she had a long relationship with someone else. After a year of college we started to hang out more and I noticed I’d often hang out with her more than she’d hang out with her boyfriend and she’d introduce me as her best friend to others. 

I realized there was something wrong about my true feelings for her and I painfully watched her heart be elsewhere. This girl became vocal to me about how much her relationship meant to her, and only an idiot would try to break something special like that apart. I swallowed my pride and buried my feelings, and tried being the best possible friend I could. After a while of this I started distancing myself from her, until I eventually stopped talking to her for a really long time to avoid my listening to my heart. For the most part I had moved on and went though a few relationships myself before finding myself single again, present day. 

It was a long time until she contacted me this weekend and wanted to meet up, as old friends of course. In my head I said “what could go wrong” and went to have a good night out. We had a awesome time just like we used to and after quite a few drinks at a club she insisted that I should teach her how to slow dance, so I did. We slow danced to a collection of some of her favourite songs at her place, and I realized my that those old feelings I had for her really never went away. Realizing my feelings were wrong I went home after that and tried forgetting about her again. 

Now I’m trying to forget about her because I know I’m tired of thinking with my emotions. I just guess I really don’t know how to at this point b

190,"So basically I live at home with my mom, dad, brother and Grandma. Growing up, my brother, (let's call him Ray) bullied me physically and verbally. It would come to the point where he would bruise me and I needed to call my parents for help. But this wasn't any ordinary straight bullying. He would only do it when my parents were gone or at work, and he would manipulate an apology to where I was always the victim. He made me feel worthless and awful. Basically I started seeing a counselor last year and he diagnosed me with clinical depression, but my parents were having none of that. 

They made me stop seeing him after he said I should call the ER to prevent me from killing myself. I have had these sort of thoughts for several years now, but I feel that no one at home too me seriously, because it took them there and a half years of me asking to see a therapist for my mother to finally act on it. 

Basically in that ""golden period"" that my brother put me through was when both my parents were alcoholics. Ray would say shit like ""when you die I'm gonna party and shit on your grave"" actual quote

Keep in mind that Ray was like actually twice my height and four years older than me. My problem now is that my family had changed. My grandma stopped yelling, my parents stopped drinking, and my brother stopped with the abuse. So that means whenever I bring up something that I want to talk about ( I can't let things go unless they are discussed) they shit me out and say that I need to let things go ( but I can't)

I’m still new to the reddit world and I’m still trying to figure out how things work. 
But hear me out.

So I’m currently at a stage in my life where I am re-thinking my career choice. (Hope my story isn’t too boring) I’m currently studying Early Childhood Education. I’m almost done with my Associates Degree. I enjoy working with children! They are so adorable! It honestly feels like I’m going to working to play with children! But recently I been thinking that this career is suitable for me. I am a shy person. It takes me time to talk to the other teachers and parents.I don’t have enough confidence in myself. 

I told my bf that I don’t think I should continue with this career. Yes it’s something that I enjoy doing but I don’t see myself working in that field for a long time. So I have been thinking of what I should do next.

Recently there has been a small spark of interest. 

My bf moved back to Korea for his military service. Thankfully he only has to serve for a month and due 23 months of government work. (Due to medical problems) So I won’t be able to video call him for a month. Ever since he has left, I began making videos for him. I recorded myself every 3 days telling him what was I was doing for the day. Of course you can’t make a perfect video in one take. So I told myself I’ll just edit the video. I found a free app to edit videos. I opened the app to edit my first video. But wait, 

I don’t know how to edit videos and the app was very difficult to use since it didn’t come with instructions (although no one really reads  the instructions for anything..) so I began playing around with the app and I figured on what to do little by little. I realize that editing is kinda cool!! Honestly I would spend a whole day editing and not getting tired of it! 

So my question is 

Should I make this interest into a career?

198,"Hi Reddit,

So I need some advice. I met this guy in a class in the second semester of 9th grade (2012) and we fell out of contact for a while and we reconnected in 2015. We were friends for a while, but I quickly things weren't exactly working out between us, simply because we didn't connect and he kind of creeped me out. I didn't really want to tell him that because I didn't want to seem rude or anything, so I just sort of made our communications less frequent and eventually not at all. Eventually, in early 2016, I found a blog post he had written about me from while we were still friends and it mentioned him wanting to use me to get him a PlayStation 4. However, the way he phrased it made me unsure if he was being sarcastic or if he was serious. Seeing that as my 'out' for our friendship, I emailed him a fabricated/embellished email just to end things. I have felt guilty about it ever since. He never wrote back to it. Two and a half years have gone by, and I feel like I should issue an apology for it, regardless of whether or not he meant to use me. What do you think I should do? I live very close to him and run the risk of bumping into him, so I am worried he thinks I'm crazy after my BS email...I don't know how he took it. 

Any advice is welcome.

Thanks

Backstory:
I am what you most people would call a bully, I found it fun to pick on the class clown and I did terrible stuff to people when I was younger. Until I turned [14] and stopped. At that point I tried to be nicer to people, and started to act more mature.

""Why?"" You might be wondering. Well even bullies have friends that I enjoy being with and I didn't want to make them think any less about me. So I decided to try to change myself for the better.

Later now in my teenage years it feels like I just want to let off some steam, or at least be myself for a couple of minutes, so I was wondering if there was a subreddit or somewhere else I can be normal for once. 

It might be a bit hard to understand what I mean, but I want to try to stop pretending being nice somewhere. A bit more easily understood.

I am trying to better, even if that's not enough to forgive me for what I have done I still want to try to be better. So before you start typing away on your keyboard saying what a terrible person I am. I know very well myself, that I am not a saint.

My immediate family I feel are too close to the whole situation, my girlfriend has a good relationship with my parents and my brother and I don't know how that would effect their advice and ability to view the whole thing objectively.

I’ve always had a problem accepting potential mental issues with myself. Long story short, my mom has suffered and still deals with depression and anxiety and ocd and adhd and a slew of other issues (parents divorced at a young age). I’ve never wanted to accept I might deal with anxiety or depression, but as I’m getting older some of these feelings are just getting worse, and I’m worried.

My motivation is at an all time low. I’ve been wanting to go to the gym, got myself a membership finally, but am finding it difficult to go. The idea of going is appealing, I want to better myself and build my confidence in my physical appearance, but getting up and going is the hard part. But worse off is my eating. I need to gain weight, But even making myself a meal is hard. Genuinely taking care of myself eating wise is difficult, sometimes not even eating a full meal a day.

I just feel like I’m losing myself, my creativity was one of my personal favorite aspects about myself. I have so many plans and projects I want to start up, I have aspirations. But finding the motivation and energy for it is never there. I find myself sitting around doing nothing with my time.

I’m always judging myself. And I don’t mean out loud or to others or complaining, but in my mind and thoughts, I find a lot of the ways I go about social situations annoying, or the way I respond or act around others. I have great friends, amazing friends, and I’ve always been able to find my people. But I’m always criticizing myself, the things I say and how I act. 

I don’t want this to turn into a post looking for a pick me up or self loathing, I just need any and all advice on how to proceed forward. I just feel like somethings off. Some days I feel great, and so happy and lucky. And others I’m just down and “off”. Sometimes the weird feeling stretches last a few days, a week. I don’t know how to describe it. Thanks for the read, again any advice I’m thankful for, hopefully the read isn’t too jumbled, my minds kinda everywhere right now.",04Sep2018,2

207,"I am 23. I got into spirituality since last 4-5 years. I became a hardcore spiritual person to the point that I convinced myself that the world is all but a product of mind and we as a humans have something magical which will transcend us to the reality. I am on a dead end now. I've tried a ton of spiritual techniques, meditation, chantings, whatnot. It's a dead end, the mind doesn't stop wandering, you can't find the source thought, you go to sleep and the world disappears, again to be stuck with the same question next day. This took a huge toll on my life. I cut off from people and all kinds of roles. I neglected every aspect human experience, hoping to transcend/drop off ego. I now just want to get back to normal life. I want to make normal connections with people. Meanwhile I am still agnostic about the whole reality thing.

212,"I’m going to pretend I’m being very paranoid and that this is my anxiety getting the best of me, but let me tell you why this actually might be serious. (Please someone tell me it’s not?) I was reading about cancerous chemicals online and came across a chemical that said it can cause MS (multiple sclerosis). So I started googling and reading about this disease just because. As I was reading down the symptoms it started to become a little too close to home for me.  Ever since I can remember, once in a while out of nowhere, I will bend my neck the wrong way and will experience a sudden wave of a combination of tingles and shocks going through my head and down my neck. It almost feels as though a liquid is pouring down my head and spread all across the back of my head and neck. It usually only lasts a few seconds but it is painful and weird!!! I remember once when I was young I tried to explain this feeling to my dad and was like you have felt this before right? And he was like no that’s weird. And I never said anything about it again. But it continued to happen every once in a while and still does to this day. Well this is actually a very common symptom of MS and is usually the first one you get. My legs and arms become numb and tingly almost immediately when I put the slightest pressure on them. And I am experiencing tingles in my hands as I’m typing this. I’m only 19 and I’m genuinely terrified. This isn’t me being paranoid this is an actual fear of mine and always has been. My mother has MS and it has never crossed my mind that I may have it until now. But when I read down the list of symptoms why do I feel like I have it? I’m almost in denial because I feel like if I found out it is true and I do have it, that I would feel like life isn’t worth living anymore. I have watched my mom become a completely different person due to this disease and other factors. I need someone to talk to ",04Sep2018,1
213,I started keeping a journal in 2009 during my sophomore year in uni. My journals do not contain accounts of my daily life but they are more of a space where I vent my innermost thoughts and emotions. Almost ten years of journaling and I am now considering what to do with my journals? Should I just keep them? I have at least consumed 6-7 notebooks. So it does not seem to much of a burden to keep them in a box. But I have plans to move overseas next year and I don’t know if I should take them with me. I am thinking of burning them but it feels weird.

So after a week or so he starts to get comfortable being around us, which is where the trouble started.

# Things he has done

* Calls me anorexic (*I'm not*)
* Unrelenting mockery
* Constant rape jokes(*?*)
* Talks about killing Jews
* Called me a cringey poseur because I showed him pictures of my favourite cars (He's a huge car enthusiast)  ^((Just making conversation buddy) (It's the VW Beetle BTW))
* Takes advantage of my friend who has no backbone (*Not literally of course*)
* No respect for women (*Calls women sluts and whores*)
* Always stealing our stuff (*Gives it back eventually but still annoying as hell*)
* Makes us feel ashamed to be ourselves

I'd feel terrible to just tell him to F-Off because that's rude and he has no other ""friends"", and he sits next to us in all our classes so we can't sit anywhere else without him following us.

Well, I am an Excellence student, for this entire year my grades have been straight E but I can never understand the algebra part of math. I studied for it, it's not like I didn't even try or attempt it, I literally tried to attain as much knowledge before the mock exam as I could.

I got my results back today and it was a horrible, depressing, and sad NA. To get NA, you have to not know much - like seriously, most people can get a pass quite easily. Yes, there were other people who usually get M or E who said that algebra mock exam was hard but majority of them passed and I didn't. I just feel really upset about this and I feel really stupid. I do well in school and to get such a horrible grade is something that really upsets me especially since I tried to do the paper.

I knew after that exam that I did terribly but to not even pass? I didn't really believe it was THAT bad (you can still get marks if you get like a fraction of your working out correct).

I've offered that should I be damaging their livelihoods in anyway or inconveniencing them beyond their tolerance I'd be more than willing to sell what I can of my personal belongings and move out (hopefully to government housing) they never take me up on my offer and tell me not to worry about it.

236,"I was once on a summer holiday to Switzerland with my family, when I was 16. We were staying in a small town and one day I visited the swimming pool with my mum and little brother. I followed the normal routine of sunbathing and dipping in the pool occasionally to cool down. However an older woman that day, probably about 50, caught my eye that day - she was quite pretty and had a great body. Being a horny teenage virgin I have to admit that I was perving on her for ages, I moved so I was laying a bit behind her, so I could just stare at her whilst she was sunbathing. The fact that she took her bikini top off at one point to tan her back just got me even more worked up! Interestingly though we caught eyes a few times, and I guess she realised I was watching her a bit. I went into the pool when she had a dip and we caught eyes again and she gave me a little smile. Later on my brother asked me to come and play some games with him in the pool and as we walked past the woman she stopped me and asked me if I knew the way to a certain street - awkwardly I said that I was not from around here, apologised and went to the pool with my brother. 

I just found it slightly strange that she just lay there and decided to ask just this one 16 year old guy the directions to a street - I watched and she didn t ask anybody else, she just got up and left maybe half an hour later!

Last night though I heard a really loud scraping noise, so I figured hamster was doing something but I went doen to check, and she was asleep. There were pieces of wood chewed off from the door, so I know now we have something from outside doing it. Most likely a mouse, as a rat would be bigger and easier to catch or see even.

Still we have one of those traps where the animal gets stuck inside but not hurt, so we would release the little thing outside if we caught it. 

We ARE NOT going to hurt whatever it is, so if you’re about to suggest poisin or snappy traps, I politely ask you not bother typing it all out.

Still the humane trap hasn’t worked. The food has gone from inside it, but there’s no animal in there.

The gap in our front door is big enough for a small mouse to get in, but we’venever had one being this irritating before so have no idea really how to get it to leave.

241,"So my other friend made a post of this (many thanks to him much appreciated) but I thought I'd do another one just to get a better perspective on answers. Basically over the past few weeks my girlfriend has been acting a little strange to say the least.

She usually tells me everything she does and everything she plans to do with the day and week and sometimes month, not because we have just because she likes to keep me updated and talk to me about it. But lately she just hasn't been telling until very last minute, for example she had a change of her hours in work, and didn't tell me until the day the change came into effect, instead of when she found out, or another example was she went away for a day to do some gliding on the weekend and didn't tell me untill about 6 hours before she left for it (I'll go on about this later aswell)  She claims she told me about going away on the weekend ( but I usually remember something like that so I'm fairly certain she never) but didn't even try to say about the work change and how basically it's just her and the guy she liftshares with staying behind which to me seems odd, I know I'm inclined to get jealous but that just didn't add up for me personally. 

On the Saturday she went gliding she disappeared for a total of about 7 hours, I didn't mind too much at first as I know it can be busy gliding and I was in work until about 7 so I thought it's alright shell text me when I'm done or she's done, then I finished and she was no where, I thought she'd be well finished by now but maybe her phone was out of charge or she was busy it would be fine, it got to about 9pm and I was starting to get really worried like she's been in an accident or something, then she called me from her car, and she said that her phone had been out of charge and that was the first chance she got to phone or text me, so I thought oh okay fair enough then, until she told me she got home at 6 and she never text me or let me know anything because she was ""watching a film with a patents"" and I thought this was very odd because she had a charger next to her TV and if she was really rushed and felt as bad as she said she'd text me as soon as her phone had even some charge instead of waiting an extra 3-4 hours to let me know. 

She gets really defensive and is really mean sometimes aswell, like if I start getting a bit suspicious she'll say things like ""you should trust me you know it's fine"" and ""why do you need to know?"" Kind of thing, and if I tell her about my day she just drops and shuts off and goes really uninterested and starts going really mean saying things like ""that didn't need to be as long as it was"" and things like that, she also likes to go off with friends, particularly a group of guys, at less than a moment's notice and comes back late often as a result of this meaning we don't call or get very little time to call, she just say that she missed me and will make up for this but the time for making it up never comes, even when she has more than a chance she just doesn't and goes really off when I mention that... 

It's my first major relationship and it's long distance aswell, it's been about 15 months since we started dating and we knew each other a few years before that and I honestly loved her to pieces, I never want to lose her but if she's a ring this strange I can't keep going on because I'll go mental, I don't know how to approach this situation because there's no way I can see bringing it up without blindly accusing, soon don't know what to do and any help would be appreciated.

I don't think I want to be an engineer much any more I don't have the right mentality, and the jobs all seem uninteresting to me. I'd love to do something creative but have no marketable skills atm and don't have enough free time. 

Should i just appriciate what I've got or push harder for something better

248,"My uncle has a Neighbour who's very old and has dementia. She quite clearly can't look after herself. He quite often goes round and finds that the place is a mess where she physically can't clear up or even cook for herself. He ends up helping her, doing errands like food shopping, cooking meals, paying bills at the bank etc. but he's not getting any younger himself and is struggling to get things done in his own life.

&amp;#x200B;

He's taken her to the doctor to enquire about a more permanent solution like a carer or elderly home. However, the issue is, she doesn't admit she needs help and because she doesn't say that she needs help, the doctor won't give any help. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is now stuck with looking after her, despite her repeated tries to say she doesn't need it. In reality, if he didn't help for 2 weeks she'd almost certianly be found dead from a fall or lack or food and water.

249,"Hi so this is gonna take long to explain, 

I (F17) dont go out (clubbing,bars..) because of my anxiety and also because i dont like drinking drugs etc so its just not my crowd. My friends (all F17) know that about me and its nothing new since 3 years. They all generally understood it and then also the day after going out back in school would tell me all the interesting things that had happened and we would then continue to gossip. This way I never felt left out even when not going out and my friends and I always had a good time talking about it later. Our friendship group that consists of around 7 girls was always relatively equal with everyone being involved at the same amount. Now since summer break is over (since 3 weeks) Ive felt really left out especially during breaks and lunch because my friends started excluding me and just slowly almost ghosting me. If anything happened I was the last to find out and it takes me a long time until i figure it out because i need to ask like 5 times and 3 different people. If I ask a questions either im completely ignored, they just say whatever or its not important, or  wave me off.  That led to me never understanding or knowing any of the inside jokes stories or whatever because I never even figured out what it was all about. Whenever they would go dinner I would also not know about it and when I once confronted one of my friends for not inviting me she said well were going out after dinner so we thought you wouldn't want that. I dont go out - yes, But that doesn't mean I can't spend time with them before that. 

A year ago my boyfriend and I started dating and we spend much time together obviously and try to cherish all moments we can because we knew he was moving away soon for university. (He moved yesterday). My friends birthday was a couple days ago and, because I had earlier texted in our group chat that I feel ignored and left out sometimes they all started being very strange to me, I wasn't sure if I was invited and so texted said girl and asked if i was invited and if she wanted me to be there. She ignored me for 3 hours and then responded that she had reserved only for 7 people and no space for me. I replied to her thinking out loud saying that i think its shady after 14 years of friendship that she threw away and didn't invite me to her 18th birthday. When I brought up the weird vibe there was and everyone ignoring me she said I was always invited and just texted her too late. I asked if i was always invited then why when I asked to double check did she say she didn't reserve for me? It was 4 against one today at lunch and they were all shouting at me and completely ignoring or not taking my side into consideration. Basically they said it was my fault, i need to be the one to initiate not them, im doing everything wrong, they are perfect and its all me. When I brought specific examples because they said its not true, they kept saying why are you so obsessed with one specific event even though I was bringing multiple examples. They said yeah once wow but what about all the other times? Why do you blow up one event so much? Again - I had multiple examples.

 They also brought as an example that I had ignored them the whole week before when really I was home sick for 2 days, one lunch missed for a school club one lunch I was feeling anxious and when home and one lunch they were all in an area that I felt anxious in and so stayed inside but let them know of that in the group chat. They said its my fault and i should've talked to them even though I wasn't free for 4 lunches and one lunch had anxiety and my friends didn't care and stayed outside. I told them that and they said you should've still talked to us. I did text in the group chat but they all told me talk IN PERSON. But that again I could not do because I was not around for lunch. I understand that it was my side that was absent during lunches last week for different reasons but they should not say I was ignoring them and then in turn start being rude to me. 

Its hard to explain but its very obvious that they're all talking shit behind my back about me and made the two people i was all good with turn against me. They ignored me and avoided me in school. I wasn't invited to the 18th birthday and we just dont talk anymore. 

These people are my friends and I enjoyed the close and good times we had together but lately they started excluding me and I felt almost a little bullied by them. I dont want to be in a fighting mode with them and I dont want there to be drama or tension. I can't talk to them because it always just turns into a big fight and doesn't get any better. 

Does anyone have advice as to what to do? Also Ive felt this way before and brought it up and they just kinda ignored me and so please dont tell me to just let go of my point and just move on. I genuinely feel unwelcome and do not want to feel like this for the rest of the school year. 

I know its confusing and long and probably sounds like stupid drama but its really bothering and hurting  me and I am at loss with what to do. ",04Sep2018,3

251,"I can't think of a better way to phrase the question because I'm tired, stressed out, and extremely pregnant.

Anyway, what started this was:

Sunday I left my bank card at home by accident, roommate spots me $40 for groceries.

Monday (labor day and the day that banks are annoyingly ALL CLOSED along with a lot of other places) I am supposed to pay her back but find out something happened with the credit card machine at a sketchy gas station and I'm locked out of my card. I will have to wait until Tuesday (today) to call and have my card unlocked and pull out the money I owe her.

I tried to explain this to her and got the nastiest ""fix it"" and evil look roommate could come up with. 

My fiance (M/24 who also lives here and has been 'best friends' with roommate for around 10 years) stands up for me and says she doesn't need to act like that.

She accuses him of 'stealing the food out of her children's mouths'. (Here is a good place to note that she literally scraps all extra cash together for alcohol and had no plans on getting her own groceries within the next couple of days). 

They get into a screaming match, and because she sublets a room in her house to us, gives us our 30 day notice to move out. 

Her exact words on that were: ""I don't care if that bitch (referring to pregnant ol me) has a foot coming out of her pussy, you guys are out in 30 days."" 

I've also for the last month spent over $200 specifically buying her children food and supplying her with 52 hours a week of free childcare. 

After this screaming match starts coming to an end, she threw a cup of juice at fiance that completely missed, covered me and my bed, and destroyed some of my belongings.

I'm so stressed on trying to find a new place to live in the next 30 days while about to pop out a baby. I have no where to go or no one to stay with in the meanwhile, so I'm stuck in this house with someone who attacked me and evicted me because she doesn't know what patience is.

In August, we fundraised specifically to help offset the costs of buying a new property and moving everything over. Well, we never moved and aren’t moving (at least to this new location). The fundraiser was specifically for moving to Location A. Come to find out, we never legally had Location A, so the owner of Location A accepted another offer because we never made an official offer or something. I feel awful that I took money from people under the premise that we would be moving to Location A, which is much closer to all the people that donated under me. I feel scammed or something. 
I’ve asked probably 10 different times what the plan is in regards to moving, but I haven’t heard anything concrete. In fact, I only know about the not-moving situation through the grape vine. 
What should I do? I was thinking about FaceBook messaging my friends who donated and telling them what I know and that I am upset, but I don’t really know anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm someone who holds myself to a pretty high social standard. I call people if they need help, I make plans and I reach out to them if they are lost, I make sure I always show up to other people's events on time, and I never never never (unless it's an extreme emergency) cancel on others.

​

Other people are not so considerate. Often people are late to hangouts, cancel last second to plans, or don't even pick up the phone. I wouldn't consider cutting out these people because I'd say that 99% of people are like this :( Even my clients.

My question to you is should I just stop EXPECTING people to have social manners? I think a lot of my annoyance just comes from me expecting people to have the same social standard that I do.

283,"First time poster, I need some advice as to how to deal with my mother and if anyone can relate (long post, sorry). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28F married and living in the same house as my parents (living in a country where it is normal for two generations to live together), although we live in separate floors (if possibly I will move out but the finances and the work we put in the house does not allow it for now). 

&amp;#x200B;

Well my mother and father both love me, they have always supported me, took care of me when I was sick, were proud when I did good in school. I can come to them with any problem I have (marriage, school, friends) and they will try to help me and they are understanding. But if I have a problem connected to them, their behaviour or anything related to them they get offended immediately, go away, give me the silent treatment (my father to the point of I do not exist) or they get upset and cry and make me feel guilty. They say things like: ""We do things we do because we love you, You are mean to us..."". So I can never talk to them if something bothers me. 

Another one is my mother sometimes is quite rude and mean, for example: I am talking with my family and jokingly saying that I gained some weight, the others say no, it does not show, and she says ""Oh don't you see how fat she is?"" And I am like what? And she says it in such a mean way and she is laughing (I know it is not a joke, she is very passive agressive also a lot). If I confront her she says she was just joking and that I take everything too seriously. At my wedding she asked me: ""Do I have to be nice and not make fun of you today since it is your wedding?""

Another is the guilt-tripping. For example, I have been abroad, bought some clothes and showed them to her. Her response: ""Well I would have wanted to have that, why didn't you buy it for me?"". Or I made some food and didn't give it to her to try it (remember we live in a separate household) and she says: ""Well why didn't you give me to try it?"". 

Does not respect privacy, comes to look thorugh the window of the bedroom randomly and get offended when I tell her it is inappropriate. Generally, she treats me like I am still a child. 

Now, today she made me so mad. We have a family cat, have had it for 17 years that lives with them because she has always lived there and does not want to live with me. They have been gone since 9AM to 4PM god knows where (they have to go outside every single day for many hours and most of the time they spent them at the casino) and they have not fed the cat since yesterday at 11PM (and I know she does not care about the cat since she complains about it to me often but I do buy the food and stuff for her). I go and give her food and call her asking where she is and she says: ""Well I am sorry, I had a mammography."" I reply: ""Well ok but you could have told me to feed the cat"". Now I feel like a piece of s\*\*t because I did not know she had a mammography, because I am a bit of a hypochondriac and worry a lot. On the other hand, I know she was not there the whole day because she was definitely at the casino. And this is another example of how I hate that she has to tell me all the medical problems and stuff and I know she should but every detail? She does not talk to my father at all. I have always been the ""partner"" in the relationship and I know it is wrong (all problems witht he family, health, relationship with my dad).

However, I feel like this job never matches with myself. For the four years in the university, it had been my life goal to break through the “teacherness”, that means regarding how a good teacher looks like. Maybe the environment here is more conservative than you imagine. It is a huge problem for a teacher if she is open-minded for LGBTQ, if she defines herself as a feminist, if she has a tattoo, and if she has bright-colored hair. Everything would be criticized by the school parents. Even I’ve heard a teacher got complained from a pupil’s parent because she were wearing a short skirt after school.
Somehow it’s reasonable because they expect teachers to be role-models for growing kids. But if I do my best in school, why should I be controlled outside the school? Already got a tattoo hidden by clothes, planning to get one more in few years. So open-minded to sexuality itself. And I define myself as a bisexual feminist. I feel like I will never mingle in that society.

The problems I'm having is dealing with family members. At this point she's only awake maybe 3 hours a day and every single bit of that is usually spent with family members who disrespect our wishes to enter the house quietly and insist on waking everybody in the house up when they arrive. She's had trouble sleeping over the past week or so and it seems that certain visitors always arrive when she seems to start a peaceful sleep, not to mention that they always manage to wake up my dad who tries to sleep during the day so he can watch over her at night. We've tried explaining this nicely but tensions are just kind of high and basically everybody that visits leaves incredibly upset. We've even had to turn people away because of how loud they're being or because my mom doesn't really know them or for some other reason, it's kind of making me angry that people seem so judgmental over how we're handling such an impossibly shitty situation. I've also started feeling bad about how I'm dealing with the situation because sometimes I just hope she'll die soon, every time she starts to wake up part of me gets frustrated because every simple thing she wants help with is an entire ordeal because of how weak she is.

294,"Hey guys, sorry if this post is a bit jumbled. Feel like I haven't put all my thoughts together yet but I really want advice on how to handle this situation, or if I should just leave it alone.

&amp;#x200B;

For simplicity's sake, I'll just refer to my friend as ""Becca."" 

&amp;#x200B;

So Becca and I both met at the community college in town. I'm currently still going there, but her mom just forced her to transfer to the four-year university nearby because she didn't want Becca to be in community college for any longer than two years (even though it really takes about two-and-a-half years of full time school to get core classes out of the way for most programs, but I digress.)

&amp;#x200B;

Becca has been passionate about music since middle school, but grew up poor so only ever had access to whatever her school music programs had to offer. She told me she was going to enter the music program at the four-year uni; I was a little worried about whether or not she had enough experience to succeed, but still supported her. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, we were talking about classes the other day, and Becca started complaining about a creative writing course she has. This immediately confused me, so I asked why she was taking a creative writing course if her major was music? Apparently, she hadn't been accepted into the music program and hadn't said anything to me. Her new major is creative writing, which is a subject I have NEVER heard her talk about in the \~2 years I've known her. I asked her why she was in this program, and she said ""because it's the only thing I qualify for."" 

&amp;#x200B;

We went back and forth, I told her that taking prerequisites for other programs wouldn't be the end of the world, and told her that she didn't even HAVE to be in school. She wasn't having any of it though, and kept coming up with half-baked excuses as to why she needed to stick in this program. When I asked her what experience she had with creative writing, she said that she'd ""sorta published a few things in the past."" I didn't even have to ask to know she was referring to fanfiction posted on wattpad back in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've heard enough stories from others that I already have a good idea on how this is going to end. She's going to come out of this program with crippling amounts of debt to pay back as well as a degree that is going to be very hard to use. I don't see this playing out well. Her parents are putting it in her head that she NEEDS to be in college RIGHT NOW, and she doesn't have enough real-world experience to see how flawed that way of thinking is. Are there any resources that I could point her towards? She's mentioned the military in the past which I thought was a great idea, but she had since closed herself off to that idea too. Talking about it face-to-face isn't an option because she becomes extremely defensive, but I just don't want her to make a mistake that could potentially stall her for years to come.

I recently just started as a freshman at a new highschool. I don't know anyone and I've been working on making friends. I have really bad trust issues and have never really had too many friends because of it. I usually only have 1 good friend at a time, maybe 2.

297,"I'm dealing with some stuff and would like to share my story. Just posting this might help. 

My childhood was somewhat rough - my dad was an addict, my mom is a pathological liar, I got bullied at school and my grandmother was an abusive bitch. I still have nightmares of P.E class, but I don't think my childhood affected me that much.
None the less, at 17 I had life pretty much figured out. I had a scholarship in a top university, a loving boyfriend and a nice group of friends. I was also becoming slightly less ugly and chubby. I had a friendly job at a bar and a roof over my head.
But everything started to crumble when my dad got injured. I applied for a full time job to support our family. The only vacancy I found that was compatible with my academic schedule was at a contact centre. I hated every hour of it. Between the 7 hours of classes, 8 hours of work and 2 hours of commute to university, plus assignments, I was sleeping around 4 hours a night. I also would have only one meal, has we were very short on money.
My grades droped and I lost my scholarship. After an argument about finances, my mother told me to move out. She believed I was lying about how much money I was earning. I also found that she was stealing money from me and selling my stuff.

I found another job and moved in with my boyfriend to a cozy studio apartment. 
Meanwhile, I had lost contact with most of my friends. I wasn't very good at managing my routine with my social life.

I wasn't eligible for a loan, so I worked for two years to save up some money and pay for my degree.
When I was finally able to returned to university, I started working on my dissertation. I was presented with an investigation position. However, my adviser had some family issues and ghosted me middle semester. I was also very uncomfortable with my older colleagues, who would sometimes harass me. I gradually lost interest in the field I was researching. This lead me to quit the project and university all together. 
Meanwhile, the company I was working for closed doors.
So I tried to find another job... It's been a couple of months and I'm still unemployed.
I have not been very active in searching, I'll admit. My relationship is suffering as well. My boyfriend is (rightfully so) feed up with the current situation. For the first time in 6 years an argument got physical. I don't blame him though.

I have lost all hope in the future.

I studied engineering for 5 years, but have no degree. My parents hate me and only call me when in need of money.
I'm not particularly good at anything. I currently am living at the expenses of my SO and I feel very guilty. If I was gone he would be very well of, and because of my failures we live in a very tight budget. I don't know what to with my life, there's nothing I enjoy doing. I don't know what career path to follow. I used to be the honours student and now feel dumb as a rock. I don't have a penny in my bank account.

313,"So I am a 21 year old male. I think I am alright looking and I dress really nice. However, girls never really take a romantic interest in me. I have plenty of female friends that really enjoy hanging out with me, but none ever even look at me as someone they'd want to date. I'm always the ""brother"" or whatever. 

So recently I realized that I was going about getting into a relationship the wrong way. I kept trying to take the ""movie approach"" where I would befriend girls that I was attracted to, suppress my feelings for a long time and then reveal them only to be crushed when they are not reciprocated.

After looking at myself more (I've been single since I started college and I am in my Senior year now so I've had plenty of time to get to know myself). I realized also that many times I fall in love due to desperation. Don't get me wrong I pride myself on never settling if a girl does not have the qualities I look for, but 90% of the time there aren't any girls that take an interest in me anyway. I've noticed that every cute girl that shows me the least bit of interest has me hoping that there's more there. I know this is not healthy and I want to improve this. 

Right now I am in a specific situation where I am really fighting to do better in this department. I met this girl this past summer in a class I was taking and I think she's really cool. I thought she was cute when I first met her and decided to try and be friends with her. (mistake I've been making: see cute girl, try to be friends, see where it goes). It turned out that we have a good amount in common and we think the same on a lot of things. For example, both of us like vinyl and we've talked a little about politics as well. 

However, there's something different about this situation. I catch myself thinking about her a lot, but I also catch myself talking myself out of being with her. Part of it is due to my past realizations, but there is also a lack of chemistry and compatibility I feel. I've always thought she was cute, but she has more of a ""tomboy"" style that doesn't really attract me in the dating department. She's pretty outdoorsy (hiking and stuff) and that's not my forte for the most part. Also even though we both like vinyl I'm passionate about music and listen to all different types of stuff but she has a little ""pocket"" she stays in and is less passionate about it. 

The problem is that even though we don't mesh relationship wise I constantly have to tell myself not to think about her so much. We are supposed to hang out this week and I was planning to cook for her at my apt, maybe play video games, and watch movies with her, which is totally relationship stuff, but I know that I shouldn't do this for my sake cause I'm pretty sure she doesn't see me in the way that I would be portraying by cooking for her and everything. Plus, *I* don't even think I like her in the way I am trying to take the relationship because of the stuff I said previously about her style. We have enough in common to be good friends but she's not what I'm looking for in a romantic relationship. 

Long story short I have a lot of mixed emotions right now and I need to know what to do to work through them and not suppress them.

Throwaway because my ex (34M) knows my (30F) regular username. (Side note: I didn't tell it to him. He figured it out by cruising a subreddit he assumed I frequented.)

​

Backstory:

I dated my ex for \~9 months, and we broke up in early 2016. It was becoming clear that he wanted more from me and the relationship than I wanted, so I ended things. Since then, he has occasionally sent me small gifts, like cookies or a book, to my office (I moved last year and he doesn't know my new home address).

For a while after we broke up and I had blocked his number due to him being verbally abusive post-breakup (example: calling me a slut). After he started sending things to my office, I unblocked his number in case he sent any weird or threatening messages. Over the last 18 months or so, he's sent me intermittent messages that alternate between variations of ""I love/miss you"" to random topical/pop culture things to ""You're a piece of shit/garbage excuse for a human being."" I have only responded to one of the ""garbage"" type texts once, to tell him to leave me the fuck alone.

My ex has also been suicidal over the last couple of years. He's been texting me more frequently over the last couple of months, claiming that he's in therapy (which he has been off and on for years), and has quit drinking. I haven't been responding.

​

Present concern:

I just received another package that was three boxes nested inside each other with nothing but packing peanuts inside—a prank. There is no sender name, but the address belongs to the same company that sends dick-shaped gummy bears anonymously through the mail (ha!). I am 99.99% certain my ex sent it, as I can't think of anyone else I know who would do something like that, and he's the only person who has ever sent anything to my office.

I'm very uncomfortable with him sending things to my office, especially if it's prank stuff, which feels like a possible escalation.

I don't know what to do. I don't think it's in any way illegal or stalkery to the point of involving the police. My instinct is to confront him and tell him to knock it the fuck off, but I worry that's unwise.

322,"So I need some opinions here...

I'm worried about an online friend that recently stopped messaging me. We're fairly close and usually talk daily, but I haven't heard from them since Tuesday of last week. I kinda wondered if I was being ghosted, but they don't seem the type to do that, and it's not like I'm getting left on read. We went from a conversation Monday evening, to them not even seeing my messages Tuesday. 

Something doesn't seem right to me, like my gut feeling is that something has happened to them, and it's got me worried sick. Unfortunately I only have one method of contact for them, so I don't really have another way to check on them. I've considered calling their work to see if they've suddenly stopped showing up or anything like that, but that almost seems like overkill to me. 

What do y'all think? Am I worrying too much? Do I need to chill the fuck out? Or am I being a bad friend by not trying harder to check on them? I'm not really sure what to do at this point...",04Sep2018,1
323,"So i've been living in Kentucky for a year and a half now after moving here to be away from California which was my homestate, and to cultivate better family bonds with the side of my family my direct parents never interacted with.

As it stands i'm currently about to be ousted from my older brother's property. I spent last summer/fall building out the small metal garage on his property into a livable room since there wasn't any extra space for me to stay here after my younger brother who moved out here with me decided to move to oregon with his highschool buddies. Leaving me with our family's 2 dogs and unaffordable rent for the 2 bedroom townhouse i had dumped money into for deposits to only live in for 6 months. 

Recently my younger brother has moved back here with us, and now my older brother has raised my rent to an almost unaffordable amount the last week of august. And since i didn't have the total amount on the first, he's going to move forward with selling the property and having us all go our separate ways. 

Even after picking up extra work on the side helping people move and assembling furniture through task rabbit in 95+ degree, i wasn't able to make up the difference and pay my other expenses on time. I've been trying to save for a few months now to get my dog's acl surgery he needs. And now with this I'm back to zero. 

Currently i am in the process of pawning/selling my material possessions and currently plan to just see how far i can get with the money that brings my way. I have until the end of the month to formulate something better. 

I'm currently researching jobs as a cannabis trimmer since that seems like the most entry level job with decent pay i could acquire with my skillsets. If nothing else just to live out of my car and get enough to get my dog his surgery. But it seems like that industry isn't any more available for workers to apply as any other as i'm finding it difficult to find listings of available jobs in states that have legalized it. 

Are there about to be homeless programs i should be aware of? Any tips for living out of your car? Really i'm just at a total loss at this point. Any advice would be helpful.

325,"I recently graduated college and got hired to work on a campaign.  The campaign lost our primary but within 10 days I was hired for a higher role for a different campaign running for the same level of office. Pretty much, my first campaign the work was split between 3/4 people.  Now, all of that responsibility is only on me.  I feel like I may have jumped into this too quickly because I am realizing now that I do not have the same desire to do this job with way more responsibility for the same amount of money.  Normally I would have no issue in quitting a job that I honestly dislike but because this is a job that ends when the election comes in November I feel like if I leave I may be screwing over the candidate I am working for.

Some of the things that I dislike about this job are.... 

I am being asked to canvass for a variety of candidates outside of my own, because of this other campaigns are attempting to coordinate with me which causes things to happen slightly slower than desired and I have less of a chance to talk about the woman I am working for to voters.  I live about an hour away from where I work which makes working 10 hour days turn into 12 hour days which has drained me mentally and physically, especially since I have worked every day the past two weeks and it will not be letting up between now and November.  I do not know if I will be able to continue at this pace for another 2 months.  I am also a person that likes a schedule and not knowing when I will be able to get off has caused some frustration and stress.  This makes it nearly impossible to enjoy quality time with not only my friends but my family as well.  This job does not have the same level of enjoyment as I previously had with the first campaign I was on.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some advice here on what to do.  I am not sure if I should tell my boss that I do not have a desire to work with her anymore, if I should ask about hiring more staff (not sure if that would help me much), or if I should suck it up and push through the next two months.  I am mostly worried that ending my employment here will also end any desire I had of furthering a political career because all the contacts I have made will turn their backs on me.  But at the same time I have always been a big advocate for doing what is best for you as an individual, especially when it comes to mental health and being happy.",04Sep2018,1

328,"So I have hit my imminent state, helplessness. Today was my trip back to Ireland! Happy days, right? Wrong. Since I was 14 (currently 18) I have been dealing with one problem: to settle down in life, but that seems a bit hard... I moved to Ireland in 2014 and hated it there, I moved back to South Africa and I was happy enough.. But my mom and my sister weren't with me everyday anymore and it really hurt. Skip a few years and I moved back and forth between Ireland and South Africa, always jumping from my dad to my mom. My dad is a bit of a drinker. A lot of a drinker. And he has some bad anger issues. My mom is kind and just wants the best for me. So back to today, It was my flight to move back to Ireland after a ""Holiday"" in South Africa, but I didn't go.. At the time of me writing this, its currently one hour until my flight and obviously I can't go now because gates close 2 hours before the plane leaves, and the airport is 30 Mins. Away. I am torn between 2 places and its been killing me this past 4 - 5 years. I need to cope somehow since my mother and sister miss me and I miss them, but can't live with them now all because I was a bit too fucking scared to move again. Thanks. ",04Sep2018,1
329,"Hello everyone! I was given a task to find out/research a system in my job. The story is simple: We (our business) are moving to a brand new place, way bigger place and our boss wants for every employee an ID card. He wants it for people to be able to access specific doors only for their department and so on. The second thing he wants is that he can see each workers hours at the end of the week ( when they entered the building and when they left so he can know what to pay them at the end of the week).

332,"I had a group of friends through high school. They used to pressure me to tell them secrets and things, and when I once finally opened up to them about some past trauma, they acted all sympathetic and then went behind my back and apparently 'ranted' about how they thought it was all a lie. They were always pretty judgmental and I could sort of tell they liked to talk about me behind me back as well. 

They started getting super distant from me and when I finally asked why, the whole group accused me of lying to get attention and basically destroyed all trust I ever had for them. After that I essentially just ghosted the group. It sucked because the rest of senior year was hell but I just forced myself through it and moved to a different state at the end of it. Its been a while, I'm currently a sophomore in college and I haven't talked to them since. Occasionally over the past year I've gotten a few texts from them. Just simple things like ""hey?"" and I've never replied because I told myself two years ago that I wasn't going to associate with shitty friends like them anymore. Sometimes I wonder if I should reach out and maybe reconcile, maybe they've grown up since then and aren't such assholes anymore.

336,"I was originally on a computer science path in school,  but I decided I hated the classes and I felt as if everyone else understood it and I just wasn’t catching on. I switched majors to psychology, which is something I’m massively passionate about. 

The dilemma I’m having is about money, essentially. With a BS in computer science, I can get an immediate job making probably 60k or more. With a BS in psychology, and I can’t do much besides go to graduate school for a doctorate.

With a doctorate, I can make good money. However, this “good money” comes much later than the good money I could get from a BS in computer science. 

How do I decide between money sooner with a degree I have no passion for, or money later with a degree I actually care about?

339,"(20,F)over here, and falling into a bad rut on what to do with my life. I currently work as a hair dressing assistant cleaning, washing hair and do makeup at my job as well. Met a wonderful (26,M)ver a year ago,  who is stationed in the army in Lousiana and wants me to move in with him of Christmas this year. 

I would love to move down and grow as a person, experiencing new things.  He is supportive as can be and I know will be there for me until I get on my feet. I obtained my cosmetology license while in high school, and I work based around that currently. The issue here is, I feel like I'm not going anywhere with it. I basically get paid to be a maid. I feel useless. 

I am very independent, pay everything for my car, phone, food, even down to my own laundry detergent. 

The biggest issue here is my mother tells me constantly how disappointed she'll be in me if I move as well.  Saying how young I am and how I should go back to school and do something with my life and how if it's going to work out with him he can wait. 

Side note: people I have talked to has also said the opposite as in I'm young, move and do it now and if it doesn't work out I can always go back to school.  

Back to the issue, my mother also adds that I'm only moving for him and how there are more opportunities around here ( I live a ferry ride away from NYC) problem being is that I never wanted to work in the city or be in that fast paced kind of atmosphere. I always loved the idea of living a more low key way of life. 

My boyfriend says to marry him go get his GI bill to get free schooling, which I know is far fetched and sounds crazy. And I know I'm too young to do so.

To sum it up, I have no idea what to do with myself. Do I listen to my mother or move down and figure out school at a later time.
Or should i even go back to school if i have no idea what I want to do in the first place?

340,"I'm 15 in my last year of school. I just had my first (half) day back after a 6 week break. And all my energy, happiness and motivation is gone. For the past 6 weeks I've been so happy, so productive and full of energy but now after only 3 hours of being at school, I'm back to this horrible depression. I've always had it, I just forgot I did. 

I don't have many friends. My best friend (he wasn't really my best friend, just my closest friend) has just moved country and today (and probably for the rest of my time at the school) I was hanging out with a guy as dull as dishwater who doesn't say anything interesting. None of my real friends are in any of my lessons. I get along with people in most of my lessons but it makes the most part of the day at school very boring. I don't have any close friends I can seriously talk to, they're all too immature - my best friend couldn't even be bothered to ask me how I was after taking a month off because my mum died. My small circle of friends all hang out in the library at break/lunch, which is dreadful when you've just been sitting down for 2 straight hours, and play shitty 2d games on the internet. 

Music plays a big part in my life, if I'm not at school, chances are I'm playing music. But I can't listen to it for 6 hours. I know i probably sound like a whiny bitch but for me, it's way too long. 

I'm not a nerd and I don't get bullied but I'm just in the middle with the rest of the inbetweeners. There's like 1 girl I talk to and that's just general banter. To even slightly get real with a girl seems impossible. 

My school is unnecessaroly strict. It really feels like I have no freedom. I'm sure most people will think ""Try working a job"" and I'm not here to argue which is worse but I'm simply not happy at school and I want to change that. 

Also please don't just say ""you've only got one more year"" i know I do but I don't want to go on for another year depressed as fuck. I want to enjoy at least these last month's. It's not good for my confidence, health or grades. 

TLDR: I've never enjoyed school, school gets rid of all my motivation, energy and happiness, I don't have many friends nor the friends I want, I can't listen to music for 6 hours which is a long time for be, I don't talk to girls, I don't have any freedom at school, I want to enjoy the small time i have left.

342,"Hello, first time poster, I didn't really know where to turn for help.  My girlfriend and I may have reached a breaking point in our 5 year relationship.  I'll try to keep this is brief as possible.  

So her and I have been together for about 5 years.  She was best friends with my cousin prior to linking up.  My cousin is the youngest girl in our family, and our family has always been close.  Growing up we did a lot of family things together.  Things turned south when her mom and my dad had an affair and things just got bad (my mom is her dads sister, just to clarify lol).  So she had it pretty rough and always just kind of did her thing regardless if people got hurt or not.  Her and I have worked together for a long time, and in that time she's grown up a lot.  There's times when I can't believe her behavior and other times when I see she's a very good person at heart.

Anyway, my gf and her never really had issues in the beginning of us dating.  It really started when 3 years in, my gf wanted to move across the country for school.  I was so attached that I agreed to an ""open relationship"", a lot of it due to her never moving away and wanting her to feel fulfilled.  I quickly learned I made a mistake and that first semester she was gone was one of the hardest times I've been through.  Not only that but my brother had just been arrested and was in jail.  I confided a lot with my cousin during this time as she knew her best.  Well my gf and I get back together half way through her year there, and she moves back at the end of spring.  

At this point I don't know exactly when it starts but the two of them start to hate each other.  My cousin would get drunk and yell at her about me, I wouldn't know any of this until my gf would get mad at me for not defending her.  If I could go back and change how I handled it I would in an instant, but my thinking at the time was ""they were friends before I ever knew her, they should be able to fix this"".  But that rationale was not working for my gf so to appease her I told my cousin that we should never talk about my gf and she shouldn't talk about me to my gf.  That was back in January.  All of our biggest fights are about my cousin.  Ever since January, they haven't hung out and my cousin and I don't speak about my gf when we hang out.  

Recently, my life has been kind of in shambles.  My brother just got out of jail a few months ago, only to relapse on heroin and is now states away in another prison.  My mom has seemingly lost her mind through all of this.  It's just been tough.  I started to give my cousin guitar lessons about a month ago, as a way to take my mind off things and honestly I've always wanted to teach someone.  This has been mostly fine with my gf as I tell her when she will be over and when she leaves.  As payment for the lesson, my cousin takes me for lunch, which is great since my gf and I are saving for a Europe trip.  Last Monday, after spending 8 hours over night with my mom in the hospital, we have our lesson but end up going out for some drinks.  This really irked my gf as she had the night off and wanted to spend time with me.  I got home around 1030 pm and could just sense her disdain.  This carried on for a few days and when she admitted she was upset about me spending time with my cousin, I just was so fed up.  We literally just cannot get passed this.  She does not want to try with my cousin as she doesn't think any good will come from it.  

I don't know what to do.  My cousin is my cousin, she will be in my life whether or not we get along.  My gf just has a hard time accepting that.  

TL;DR my gf and cousin don't get along and all of our biggest fights are about my relationship with her, and we are now on the verge of breaking up.

Any advice would be great, cheers",04Sep2018,1

At first she said she'd cover everything after what my old rent was, but quickly said she'd pay the whole rent instead. I got a text tonight saying that since she switched jobs (which she's been planning to do for a year because she's been saving a LOT of money in her bank), she won't be able to cover the full amount anymore.

It turns out to be around $1400-$1600 I'd have to come up with in the next 5 months. I opted to take harder classes this semester, on top of replacing an old, dying, 8 year old laptop last week. Rent is due tomorrow, but she said she'd cover the full amount this month.

I feel bad for confronting my mom about this, but at the same time, for lack of a better term.. This is pretty bullshit.

Idk what to feel, my intentions are innocent but like I understand if her boyfriend found out she was alone with a guy at the mall he'd be pissed too. Not like I could just blow her off since I'm already here. Idk",04Sep2018,2
352,"It seems like every job I work I become the bitch of the company. All of the hard heavy lifting work is put on me. I go do the work, no complaints and when I come back I see my manager out for a smoke break, my coworker joking with the girls up front or whatever. In the end they do very little work and I do the most of it. 

This turns out being the case at every job. My last job I began to get fed up. Brought it up to my boss and he pretty much said there is nothing he can do about it, don't worry what other people are doing, just do you. I put my head down and kept working. A month and a half later I bring it up again, he said the more I bring up other people's short comings (never mentioned anyone in particular) the more he feels I'm spending more time complaining than working, although I do most of the work. 

In the end the work load vanished, they terminated me without cause and kept the people who barily worked. 

I'm young and only 150 lbs. I care about my body and do things properly, proper lifts and such which can slow things down. Constantly putting heavy loads on my body is hurting it. I don't want to be a company's pack mule. I want to be their coworker.",04Sep2018,1
353,"At 29, I’m wealthier than most people at retirement. I have a great corporate job despite a high school education. I have a nice new house. I have the love of a good man who desperately wants a family.

These are all things I wanted and systematically achieved. I’m good at working hard, finding loopholes and getting my way. I’m terrible at empathy, making moral decisions and happiness. There’s a simmering anger underneath everything and there may be some sociopathic traits. 

Now, the looming prospect of a quiet family life is starting to cause me a lot of unease. It’s something I want in theory. In practice, everything becomes a milestone that gets written off when reached. I’m building a great life, but I’m not sure if it will make me happy. I’m not sure if anything can make me happy tbh, besides fighting for things. And it seems that marriage and a kid are a requirement for women at a certain age, so here we are.

How do you keep that driving anger under control?
How do you teach yourself to be good to people?",04Sep2018,1

365,"I haven't been able to talk with anyone about this. I am a 24 year old male. When I was in ninth grade, I was a pretty lonely kid and I'd previously come from a special education school and I didn't really know how to socialize very well. That year I got myself into a relationship with a girl I believe was a sociopath. She would constantly hit me, bite me, scratch me, and I still have a scar on my arm where she sliced me with a knife. At the same time this was happening, I made friends with another girl who was older than me, she was 17 but she was a senior at the time I was a freshman. I think she too was some sort of sociopath or narcissist. At the beginning of our friendship she insisted that we watch porn together. Time went on and her behavior became very strange and perverse. I remember her putting her hand down my pants and feeling me up, sometimes with other people around and she would somehow laugh it off and make it into a joke. Several times she convinced me to strip down into my underwear and she'd apply make-up to my face, and she would laugh and take pictures with her friend. She also said if I didn't kiss her boyfriend I wasn't really a man, or something along those lines. And on top of this, my girlfriend at the time and this girl I was friends with became aquainted through me and ended up getting along, the both of them forcing me to strip and have makeup put on my face so they could laugh and take pictures together. 

So, after all that ended I never really gave it much thought, I just tried to move on. I did have a few relationships after that but I noticed some really weird things that kept happening to me. Most noticably I've had erectile dysfunction from the time I lost my virginity to the last time I had sex. I am unable to get fully erect and my erections are easily lost, and I don't think this is normal for a male of my age. Each time I had a relationship I found myself with girls who were very passive aggressive and manipulative, and they more or less initiated the relationship instead of me. I noticed that upon physical contact with women I start trembling and shaking and I have an elevated heart rate. Each time I notice girls smiling at me or noticing me it gives me a jolt of anxiety. 

It took me almost ten years to realize what happened was abuse and how it affected me. I never thought men could be abused by women. I think a majority of depression/drug addiction I've been through was because of this. I still struggle with pornography addiction to this day. Has anyone else here been through abuse like this and what did you do? If you're a man who was abused by women, how did it affect you and how did you cope?

373,"I would like to say English is not my mother language, so please excuse my grammar and any typos. And I was on mobile, too

So a little background stories.

I had a trio squad in college. Me, A and B.

I am kind of the laid back and passive person. Since my first year in university I have never really made any effort to make new friends or close friends. I did socialize and joke around a few times, even hung out with some of them, but I am not close to any specific person or in a close group of friends. And I am not the kind of person that would avoid someone because I heard rumors about them as I would like to decide whether a person is good or bad myself.

About A, I have heard a lot of bad things about her. I myself also found that she was:
- Very competitive and grave for attention. She would show off her high scores, block anyone’s Facebook if they bad-mouthing about her - even if some of them might be truth, and show off how her relationship with her bf, her presents,.... She also made a friend of mine sounded bad in a speaking test so that she sounded better and got high score, despite the fact that she promised to speak slowly so the other could catch up.
- Used to getting what she wants and being indulged (as she is the only daughter of a rich, old-fashioned mom who would do things like not letting her dating her current bf bcause his family is poorer than hers).
- Opportunist. Imagine this, her duty was to go to the teachers’ room to get something for our lecturer. However, C was going to walk by that room on his way to the canteen. So she asked him to pick the thing for her too so that she wouldn’t have to go.
- A likes to dress like a princess. She likes blouses, dress, high heels and skirts. I like t-shirts, sneakers and anything that is comfortable. I do wear skirts and dresses, but not on a daily basis
- Her go to slogan: You can do whatever, as long as I am happy with it.

I know she was pretty bad therefore I kinda avoided her on purpose (avoid studying the same course with her, prolonging our convo and stuff like that). But at the same time, I still talk to her if I had to and with a nice attitude. She also had a very close friend herself so the relationship between us could be scored at about 5/10

B is also a pretty laid back person. She loves taking photographs and posting them on Instagram. She is also a teaching assistant (TA) and very good at doing makeup. She was friends with A before me therefore closer to A than to me.

In our second year of university, we had to go on a 7-day field trip. Students had to stay in a room of 3. Everyone chose their best friend squad to stay with while no one asked me because as I said, I don’t have any close friends. Then A invited me to be in the same room with her and B so I said okay, because the deadline was close. Then we actually had great times together, like taking pictures, hanging out and talking about our struggles and I really thought maybe A wasn’t that bad. But I still avoided taking the same course with her as I still felt 7 days weren’t enough to prove anything.

In our next year we had to go on another field trip. This time it was 10 days, and abroad.
I haven’t talked much to both A and B after field trip 1, but still they invited me to be in the same room again and I said yes again. This is when our friendship got to a higher level and the real struggles began.

First of all, I have always felt like an outcast.

As I said before,
- B was closer to A than I was always the last one to hear about B’s relationship stories.
- B is a social media sweetheart, she took great pics and got tons of likes. A also wants that, but I don’t really care about it. Therefore A buys whatever B bought and asked B constantly to do her makeups during our 2nd field trip while I did my own makeup.
- They are both rich, making more money than I am bc I have tight schedule and not want to spend my parents’ money.

Second of all, I am feeling like A is bullying me (and sometimes also B)
- She wanted us to wear the same colors when we hang out to just show people how close we are.
- She would ask me or B to do stuff for her. She would ask B to lend her a skirt if she does not have one not a good match with her top. She asked me to iron her clothes when I decided to stay in our apartment as I don’t want to spend more money while she was hanging out with B.
- When we was planning on our dates, I jokingly said that they should pick me up as I was tired of riding by myself. She said no fucking way are you kidding bla bla bla. On our real date, she called and asked me to stop by her house just to go alongside with her to the restaurant because she didn’t want to sit alone in the restaurant waiting for us. 5 mins after that she called again suggested I pick her up so that she didn’t have to ride.
- There was a pretty old motorcycle in front of the cafe we went to, B suggested a pose where 2 of us would sit on it, while the one left would stay behind and act like trying to push it forward. B asked me who would be the one to push, I said I would not do that. B asked A the same question, they argue for a while then A decided I should be the one pushing because “you are wearing a worker outfit” (I was wearing a jean overall). I was pissed off and just wanted to finish fast so I could just go home, I agreed. A made B the rider and she herself stood in the middle of the picture.
- Later on they made me stand in the middle of the picture but they still refused to be the one to push.
- When I went home I told them I was angry that A said I was wearing worker suit so I should push, she said ‘Oh mommy I am so sorry mommy, would you like me to devote anything to you?’
- When I said next time if there is any position that all of us don’t like to be in, we should play rock paper scissors to decide who will be in the position. B said she was okay to be the one who push. A said she is fine as long as she is in the picture then quickly changed the subject.

There are more stories, but I think I’d better stop here as those are the highlights which made me felt very insulted and left out.

Am I overreacting or paranoid?
Should I continue our friendship? If not, how to end, because I don’t wanna make a fuss out of it.

379,"I [17/F] have a friend [18/F] that I’ve known since elementary school. I love this girl like a sister. But when we were in middle school, she started self-harming. She’s struggled with mental health ever since, and has a really bad depressive period about once a year. She has a really bad home life, and none of the adults in her life believe she’s “old enough” to have mental health issues. I am the only person she will discuss any of her mental health problems with, as some incidents when she was younger left her with a VERY strong distrust of all mental health professionals. 

Sad as it is to say, her downswings are almost routine at this point. Roughly once a year, she starts to spiral into complete emotional breakdown/bleakness and talk about how meaningless life is, plan on giving her stuff away. She vents, I remind her constantly that this has happened and she’s gotten through it before, and in a few months or weeks things chill out to a normal level. 

But this time is different. She is adamant that she’s going to die on her birthday in a few weeks. She keeps talking about how she wishes she could see her mom again, or have kids, and that dying makes her sad, but she will not budge on the idea of dying. None of my usual redirecting is working, she’s not responding to my attempts to help solve problems that are particularly stressful right now, talking about it doesn’t seem to make the feeling lessen. It’s more resolute than a gut emotional reaction this time. She just doesn’t want to live with constant anxiety and random crying fits. 

Does anyone who’s been in this mental state themselves or works with people who are have any advice for how best to support her?? She won’t call a hotline, but I am prepared to call 911 if she gives me any warning at all the night of her birthday. ",04Sep2018,2
380,"Idk, feel like this is super broad but it's basically on the title- I just feel like there is so much going on in my life right now and I'm just exhausted from it all. 

My company has been in the process of merging for nearly a year now and everything at work from time entry to what I work on is changing. 

My brother just had his first kid a month ago and I've yet to meet her because we don't have time.

My wife and I settled on a house a month ago (yep-same week as the kid) and are still unpacking etc.

In the last 3 weeks I've been to 2 wedding, 5 and 3 hours away, I've got a bachelor party this weekend 8 hours away, followed by a 3 day work trip less than 24 hours after I get back (internal conference at the worst possible timing because I'm already working 50+ hours a week), another wedding in 2 weeks (where I live, but that just means that we have family staying with us in our still messy house) and then another wedding in October.

I know I should feel blessed and lucky to have a good job and so many friends and family but I just feel tired. All I want to do is spend a weekend binging TV or games (followed, of course by the feeling of guilt for wasting time).

382,"Hello- So my younger sister has a 4 year old white German-Shepherd. He is the most sweetest and smartest dog I've ever met. The unfortunate thing is, she is never home to care for him and forces my other younger brothers to look after him. The background of this is that she got the dog when she was going through a breakup, so the dog was her way to go out and keep herself distracted. The dog was never meant to be forever in my opinion. It was only her accessory to post on social media and what not. It really pisses me off bc I really love animals and I've been wanting to adopt for a long time, but I am not in a stable position to do so at the moment. Which is why I've made the decision to give the dog up without her consent. 

I know it is her dog, but he is living a bad life without his owner. She leaves home and will be gone for a week and never come once to check or feed the dog. My family took care of the dog as best as they could, but it is not their responsibility even after my parents said no to her bringing the dog home (my sister still lives with my parents). I am a little embarrassed and sad that I have to be the one to give him up but I want the best for this dog. He deserve the best home and loving family he can get right now. I don't know which animal shelter is a no kill shelter and I don't know which shelter would be willing to help him find a nice home. I want them to help find his new loving family. I also don't know if posting it on Facebook asking if people would take him be a good idea as well?

For the few weeks I've been here I've just had the feeling that I don't belong and this isn't where I envision myself for the next four years. Aside from this gut response I have other reasons for wanting to transfer:

1. It wasn't fully my choice to go here. My parents insisted that I go to a more prestigious liberal arts college instead of one of the admittedly mediocre state schools. I was largely indifferent during the application process.

2. Financial situation. As of now, starting my first semester, my parents have $120,000 saved specifically for my education. My current college will be $47,000 per year (if I don't pursue more scholarships/work study later on), meaning I will have to take out loans. The state university thats located in my hometown would be $11,000 per year. Both of these are after scholarships, housing and food are accounted for. Aside from this, my grandparents have agreed to pay for some of the remaining cost, but no explicit amount has been set. 

3. I know this reason is really petty but my girlfriend is attending the local university and ideally I'd like to be with her. On top of the lovey-dovey relationship stuff, she inspires me to try harder at school and pursue other activities like internships or clubs.After meeting her in high school, My grades improved and I actually took the steps to take leadership roles in my life for once.

4. It's only been a few weeks of living here, but I feel that I don't fit in with the small, tight-knit community here. Student activism and social justice are big here, but I don't connect at all with that.

On the reasons for staying here, it would definitely benefit me academically. Professors have closer relationships with students, classes are smaller, and internship and research opportunities seem to be thrown at you. Also, my college is located in the suburbs of a large metropolitan city and there is significantly more job opportunity for me here than at home.

This question of whether I should transfer or not has been bugging me for a long time and any advice at all would be greatly appreciated!",04Sep2018,1

Every time I learn ways to do the job with one trainee. I am pushed onto another who tells me the way to do that is wrong and I need to me doing it there way. I've had multiple sit ins with my supervisor and trainers. Where they demean me, tell me the job isn't that hard to do, and they won't acknowledge my improvements. I had a day where I have had personal problems aris, and it was affecting my mood and willingness to do the job. However I told my sup since everyone in the department touts that it's an ""open door policy"". He told me that ""everyone has personal issues and I need to get over mine"". I've brought up the problems I had with my first trainer. Whom treated me like a complete idiot when I asked for clarifications regarding procedures. Now my new trainer is very micro managing. She doesn't let me breathe nor is she really trying to help me. Again when I ask for help or have a general question which i want to make sure I'm following protocol. She doesn't respond or acknowledge me. Half the time she won't even sit with me.  I'm afraid of bringing these problems up to anyone above me. They really want to follow ""chain-of-command"" so I'm confused as to how my problems will be processed if its everyone above me. Above all due to my mistreatment for my first 2 months here. I'm stuck wondering whether the pay is worth my health or whether I am too mentally weak to just ""suck it up and deal with it."" I only took the job because it pays good, sustainable, and I could return back to college(hours and $$).

TL;DR: I don't like the new job I started working for with the government. It's not the actual job that's the problem. It's the way the office functions and it's practices towards me specifically.

There was a girl I went to school with, and I got a crush on her. It lasted for a while, so after a while I decided to talk to her. Keep in mind I've never talked to a girl before in my life, I'm kinda extremely socially awkward. We became good friends (that was about half a year ago), but about a month ago I decided to tell her everything. Me being me, I didn't know how to say it even though I prepared the entire speech. Essentially what I said is ""You know what I want to say"". She understood everything, and even though she essentially said ""It's not you, it's me"", it was the nicest ""no"" I've ever heard in my life, and that moment, when she was talking to me, I felt so complete, I felt good. Not for long though. After I got home, I texted her that I needed to rant out the entire history of knowing her, and so I ranted out into stuff like depression etc. She was so nice and kind about everything, she understood everything I said. I've never really had friends before, so it was nice to have someone that knows everything. We decided to meet to talk it out face to face, but unfortunately there was no time, and she left for summer holidays for 2 weeks. We didn't text at all, and I felt terrible, often feeling actual physical pain in the heart, but I was slowly getting better. The worst 2 weeks of my life pass, and the school starts again, so I see her everyday for like 6-8 hours. We haven't talked about what happened, but now that I see her again, I'm starting to feel terrible again. It's been worse and worse, and even though it's been almost a month, nothing's changing. School's starting, so I really need to focus, but I can't. A part of me is still getting angry every time she talks with a guy (one friend of mine in particular), even though she told me that she isn't ready for a relationship, and I trust her.

I really need to forget about her, but parts of me still want to hold on, that maybe there's still hope, but I know there isn't. We're still friends, but I think we shouldn't be, but seeing her with other friends in school makes me feel so empty.

407,"Hello!

As the title says, I'm feeling completely burned out when I haven't even started my last year of studies. I'm studying chemical engineering which requires quite a bit of studying and work to be put into it. (But that's not the issue)

However, for the last couple of years things haven't been going for me well. I ran into multiple issues with my mental health (from a hurtful breakup, to my friend passing away) and it seems that everything is not going to be better for a while now.

So, as a person that I am, I'm trying not to put everything for the last minute and to plan my life into the future. I'm 100% sure that after I'm done with my studies next Summer, I will want to take a break for at least a couple of months which led me to the question, what to do then?

I have a lot of working experience, even though I'm only 21. From the age of 16 for 3 years during Summer I've worked at a construction company, for one Summer I did work as an assistant at Mars Inc. company and this Summer for the first time I had a chance to have a job abroad at the Netherlands, which was in a paint making factory. So as far as I'm aware, I'm pretty good at doing physical and mental works.

I'm from the eastern Europe. We don't have great life here, our economy sucks and we don't have happy and encouraging society. (My country has the highest suicide rate in the world, oh I wonder why..) And spending this Summer working at the Netherlands completely changed my views on the people and on the society itself. I'm a male, and leaving that country has brought me to tears knowing that I'm about to get back to my usual and depressing routine.

And why I know it's depressing and there's something wrong with me? Well.. Living a dull life as I've been for these 21 years have made me to be scared of many things. Showing yourself out to the people, doing things that I think I would enjoy doing because of the constant fear of failing and constant fear of other people mocking me. Leaving the Netherlands I've had an idea to finally buy a cheap dslr camera and start learning things about photography, since I've always been fascinated about it. But now, when I'm back here it feels that again, everyone is against that and I have to force myself to deal with constant negativity/pressure or whatever you can call it and I'm just afraid of buying it because I know it will be hard to go outside and take those pictures. It's hard to explain everything, especially when it's not my native language (even though I would have a problem doing that in my language as well), but I just want to have something to live for, to wait for me, while I'm doing my last year of university. I just want to know that something is there that I finally be able to enjoy doing and get into it 100%.. All my life people have told me I'm good at things, but I've never managed to overcome that fear of failing and showing yourself, so I've never achieved anything that sitting and playing video games.. So at least I'm thinking if I have a place, further away from society for a couple of months next Summer, I can finally rethink my life, do correct future decisions and just finally relax and get that anxiety out of my head.

So, if there's still anyone reading I really need your advice on what to do. To be more correct, I know that I should take time for myself, but I just need to find a place where. I'm not wealthy, I cannot just go anywhere and enjoy peace. I need to find an income during that time as well. Anyway..

409,"Details - together 3.5 years, engaged. We were both unhappy (we've both dealt with depression in the past, along with the relationship issues that come with time), but I was trying to keep us afloat. I came home from work away (gone for a few weeks) and found out that while I was gone she had slept with someone else. I wasn't mad, more shocked then anything, but knew that we were broken beyond repair (we had broken up and gotten back together again only a month prior, on my birthday of all days). We parted ways.

Shortly after she picked up with a friend of hers, and they dated for a while before he told her that he was moreso in the relationship as a way to try and deal with the anxiety that he had been experiencing since his friend had drowned a couple years prior, and as a result they broke up. We met for coffee and she seemed happy enough, we parted ways again that was the last Ive seen her (almost 3 years ago).

Ran into some of her friends the other night and in the course of conversation it came out that she had gotten back together with her friend and virtually isolated herself from just about all of her friends shortly after our meetup for coffee. (childhood best friends, like her core group that she would have walked through broken glass for when I knew her).

I am a psychology major in my second year of college. I've always loved psychology and understanding why we are the way that we are.

I want to do research on the brain and how it relates to our behavior, discover more about mental illness and to help discover more about the brain. I'm currently taking a bio class (+lab) philosophy class, physiological psychology class  and I feel so overwhelmed by my bio class. All of these classes are a requirement for both my psychology major and the neuroscience concentration.

I have my high school diploma, graduated in 2010 with roughly 20 college credits from AP exams,  and some college credits from my first attempt at college, but unfortunately due to some family and personal issues I dropped out and focused on work. I was successful(ish) became manager of a store with 1.1 million in sales before I turned 21. I was a store manager for 3 years before I quit and invested my money in a franchise unfortunately this is when my depression became extremely severe and the business failed and I declated bankruptcy. Since then I have been in job limbo (bouncing from shitty decent paying job to the next) and really quite unsure of how to even proceed with going back to school or what career I should pursue. I will spare the details but I had a difficult childhood and had a toxic worldview for an extremely long time I have worked hard to change the way i think and the way i view the world. With this new view my pursuit of knowledge and a fulfilling career that I enjoy is much more important to me then my earlier attempt. I enjoy technology, science, math, psychology, and biology. I plan to go to my local community college to start an associate's degree. 

TLDR: background (25m), declared bankruptcy, going back to college, extremely interested in sciences, perhaps some applicable college credits, can work extremely hard, just getting ahold of my depression after several hard years.

What can I do to prepare to go back to school such as renting math or science books and doing some self reviews to bring my knowledge back up to speed?

What careers/degrees should I research?

Are there any grants/scholarships I can apply for?

433,"Here is a story, 

Some weeks ago I was trying some shirts on, one of the staff was so gentle to pick me a white one to try on, the shirt was actually nice and I made her a compliment saying that she had a nice taste, she smiled back and added something. 

A week or so later I was in there looking for a rain/winter coat, she was sorting the clothes out nearby. I greet her, she’s smiley, a conversation develops, another Anon jumps in and before we know it we’re all talking about art, paintings and so on, I ask her at what time does she finish, she says 9 and that she hasn’t been feeling too well, I salute her and leave. 

I keep going there sporadically, checking if there is any new rain/winter coat. Not really talking to anybody, really. 

One day I realize that perhaps I could have been more clear about my intentions when I asked her at what time she would have finished her shift. I look for her but she’s not in sight, I ask another staff member if she’s around and I get told that she wasn’t feeling well and she was on leave. 

I Hadn’t been going to Anon Shop since a while, and when I did I hadn’t talked to anybody. 

One day I’m in there looking around, she passes by and says “Hi how are you?..” but I was too distracted to notice her and answer and greet her in time 

Today I go there to check again about rain/winter coats. I see her there and greet her again, I try to explain her what I meant when I had asked her at what time she would have finished her shift, but she rumbles that I shouldn’t have asked other staff members if she was on leave, I was about to clarify that I didn’t ask that and that I was only looking for her, but decide that an apology would have been better, she asks me to wait and walks to the desks, she meets with the other staff member that I previously asked about her, they turn around, grin, she calls the security and this old bald man walks up to me telling me to leave and that every time I was in there I was harassing the staff members (completely false), I try to explain my version but he didn’t want to listen to any reason and threatened to have me arrested... 

So apparently I’m not allowed in the Anon Shop “anymore”... 

I believe that’s unfair and I don’t understand why of such an harsh treatment, the way she initially behaved towards me might have lead me to see something that apparently was not there, but she did seem to be very interested when talking to me... I mean all I needed was just a “No” and I would have moved on.

440,"This may be a bit of a long story, so I apologize in advance! For reference, I'm a 27 year old woman living in midtown Manhattan with my 30 year old boyfriend.

I have been suspicious of a prostitute in my building for some time--I'm frequently seeing random middle aged white men leaving my building when I get home from work, which seems like no big deal, however we live in a small apartment building with only 6 units. So while I don't know everyone in the building, I can recognize a few familiar faces.

A few weeks ago on a Sunday, my boyfriend was out running an errand and I was home alone for a bit. I heard a knock on the door and went to answer and it was a white middle aged man. I greeted him and he said hello back, and then attempted to walk into my apartment. I stopped him and asked if he needed anything, to which he asked ""Julia?"". I told him no, and he turned around and left the building. Super, super strange. This only heightened my previous suspicions.

Last week, I was getting home from the gym around 8pm. I noticed a man at the top of the stairs on my floor. I figured he was just waiting for me to come up so that he could go down. So I run up the stairs, say ""Thank you"" and pass him. He continues to follow me and as I close my apartment door I realize he's looking at me and seems to think that I'm about to let him in. Again, I ask ""Do you need anything?"" and he says ""Oh, I thought you were someone else."" He turned around and left the building, and then we noticed he later came back and went upstairs.

Since the first incident, we've gotten 3-4 knocks on our door--all men. I haven't been opening the door, but instead looking at them through the peephole. They all seem to realize after we don't answer that they're at the wrong place and either leave the building or check their phone and head upstairs.

Reddit, does this sound like what I think it is? If so, do you think calling the police would do anything?

442,"So im a welder for a large company and we work alongside with fitters who fit up an allign the parts for us to weld. Sometimes the fitters have to be on fire watch duty if they don’t have any work to do themselves. So they sit on a bucket all day and literally sit there and watch us all day with a fire extinguisher while Im sweating and working my ass off. 

Im relatively new to the job (1 year) so im not gonna set any speed records welding. But I do the job right and make sure its within the correct parameters, and I have hundreds of hours of experience with different types of welding. 

*Anyways* theres this asshat fitter guy who has been giving me a hard time for the past week. He seems to be in his late 20s *maybe* early 30s. We have to crawl through a small hole to enter the workspace and we have to bring our heavy tool bag with us. The guy was already inside the space and I asked him politely if I could hand him my bag through the hole so I could climb in. He was like, “yes, I can do that for you... doesn’t mean I will though!” And then im like, “...please?” Then he chuckled and eventually did it. That was last week. 

*This* week something *else* happened. So he noticed I got frustrated a couple of times and threw my welding rod down because it kept sticking to the plate (it happens to everyone occasionally). Keep in mind I was sweating my ass off in an uncomfortable position that’s loud and filled with dust and smoke for 6 hours straight so I was obviously more irritable if something simple is not working. I was losing my patience. So after the shift was over and I obviously got a lot of work done, this asshat was like “you need to learn how to weld young buck!” Then we kinda got into a shit talking session and I was like “yeah lets see you do it then! How many years have you even been here?!” And then he was like “it dont matter!” I just wanted to punch this guy honestly but I also want to keep my job.

About 3 weeks in I realized ""Oh shit I think this was a BIG mistake"". We named her Abigail and people automatically call her Abby. I hate it, because I have some negative name associations with Abby - a former pet of my mom's and some asshole from high school. Like a complete f-ing idiot, this did not occur to me in the hospital when I was sleep deprived and hormonal. I thought 90% of people would call her Abigail. Nope. 90% of people call her Abby. 

I am honestly in a complete panic and in tears about this on a daily basis. Will I always associate my kid with a dog and some person from high school? I've gotten on some antidepressants, and I'm going to wait a month or so until they take effect, to make sure this is true name regret and not a manifestation of PPD. My husband is on board with changing the name if it makes me feel better. We have a name we would change it to. 

There are two things that bother me: people's reactions and perceptions, and the legal name change process. 

1. Can you be completely honest with me, and tell me if you'd think someone has completely lost it if they changed their child's name? I'm thinking of all of the people we'd have to tell, and I just want to die of embarrassment and shame. Who knows if this will just be a blip on people's radar or the piece of gossip that our families bring up behind our backs and giggle about for years to come. I really want to change it, but if that isn't feasible, I'll need to start to work on accepting it - if I can. 

2. I don't want this to cause her issues later in life. Is she going to have to fill out the ""former name"" on paperwork every time now? If we change the name on the birth certificate and with social security, is the former name going to be scrubbed forever? I'd prefer to forget about this nightmare forever if we do end up changing it. If anyone has experience with a name change, whether it be your own or someone you know, I'd appreciate it. 

Anyway, thanks for reading, and for any advice you can throw my way. ",04Sep2018,1
452,"really not major, but it got me thinking. this is for my automotive class. long story short, there’s a shop car that’s stick shift and i really want to learn. i ask him to which he starts making reasonable but fishy excuses. he starts off by saying, “oh we would have to move stuff out of the way in the shop”. i say ok i can help that’s fine. then he says, “well, we gotta to wait for the parking lot to clear out”. no problem i got time. “it’s out of gas”. i didn’t take offense, but i just assumed he doesn’t want to. and that’s tottaly  fine, we have all have lives and we r all tired after school, after all teaching it can be frustrating and his part. week later, i am going to my car after staying after school to lift weights, i see him and a couple kids driving the car the parking lot and he is teaching them. So then i was like ok, maybe he doesn’t like me. the only other logical reason that he might of agreed to it is because maybe those kids stayed a few minutes after class to clean the shop and they asked and it was the least he could do. 
imma ask him one more time, and see what he says ",04Sep2018,1
454,"heyy, guys how are you? Me? I've been better, I kinda don't have anyone to talk this about so I feel the urge to make this post. I'm a 18m, who has a normal life, I guess, who is right now waiting for the school to start(summer break). I was working at macdonalds(worked there like 5 months) and I quit like 1 month ago cause I'm so stupid that I didnt want to work, just to isolate my fucking self. I'm not depressed but I'm so lonely that every time I meet new people, have opportunities to do something (go out, anything) I just isolate myself. I've been dreaming alot about girls, specially one that I used to work with. She's not my crush or anything, but like for me it kinda hits me hard because she was a girl that I liked to hang out even tho we were not close at all lol. Some of these dreams are sexual others are romantic, meh. My parents say ""Go out, catch sun"" ""Always on the computer"", indeed, always fucking playing TERA, stuck at home not doing shit but fucking my eyes up with the monitor light.. I quit the gym that I was just to save money so the only time I leave the house is at night after dinner, I started doing 10000 steps every day, not with the goal of getting fit or anything just getting some fresh air while listening to podcasts(usually from AndySamberg, I love that guy lol). Pretty much this, I dont talk to anyone, I just spend all the time on the computer, I'm sad about myself from not being able to overpass this. I have a friend who only cares about me just to drink, and get high etc(he texted me because it's a party happening in my village next week) and we're going, I dont even care anymore just wanna forget everything in my head. I wanna help my parents so bad in everything that I can, they worked so hard and I'm all day playing games, that's not fair, I know how much it hurts to work so hard and the end all the money goes to bills, and bills. I'm crying right now but the truth is idk how because I stopped feeling emotions along time ago. Just listening to some music now until I go walk again..

455,"Hi! So, as the title says, I'm 20 years old and I'd like to talk to my dad about maybe getting a curfew that's a little longer. I'm a college student and I commute so I'm living with my parents through school. I have a bunch of other friends that are commuters too and they don't really have curfews while I still have to be home at midnight. It's a little embarrassing to be out with friends and to have to excuse myself from movies or parties bc midnight is fast approaching and I'll get in huge trouble if I miss it.

Part of the reason that I have a curfew is that there was a few times that I came home drunk when I was 18 and had first started college. However, I did work really hard to regain my parent's trust after that and recently, my dad (who is the enforcer of the curfew. My mom really couldn't give less of a fuck what time I come home as long as I come home) admitted that he was over that but that he felt like ""bad things happen after midnight"" and that I shouldn't be out in that. 

Here's the thing: For a while, I've suspected that my father's mentally ill. It's not just me. My mom thinks he has something going on, as well as my brother, sister, and my mom's immediate family. My dad's father also confided in my mom that he felt like something was a little off about my father. He did this before his death about 15 years ago so this isn't a recent thing or just something that I came up with. (My dad's mother and his brother also told my mom the same thing before they died) My dad is very, very, very paranoid. For example, he refuses to leave the house if no one is going to stay behind to watch it because he feels like, in his own words, ""irish gypsies will rob us."" It would be funny if he didn't completely believe it. When my mom was pregnant with my brother, my dad became convinced that it wasn't his child to the point where he literally HIT my mom while she was pregnant (spoiler alert: It is his kid). He once threatened to kick me out of the house because he thought that I was plotting against him with my friends. I was 11 years old at the time. I could go on with a million more examples but I think these get the point across: My dad is crazy. 

Moving away from him isn't possible. My mom won't divorce him due to religious reasons (She's very firmly Christian) and financially, we really need him to stay afloat. I'd try to get him to mental hospital or something but he would turn very violent and it's just not worth the risk. Even though it does get scary when he gets ideas into his head, he isn't crazy most of the time, just when he becomes super convinced of something. One of these somethings is the whole ""nothing good happens after midnight"" thing. I would really like to be able to stay out past midnight like literally everyone else my age. I'm not saying that I'd rage until 5AM or anything but it would be kind of nice not to have to start packing up around 11:30 sometimes. I see no reason why I should even have a curfew. My dad admitted that he trusted me again after I came home drunk a few times at 18. I live in a safe suburb. When I do things with my friends, they generally aren't very ""party-ish"" things anymore. At worst, we'll just smoke some weed and go for a walk (Again, somewhere safe). I'm a good student too. I have a high GPA. I'm a double major with a minor. I have a part time job so it's not like I ask my parents for money. I work really hard during the week and I've been super unproblematic (aside from the coming home drunk thing) for most of my life. I see no reason why I shouldn't be allowed to stay out a little late on Fridays and Saturdays, especially considering that I bust my ass every other day. How do I reason with my dad about this? Can I reason with my dad?

And, honestly, I will take any other advice on how to deal with my father. Like I said, my family and I are not in a situation where we can leave so if anyone knows what mental illness he may be suffering from, how to treat it, and how to rationalize with him, I would really appreciate the advice. Thanks in advance! 

**TL;DR I'm 20 years old and I have to be home by midnight because my dad feels like ""nothing good happens after midnight."" I have good grades, work hard in school, have my own job (so I have my own source of money) and am generally unproblematic (Aside from when I was 18 and I came home drunk a few times. I've since regained my parent's trust, which my dad even admitted to me). My dad, however, can be extremely paranoid, to the point of violence, and I'm not sure how to reason with him. My family is not in a position where we can leave him so I would appreciate advice on how to deal with him in general as well. Thank you!**",04Sep2018,1
456,"Hey everyone. I’m a college student who’s about to try out for an a capella group. Although I think I’m a good singer, I am super nervous for my audition tonight. I haven’t been in a group like this before, but I have done musical theatre. I gravitated toward picking a song from a musical, but I was steered away since it’s an a capella group that probably does more pop or rock.

I had trouble picking a song but I eventually went with Testing 123 by the Barenaked Ladies. It’s an older song and I don’t know anybody who knows it, but I like it and am comfortable enough singing it. I’m afraid I picked too obscure of a song though.

My other problem was practice. My dorm room has paper thin walls, and our school has no practice rooms for musicians. I’ve had to resort to using a secluded lounge in the dorm, but it can be busy so I haven’t been able to practice enough.

&amp;#x200B;

The story: I fell in love (at first sight) with a shy dude, who, for the most part, seemed to like me too. But we couldn't talk to one another much, due to social awkwardness on both sides. We two used to be classmates and we would occasionally say ""hi"" or have short conversations (mostly joking) that he initiated. Other than that, I had tried to text him before a few times but nothing much ever happened. I eventually decided to message him again (when school was over for good) and we talked all night long. He told me we would talk again, but we didn't. Our last interaction was a ""happy birthday"" message I sent him to which he responded with a ""thank you"". 

 Now we are a week away from the ""thank you"", 3-ish weeks away from the conversation we would totally have and 3 long years away from when we first started to talk. 

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts: I like him and need to have a straight answer to whether he likes me back or not. Do you think I have already gotten it but I'm too afraid to move on? All my friends (=unpaid therapists) say so. What should I do now?

465,"Hello. I have recently graduated from an Academy of Multimedia Production and earned an Associate's Degree. Yesterday, I applied for my first job, at a well-known video game company that is currently working on a pretty well known AAA title.

I applied via their website, for a position of an Associate Producer, which is an entry level job in the industry. I, personally, have no experience in video games, but have done a lot of personal studying, reading and exploring on the subject, especially on producing.

Application was rejected today, with no explanation, and I am kind of lost since I would really like to get in the industry early no matter what. I am 23 years old. So, if anyone has some time on their hands, I would kindly ask whether you could provide me with feedback regarding my cover letter and resume, especially the cover letter (both below). No need to hold back, I am here to improve.

Their job description:

XX is looking for an exceptional and well-organized Associate Producer, who will help manage teams and cooperate closely with our Production team to coordinate development processes within the studio. The person on this position will participate in the production of our awaited AAA game and will have the chance to grow within the team. If you are able to communicate with people as efficiently as you do with your spreadsheet, join us!

Daily responsibilities of a job:

* Day-to-day support in production management of the teams.
* Acting as a liaison between various production and development departments.
* Preparing and overseeing schedules and roadmaps and maintaining them on a daily basis.
* Helping with organizing and running review meetings.
* Supporting Producers in everyday tasks.

Qualifications:

* Fluent English - vital because of international working environment.
* At least 1 year of production management experience.
* Good PM skills (knowledge of tools and general methodologies used in project management.)
* Enjoys working in a highly dynamic and intense work environment.
* Excellent organization of own work and great communication skills.
* Jira experience is nice to have.
* Positive and constructive attitude.
* Passion for games!

I was rather confident about this. Responsibilities seemed pretty great and relatively easy, and judging from qualifications I felt like I would atleast get the opportunity for an interview. Didn't happen, though.

468,"At the moment I'm about $12k in debt, and if I continue on my current path (assuming I get no extra grants or scholarships), I'll be looking at graduating at 23 with about $18k in debt.

However something might change that and I'm really unsure how I should approach it.

My current path is this: I'm currently pursuing a degree in Communications. It's a major I'm actually somewhat enthusiastic about, and I'm taking classes that seem enjoyable...but I'm unambitious in regards to any futures in the field. This could be a problem as to get a good position in the job market would require drive and ambition, I'd imagine.

The fork in the path is this: because of my unambitious nature, I've been contemplating taking up Accounting as a major. Math is something I'm skilled at...but quite dislike doing, to be honest. However to switch my major to this would render every single class I took last year irrelevant; $8k worth of classes down the drain and it would require me to take on an extra year of schooling (and an additional $6k in loans) as a result.

In regards to ambitions, there's nothing I particularly care for or want to do. I'm perfectly fine working a 40hr, 9-5 job as it would give me the rest of the day to pursue other things (of course, as long as the job pays well enough to live comfortably). There is absolutely nothing I care about enough to be willing to put much of a future towards. Screenwriting and playing music are things that do give me joy...but I really have no desire to pursue them as anything more than a hobby.

As it stands, I've done an internship at a law office over the summer, along with having a couple opportunities to work on short films and television shows during my years in college.

The compromise I've been given on my last post regarding this is to finish my bachelors in Communications, and then pursue a Master's in Accounting and get my CPA then. However that would result in the same dilemma; more schooling + extra money taken out for *the possibility* of a 40hr 9-5 job.",04Sep2018,1

475,"TLDR: Need dental work and was planning to have it done overseas. A local office offered to do the work at a discounted rate that would still be more expensive than. Trying to decide whether to still go abroad or use the local dentist. 

My parents are good, well intentioned people who unfortunately did not promote dental hygiene while I was growing up. By the time I was able to understand the importance of brushing/flossing I already had significant cavities. In my mid-late teens I had a lot of work done but was told I would need crowns on all of my front teeth by the time I was 30. 

I’m 29 now and I’ve noticed some decay around my old filings and started to have pain where I will need a root canal done. I’ve moved around quite a bit in the last few years and have received several quotes in different cities ranging from $15k - $30k for the work I need done. I was blown away by the estimates, so I started researching dental clinics in Mexico and a few others countries. The quotes from these clinics were typically $2k - $5k and I was feeling confident that I would go abroad to have my work done. 

I currently live in NYC and went to a new dentist for a routine cleaning. The hygenist I had today was the best I’ve ever had. Not only was she very detail oriented with my cleaning, she explained things I could improve on in a very non patronizing way. Apparently, I need to brush up and down more and not as much side to side (oops!). The dentist was incredibly friendly and explained his recommended treatment plan very well (it was all information I already knew, but it’s nice to see if there’s any difference in opinion between dentists). I told them that I knew I needed the work but was mostly concerned about the cost. 

Getting significant dental work here in the city never even occurred to me because I assumed the cost would be the highest out of any office I’d seen previously. The dentist spoke with his front office staff and they offered to do the work for me at significantly discounted rate. The total came to $9.2k, which is by far the cheapest quote I’ve received in the US and it included the cost for some small fillings I need on my molars, not just the high dollar items. 

I’m torn because while this office is still far more expensive than going abroad, I feel comfortable with the staff and know their work would be high quality. The lab they use is also in the city and top notch. I know the crowns I get put in will easily last me at least 15 years. That said, $9k isn’t exactly pocket change. Many of the clinics I’ve looked at specifically cater to dental tourists and seem to provide quality work. I either need to roll the dice and hope for a good experience when I travel, or pay more and go with someone local that I trust. 

This is a huge investment and would greatly appreciate any input one which direction I should take, especially if anyone has experience going abroad for dental work!

      Today was my first day of senior year and I’m terrified. My classes are okay for the most part, but other than that everything is a mess. I don’t really know exactly what to do for my letters of recommendation; I’ve asked two teachers and they both said yes but now I’m kinda like “...now what”.

Whenever I even really think about college in general my anxiety spikes too.  I’m nowhere close to being ready for college.

My teacher today said something along the lines of: “If you struggled in Algebra II (the prerequisite) then this class may not be for you. And I understand that, I just feel that if I switch into an easier math course then colleges will really frown upon that. I feel like they’ll frown upon the fact that I can’t even hang in at grade level math.

478,"Title says it all; he’d rather stay at home and play video games than go out with me and my friends/family. I’m a gamer myself and have no problems with this, but my friends all think it’s really weird that after all this time together - they’ve only met him once or twice. And I agree. He claims he got all his “partying” done in the military, but that’s not what this is about. This is about going to dinner dates with my best friend and her boyfriend, having board game nights with friends and a couple of drinks... Normal stuff really.. But whenever I ask he always turns me down and I have to go alone. Some of my friends actually say my boyfriend is “imaginary” and “all in my head” as a joke, because they’ve never met him/or only a few times because he never wants to join us. How do I fix this? Is this normal at all? How do I make him realise that this is hurting me, as I want him to know my friends/family on a deeper level? ",04Sep2018,1
479,"My dad is 58 and has been working hard his whole life as a carpenter to give us all we need to surivive.

My moms is 60 and worked up until about 2004. After that her health declined and she hasn't done much since. 


Unfiltered truth: my parents were heavily into drugs in their youth (cocaine, acid, pills and stuff like that). My mom had my brother, met my dad, and then had me. During our childhood, my parents continued to be wreckless and make bad decisions. They would still do drugs and never payed a single tax. So by the time I was set to go to college, I couldn't get any help from them because they owed an insane amount in taxes. 

They did all these bad decisions while trying to give us the most modest life possible doing the best they can. 

I noticed quickly that I wasn't really allowed to complain because it made things worse. It was safer for me to be quiet and make sure everyone was taken care of all while dealing with an alcoholic father that would rage or a mother that would scream at us and have seizures if she didn't have pills. 

I thought this was normal life and now I know that it isn't. My dad thankfully stopped drinking and is a normal dad now. He takes care of my mom who is more addicted now than ever. I don't even know her anymore, and after being hit, yelled at, sexually abused, manipulated, and stolen from.( one time I had to get surgery for a broken foot. They didn't take me to the doctor. My mom sat at home perfectly able at the time, and when I got home, it took one day for her to ask for my painkillers literally pouring with tears begging for the) 


Now: I quit my job I had that was basically a supplement to their income, I'm a plant biologist working at a university, and I need to leave them, but I feel so guilty. I feel like I could help them, but I've literally tried everything. I've bought them new beds, I've treated their house for bugs, given them money, taken care of mom for 5 years while my dad traveled for work. I want to live my own life.  

Why do I feel so guilty? What can I do to get away? ",04Sep2018,1

481,"I am taking a gap year. My parents are graciously allowing me to stay home for as long as I want to - I am a very very anxious person and I am grateful to them for making this transition into adulthood easier. I have no curfew, I am allowed to take the car whenever, I am very free. Pretty much the only rule is that I must go to Church with them on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights... On one condition. 

I am free to go whenever and wherever *as long as I let them know.* This isn't a problem! Seriously, I wouldn't care, but... Some things are my business. For example, I've always been homeschooled. I've downloaded dating apps and I've said ""I'm going out with a guy"" and my mom doesn't care. (Dad does, so I just wait until he's out of town.) First time was a kind of yucky tinder date, second time was with a different guy I really hit it off with. I went out with that guy again. Now, here's the problem. My mom found out that I went on a date with a different person than my first date, and wouldnt stop asking about it. I had told her I was going to the mall and she's mad that I didn't mention with who. 

She got over it after a lecture, then after a bit started asking about him. His name, where he goes to school, what his family is like, if we can get our families together, etc. I kept the answers short because honestly she wants to act like my friend (I'd tell my friend all about my date) but also like my mom (I'd be pissed if my friend lectured me about not telling her who I was with).

I reaaaally fell for that guy but he stopped talking to me. Whatever, I'll get over it. BUT I'm trying to meet up with someone else tonight... and I have no excuse. If I say that I'm going on a date with someone else, she'll ask about what happened to the last guy, how I met this one, etc etc. If I say I'm going out with friends (I only have like 2 lmao) she'll call their parents. I feel stuck. What excuses can I give to get out of my house?

tl;dr: My parents have given me the tiny little rule of knowing where I am at all times in exchange for staying with them. I'd like to keep my activities private but I want to comply. Advice?

Everyone goes to me,you'll make new friends but I don't want new friends, I just want my old friends. And I haven't really been successful making friends today. 

Secondly I really wished I went to a different Six form, mainly because a lot of my friends and people I know are there and hell some of my crushes are there and I much rather be with people I know then don't. 

I really want to swap College to Six form but I don't think I can and the chances are really slim of swapping.

I just miss my old life at secondary school and I really don't want to this new college with people I don't know.

489,"Hello, I'm a 19 year old sophomore at the University of Michigan and I'm trying to take charge of my life. I have experienced anxiety my entire life and its because of this that I'm unsure as to whether my case is severe enough to require some form of medication. I thought I could just voice my daily thoughts on here and gets someone else's opinions on whether I should see a doctor. Here it goes...

Right now it is 85 degrees out and humid but I absolutely refuse to go out in anything less than long sleeves and pants. This is because I am 6'3, 155 pounds so I am very lanky. I want to cry anytime someone sees me in less than long sleeves and pants. I also find myself constantly manipulating my body in order to appear larger and less skinny. For example, today in my research lab while we were sitting I became extremely self-conscious about my the size of my wrists and despite it being boiling hot I rolled my long sleeves over my wrists and kept them there the entire day. 

I also believe I have a slightly weak chin. This drives me absolutely crazy so in order to counteract my weak chin I keep my lower jaw lowered and slightly forward at ALL TIMES. I particularly hate it when I am required to eat in front of others though because it requires me to chew and expose my weak jaw. I also have slightly fucked up lower teeth so whenever I speak with someone I consciously keep my lower lip slightly curled as to not expose my lower teeth.

I wear joggers usually when I go outside with high socks and high top converse. However, because I am so skinny the joggers sometimes slide down to my shoe and make me look like a lanky dumbass. Therefore, every morning I safety pin my pants to the top of my socks so that they cant slide down. If they slide down and refuse to stay up I want to cry.

I also care about my hair A LOT. I refuse to go out and have anyone see me without having taken a shower and styled my hair. Sometimes I even feel self-conscious letting my own roommates see my unshowered hair. This is because I think I have a slightly disproportionally small head so if my hair is all flat and ugly I look so fucking stupid. Because of this I also refuse to do any type of activity that requires sweating because it ruins my hair. 

I believe I may have some social anxiety as well. Today in class we were asked to share our names and where were from and our favorite movie. I was the last to go and my heart was beating out of my chest. I practiced what I was going to say over and over mouthing the words to myself but I still slightly screwed up because I stuttered when I said neuroscience. I felt awful the rest of the class because everybody in my class probably thinks Im dumb af now. 

Every time I see someone walk by me I consciously adjust myself to look as good as possible no matter who they are. Jut out my chin, straighten my posture, fix my hair. It makes walking around absolutely exhausting because I am constantly feeling worried about what I look like. In order to quiet this worry I always go into buildings that I know have full length mirrors as I walk by to ensure myself I look okay. 

Today while sitting in my first class of the year I could feel my heart beating so quick. And I know that its normal for others to feel this way on the first day but my heart beating fast never ended the entire hour. This happens pretty often and I frequently get distracted while trying to pay attention in class because I suddenly need to fix my hair or realize that Im not jutting out my lower chin.

I have had these feelings my entire life which is why I think of them as somewhat normal. However, living with three roommates, they constantly point out all the strange things I do and its making me realize I'm not normal. I have never seen a doctor or therapist about these problems. I just want to know, does everybody have these voices and problems in their head or am I just crazy. Im sick and tired of always being worried and I just want to know if yall think I should see a doctor. I have many more daily worries but its too much to voice here.

494,"Hi everyone! I recently moved into a smoking building because it is the only housing near my job that I can afford. For the most part, the building it really nice, but my apartment smells quite strongly of cigarette smoke. According to my landlord, my neighbor smokes, and I think that the smell is coming from his apartment because the smell is only evident during times when he would be home - during the morning and at night (assuming he works day hours). No one else near me smokes, and the smell isn't coming from an old tenant in my unit because my apartment was recently renovated with all new floors, cabinets, paint, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have only seen my neighbor once, and he doesn't exactly look like the nicest, most approachable person. I'm nervous to knock on his door and ask him to stop smoking in his apartment since he technically has every right to, but I'm beginning to feel like I have to do something since everything in my apartment smells. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, can anyone provide some advice on how I can talk to him about this issue? The problem is that since this is a smoking building, he can easily tell me to piss off, so I want to make sure I approach it appropriately to try to avoid that. I'm always very nervous about approaching someone about something so personal like this, so any advice would be very helpful!

**Quick warning**: this is really long, but i don't think anyone could really judge for themselves if they didn't know all of the facts and the whole story, if cant be bothered to read this, ill understand but whether you read this or not i hope you have a fantastic day, night or whichever the current time of the day is for you.

 Growing up I was a pretty normal kid, I was close with my friends, I was pretty smart and had a normal experience in the years of elementary school(For context, my family is a part of this community, where they own all the facilities from pre-kinder garden to Highschool. so there's people id known since i was 3) I was scared of middle school, but kind of excited at the same time, I was growing up and also thought it would be cool to have some female friends for a change.

So here is when it all starts to go wrong bit by bit.                                                                                                                                      at the start of middle school they mix up the classes(3 classes, around 100 people) and i got in a class with like 2 of my friends, and the rest were people i wasn't really friends with but my friends were.                                                                            for the rest of the year i tried connecting to the other people in the class, and ended up being alright with them, not really friends.  and watched my 2 friends drift away towards the other friends. 

Next year around the same thing happened, no real connection, I was watching my friends start to talking to girls but nothing really happened for me. I threw myself into online gaming and spent most of my hours there. At the end of the year I was optimistic as usual and thought ""Ah next years gonna be my year"".

The year after that I finally somewhat connected with the group of friends but i wasn't really in, We Never really hung out outside of school and I didn't really get invited to anything, and if i did it would be by kind of making myself relevant. I knew it felt wrong, but I was lonely and took everything i could get. Nothing really in the girl front either, i didn't really like who I was in that group of friends and i think that might of shown through confidence and attitude.

in those 3 years since elementary i lost a lot of confidence in myself and started to love myself less and less, I felt like i'm not really worth anything and that i was just unlikeable. i was down but somehow still managed to have some optimism and thought next year's gonna be different(Classes mixing again)

My parents broke up over the summer and i was heartbroken, i had to get it out of my system so i told one friend, but other than that kept it hidden for months.

I went into 10th grade with a fake smile on my face trying to forget about the events of the summer, and i got in a class with some new people i never really talked to, I managed to connect to this one guy and we became really close friends, . there was even this new girl that i kind of connected to. and for the first time in a while i felt kind of happy.                              my close friend knew the situation i was in and always advised me on it and introduced me to some friends from other schools and I was amazed, girls i didn't even know treated me better than girls I've known for years.                                                         I helped the new girl out at the start of the year and helped a bit in connecting her to the rest of the people i knew and she connected to the girls that i didn't talk to and for the rest of the year we kind of drifted off and don't really talk anymore which pissed me off and made me realize that me around my toxic group of friends drove her off. 

end of the year came and me and my close friend talked about moving schools. but my naive dumb ass, thought next year would be different than the rest.

First day of school came and like all the rest of the previous first days, i realized that nothings changed. That was 2 days ago and now i find myself 16, without much confidence, never have been in a realtionship, never kissed a girl and feeling just stuck in this toxic place without being able to progress personally.

&amp;#x200B;

The school I want to switch to has a good amount of friends and people i know and there's triple the people there so i think i have a good change of finding my place there. downside is transferring would be hard since i already have 2 majors and i might have a hard time adjusting, and it might even hurt my grades. I really am lost and i don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Had a friends group from middle school to highschool which was toxic and felt an outcast from, lost confidence, love for myself, never been in a realtionship and feel stuck in a toxic place ,should i switch schools to one where i have some friends and get a fresh start, but might affect my grades.

512,"The circumstances are really difficult. For context I'm now 18.

My parents got divorced when I was 6, so I've grown up living alone with my mum. I always used to stay with my dad every other weekend, but as I've grown up I've realised that actually he is a bad man and that I don't really enjoy going round there. He never woredk and so there was no money = sitting in flat watching tv all day. 

I've worked out from what I've seen and what I've heard people say that:
● he is a benefit fraud
● he steals from people 
● he paid only 2 child maintenance payments to my mum over a period of 12 years
● he has previous minor criminal offences
● he treated his side of the family badly

I see him for roughly 4 hours a month. I've tried to cut down as much as I reasonably can. Over a year ago he got evicted from his flat. He was homeless for a while, but now he lives in a rehabilitation centre where you have 1 room to live in. The place is filled with alcoholics, drug addicts and mentally ill people. Certainly not the environment to visit. Before the eviction he had been left by his second wife - a marriage which was ridiculous in the first place. This really annoyed me. 

Because of this break up, he tried to kill himself multiple times. I never knew about it, until it was visiting weekend (at this point I had only cut down to seeing him for a day, not the full weekend like I used to) one time, only this time he had just been evicted and I had to go to a random house to see him. After a while we walked to the nearby cemetery to see where my grandparents ashes were buried. We had never been since they died, he never cared. He sat me down on a bench and told me everything: the eviction, the suicide attempts (in detail), how he was refusing help from doctors. He then went on to say how he didn't think he saw me enough. Trouble is, I was getting older, and I didn't want to see him much anymore. What also alarmed me was that I wasn't bothered by what he said. I just didn't really care.

He's unemployed, living off benefits, has a walking stick, he's split up with his wife who was at least nice to have around. Bringing the story back to present, there are so many unforgivable little things I know about him that just annoy me and really are appalling. Little things where he has just screwed me or others over. Not to mention the fact that half of his benefit money has always gone on his smoking. He never hesitated to chain smoke around me. I used to feel sick sometimes because of the passive smoking. 

Whilst I appreciate the back-story is brief, I hope it's enough to make you understand why I want to cut ties. We are totally different, and I can only thank my mum for bringing me up exceptionally well. However it's come to the point where I need to make a decision. Soon I leave for university, where I will begin my degree to become a Police Officer. I will be the first person ever in my family to go and this backs up my point about us being different. I'm slightly worried that his record (criminally, financially) may affect the vetting process of me joining the Police, though that isn't why I want to cut ties.

I'm moving 4 hours north and I think that now could be a good time to cut him off. The only issue is that he has slight anger issues, and he has previous for suicide attempts. I believe he will try to kill himself if I were to cut ties. He already says he doesnt like life, he only lives to see me, and that is extremely infrequently now. He also knows where my mum lives, she's quite vulnerable and whilst my dad has a walking stick, I genuinely don't know what he could do. (I've seen him threaten and punch a couple of people.) He very well may blame my mother. I think he is in denial of the fact that I've grown up, and that I understand the world now.

This is such a difficult situation to be in. Barely anyone knows about it. My girlfriend of nearly 3 years knows little about it because she is from a really respectable family and her way of life is quite different. I absolute hate it whenever someone from her family asks about mine, it's an embarrassment to talk about. And that is about both parents, even if my mum has bought me up well. 

To conclude, I think I definitely want to cut my father off, but I just don't know how. I don't feel a connection with him, he hasn't really offered anything towards my life. I don't need him.

Please help me",04Sep2018,0

519,"My chihuahua Molly is about 15 years old and hasn’t been doing so well recently. We’ve had her since she was a puppy and in the past few months we’ve noticed a major decline in her health and mind. My family and I are struggling to decide whether to put her down or not. We love her to pieces and can’t imagine not having her here. We also have another dog that I know would be devastated to lose her. We don’t know what to do. We can’t tell if now is the right time for her or not. We don’t want to rob her of whatever remaining time she has left but also don’t want her to suffer. 

Here are her issues - she has a huge mammary tumor on her stomach that seems to grow bigger and bigger each week. It’s gotten to the point where it’s so big we are scared it’s going to burst. It seems to bother her and she tends to bite at it a lot. She’s very tiny and the tumor has gotten so big that when she walks she walks crooked and with a limp. She’s also gotten to the point where she can’t go up or down the stairs by herself anymore. We took her to the vet months ago but due to her age the vet said it would be unwise to operate on her. They basically told us there is nothing that can be done so we just took her home. 

Aside from the tumor we’ve noticed a drastic change in her personality. She’s started being more aggressive than usual. She used to let us pick her up but now if we even try she’ll try to bite us. She also doesn’t seem to recognize us much anymore. I say this because usually when I come home from college to visit once or twice a month she is usually ecstatic to see me and wants to be petted and loved. Now she doesn’t move when I come home and try’s to bite me when I try to pet her. Its like she doesn’t even know who I am. My mother who takes care of her full time says that she won’t even let her pick her up or pet her anymore.

My mom says that she seems pitiful most days but also has some good days. She still gets up to eat and drink and use the bathroom but doesn’t play or roam around anymore. When she has her bad days it’s so heartbreaking and it seems almost cruel to not put her out of her misery. But on the other hand the few good days she has makes us believe it’s not her time yet and she still has more life left to live, and that putting her down would seem like we were taking that away from her and giving up on her. She’s technically my dog so it’s my decision on what to do, but I just don’t know. I don’t want to let her down. I also don’t want her to be in pain. How do I know when the right time is?

TLDR; My dog has had a major decline in health recently. We can’t tell when the right time is to put her to sleep.

I want to write him a letter and leave it at his doorstep before I move at the end of September. Would this be a good idea? Underneath I'm attaching the letter.

 

A

I’m writing you this letter as an extension of goodwill. I had hoped we would get the chance to say good bye in person before I left, but that won’t happen. I want you to know that the time we spent together is something that I will cherish forever, and that you gave me some of the best memories of my life. I’ll never forget that night when we were driving back from Arizona and we saw that green light falling from the sky. That moment was so magical, and I’ll never regret sharing it with you. We shared so many memories, and there’s so many places I’ve been to now that I don’t think I would’ve gone without you. Throughout the course of our relationship we’ve had plenty of ups and downs, and we went through a lot together. You were so kind, patient and loyal to me, and I don’t think I ever told you how much I appreciated that, and everything else that you did for me. Part of my heart will always love and care for you, and I want you to know that I have no hatred for you, and will always think of you in a positive way. Though you have been cold to me after our break up, I have no way of knowing if that’s how you’re coping with the loss of our relationship, or the other pain that I know you have. I want you to know that I am still rooting for you. You’re a good person, and I know that you’ll figure everything out. I hope that you’re taking care of your mind and heart as much as you are your body(I noticed you’ve been dedicating a lot of time to exercising). If we’re meant to be together, we’ll find each other again, as we did when you called me 2 years ago. One day, I hope you feel that you can reach out to me, and we can become friends again. I really miss you in my life, not just romantically but as my best friend. I miss all the laughs we shared, and all the places we went together, and I hope that we can have that again one day. I’m sorry it took me so long to start therapy. I know that you worried about me endlessly for months, and I regret that I put you through that. I wanted to let you know that I finished the first month of DBT and finally started skills class! I My whole school schedule is set up so I can continue attending therapy and skills class twice a week, and I’m really excited about all the progress that I’ll be able to make!! I hope that you’re also going to therapy, and that it’s going well for you too. I hope that you’re staying healthy and cultivating new healthy hobbies. Remember that you’re not alone,that you’re loved and if you ever need anything, even just someone to talk to, don’t hesitate to call me! I hope we can cultivate a friendship one day, but until then I wanted to write you this. There’s so many things I want to say, and so many questions I have for you, but I wont bring them up now. I still hope I can read your poems one day. I really wish you nothing but the best. If you ever need me, you know where you can reach me, and my door at U\*\* is always open to you. I hope you come visit one day.

until we meet again,

523,"Currently I make 30k gross from my Vacation Rental PM gig. Honestly, I love the gig so far (6 months) , great hours, flexibility and I also never have to pay for Alcohol because of what the guests leave behind. It's a small company that consists of two co-owners and 2 full time employee while I'm the lowest on the totem pole. The only thing that isn't great about the job is that it pays 30k a year. I've been told they see me in a leadership role in a few years but I'm not entirely sure I want to make &lt;$35,000 for the next few years hoping for them to give me a significant pay raise.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a fierce desire to achieve financial independence through RE, hopefully STR's. My dilemma arises from being 50k in Student loan debt that I got from school to get my BFA in acting (please spare me, I've already heard it all). On one hand, I want to buy a small house ASAP and house hack it just to get started in the world of RE. On the other, maybe I should buckle down, find a better paying career  (go back to school if needed) and throw all my money at my debt. I currently live at home so I'd be able to do that but the latter option is certainly the least thrilling option for me. Who WANTS to live with their parents and siblings? Not me!!

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, going back to school doesn't seem like a terrible choice. I can get an associates degree on the cheap thanks to free community school for tax paying adults in Tennessee, awesome! If I can command &gt;$45,000 after a two year associates degree (or one year if accelerated) then that would seem like the smart path, no? If my goal is to achieve FI through RE then obviously making more money sooner will make me more money later.

525,"So I’m mainly looking for input from people with tattoos, but any advice is welcome. I have a tattoo in mind that I’ve wanted since I was 14 (18 now for reference). It’s going to be a small line tattoo of my favorite animal, and I have every intention of going through with it once I find a good time and place (I’m spending time abroad so if I get one here I want a place where the artist speaks one or both of my languages fluently). So that’s my intended first tattoo, just because it’s small, simple, and holds a lot of significance to me. Just to clarify, I’m not asking for advice on that one. So here’s where I want advice. A while ago, I went to get a piercing and my piercing guy was awesome so I followed him on social media, where he posts pictures of his work. In addition to piercings, he also designs tattoos and one that he designed really caught my eye. When I first saw it, I remembered thinking “holy shit that would be such a cool tattoo to have” but here’s the kicker: it has no personal significance to me. I just really like it. Like if someone were to ask me what the meaning of it was, I would honestly have to be like “oh I just saw it and liked it a lot so I got the tattoo.” Is it shallow to get a tattoo just because I think the design is cool? Should all tattoos have personal meaning behind them, or are they just considered pieces of art to put on your body? In addition, would I offend the artist if I told him I wanted his tattoo just to have something pretty on my body instead of some deep personal reason? 

TL;DR: looking for opinions on tattoos that are cool looking but don’t have deep personal significance ",04Sep2018,1

537,"TLDR at bottom

I work for an escape room that up until March of this year was run solely by the owners (two brothers) without the need of a manager. Last summer I got my friend (let's call him Joe) a job there. Joe is a good guy, nerd like myself, and I had no real problems with him at all which is why I wanted him to work here with me. Our jobs are pretty easy and we get paid well, so there's no real reason to complain about anything.

Flash forward to February of this year and the owners decide they need a manager. Joe, one other employee, and myself all applied for the position. I knew Joe had some previous experience at a shoe store being a manager so I even recommended that he apply. The day comes and goes and the owners let me know that Joe got the position only because he had the experience and I did not (the other employee wasn't even considered for various reasons and later quit because she didn't get it). Although I was hoping I would get the position, I was happy for Joe as I know he was falling on hard times and needed to be in a better financial situation and now he is. I congratulated him personally and told him there's no hard feelings, he was simply the better applicant.

As time goes on though, I started noticing that he wasn't quite doing the best job he could. We would run out of change (both coins and bills) and it would be many days after we let him know we were out before he would get it. We would run out of toilet paper, he would order some on Amazon and place paper towels in the bathroom. Then he would be surprised that the toilets got clogged from it. One day, I come in for my opening shift and he was scheduled to be there 30 minutes prior. I come in to find the whole store wasn't opened and one of the opening procedures done. I walk into the control room to find him watching UFC on the company laptop. This and many other bad things kept going on for months, none of it getting better. 

I brought many problems up to Joe and stated my disdain towards them, however they fell on deaf ears. He would agree with me, but nothing would change. So after a few failed attempts to get through to him, I decided I needed to reach out to the owners. Since I have a pretty bad memory sometimes, I made a list of specific events that I thought were concerning. They hired him to do a certain job, one that they could not complete themselves and that would solve problems we had. The fact that 4 months later after he was hired these problems still existed was an issue enough for me to justify reaching out to them. I spoke to both of them on a conference call and explained to them what my concerns were. I made it clear that I was not out to get him fired nor try to take his job. I simply wanted the problems we have to be fixed and him to do better. I believe he can do the job, but maybe with the lax nature of how things were when he was a simple employee, maybe he didn't quite know what needed to be done. The owners agreed and even said that they could be at fault because once he was hired they had a hands off approach and didn't guide or teach him things he should have learned to do. They scheduled a store meeting for the next month and a private meeting with Joe to discuss any issues.

The meeting was last week and I'm starting to see Joe do some out of character things. For one, he posted something on social media about ""what should I do about someone who tries to find faults in everything I do and even makes a list?"" Which was posted the same day his private meeting was. I I responded and told him that maybe he needed to talk to that person and clear the air. Maybe there's something they need to talk about, however he did not respond (maybe it wasn't about me, but the mention of a list makes that pretty convincing). So far, it seems like just in the few days since the meeting, he seems to be pushing for getting things done better, which was the whole problem to begin with. However, I'm concerned that the owners discussed with him how I brought up the issues and he took it the wrong way. There are many other examples I could bring up, however this post has already gone on much longer than I expected, so I don't want to drag this on.

How should I deal with this situation? I value him as a friend and want him to know that my criticism of his work is only constructive and that I want him to be better, but I'm worried that he will take it the wrong way. 

Tldr: got my friend a job at my work, he was chosen as manager over me months later and isn't very good. After discussing with him a few times about the problems, they go mostly ignored. I speak with the owners about the problems, they discuss them with him and now he seems to be mad about it as if I'm out to get his job.",04Sep2018,1
538,"So I met this guy online, both of us in our early 20's and we live pretty far away (like 2 continents away) but I still love talking to him. We've been talking for almost 4 months straight... everyday. He usually initiates because his schedule is more flexible than mine. 

So here's the thing, we seem to have a crazy good chemistry and at the beginning he was really flirtatious with me, like a lot. We've sexted and all, like 5 times and in our last time we shared nudes and he seemed to enjoyed those times a lot, specially the last one. After that, he's not flirtatious with me anymore. A month of not being flirtatious. Like it went down gradually in a week after that last sexting time but he still talks to me everyday and initiates the conversation, he's just not flirty like before. First I was still flirtatious and all but I just stopped because I don't feel it's reciprocated like before. I'm not looking for a relationship  or anything,  but I just noticed that change.

Do you think there's something wrong or what does it mean?",04Sep2018,1
539,"Hey guys, first post here and I'm tired so sry for the spelling mistakes to come.

So yeah the title describes it pretty well but maybe some context can help. I (17/M) live in Belgium and I speak French, English and Dutch(not perfect). I need the money because my family situation is messed up and I have other problems. So I know money won't solve these problems but I do need to leave the country as soon as I can which is probably in 10 months when I graduate from high school and turn 18y/o. I'll probably move to Canada and go to university there. The main problem is that the tuition fees are too high. 

What are the best ways to get a lot of money, as a teen, in a semi-short period of time? Should I get a low paying easy job or should I learn a new skill like programming or something else?

Thanks for reading and any help is appreciated. ",04Sep2018,1
540,"Hi reddit so I'm 19, and I'm currently in college, I took 5-6 classes every semester and skipped on my summer to take more classes be able to graduate with  my AS in computer programming/analysis as soon as possible to get the most out of my financial aid. Now I'm one semester away from graduation and I am informed by an adviser that the university I planned on transferring to, the one that I specifically changed my major for is now getting rid of there BAS program, which is what I was going to continue my education with. I found this out today and informed my mother about it she's making it seem like it's my fault because I didn't end up going strait to the university instead of getting my AS from a college.  I wanted to but I didn't get accepted when I first applied because I hadn't taken the ACT's only the SAT's. I feel like such an idiot because if I had just stuck with my major originally I wouldn't be in this situation I would have been able to have been Immediately accepted. I was getting my AA before and changed it because my first semester of class I took new student experience and we had to do research on what we were going to do the rest of our school career. I wanted to go into software developing and for the school I wanted to do it with, I needed my AS in computer programming so I ended up changing my major so that I would have the requirements to apply.  

I have no Idea what to do I want to continue my education at a university when I graduate and at this point I don't even have a preference for where. I talked to an adviser about it and she told me that my school plans on picking up the program but they don't know when, I told my mom that and she doesn't want me to continue with a college she wants me go into a university as soon as I graduate. 

The options that I have as I see it are, 

1. Once I graduate, I apply to the school I want to go to with an entirely new major in mind, and pray to god that I get accepted. 

2. I continue with my AS and wait until i find out when they launch the new program 

3. See if any other universities offer a continuation for my AS, and apply there

Honestly with my situation it's really just between one and two, I could really use some advice on this, and if you guys can recommend and schools to check out that wouldn't hurt. 

I'm in Florida, the school I'm taking about are UCF (the one that cancelled) and Valencia college (the one I""m currently at)",04Sep2018,4

The mother psychologically abuses her as well and as a result the girl is riddled with anxiety and depression. She's from the USA. As I said, the local police do nothing other than ""Listen to your mother"". I'm on the other side of the world and only a few years older, I don't know what to do and seeing her like this is killing me. I can't figure out a way for her to get out of this hell that she lives in.",04Sep2018,0
