1,"At work, our boss (and CEO of our under 50 employee company) tasked myself and three other coworkers with interviewing four candidates for a new position related to what we currently do. We all independently agreed on one candidate and believed he was perfect for the job. Our boss, after sitting down with him for 10 minutes and asking non-technical questions, said that he wasn't hiring this person ""because of his poor English"". The candidate was African American and spoke English as well as anyone else at the company. This position is internal and English skills were not emphasized as something that was a priority in this position. I believe that this is a concrete example of something that I've suspected for a long time, that my boss discriminates when hiring. I am angry about this, but unsure of what I can do to let this person know that discrimination occurred. More selfishly, what protections do I have if what I tell the candidate comes back to my boss?

2,"Maybe I’ve posted this here before, maybe not. 

My guy friend wants to be oppressed so much. It’s kinda funny. Apparently being oppressed is “cool” or something and I think that’s why he is doing it.

First thing he told me was that he was bi-racial. That means that he would have parents of two different races (example: Black Mom and white dad) this statement is soooo bullshit. Both of his parents are white af. He 100% not adopted and all of his grandparents are white. He is the palest guy I know.

Next thing he told me is that he was gay, but after a lot of drinks I asked him again and he says guys are nasty and he told me about a girl he really likes. So that claim that he is gay is bs too. 

Next he says he has a disability, but every time I ask him about it, he always is confused at first then is like “oh yea....”. That’s fishy on its own because if you are disabled, you wouldn’t just forget about it until someone brings it up right? Being disabled affects your life in a daily basis. Then  he explains the disability and it is a little different every time.

Then he claimed that he was trans and he was born as a woman and got surgery before we became friends after he graduated high school. That is bs because there are no chest scars where he would have gotten top surgery and his mom always shows me embarrassing videos of him running around naked as a toddler and he has a dick. (His Mom is weird don’t ask me about the videos)

It’s kinda funny because it is pathetic but actually pretty insulting because I am disabled and have to use a wheelchair and I am lgbt and him trying to be something that he is not is annoying and sometimes makes me upset.

I want him to stop so what should I do? Should I confront him? Should I just ignore all his texts and calls and once he asks me what’s wrong I tell him? Please let me know. I really want his to stop all this bs. 

Thanks guys ",20Feb2018,2

4,"Ok so my bday was at weekend and I got some bday money from my mum that's meant to be going on some new carpets for my house. We went away and my boyfriend said that what ever bday money I spend he will give it me back so I ended up spending 50 pound. Plus gave him 20 quid to go out with tonight.

7,"My girlfriend and I have been planning a nice Caribbean vacation with my best friend and her boyfriend (we are all good friends). While hanging out, my best friend somehow correctly guessed that I was planning to propose on this vacation and I was too dumb to vehemently deny.

I say I was dumb because obviously news this juicy doesn't stay under wraps for long and I get a text from her boyfriend. It turns out he was also planning to propose on this vacation.

So we are both kind of stuck in this wierd spot. 

We are thinking that no girl wants to have to share her proposal day with someone else - it's supposed to be a special day that happens once in your life and having someone so close to you also have this day is kind of thunder stealing.

We also think that even if it isn't the same day, having two proposals on the same vacation feels like it might make one feel cheapened. I think you could feel bad regardless if you were proposed to first or second.

Are these emotional speculations accurate? How would you (mainly asking women) feel if your best friend was proposed to on the same vacation? wtf do we do?",20Feb2018,1

10,"A little about me, 20M with a steady job and associates degree. My dream is to be in a famous/successful band. I'm in 2 of which, both are punk/pop punk. I know it takes a lot of work on my part to achieve my dream, but I don't believe that I'm doing enough to really have a shot at it. I practice about 4 hours a week not counting 2 band practices.
      I believe my lack of practicing and trying may stem from my long time hobby of playing video games. I can think on many occasions that I have plenty of free time. What I end up doing is playing the whole day away on Xbox and not on my drums.
      I also belive that I have other issues that stem from playing games a lot. I admittedly have a lack of friends and no girls in sight. In fact trying to actively make friends and chase girls seems like a terrible chore.

16,"Hi all, I came to this subreddit because honestly I don’t feel like I have anywhere else to go. 

A few months ago someone I was very much in love with broke up with me and completely shattered my heart. We remained friends after and while it hurt I felt like it was at least better than nothing. 

Very recently he expressed that he doesn’t want to be friends with me anymore or have any contact at all. Saying that he doesn’t even care about dropping me completely from his life. He won’t answer my messages asking for an explanation either. 

I also found out that I’m pregnant. We had been intimate throughout the months we were “just friends” and I haven’t been with anybody else. So it’s his for sure, but I haven’t told him.

I can’t keep this baby, not alone and definitely not in the situation I’m in right now. So my question I guess is should I ask him to provide half the amount of an abortion and never speak to him again? Or try and pay for it myself and just never say anything about it.

17,"So lately I've been thinking about situations when police may need to be called. Robbery, shooting, assault etc. Stating the obvious I know! But what I'm wanting to know is, when do you think calling the cops is really necessary? For example if you're fighting with someone or you hear of others fighting/arguing, etc. And restraining orders: What's involved with that? I've heard a lot of people tell me different things, about needing certain evidence or some other proof before police can issue a restraining order. And as for calling the cops: I've heard mixed opinions, stuff like being blacklisted if you're always calling the cops out after a fight or some such situation you may consider worthy enough for a police report or an emergency. So, how would you know that a call to the police is appropriate or just whinging? I'm talking about when you seriously need them of course.

19,"So im gonna start from the beginning. So one of my close friends (lets call him Dave), was turning 18 years old. I was invited to his party. I was pretty happy to go. When i arrived i was just making some small talk with other people. And i see my best friend (lets call him John) entering the room with his bestfriend from childhood (the girl i will be adressing, lets call her Mary). John and Mary are best friends since kindergarten they will never date, they even call themselves brother and sister sometimes. I obviously caught my eye to Mary. We sit down in a round table, me John Mary and other people we know. Next to her sat (lets call him Peter) and her best friend John. Although Mary is not the regular type of person you see everyday, she lives far away from here and she comes visit John in rare occasions. So i consider myself a good entertainer, and thus i started talking with the whole table, making everyone laugh, specially Mary. She was constantly looking at me while i was talking she was interested on what i was saying. By the time dinner ended we sang Dave happy birthday and so on. During the dinner i did not see Mary and Peter talking much, yes they spoke a bit but not too much. A random girl sat on Peters lap in-front of Mary so im not that worried. When the music started playing was when Mary started getting close to me. I was drinking with a friend of mine and she out of the bloom asked us what where we drinking, i responded i don’t even know. I asked her if she wanted some and she accepted. We started dancing together, it was very fun. Then John felt sick and went to the bathroom, me and Mary decided to sit down and let him recover. So me and Mary sat down together while John feeling bad sat on a personal chair and our other friends sat on another couch. They were all talking and kind of distracted, while me and Mary were talking about ourselves, we talked for about 1 hour and it was great! We stood up because John was feeling better and we went to dance again. I served her with a drink again, but she was accidentally touching my hands at that time it is Wierd to describe. We had a bit more fun talking and drinking while dancing. Now this part is where i don’t understand maybe im overthinking. I asked her a common question about food where she lives and ahe decided to go talk with me back to the couches where we were sitting. Alone this time. When she finished we went back to John and others to dance. John felt a bit worse at that time and they had to leave a bit early. When we were saying goodbye she held my arm tightly and slowly reached my hand and while i said goodbye, She let go slowly just like in movies while waving back. She looked at me for quite a few seconds on the goodbye. I really felt some connection there, that i have never felt before. Now that is over i have a few questions. 
1. Should I text her (party was saturday to sunday)

2. Is she slightly interested (she is single and is not interested in John whatsoever). The problem with this one is i dont know if she is interested with people from her town.

3. Im going to visit Johns old city before he came to study where i live. (His old city is were mary lives, im definitely going to be with her then. 

4. what should i do?

5. Should i ask John for help? Will he take it the wrong way?

20,"  I’m a teenager in high school. Before I go on, I should say that I am on medications and they work I guess, I’m way healthier than I used to be, but still feel hopeless and tired a lot of the time, and still find it difficult to do things, even the things I like. I told my psychiatrist but then said that it’s probably best not to change medications right now while I’m in school so I don’t sabotage my grades. I go to a therapist but she isn’t really helpful, all I do is rant and she talks to me in this perky way that seems so fake and I feel like she’s lying to me sometimes by exaggerating my accomplishments and giving me too much credit. My main problem with her is that she doesn’t give me actual advice, like tangible input that I can utilize outside of the office. She’s kind of like one of those “Ah. mhm? And How does that make you feel?” therapists. I talked to my mom about this, and told her that I want a new therapist, but she says that I should tell my therapist this? In my opinion, that seems dumb because why would I tell her that I want to fire her? Plus she’s really sweet and I wouldn’t want to do that. So I go less often to therapy because I feel like it’s a waste of time, now I only go every two weeks instead of weekly like I used to, and twice a week before that. I insist on a new one, but my mom is stubborn and won’t get one. I have no idea what to do. My medications are working, and I can’t get a new therapist, so I feel stuck. 
  Then there’s school. My grades are shit, I recently got into a college though which is nice, but still, whenever I look at my grades I feel like trash. I have time to improve them, but my transcripts are permanent and still scarred from my intense depression during the first two years. And I think about all the other people at my school who have 5.0 gpas and people who are good at math and apart of all these clubs, etc. I only do two clubs, three if I count one that counts as a class. I hang out with a lot of the “AP  kids” and it’s like a constant competition. I love my friends and they are probably one of the few reasons I haven’t killed myself yet. But my grades are mediocre, I have like a C+ average. And I know I could be doing so much better if I wasn’t depressed. My productivity is inconsistent and half-assed, and I am constantly coping, either with humor or by reading or watching films (which takes a lot of effort) or by sleeping. 
  I don’t know if God is real. I pray and I think I believe in God. I believe things in my life happen for a reason, in such an oddly harmonious way that it has to be divinely planned. I was raised Christian, but strayed away from it despite my parents enforcing it on me, and sometimes arguments result in screaming and tears and it’s never graceful. Sometimes I’d consider myself a Christian, but then I realize that I disagree with so much of the Bible. I’m pro-choice, pro-LGBT (I’m queer but I’m not counting that as a disagreement because I can’t really help that), and I hate gender norms, really I hate gender in general and want it abolished. I don’t think divorce is unethical. I don’t think pre-marital sex is unethical, nor do I believe that non-pro-creative sex is unethical. I believe in evolution. I believe in science. Yet I still feel guilty and afraid that I’m going to hell, amidst all this cognitive dissonance. I’ve considered like every other religion and none of them work for me. Living with homophobic and transphobic parents is certainly not helping this.
  Sometimes I believe the reason I’m single and haven’t found love is because God is punishing me for being queer, or that God isn’t giving me the opportunity to embrace and act upon my sexuality so I can be pure and then I’ll become one of those horrible “ex-gays” who rally as a prime example that the Bible is right. Logically, I know all that shit is inaccurate, but I still feel so afraid. And I feel so lonely despite being constantly surrounded by people. I’ve tried dating apps and nothing really works out. And I always crush on guys then realize I only liked the idea of them that I created in my head and not who they actually are. But there’s this one guy recently who doesn’t fit the idea, and I know he doesn’t, but I still like him. Yet nothing is happening between us. Objectively, I’ve been having a good 2018, I’ve won a few awards for Mock Trial and Speech, I was nominated on King’s Court for this Sadie Hawkins dance, and I got accepted into a college. Still, I feel like shit most of the time. 
  When I google “help I’m a teenager and depressed” etc., I get results that say to get professional help. And I AM getting professional help, and IT IS WORKING, just not enough. So I can’t do anything. I can’t tell if this will be my new normal for the rest of my life or I can genuinely improve. I’m not suicidal, I just really dread living out the rest of my life in a world where my worth is measured by my productivity and where everyone is fighting with each other while I get my paycheck and go home and continue to do so for forty years while being crushed by the weight of massive student debt. I need advice on how to get unstuck. ",20Feb2018,2

22,"Trigger warning:
I have this friend who is just at rock bottom of life. 4 years ago, she (at 13) had been raped by a brutal guy, leading to her start of having PTSD. Fast forward to now, she has a service dog, she was now finally getting somewhere where she deemed herself ‘normal’, she and her family moved more than 200 miles away, and she was starting to get out of her bad drinking habit. Then, she started getting texts, claiming to be the same guy from that time, and threatening her. Every time she blocked him, he would use a new number to block him. We both thought it was empty threats since he was so far away, but he was threatening her big time and saying he knew where she lived. I asked her to change her number, and when she did, not even telling anyone her new number yet, she gets a text from the guy. So now I realize she has a bugged phone and I tell her to stop texting on it and buy a new one immediately (she can’t).
   I then ask her to call the police because she had more than enough evidence for the cops. She says she won’t until she can proof it’s him and not just some troll. I agree with that. Biggest mistake ever.
  This recent Valentines, she was walking alone when he showed up. He kidnapped her, traveled more than 2 hours away, and then him and some other guys were just brutal to her for 2 whole days. Based on some evidence at the scene, it was most likely a Red Room. SWAT finds her in a terrible state, bring her to hospital to run tests, then bring her home that night. The guys still haven’t been caught.
   I understand that rape victims need a support system to really heal. She doesn’t have that. Except for me and her support dog, everyone in her family thinks she isn’t going to make it to her 18th birthday. It’s basically trying to talk to a wall with her dad, when his only response to what they did to her was ‘ok’. He even tried choking her yesterday when he was mad she couldn’t get food by herself. I have had to talk with her through all of this since she sees me as the only one to trust and had to get .... the answers that the police wanted to know. I just don’t know what to do. I’m just a kid myself trying my best to help this poor girl out, and I refuse to give up like her parents. I just need a direction or actual therapy methods to help her. Her family can’t and won’t afford a therapist and most psychiatrists don’t take on a rape victim since it’s hard for them to see themselves the same ever again. What should I do?

I was raped twelve years ago when I was 17 by two older guys that were brothers. I was drunk, very drunk and fell asleep in the oldest brothers bed. They both had to help me to the bed because I couldn't walk, I could barely stay awake. I was awoken by them during an argument between them trying to decide who would take my tampon out. I fell asleep again to be awoken by my tampon being removed. I couldn't open my eyes so I don't know which one pulled it out. The next time I woke up the youngest brother was on top of me, my leg was pinned against the wall, my clothes were pulled off and my shirt was up around my neck. He was sucking and kissing my breasts and fucking me, I said stop in a gurgled plead. I said please don't. That was all I could manage to say. I tried to push him off but my head was swimming and the room was spinning. He came on my stomach after the older brother told him to hurry up because it was his turn. I rolled onto my stomach and said I'm going to throw up. The older brother got a trash can and rubbed my back while I vomited. I fell back to sleep in my drunken stupor. I woke up again to heaviness on me. I was laying on my stomach, it was the older brothers turn with me, he kissed my face and stroked my hair shushing me to be calm. I started whining but it felt so good, I said no not again please, but he didn't stop, I kept slipping in and out of consciousness waking up when he made me orgasm. He wanted to fuck me anally and asked ""is this ok""? My response was a moan of drunken sick coming up again, I didn't throw up, but not a word was spoken and I didn't move, I couldn't. He started to rape me again this time in a way I'd never experienced before, anally. The pain was excruciating, I screamed ow and stop, he didn't stop but didn't take long to orgasm. They left me there in his bed. I awoke bloody and bruised with my head feeling like I was hit by a car. The younger brother had gone and the older was there still watching the football game with friends! He told me he didn't do anything that it was all his brother.

37,"I'm not sure where to begin. I've written this post like three times over because I'm not sure how to communicate this but I'll try my best to keep it short and sweet. I'm currently sixteen going through my sophomore year of highschool and I'm a complete failure. I'm not ready for adulthood.  I thought these problems would fade with time but they haven't gone anywhere. I guess that's to be expected when I myself seem to be my biggest obstacle. I have no motivation, I have no goals, I hardly show up to school on time if at all, I haven't done any schoolwork at home in years, I've never had a job, I haven't even gotten my driver's permit, I have anxiety that used to be as bad as ocd and daily panic attacks but now just remains as generalized and at times social with the occasional panic attack or ocd ritual. I just have no goals or directions, nothing to aim at. I have no fucking clue where my life is going. I've had these problems for years and they will not just solve themselves once I become an adult. I'm just completely lost. I tried filling this void with drugs and girls and obviously that's all ended in disaster. I know now I need to focus on myself and my goals and look out for myself before anyone else. I have some vague interests, politics, law, philosophy, basketball, writing. Not sure what the fuck to do with any of these though and there's no way I'm going to be able to accomplish anything unless I have the discipline to show up to school. All I do is self pity, I can't seem to focus on anything but my problems because I have nothing else to focus on. I'm frustrated. I've realized the only thing in my way isn't the system, or my parents, or my ex girlfriend... it's me. At the end of the day I only have myself to blame for my issues and I need to fix myself fast or my life is going to fall right down this hole and I'm afraid I won't be able to pick myself back up and I won't be able to function in society and I'll never be happy. I know I'm still young and ""I ain't seen shit yet"" but I've been through more than my fair share of troubles and there have been many times in my life where I've seen the world as a cold, dark, unforgiving nightmare that isn't worth traversing. I want to be better, I want to succeed but I'm just too damn lazy, undisciplined, and unmotivated. I feel like the work I do isn't worth it and sometimes I just feel like giving up. All I do with my free time is browse the internet, play video games, watch youtube and just turn off my brain. I feel like maybe I have the desire to be better and have the knowledge to know how to fix myself I just can't seem to implement. I'm not sure if this makes any sense at all but any suggestions would be appreciated. I want to turn my life around but sometimes I guess I have trouble actually taking any steps.

The thing is, my partner is very angry at me for wanting to move. They yelled at me and threatened to break up with me if I decide to go through with it.

41,"Hi all. 

I'm 19 years of age and I allowed my friend to borrow my car almost a year ago. He crashes the car and totals it. Nobody was injured but the car was totally wrecked. I won't bore you all with the whole story but the whole incident was, even by his own admission, entirely his fault and nobody else was involved. The very moment of the crash he promised to pay me back for the car. I have messages, texts and witnesses backing this up.  At the start he paid me back a few hundred dollars but then he fell under hard times and said he couldn't pay me anymore. I knew he had other debts so I had abit of sympathy. (The price of the car wasn't very much as I'm only 19 and was my second car, only $1000 is what he agreed upon for him to pay me back) A bit of time past and he continued to tell me he didn't have the money, but I saw him buying things for himself like clothes and alcohol for the weekend. At this point I felt very disrespected by someone I called a mate. I went overseas for a while, recently came back and asked him for the money again. He got annoyed with me for asking about the money and said I should just get over it. This really pissed me off.

I don't know what else to do. At this point he owes me $300. Which may not seem like a lot but I'm only 19 so it's still a large ish sum of money to a broke student. In hindsight it was a mistake to let someone use my car but he was a mate and I trusted him. What should I do next? Obviously I want to go about it legally. Should I just forget about my money? Do you think I should just cut my losses and learn from it all?

56,"SO, the thing is, ever since I´ve come here (I live in Medellin, Colombia), I´ve become pretty much dependant on the metro system. But a certain day, I saw one of those trains  coming to the station and saw his driver. It was a woman. She was really young, like 19 or 20 years old. I was stunned. That felt somehow uplifting. Then I started to notice all drivers from the system (including buses, trams, etc.), were all also young. Almost my age, I've always since payed a lot of attention to them; since I livea near a terminal, the drivers get down the train in front of me and change with another one. And I thought ""I want to be like this people"". They are probably not very recognized, but they make a really, seriously REALLY important part of the city. I think they're awesome, and really dependable, they look so stoic in their cabins, yet so happy doing it, and I thought I would like to give it a try.

So I foud out that the SITVA (system), had all this drivers because they employ people from colleges to give them the possibility to afford expenses they could not on their own, even the collegiature itself; and they go to the colleges to train those who want, so anybody can get there.

58,"I have a friend whom I have grown close to over the past year. She does many things that I find objectionable, such as readily sleeping with strangers she met online, meeting married men to find out if they are a cheater, etc. She interacts A LOT with people online, and had started to do so since a very young age. From what she says, a lot of those relationships have a sexual component to it. When she first told me about these things, I was very shocked to learn of it, but she tried to convince me that it is a common type of behavior and cited examples of other friends who does those kind of things (casual sex). I hate how readily she trades her sexuality for other things (companionship, a person to talk to), but at the same time felt that I am very ignorant about the culture of people who do those kind of things (friends with benefits, being a sugar baby, sexting with strangers), and so I probed her more and learnt more about what kind of things she does. The more I learnt, the less I endorse how she behaves, and hearing about what she does also makes feel sad, jaded and empty. Our views about love, relationship, marriage are quite different and I cannot accept her views so easily, and cannot help feeling that they are a bit 'weird', even potentially damaging to her. 

It makes me feel sad that she does not value herself very much by sleeping with strangers so casually, or by involving sex in a relationship so readily, and almost as if she is using it to trade for something. She also seems very set in her ways, and comes up with justifications for her behavior very easily. It almost feels like she steals a bit of my happiness and self security after interacting with her. I couldn't sleep at all last night after that conversation. It is just so screwed up. I think she has accepted her fate that her life is screwed.

I am 
1) convinced her behavior is not normal when I compare how she behaves with how other people in my age group in my circle of friends behave
2) not sure if I should try to help her if she does not want to help herself. If she does not want help and she know I don't subscribe to her views on these things, why is she telling me all these things?
3) exhausted from listening to her, and I have tried talking to our school therapist about it. So the next time she starts to tell me about her relationships, what should I say to her? Should I just say honestly that I cannot take it.

She is an animal-loving, gentle person, trying to make 'moral' decisions (according to her). and she is ambitious and driven, which I think is a trait I value in people. It's just this side of human relationships that I am quite deeply affected by. Am I being too judgmental, too naive, too pure, too conservative.....?

73,"(This is a long post, so I provided a **TLDR** at the bottom) 

I'm a 19 year old male and have an extremely close relationship with my mom. She's the most kind and selfless person I know and I love her more than anyone else in the world. She's done everything to ensure that I have a happy life (she divorced my father over a decade ago due to abuse, so I feel closer to her than my dad). When she accidentally found out about my fetish, I had a breakdown and have felt almost betrayed by her for making me feel so vulnerable and humiliated upon finding out. For your sake, I think its best to also know that I have severe depression, and possibly mild Aspergers.

So I have a fetish with khaki pants (plus several other things that are totally legal and harmless to other human beings). These fetishes have rendered me completely asexual by default. No women or men have ever done anything for me and I am completely rendered impotent in terms of normal sexuality, especially because of the fact that I developed most of my current fetishes well before adolescence. 

I probably have about 50 pairs of khaki pants and shorts and get an erection whenever I see guys (only guys) wearing them. I masturbate in them and wearing them are the only way I can orgasm. I've had so many close calls with my parents finding out about my fetish but my greatest and most ultimate fear was either of them finding out about my fetish. 

So I go to college and was visiting my mom's house for the weekend. Every time I go home for the weekend, I bring home a stash of khaki pants to masturbate in at night. I also brought home laundry to do as well. Yesterday afternoon, a close family friend asked to hang out with my brother and I. While we were gone, my mom stayed home to work or do chores. The whole time I was gone, I had the creeping feeling that my mom had found my stash because I didn't hide it very well and she has a tendency to do my laundry for me, despite the fact that I've been doing my own laundry for more than half of my life.

When we got home, my mom wasn't there, but I decided to take a nap since I hadn't slept well the night before. Then my mom woke me up. 

""What's with all the pants?"" she asked with the most clueless expression I ever encountered. She went into my room to get all the dirty laundry I had and found my stash.

...I can't even describe exactly how mortified I was.

I lost the ability to speak and gave my mom no answers. She then called my dad for emotional support after seeing me frozen in fear like that (I know this because she later told me that she didn't know how to respond to my reaction after I asked her why she called my dad to get involved in this). After he arrived, I locked my door. He tried coaxing me to come out of my room and talk, causing me to begin shouting at my parents and calling them every name and word in the book. My body was shaking uncontrollably. They momentarily gave up and talked about other family matters to distract them and help them process what just happened as I sobbed on my bedroom floor. I fell asleep crying and despaired. 

I woke up this morning unable to get out of bed. My appetite has been nonexistent. My mom attempted to ask questions here and there and give me something to eat, but to no avail.

What hurts me most is that my parents now think I'm a freak and the relationship that I had with my mom will never be the same. I told her I don't even regret calling her a ""piss-ant cunt"" because of how humiliated and exposed she made me feel, even though it wasn't her fault for causing this all to happen. This is especially significant, because in every past situation, I absolutely hated being angry with my mom, but now, I can't even have eye-contact with her because of how humiliated I am with myself and how angry at her I am for accidentally stumbling across my stash. I know it's my fault in the end for not hiding it well enough, but I can't help feel angry at her for even going through my stuff.

I made this account just to express how vulnerable I've been rendered and how humiliated and hurt I feel. How do I move on from here? How do I recover and not let this situation bother me too much? How do I stop being angry at my mother? Any advice answering these questions or any of the millions more than I can't ask regarding how to go about this will be thoroughly appreciated. Also, please let me know if you need more details that I need to edit or add. Thanks in advance.

**TLDR**: I have a very unusual sexual fetish. My mom found out by accident and now I feel like our close relationship will never be the same again, on top of feeling more vulnerable and hopeless than I ever have before. ",20Feb2018,3

Is there anything else to do aside from notifying it to the police/owners of the complex? I doubt they will be able to do anything if they don't know who it is. Same as me, really. I'm completely clueless about how people should react to these situations. 

If you have a ""creative"" solution, please share it with me. Thanks for reading.",20Feb2018,2
78,"I’m getting the increasing feeling he doesn’t respect me. When I tell him no or stop when he touches me he always makes a big deal of “why” “what” “what did I do?” 

He has been living with me for a little over a month but doesn’t pay rent, only sometimes pays for food. 

He has a job with my fathers communications technology company while he gets a PHD in the same field, it’s symbiotic so the company has access to the university labs for research. He is supposed to be living up there near the uni/company but spends time here and I feel like he is sneakily trying to move in, while he says he is looking for an apartment I think he is lying.

Lastly he is sick, I think it’s the flu and when I asked him if he got the vaccine he said no, after telling me months ago when I told him to get one that he had it. The biggest issue is my dad has a compromised immune system and I have asthma which can cause complications if I get it.

How do I approach this to see if I’m just being paranoid or if he is taking advantage as if he is the relationship will end.",20Feb2018,2
79,"Short background: have been friends for over 10 years. For the last year, things have been less than great. Were planning to move in together to save rent money, she backs out a month before we’re supposed to move in - leaving me one month to find housing (tough to do in so short a time where we live). I never hear from her unless her boyfriend is out of town and usually I end up having to drive to her since she refuses to drive to me.

So, most recently she agreed to watch my dog for me when I was traveling for work. I asked her if she wouldn’t mind just picking me up from the airport, bring him with her and drop us both off. The night before I’m supposed to fly back home she tells me she can’t pick me up from the airport because she has to go to the gym. Have to? Seriously? Fine, I handle it. 

For the last 3 months I’ve been studying for a huge certification exam. Finally took it and also passed. She is literally the only person who hasn’t acknowledged it, even though I’ve been talking about getting this certification for the last year. Got a text message from her - thought maybe she finally figured it out - but no? She asked me to watch her dog when she goes on vacay next month.

I feel kind of obligated to watch the dog, but I’m over her shit. Plus, it explicitly states in my lease that I will get fined $500 if they catch me with an unauthorized animal. Would it be totally shitty of me to refuse? ",20Feb2018,3
80,"Hello r/advice,

Sorry if my grammar isn't the best here, I can't properly think right now. I went to my college gym to work out. I placed my prescription glasses and my earphones in my down jacket, and the jacket in a cubby that the gym has. I worked out for about 45 minutes and when I went to get my stuff the jacket and the earphones and glasses that I put in there were gone too. The person working at the gym had no idea if someone took it, so I went to the campus police and filed a report on my missing items. Worst case scenario is someone stole my items so I would just have to buy new stuff, but I need my prescription glasses. I'm blind in one eye due to glaucoma and feel a lot of pain in that eye when I don't have my glasses, almost to the point of me having to keep that eye shut to stop the pain. Right now I'm typing this and I have to lower the brightness on my laptop almost all of the way down and it still hurts me to look at the screen. I have classes all this week, as well as online reports due and a senior design presentation this Thursday so I am completely lost at what to do. To most people glasses earphones and jackets are just items, but I had to walk home in the rain today in a T-shirt. My headphones help me exit from my stressful life and my glasses help me stop pain that I'm constantly feeling. I have no idea what to do so any advice would be very helpful.

TLDR: got my prescription glasses and other very important things stolen from me",20Feb2018,3

I know her name because the day afte we broke off he has her down as “in a relationship” on facebook( he doesn’t know I have it) and made a post on instagram( he doesn’t know I have it) about his “new gf” I said is she the one you were seeing before? He said yea he’s known her for awhile but she had a bf til recently and he met me He said” but if you ever change your mind and want to try again” I said “but you are in a relationship” and he said “I am NOT in a relationship😂Not yet!!!!” I said I’m not rdy for a rship and he said down the road maybe who knows where we’ll be, let him know if mind changes.

90,"So this is a longer one so I appreciate your time.
My boyfriend and I started dating in July 2017. I have a son from a previous marriage.
I’m 24 and my bf is 27. I wanted someone older because I am very mature for my age. I own my house, a car, I have a good job, I’m a good mother. I’m just looking for a good partner.
My boyfriend however, when we met did not have a job. Since July he has had 3 jobs. He’s now starting a 4th one tomorrow. He had a BAD habit of calling over, going late, and over sleeping. He’s even missed interviews and things due to sleeping. I’m worried he won’t keep this one but at least it’s a step the right way. 
He stays up all night playing video games, sleeps all day.
Occasionally he’ll help with house work but I usually have to ask him to do things like shovel or mow the lawn. 
He constantly talks about how hot other girls are and I’ve told him it bothers me and he needs to chill it out. 
When we fight he’s called me really bad things like “dumb c**t” and “fu***** idiot”. He hasn’t hit me, but he has pushed me against the wall.
I know I get angry and yell because of all these things so I know I definitly cause some fights but at the same time when I try and just talk about stuff with him, he flips and calls me nuts.
I’m torn because when we’re getting along it’s really good. He also is good with my son. I dated for about a year before I met him. Every guy I ever met was either just wanting sex, or didn’t want to deal with the baggage I had. 
I am just ready for a decent man, who will be my partner. I have my life together; I just want someone to add to it.
I’m not sure what to do... I’m stuck between being patient while he gets it together, and ending it because I’m not sure he’s ever going to.
What would you do?

Should I attempt to talk to the employee ever? Or should I try to forget it?

95,"Some background: I wasn’t always morbidly heavy, but after dealing with a rare type of cancer and a slow recovery from that, the weight has packed on (I weighed 170 when I was diagnosed). I then traveled over the road with my husband and the sedentary lifestyle added 35 more pounds.  Currently I’m at 311 (was 334 to start). We are off the road now, and the weight is really making me miserable. I’m tired of feeling like I have to hide from the world and miss out bc I’m ashamed of how I look and how out of shape I am. 

I started by adjusting my food portion habits. I then changed the types of foods I was eating (I try to eat mostly meats and greens and avoid most sugars). I feel like I’m on the right track. The weight loss is gradual, but consistent. 

I want to incorporate exercise into my lifestyle now, but I’m not comfortable with a gym or anything public. I started at home yoga with a dvd last month and am already noticing some positive difference. I can’t do all the poses due to having shattered my kneecap about 14 years ago (which is when the weight gain initially started, recovery from that). My knee has a lot of awkward metal in it. Anything that requires squats, jumping or anything similar is too much exertion on my knee and is extremely painful (feels like my inner knee is being stabbed). I can dance around okay though. 

Any advice on what kind of exercise I should do?  Is it ok to start out a few days a week and increase from there? Or should I do it every day but start at 15 minutes and increase? I’m pretty out of shape. Pretty much any advice is welcome. 

Please don’t be mean, I’m really trying to change my life. ",20Feb2018,7

Just to give you an idea of what I look like; my hair is buzzed, I have really broad shoulders and my clothes come exclusively from the men's section. Couple that with my deep voice and square jaw and I basically look like a man with tits. Although many people immediately assume that I'm a lesbian, I've only ever been into guys. The idea of masculinity is just very attractive to me, on myself and on other people. I don't think I'd like dating a girl simply because femininity is not appealing to me.

Me and the girl use to talk back in the summer and we almost started a relationship but things went sideways and we stopped talking.

For example every day she texts me good morning a little bit after she has woken up and we talk all day until night time. Around night she will either text me till she falls asleep or just ignore me completely even if she’s awake. Like out of the blue she will just stop responding until the next morning when she says good morning and will like draw something over iMessage related to the morning. For example today we were on face time till I had to go to work then I texted her I’d text her when I’m out and she said have a great day at work!! Then work ended and i texted her I’m out and got no response. So I have no idea if she likes me or not or what she’s doing or thinking. Should I just stop responding?

118,"tl dr; Went to college to escape bad parents, and college forced me to stay in the same city and commute from home to their satellite school. Currently on academic probation, but I don't see myself succeeding or being motivated to succeed any further. I took high school way too seriously without paying attention to my mental health and I'm still burnt out to this day. Been depressed for years, and not being able to get with a girl I wanted to be with at the main campus of my college is just the icing on the shit cake of my dissatisfaction in life.

So basically I only went to college because I wanted to escape my parents and finally stop being sheltered by them. I'm still living with them, and I don't even want to live anymore, much less continue on with college (don't worry, got a therapist and meds for that).

Last semester I took 4 courses and I ended up having to late drop one of them because I was admitted into a mental hospital for two weeks and the other courses I could make up. After leaving the hospital, my grades went into a downward spiral. 

My GPA went from a 3.0 to a 1.996, and the requirements for getting off probation are to meet a C+ for all the courses I'm taking right now. Problem is, I just don't care enough anymore about my classes to be doing more than the minimal effort to stay at a C-. I even lied to one of my advisors about some of the grades I got for quizzes because I couldn't deal with the fact that I just don't want to do college anymore. 

I barely study, work out, or pay attention as much as I used to, now that the depression has other ideas. I tried looking into accomodations the school offered for me, but honestly the best they could offer me were some meetings with mental health counselours when I already have a psychiatrist and a therapist I go to.

I just don't see a future for me after college. I don't see one for me having kids. And I don't see one for me with a spouse.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still trying, but all the self-doubt, low self-esteem, comparison of others to me, the sheer decline in my academic prowess, and the sharp decline of my ability to apply intelligence despite undergoing rigourous courses in high school are suffocating me (I am still seriously burnt out from doing extracurriculars, taking too many AP classes, and losing sleep due to alcoholic dad's nuisiances, my addiction to videogames as a compensation for my dead social life, and being used to having minimal sleep. 

I've tried and tried, but my brain just feels a heavy mental fatigue because I tried shouldering way too many hard burdens by myself in high school. Even after many months from high school, my fatigue has not gone away. I can't even express how I feel until I leave my parents' place for good; part of the reason why my therapy is going nowhere I need to be and why I haven't bothered changing my meds to a stronger concentration is because I don't see any improvement in my mental well-being while I'm still in the same shitty situation I've always been in and everything I've worked for has been in vain because I didn't even get in the college I wanted nor the main campus of the college I'm attending. 

And I only went to that college because I was thinking about a special person when I was half asleep writing my college apps. Honestly feeling like college was a waste of time. She's special to me, but clearly I'm not to her, so I don't have much reason to stay and keep torturing myself with college and depression. I have no one and nothing to fight for in college.

So what can I do now to make myself feel more satisfied about life?

121,"so I smoke pot, but I'm a bit disciplined in the way I smoke it. I used to smoke a lot more, as in 3-5 times a day, back in high school, but I've decided to keep it to a weekend kind of thing, only once on those days. I'm in college, I live at home and seriously it still surrounds me in all social groups i'm in. but anyways, I've bought about $150 worth of paraphernalia over the past month, of course my mom calling me and texting me that she doesnt approve of me buying that stuff because she can track my purchases. I'm almost 19 years old, and I'm planning on moving in with a friend over summer to move me out of the house I grew up in. I keep my smoking shenanigans as FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE from my mom, never smoking in the house, hiding it if I bring it home, etc. Recently I had forgotten I had left my stuff in my car last night, and this morning I woke up to my angry mom calling me a pothead.

All the stuff from my car was gone. There were no drugs, pot, or anything, just the rig, blowtorch, grinder, and jar (that had nothing in it) that I had. I ask her where it all is, and she refuses to tell me and when I asked her to at least pay me back and I seriously won't ever leave it in my car for her to see ever again, she blows up and tells me that she knows that's ""all i do"" which she knows is absolute BS because all I do is work, study, and go to school and never at home. I do pretty well in school, and have been generally pleased with how i've been living, so to treat myself I spent my owned earned money on paraphernalia, and whether you agree with the purchasing decision or not, you have to respect the purchase in the first place. My mom is stating that since the car is ""under her,"" that she doesn't want people to think she's associated with it. She claims that since I live in her house that I need to respect her rules on how to live my life. I'm just upset because she stole $150 worth of property from me, and fucking regardless of that I sleep in the same house, that doesn't give you automatic control over what my habits should be and that I need to just ""deal with it"" if she just took over $150 of my earned money. 

What do I do about this, she refuses to budge. Do I just accept this and that I lost a lot of money because I impulsively forgot to not be careful and put the stuff away, or should I try to fight her more on this? Because from how I see it, I dont have a good chance of winning and i'm not gonna get anybody else involved in this because that would just be wasting their time with something stupid. We argued but it was very angry and more just rationalizing each others own point of view and it just left us both more pissed off. ",20Feb2018,3

124,"tldr: please just read if you're going to reply

I've been with her for 5 months and it has been the greatest 5 months of my life. It's long distance as were 1,000 miles apart but we've both loved it. I'm a freshman in college and it's my first relationship. Often times at first, I was intimidated by her ex of 5 years and large amount of sexual partners, especially both of us being only 19, but she has been nothing but loving and trustworthy.

Around thanksgiving I didn't go home because of distance reasons and she did. On her second day back, she skyped me late crying and rather drunk saying her ex was texting her trying to get back together. She said she texted him saying they were both in relationships. She also said hes done this twice before and she believed him those times but he fucked her over. We weren't together those two times. She said she was tired of him fucking her over and just wanted it to end. She told me this didn't effect our relationship and she was only telling me because she wanted to be honest. She was really upset about it and I was understanding because they had been together so long. She didn't elaborate. I didn't ask. She didn't mention him again. This was barely a month into our relationship.

Flash forward to 2 days ago. She's visiting me at my university. I snoop on her phone and find the messages. Over thanksgiving break she had texted him a few sexual messages, said she missed him, asked to skype, and said she wanted to see him. 

I confronted her and she said it was a misunderstanding. That she had been trying to catch him trying to get her back so she could send the messages to his girlfriend. She said she wanted to fuck him over. It was only a ploy and she said she was sorry. The texts I saw it was only her starting the conversations but she says he always started them on snapchat and it carried over to text. She had screenshots of other messages but said she talked with a friend and decided to just let it go and not send it. She didn't have any texts from him since then, and if she had deleted anything I'm sure she would have deleted the sexual messages as well so I don't think they've talked since then. She says she hates him and denies anything being sincere. Also saying she did NOT have sex with him.

Shes been so open and amazing but I've just had weird feelings for a while about how she acts. She likes attention from people but I don't see her as ever being a cheater. This came out of nowhere and I don't know what to do. I want to hang on and I want to believe her but it just feels like it doesn't add up. I may not be conveying this story very well but I desperately need advice. Am i being delusional that she's telling the truth??? Please help. Don't just reply with a quote.

126,"I started working at a pizza place in town as a delivery driver about a week and a half ago. This is not my first delivery job, and I've worked at two previous establishments for over 5 years. 

Some stuff has been happening, an I don't know how I am supposed to approach my GM about what happened today. It crossed my mind to walk out and not come back, but that was in the heat of the moment. 

The manager, a 17 year old kid who boasts about dropping out of school and smoking weed at work, has almost shorted me out of a $20 tip a couple of days ago. I realized what happened and I was told that I had to talk to the GM to get my money since it was a very large plan-ahead order. I ended up talking to another manager that was irked that he didn't fix it the night it happened. She said, ""He is supposed to fix it that night. I don't know why he's still a manager."" Also, I was the one who pointed it out, and, if I didn't, it would have gone unnoticed. 

The next day after that, I had a weird feeling I made less money from my tip out, but I just decided to mention it lightly and he said that it was correct. After all of this I wrote down each address and how much I was tipped so there would be no question in my mind. And today, I was supposed to make $37.93 but only walked out with $19. I said something doesn't seem right, and he said that I was given all that was left over. I keep my money in the bag that they give me with the $30 ""bank"" to make change. He instead got mad at me because I didn't have the correct three $5, $1, and coin change and told me that I need to start doing that. I asked him how am I supposed to make change? I get larger bills from the customer and give out smaller ones in return, and he questioned if I gave out the wrong change by doing my math wrong. I don't like the way he spoke to me, and this isn't the first time he's been rude about something.

I have never had problems with missing money in the past. When we did run into a problem at previous jobs, it was mainly due to a run being switched when we were very busy or an order not being ""bad ordered."" If that happened, who ever was in charge would sit for up to 30 minutes with whoever it was to make things right. 

I am not accustomed to the way they tip out because he wants me to give him all of the money I have and I receive the difference. I usually don't and I will sit and count it out with whoever is there, but today he was slightly adamant about just taking it to the front to tip me out while I finished the rest of the closing duties because he wanted to get out early.

I am not saying he stole it necessarily, but it's clear there is some sort of error. I feel like if I go up to my GM and say this, he might think I am accusing this guy of stealing from me. I'm not and just want to figure this out. I don't give out the wrong change and am very confident beyond basic math skills. His hours have been cut before, and I am not sure why but is clearly due to some inability or behavior. I just have a bad feeling that he's either dishonest or just doesn't care.

How should I approach my GM? Thank you.

TLDR; Was shorted on my tip pay out tonight and have only been working here for 1.5 weeks. Not the first time, but I caught it the first time it happened a couple of days ago.

It was really stupid of me to do, and I regret it. The friend has turned really toxic recently. My sister has no clue that I shared it. I can't imagine how pissed off she would be if I told her because I'm incredibly naive... I was hoping I could find a way to lock the friend out and be done with the ordeal (the friend uses an iPod Touch). I'm scared of this friend, and I don't think I could just talk to her and say to get off. I thought if I deleted her profile, then the friend would get the point that she might've stayed too long. She didn't get the point and instead decided to make a new profile with the passive-aggressive title of ""non-grata"" which means ""person not appreciated"". I deleted the profile again so I could really nail-down the fact that maybe some outside force is like ""HEY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG HERE AND MAYBE I WAS AN IDIOT FOR DOING THIS!!!"" 
I'm too scared to face her, but I feel like I should. What should I do? Try to lock her out? Make an excuse for her to get off? Regardless, I'm terrified. Thank you in advance for any advice.

129,"I'm a straight guy (on reddit no less), and I want to get married and have kids one day. 

Problem is, I'm disgusted by makeup (mostly lip stick/gloss, I can deal with a bit of eye or face makeup), piercings (including ear), and nail polish. I have been ever since I was a little kid (I have a distinct recollection of being 5 years old and feeling really grossed out by my mom putting on makeup). I have no idea why I'm like this, but I can give the reasons why I feel like this.

Basically the reason for me finding makeup gross boils down to what happens to it. With lipstick/gloss, the woman using it is basically eating it over the course of the day, which I find pretty gross since it's made of a bunch of chemicals, and if I kissed them then I'd eat some too. I'd bet that if you saw someone take a bite out of a lipstick that'd be pretty revolting and it seems to me like using lipstick/gloss is basically the same thing on a smaller scale.

Nail polish is similar, since I've seen chips of it come off into food and stuff. It's not as big of an issue for me though.

Piercings are probably what I have the most trouble with. It's sticking metal through your effing skin, I fail to see how everyone just goes along with it lol.

Obviously, you can see why this is a huge problem. I have one semi-friend who's a woman and whenever she wears earrings or makeup I just feel grossed out, obviously I realize it's silly so I do my best to overcome it, but in my current state there's no way I could be in a relationship unless I find someone who doesn't use and won't use these things in the future, and it seems pretty unlikely that I'd happen upon someone like that.

130,"20 years old, male, college student.

Recently I've been experiencing some depression.  When I was younger I also would have these stages but as I have gotten older it just gets meaner each bout.  There's a list of things that contribute to it.

When I was 16~, I was diagnosed with a form of muscular dystrophy.  I had surgery on each leg when I was in 9th and 10th grade, permanently taking sports out of my life.  I played a lot of sports, still a fan of baseball and football.  That hit hard because I have had serious trouble walking (stairs), long distance, standing for long periods, etc.  Eventually I could be in a wheelchair and that scares me and makes me want to cry.

I was a huge drug dealer in high school, (mostly weed), with a group of friends.  We lived crazy, and it's not something i'm entirely proud about but it'll stick with me forever.  I have a lot of friends that are dead, out of my life, or I don't even know what's happened to.  I ended up getting arrested first year of college which changed everything. I was expelled from college for my arrest but luckily got off with a good deal from my lawyer and awesome parents help.  I bent the rules a lot in High school and like I say, it was bad.  I wish I could change it all.  

I recently came back from this arrest, completed 6 months in a college drug court program, gave up everything and 90% of my friends, stayed clean and did it all.  I am again a student, making great grades and all.  Majoring in Accounting.  I am proud of this but since I graduated the program I am again back to smoking weed.  I haven't used any other drugs, even drank.  I will never sell weed again.

Throughout all this, right before I was arrested last year, I met a girl.  She goes to a different university but we've gone to HS and middle school together since we were young, reconnected over Winter Break Freshman year of college.  I dated her very seriously for a year, the most amazing person.  Things had been off-and-on towards the end, but it ended badly.  She honestly took advantage of me, just wasn't cool, did some stuff - whatever.  It took me by surprise and I always have trouble handing things when someone crosses me.  I go the extra mile to let you know I don't appreciate what you did.  I did that.

On top of this my mom has cancer. It has gone well, things are clearing up and she is looking good. This happened maybe 4 months ago, during the drug court.  This hit me hard and I don't think I probably reacted to it normally at the beginning of the news.  It's taken it's toll on me but I am feeling good and I am glad she's going to be okay.

All of these things have just hit. I am not doing well.  I go to school and try hard and make the grades - I owe it to myself, my family, my future, and everyone to graduate college and make a successful career for myself.  But I am not happy.  I don't see the big picture right now.  I don't feel like I have any friends at my University after everything that happened my freshman year (arrest), and the entire change I have taken as a person.  I listen to music all the time but recently but it's been all mellow and sad.

So I really really like romantic stuff (ie in fiction, hearing other people's stories, etc) but... I've never been able to experience it for myself. I had a sparse few crushes in middle school, but even those were almost all on celebrities/fictional characters rather than people I possibly could have had a chance with. But since high school I haven't even had those. I can manage vague physical attraction towards someone, but it's not lust, there's not really any emotion, and it's pretty much just, ""eh, he's got a handsome face/nice ass. cool.""

I've never felt anything towards guys I see on a regular basis (and I've even tried to convince myself that I like them. ""look, he's nice and handsome! have feelings! It doesn't work). I've never been in a relationship or even flirted/been flirted with, or approached by anyone, which definitely doesn't help how I feel.

I definitely *want* it, I fantasize about both sex and non-sexual intimacy (eg cuddling, kissing, going on dates, etc) almost constantly, so I don't think I'm aro/ace.

I'm wondering whether my horrible self-esteem and likely depression could be a factor? I do have horrible body image and can't imagine anyone possibly wanting me, but it seems unfair when my other depressed/anxious friends are all in relationships. This is why I haven't tried dating apps though, the concept scares me. Knowing myself something like tinder would just make me anxious and nervous because I have such shit self esteem and I hate the thought of people judging and evaluating me based on my looks.

I know this probably seems really silly and stupid compared to people that are struggling with unrequited feelings or bad relationships but... it's just really hard when everyone always talks about love as the most powerful and amazing feeling in the world and you can't imagine experiencing it. Like song lyrics about intense love/lust really get me down b/c I want that for myself so so badly, and I'm really scared it's something I'll never experience. Like what if I never fall in love? Or I'm never passionate about anyone? That's terrifying to me. I know people say to wait but I've been waiting for years and I'm tired.

Now that I'm 18, I've started to grow a patchy beard. I can grow a magnificent neck beard, but struggled with cheek growth, so I decided to trim it with an electric razor. Let me be clear, I don't want to be clean shaved, just want to wait it out with a short neck beard until I have some cheek growth so that I can grow a decent full beard. My mom caught me doing this about 2 months ago, so she took it away. I thought, no problem, I'll trim with scissors, but let my beard grow a bit longer. Been doing that for about 2 months until today, when my mom caught be again. Now she got really angry at me, saying that everyone will think she's a failure since she's a full Sikh, and I'm out here cutting my beard, not following Sikh traditions. Get this, what other family members think of each other is huge not only in Sikh, but in Indian culture in general. I tried to explain that I hate having a patchy beard with uneven growth on cheeks, but hair under my chin. I will keep a beard, but it'll just be trimmed and short. She had none of it, and now she told me that she'll disown me if she catches me again. She'll literally check my face everyday now. 

Some of you might think that this is just no biggie, that I should just suck it up and grow a neck beard. A part of me agrees with this, but I don't know how to deal with peer pressure of other guys who trim their beards. I've be on the receiving end of ""greasy beard"", and ""terrorist"" jokes in the past from classmates, where only 1 of them are actually Sikh. I generally don't care about them, and I'll laugh them off because it rarely happens to me. I'm just worried that these jokes will increase as well with time. Should I just follow through with my mom?

I was stupid and didn't make a contract or a recording, just took her word for it.

Well the phone is gone (she didn't know the guy it was sold to) and I ended up having to pay the entire bill (over $1000) she later left the province. I did not receive a cent from her. I ""blacklisted"" the phone so it couldn't be used, but I always wonder if there was more I could've done? This was last year, but a regret that still haunts me to this day. 

And please, no posts telling me how stupid I was, I know I was. I have bi-polar and I did it during a manic phase. I was also really naïve and dumb and just wanting to help someone I thought was a friend escape abuse. I know better now.

Thank You!",20Feb2018,4

I play magic, I read the strats and rules/guidelines for effective deck building, I lose 7/10 games I play. I'm just really sick of no matter the work I put into something I can never get better than beginner level. I'd trade all of my skills I'm okay at for one thing that I was really good at.

They offered him the job after interviewing &amp; we were ecstatic. I have been so depressed living in this cold, miserable, lonely city, I almost cried with happiness about moving. Then they let him know he needs to come in for a drug test next week, including hair follicle. He is an occasional smoker. We live in a state where it is legal. He only smoked a few times a month ago. The test goes back 90 days. I am not even sure if it will be a deal breaker for the job.

"" If you were born poor, it was not your mistake. But if you die poor, it is your mistake.""
1. Many successful people died poor. Success is not measured in money. It is measured in positive effect we have on lives of others. 
2. Many people are poor because they are not given a chance. 
3. A friend of my parents spent his life savings on the love of his life when she fell sick and had no medical insurance. He died poor but he was happy.

164,"Bear with me, this is my first post on here and probably going to be a pretty long one... 

For some general background, my boyfriend and I met on a dating app and have been together for almost a year.

 About 3 months into our relationship, he began having issues with sexual performance. He said it was just a psychological thing and that once it started happening it was very hard for him to be fully in the moment and not think about it. These issues continued for about 3 months pretty consistently. I would say that we did not have “successful” sexual relations more than a couple times over this period. 

As you can imagine, this was very hard on us both. Obviously moreso on him than me, and I’m the first to admit that. But, it did take quite a big toll on my self esteem and confidence. Even though I tried to think about it rationally, I was pretty distraught with thoughts that this might never get better and maybe I’m just not good enough or he doesn’t really like me, etc. 

On another note, I wasn’t getting what I needed sexually. There wasn’t a ton of effort on his part to make up for the lack of intercourse in other ways. 

My thoughts began to slowly wander to “you know you want to stay with him and make this work, but it’s not getting better. Maybe if you hookup with someone else, just one time, it will help restore your confidence and you can hang on for a little longer.” I had somehow convinced myself that I could continue on in the relationship if I just gave myself one free pass. I figured I would get the boost in self esteem that I needed and also quite frankly, satisfy my sexual needs too. 

One drunken night, I decided to follow through with my (extremely dumb and selfish) plan. My ex had been calling me a lot recently (I had not been answering), but I decided to pick up this time. He invited me over to his place and I went. We became physical and I ended up cheating. 

Honestly, I felt about 10% better during the physical act and then 100 times worse after. I knew that I had messed up so bad and didn’t sleep for weeks. I just felt regret and tremendous guilt. 

I realized quickly that if I felt I couldn’t deal with the issues I should have just been transparent about it and left the relationship if I came to that. Instead I did something dishonest to give myself temporary satisfaction because I was hurting. 

You can feel free to comment that what I did was wrong and selfish (you’d be right), but I already know this full well. I hope most of the focus of the comments and advice can instead be on the rest of this post. 

Anyway, I confessed to my partner a couple months later. I told him what I had done and was careful to fully apologize and acknowledge my wrongdoing thoroughly before explaining any of the thoughts going through my head at the time. I did eventually tell him my reasoning (again, I know it was very flawed), because it did contribute to the action and that is objectively true.

We made the decision to stay together and work through it.  This was a huge, huge act of maturity and grace on my partners end. It was really hard, but the more we talked it out, our relationship actually strengthened in a weird way. There were incidents of crying and upset for weeks (completely understandable), but we were able to establish a more open dialogue about our emotions as a result. 

Fast forward a few months, and my boyfriend decides to play what he thinks is a funny joke on me tonight. 

I get home from work and he holds up an open condom wrapper in my face. He says “what’s this?” I look at him for a couple minutes in utter shock and confusion. He goes “haha I’m just kidding, I just left this here on the floor from last night by accident.” He immediately apologized and said he knew what he said was stupid and he regretted it. 

I’m torn and don’t really know how to feel. On the one hand, of course what I did initially is what caused all of this. I accept full responsibility for that and still feel guilty to this day. I also know that as part of trying to make this work long term, I need to allow him to have outbursts every now and then and do what he needs to do to heal. 

However, another part of me feels like we both agreed to stay in this and try to make this work, and him intentionally playing with my emotions that way is just really not constructive and seems unnecessary so many months later. 

 It also makes me feel like he’s intentionally trying to instill some feeling of fear and exert power over me, even though he claims it was a joke. What made this worse to me was that literally 15 minutes before, we finished up a really great and productive convo about how we can better handle conflict resolution in our relationship and continue to be more open about our feelings. This felt like a slap in the face after what I thought was a really important and meaningful conversation. 

Do I need to just suck it up, take his word that it was a joke and accept that my actions caused this to be a thing in the first place? Or is he being unfair by intentionally making jokes about a subject that is clearly not funny and doing it right after I put a lot of thought into another conversation to help further strengthen our relationship?",20Feb2018,2
165,"Yesterday I finally decided to stop trolling r/ relationships. I used to spend 6-8+ hours daily writing fake posts, gathering data, putting it on multiple spreadsheets, graphing it, etc. It was an addiction. I couldn't study for tests, and it reached the point where I skipped a class to write a post.

I wanted to slowly ease into writing less posts a day, eventually getting to zero, but I was forced to stop immediately. 

I'm not handling it well. I came home today, felt extremely depressed, and took a 4 hour nap. This fucking sucks. I feel so tempted to write a fake post, but I know that's not how I'm going to overcome this. I feel so incredibly fucking lonely, despite having a lot of real life friends. I think it's because I used r/ relationships as a way to get emotional fulfillment, and now that I've been forcefully cut off from that I'm not being satisfied. I feel like the only thing that kept me happy was coming home to hundreds of messages from random Redditors. 

I don't know what the fuck to do. How the hell do I keep myself distracted now that I have 6-8 more hours of free time every day?

167,"(Sorry it's so long, apparently I don't know how to keep it simple.)

 After deciding on a pathway for life, I get really keen on it. I feel like I'm finally ready, finally not scared anymore. But as soon as I reach the outcome of the decision I instantly want the other life back. 

For some backstory, in high school I was a pretty high achiever, the smart quiet kid. I didn't know what I wanted to do in the future so I just focused on what I enjoyed - media and design. The plan was to apply for a graphic design course in university. When it came down to applying, people around me starting voicing their concerns about the job prospects, so I pursued a more general course that would allow me to study a few areas that I was very passionate about. I was accepted, but looked and felt miserable every time I came home. I decided it maybe wasn't for me, and dropped out 3 days into the course.

I'd like to think it was fate that I dropped out, as a few months later my life was turned upside down with a massive family issue. I had to take on a lot more responsibility to care for my family, but once this calmed down I was left unemployed, with no previous work history and no confidence in anything. Just regret and sadness. I tried very very hard to get a job but was never given a chance. My friends were all succeeding in life while I was left behind, disappointing everyone.

I joined a class to help with self motivation and it taught me a lot about myself, why I feel so terrible most of the time and how to be positive. It helped me to decide that I wanted to give studying another try, with something that will leave me more job ready (teaching). I felt so passionate about it, and finally happy with where my life was going. I visited the motivation class provider when I was accepted into the course. Instead of congratulating me they insulted me, berated me, told me I'm not normal for my age, and made me cry, because I didn't have a job. I left and never went back.

The issue with that was, I didn't get accepted into my 'ideal' teaching course. It didn't allow me to take the units I wanted, as it taught a much younger age than I wanted to and may add a whole extra year to my study. It was also at a completely different campus. Everyone was questioning why I even accepted the offer. But I was trying to be happy with it, as I was at least going to be doing something.

Fast forward to now. I just had my first day, and I'm already feeling the dread coming on. I'm rethinking the whole commitment and career path even though I know I can do it. I had a panic attack this morning because I had to travel alone, which I hadn't done until today. Even though I've been given this amazing opportunity, and have the ability to succeed, something is pushing me back. While I'm at university I'm okay, but as soon as can leave, I do. I don't stay for anything extra. I have no friends there and I don't really have the desire to make any. I just want to get past this stupid indecisiveness and pick something that works for once. I've always been like this and it's really ruining any chance of me having a life. Everything's just so overwhelming when it shouldn't be. I'm stressing now because I don't know where the entrance to one of my buildings is and it makes me not want to go at all. I don't know what exact question I'm asking, I just need any advice to help me with these feelings I'm having.

I really don't want to fuck up and quit again.

So this just this Saturday I had my prom. My date was someone I didn’t really know that much, basically I was kinda forced to bring her because she was the friend of my friends on my table. I didn’t enjoy prom much because the people around me were busy talking to each other and any effort i’d try to make would be nothing because i’d be ignored by my friends. Everytime i’d try to talk to my date i’m unsure what to say to her because we’re just acquitances and our usual conversations would just be a simple how you doing and such and she would continue to talk to her friends in our table. Monday came, school is back and my friends are talking about how prom was so good and here I am being sensitive suddenly feeling bad on how I didn’t enjoy it. I had no choice but to bring my date or else they’d had ill feelings with me or they’d call me picky. On top of all of this I currently have so much school work to do to the point that I literally have no sleep just studying and doing homework.

So I've been able to be more supportive of her lately, because I know I should be.

She is now in a situation with a friend where she shared something with someone else that was told to her in confidence. The same thing we've argued about.

So far, I've been supportive, but it concerns me that she still hasn't figured out that she loves to gossip. Her biggest problem with her friend right now is that her friend says she can't trust her anymore, but my SO doesn't understand why.

Do I continue to feign support, or be real and bring up her history with things like this?

183,"I just don’t know what to do anymore... I’m so confused right now and I don’t know if what I’m doing and thinking is right or terrible. Basically I have a ‘friend’. One of those friends that is well... annoying and clingy (look, I know I’m an absolutely horrible person to think this but I just need to say it all or I’m gonna explode). Whenever I’m talking to my other friends she’ll but in and try and divert my attention from them, interrupting our conversations, and during class she will constantly call out my name to try and get my attention, making it difficult for me to do stuff. Not long ago I found out she had a crush on me. Look, I’m not homophobic in the slightest but as a completely straight girl, I just don’t feel very comfortable around her sometimes nowadays, even though she knows I’m straight(I know how bad that is but I just can’t help it). I’m not even sure why we are friends, because to be totally honest I find this person very annoying and she always drains my energy and stops me from being able to spend time with my other friends. We’ve never been best friends or anything, but we hang out in the same group( a group of around 30 ppl). I guess she’s always tried to be friends with me in particular because I always try and make her feel included and I put up with her and all. Recently she began to confide in me that she was really depressed, she said that she feels like no one likes her or would ever want to be her friend, naturally I assured her that she was awesome and I really liked her, I tried to hang out with her more and support her. I felt so guilty because the truth is that as much as I want to genuinely like her, I just couldn’t. She kept confiding in just me, and I kept trying to be a better friend to her. It started getting to the point where she was getting too ‘close’ to me, so I tried to back away from her a little to remind her I was straight. Today, she told me she wanted to kill herself. I don’t think she was attention seeking at all. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m so worried about her I can’t even sleep tonight and I’m lying awake crying. Even though I find her annoying, she’s a great perso. I know I have to help her as much as I can but a selfish part of me is telling me that I have to preserve myself. On the one hand I can put all my effort into helping her(the obvious option), but this will mean I’m going to have to distance myself from my best friends, because she will undoubtedly hog all my attention and constantly drive me away from my friends, but I don’t even gain any happiness or fun from being her friend(Oh god I’m such an awful person, wow). Everytime I spend time with her I feel so depressed and emotionally drained from trying to be the friend that she needs. On the other hand I could carry on with my life, being kind to her, but not giving her the amount of attention she needs rn and look after myself and carry on being able to be with my other friends more, (she wouldn’t want me to be hanging with them much because she doesn’t want everyone knowing her problems). The real question is a morale one I guess. Should I value someone’s life more, or my own happiness. The answer should be obvious right? This girls life, yet this part of me says I need to keep myself happy so that I don’t fall back into the sadness I had since primary school. I don’t know what to do, are either of these options valid or should I be doing something completely different?",20Feb2018,2

Was it just like a heat of the moment kinda thing? Well we agreed to continue our friendship with all the sexual benefits. As time went on I noticed that she started texting me casually everyday instead of trying to make plans for use to fuck. Well lately we've kinda been diving into our past with each other. We share stories of our lives and sometimes little secrets. She vents to me and tells me there's times that she misses me, and I can't lie there are times that I miss her, as well. Last night we got into a fight and she called me really late, saying how she had this really bad feeling that she was going to lose me. We both have a lot of trust issues and stuff from past relationship though, and I'm not trying to be like her ex, even if we aren't actually dating. She's an old soul and is really amazing. I don't want to like try to ask her on a date only to be turned down and then lose a friend.

205,"I am a college student and I recently reconnected with a girl from my high school who was a grade ahead of me. We were not strangers back in high school, but I recently messaged her wanting to catch up on things and see how she has been. It has been a month of messaging back and forth, it is not constant probably a handful of messages sent back and forth a day due to our busy schedules with work and class. 

At first, I didn't think anything of it because I figured we were just making conversation. Now I am finding myself eager to message her and find out about her day and what not. As far as personal details go we have shared some, but not a lot because we both know each other fairly well. 

I am wanting advice on what to do next. Here is my situation..... I want to take this to the next step and see if we can work out a relationship of some sort. I would have no problem doing so, the problem is that she lives over 4 hours away at some college. I did mention getting together in person during the break, but it seems that may not be for a while, unfortunately. 

I do not think it would be awkward bringing up my thoughts and ideas to her about this, I would rather do it in person. I think randomly showing up to her college would be very weird and I do not think I could find the time between work, school, and studying to drive 4 hours to visit her. 

My gut is telling me to go for it since I do not have anything to lose really and I do feel like I have grown feelings for her. Another part of me is telling me to not waste my time and to try and find someone else who is closer to where I live now.

206,"First of all, I’m going to get this out of the way. I don’t live in a troubled home,just a lot of stress So a little bit of context. My family has always tried to control my life. What clothes I bought, who I talked too, everything. It was only up to when I turned 17 that I really got to choose because I had my first full time job, right around 5 months into my job, I had broken up with my X (who my mother had hated) and started dating sometime whom Iv been with for half a year. She told me everything that my x was doing behind my back as she was very close friends with both of us, and couldn’t stand it anymore. Long-story short, this girl had been truly amazing, brought my confidence up, helped me become a better driver, everything, she is great. 

However that’s not the point. The point is my parent(s) try to interact and change aspects of our relationship. I consider my self a  very down to earth person. I work a 7-5 job on the weekdays and have never taken a day off (unless it was a snowstorm out and I don’t want to get trapped). I usually go out on a date (usually lunch, coffee or a movie, she is extremely low maintenance) however this weekend we went twice (Saturday and Monday)

Saturday was just lunch, homemade crafts and some drinks. Pretty simple. Monday was a movie.  

Now since This girl is so special to me, I tend to spoil her. I make around 400$ a week (half of it goes to a fund for going back to school, which my mother was not proud of) so I have about 200$ of what I call” Stuff money” what I use to go out and such. (My parents don’t make me pay rent or other such things which I thank them for a lot) and since Valentine’s Day was recently here and gone. I got her some chocolate, A bear, some mugs, flowers and a ring to replace one ( all this cost about 135$). Which I had no problem with. I was happy with. She was so happy she didn’t let me go for 2 hours. I was happy and proud.

Now my mother saw the bill in a box that I had neglected to throw out, and flipped her lid. 

Saying how she’s using me to get back at my x and her x man, and how I’m such a dumbass for giving her these things, and how it’s not a “personal” gift because she posted it on her Instagram feed.  (I don’t really think that matters much to be honest it’s 2018, it’s just common) 

I 100% know she’s not. We spend every day together,  I drive her home, we FaceTime all night and we spend every weekend together. She is my best friend, it’s hard to describe but I know this person is wholesome. 


And many of you are reading this saying “well why can’t you just leave?” well I don’t want to because my father has Parkinson’s so I don’t want to leave her out to try. And I don’t think I have the finances to do it right now. 

So my question is how do I tell her that I think she needs to take a step back out that area of my life? I don’t think this is a “like her or don’t like her” issue because often times on the weekend my girlfriend will spend more time with my parents and she’d spend with me.

I’ve called in twice now because of my new born son and wife, and I have PTO for it. I’m not getting into trouble, I’ve talked to the boss about it, and everything is fine. Yet every time I do he text me “you not coming to work??” And I just called out today for that 2nd time and again he text me “you’re not coming into work again??” Btw he also has cameras pointed out to the backyard where it happens my work vehicle is parked in direct line of sight. He has remote view on his phone, so he can just open his phone and see if I’m home or not. My dad has a temper problem on him and cares to the point where he gets angry and starts shouting/hanging up on you kinda thing.

The first time I called in he gave me 100 reasons why I shouldn’t have and things I should have done so I didn’t have to call in. I explained to him why and he basically got tired of saying stuff and stopped bugging me about it.

215,"Hello all,

So after 6 years of undergraduate, 2 years of grad school, and 1 year in a teaching credential program, I finally have a nice job as as science teacher in a well paying district in a nice area. 

Life is grand. I enjoy going to work everyday. I get paid to talk about science all day. I am working on starting several extra curricular events for my students such as a field trip to a nuclear reactor. I get to be in the school musical coming up.

We had a four day weekend so I took a mini road trip and saw all these things that I had wanted to see for quite some time. Even though I slept in my truck to save money, I still was able to do it because I actually have some disposable income now.

But, I feel kind of guilty about all of it.

Many of my friends are on an ""academia"" track, so they are getting their PhD's and they only get every other weekend off if they are lucky. One of my friends got totally scr*wed by her research adviser and had a bunch of her work not even count towards anything. She has told me multiple times that she hates grad school and that I made the right decision to leave with a masters degree.

Another friend has a good engineering job but she is working from like 5AM-7PM Monday through Saturday right now because of the project she is assigned to. She barely has any free time to herself and is very stressed.

Other friends have jobs that aren't that well paying so they generally can't afford to go do fun stuff.

When I am hanging out with them I feel guilty. I feel like I don't deserve to be this happy. And I feel kind of lazy in a way too. Maybe it's because I was a ""broke college student"" for 9 years essentially? And so now everything feels like luxury?

Any tips on not feeling guilty for being happy?

I feel something is wrong because my environment is telling me. Just the other day, a coworker made a mistake, i took some time to explain how wrong it is and the consequences of it and she almost cried, i was obviously missing something.

Relationship wise, women feel like i mislead them because i don't want sex unless i am extremely conformable and don't like contact, i really don't like unnecessary physical contact at all. I am perfectly happy with just speaking and sharing time together. They think i'm not interested and move on. At the moment, i stopped trying, it is really not fair for them.

At work, everyone is so formal to me compared to how they treat each other. One coworker told me that i appear a little cold. I thanked him for that feedback and tried to improve.

So these things are not working and i am the common denominator. I am fine myself except everyday it seems like i feel a little less. Should i seek help? Is it something from my diet/exercise?

219,"Living at home at my age now seems awkward, but that is the least reason to get out. But I just want to get out regardless.

The biggest motive to move out is my mother. She's not bad at all. Loving, caring, financially supportive. The problem is she does the typical stuff that most mothers do to drive children to move out(unintended), including my sister. She has become almost completely dependent on me. Calling me every five minutes for various task, most she could do on her own. This becomes embarrassing when company is over. I came home from a 12/hr shift and she bombarded me with a list of chores she claimed she'd taken on while I was away. She use me as a crutch to hold conversations. Anything I say or share to her she immediately make it hot topic to others and blow out of perspective. I'm her personal chauffeur, which other people in the family started to see me as. Lastly is when I feel depressed or upset by the nagging, she scolds me for being irritated. I ghosted the last women I dated because of this and now she begging for grandchildren. These are just the bad things that bother me, but doesn't describe her. I'm just tired. And to be honest,  I don't know her personal issues because I'm always last to know and she's never be upfront with me about her problems. 

The toxic dependent relationship is why neither of us are moving towards our goal. No matter how I bring it up, she can't understand. Yesterday my sister told me in a random family conversation that one of my uncles was talking how they noticed the situation, wanting me to leave. 

This most likely will be a long term goal. I have a job and make between $1,600 to $2k a month and can finding a second job is no problem. Just started saving from a changed lifestyle and won't blow my tax returns on PC stuff again, just invest. After some research on local apartments in nearby towns, they seem to be okay for cost of living, it's just the crime rate is the unknown variable. 

Other things to consider is if she'll act out in other ways. Take gifts she bought me like a leash to stay here. So far I started rehab on the house. Painted walls, Installed flooring in several rooms of the house. Setup studs for a redesigned basement without drywall and insulation. Now the kitchen is undergoing rehab but the cabinets have not even been bought yet. I feel one way or another she'll try to sue or something even if I agree to continue servicing until the jobs are complete. Then there is moving bills into my name. My phone, insurance, just setting myself independent so there is no obligations left. I'm just worried about any unknown documents she might still have.

For arguments sake this thread is going to assume that I’ve chosen one of the two options and I’m asking for advice on how to proceed with my decision. 

I got out of a 3 year relationship. After a week I dated someone else for two months (I regret nothing here). A couple weeks after that I messed around with someone for a while. It’s been two months since my last official relationship, and one month since my last “one night stand.”

There’s this girl I’ve known for 4 years, Becca, and I want to date her. I can already tell that our relationship would be really healthy if I were to ask her out. I know she likes me. We have been hanging out a lot just the two of us. No one has made a move yet but I really want to. 

Enter Ryan and Kevin, two of my best friends. Ryan has been my best bud for 10 years. Kevin is Becca’s cousin. Ryan says he thinks I’m dependent on relationships and need to feel loved. He says I need to be single for a while. Kevin, being Becca’s cousin, shares Ryans concern but also is worried about the aftermath that a relationship with Becca could wreak. From his perspective, Kevin thinks that Becca would make the breakup years down the line really ugly. Kevin sees no peaceful ending, only fury. He worries of a potential friend destroying scenario once Becca is assimilated into our friend group. He also thinks I should keep exploring my options. And this is coming from a guy who actually does love his cousins. (like a cousin ofcourse) ((not in the south))

I fundamentally disagree with Kevin on many fronts and think he is being hyperbolic and dramatic (as he often is with these sorts of serious situations). He’s acting like a relationship between Becca and I would place him directly in it with us. I’m not saying it doesn’t put him in a strange position, just that that position is not NEARLY as big as he thinks it is. At the end of the day he says he doesn’t have a problem with it but these are just his recommendations. 

So...yikes. I’ve decided I don’t need to prove to them I can be single. That I’m going to do whatever I want. My relationships should be just that, mine. They can have their minds changed, but I need the right argument. I’ll also add that Ryan is a kiss less virgin and Kevin is still in his first relationship that has only been going on for six months. When it comes to discussing relationships or “dependency” on it, these guys have very little idea about what they are talking about. So what can I say to gain their support or at least draw them into neutral territory?

TL;DR: After dating for 4 years, dating someone else a week later for two months, and now being single for two months, my Friends (who know very little about relationships) want me to not officially date for a while. I’ve met a girl and want to date her (one of my friends cousins), how do I get their blessing or make them less opposed to the idea?

231,"So, I am a Coast Guard Veteran I did six years, I just recently got out and I go to school on the west coast. I got out and I am now using my GI Bill, and I work at the Veterans service center on campus. Well I guess a Yeoman(admin person) came in my office at my college(her husband goes here), and told my boss and co workers, that I got a dishonorable discharge, and discussed some private matters of mine, I had an sexual assault (done to me) on my record I tried to keep my private in my civilian life. Well this person goes on to tell my boss that SHE processed my discharge.

233,"She is the most quiet person in the world. Really reclusive and it is difficult to communicate with her. She is 18 and I'm 23. I guess I always knew she was depressed but I never did anything because of how hard it is to reach her. She never opens herself.
She took a bunch of pills and alcohol but I found her probably an hour after she took them and left a note. Currently she is in the hospital.

I'm devastated. I never expected this. I want to help her in any way I can but I don't know how. Obviously looking for professional help is my priority now but I also need to know what to do at a personal level now that I've ignored for long enough all the signs.

Also I would like to know what kind of professional should I be looking for? She has never gone to any but I always suspected that she suffers from depression and social anxiety.",20Feb2018,4
234,"Hello reddit, I am a white person looking to bring some diversity to my every day existence. I've moved to a new area relatively recently (South Florida in the USA) and my new social circle is very small, and very, very white. Now, I like my wypipo but I believe it's important to build the community you want to see, and I want to take steps to build a more diverse social circle.

What is a not-creepy, not-exceptionally-awkward way to meet people, socialize (and maybe even make a friend) outside of one's immediate cultural comfort-zone, without fetishizing others or making them feel like they're the ""token"" friend? I am probably embarrassing myself, but I haven't had any black friends since just after high school, and to my knowledge I have never had any acquaintances who practice Islam, Hinduism or Buddhism, actively or otherwise. I'm not any more racist than the average liberal, but the social path of least resistance always seems to put me in a room full of other white people and I don't know how to break the chain.

I'm just wondering if this is an unusual situation or not. I'm in college and I work part time. I get along well with most people but no one wants to hang out one on one. I do live off campus. I get invited to some things if I'm doing a group project or something but usually no text me comes to my house. I live in a rural place and it's just sort of awkward. I also love with my parents. I don't have a boyfriend either. I've gotten asked out a lot but usually they just want sex or want to take advantage of me and are really disrespectful. I've had to cut off a lot of relationships lately because people who wanted to hang out just didn't respect my boundaries. I have my family and my neighbors too.

244,"I'm really having a hard time with school right now. I'm 17 and a sophomore. My mom held me back for ¨immaturity¨ reasons. Now, I'm the oldest in my classes. I get made fun of a lot for being a model and being vegan. I'm not an annoying vegan, sometimes at lunch when I'm just minding my own business eating carrots or some shit I literally have people come up to me and ask me if I like hamburgers or some idiotic comments like that. I'm a farley good student, I make As and Bs. 
Anyway, I can't make friends. Every time I try I get told I'm trying too hard, or if I compliment someone I get told I'm being flirtatious when I'm not. Quite often I get talked over when I'm trying to carry on a conversation with someone. I'm not socially awkward, I'm pretty outgoing and I just feel like I don't fit in.

( Keep in mind, She has been asked out by a lot of guys at work and all turned them down. )  So my only question is, Do I just do my usual routine and be the "" Nice guy "" and let him get with her and slowly distance myself for a bit so I don't end up hurting myself emotionally, Or should I at least have the right to let her know how I feel about her before he confesses to her since I did like her before he did. I pretty much already know, at least from the looks of it, That she will reject me. Which I am perfectly fine with, Shes 22, I'm 20, And the guy who likes her too is 25, So to her I'm probably still immature. Either way, I just wanna at least let her know how I feel and you know, See if she feels the same. And if she doesn't then id like to hear the rejection from her so I don't end up thinking about "" what if's "" because its already confirmed. 

TL;DR Should I confess to her first because I liked her before he did, Or Do I just let him ask her out without expressing my emotions to her and be "" happy "" for them?

Now, I'm not exactly friends with John, but I've had a few drinks with him and we get along. Regarding Carol, I'm not interested in her, and afaik she's not interested in me, but we get along, and we've even gone in whole-day trips to other cities, just the 2 of us.

Now here's what happened. We're having an exam on Saturday. I have my notes and the notes of several other people, but Carol wanted to form a study group with me and John. So I texted John and went hey mate, wanna help us. He agreed but never replied regarding his time

I then find out via Carol he went over me and scheduled it with her. She told me beause she thought he had told me first. Anyway neither of them ever came back to me about it (although now I would obviously refuse) but she asked for my other notes.

I'm not happy with any of these guys right now, they have shown they do not want my company for whatever reason so I don't want to do them a favour or engage with either of them. Or should I?

""You're a cute guy for a Trump supporter, how about we meet up and I fuck the white nationalism out of you?""

And then she posted her phone number.

Her message was not even accurate. I am not a Trump supporter (and certainly not a white nationalist). One of my Facebook pictures is at one of my relative's funeral in 2016. He was a veteran and some of his friends were wearing Trump clothing (the funeral was informal clothing as my relative didn't like formal attire which he thought was 'stuffy').

I looked her up and found out she was a college student (like me) and the same age as me. And I have been thinking about reporting her to her university for sexual harassment (her university has a zero tolerance policy on this, so it could mean she gets kicked out). One of my friend's wants me to send it to the media.

261,"My brother, 22, is depressed and has severe anxiety. He is unable to take productive steps for his life. He wilfully went off of his meds a few months ago and has been getting worse and worse. He currently has no psychiatrist helping him. I live away from home but commute often to take care of family matters, e.g. mother's got a lot of specialist appointments, is in and out of hospital, little brother (13yo)'s Parent-Teacher nights and school-related things. I do my best to give my 22yo brother a call a day and keep him accountable, and be nonjudgemental and encourage him and love him in the face of all of the obstacles he's dealing with. 

I (25) myself, am struggling to hold onto life as it takes me on its rollercoaster ride (graduating, going to school FT, looking for work, working 30-40 hours a week in obscene hour shifts, dealing with a mother slowly succumbing to dementia, helping ensure my 13 year old brother is being raised properly as I and my 22yo brother were not, saving up + getting ready to get married in August). 

I have always had a deep sense of responsibility and obligation to my family -- to the point that I feel like I need to dictate/take care of micro aspects of their lives. In fact, I get it from my dad, who takes care of the entire household, my mother, and works full time mostly by himself. I have been trying to coach him, get hm the help he needs, and be as supportive as possible while not always being able to be physically present. As of late, this deep sense of ""ownership"" over his life choices has me feeling extremely helpless, frustrated, and encourages really bad habits in myself which I am trying hard to anticipate and mitigate. 

I am doing my best get a well-paid, salaried, government job so that I can afford psychologists for both my mom and my brother. We live in Canada by the way. I think that would really help him. 

As it stands, my brother is not in a good place -- mind you he's not in a state that needs to be institutionalized, but I fear that it is coming in the next few years. Between his anxiety, his laziness (cultivated by our family culture) and depression, he is unable to get himself out of the deep pit he's finding himself in. How do I avoid feeling so frustrated and helpless in the now, let him be his own person for better or worse, and how do I remain supportive and avoid the onset of future resentment? How do I ""let go"" of my perceived responsibility of him without becoming insensitive/desensitized/apathetic of him. How can I prepare my family for his potential suicide? They will be destroyed. 

tl;dr: how do I go hands off, off of my brother who is succumbing deeper and deeper into depression, while still being supportive and loving of him? I fear he is forging a path to suicide; how do I prepare myself and my family for that and let go of resentment?",20Feb2018,0
262,"Hello everyone, I just want to ask for some advice that has been on my mind lately and it is really hard dealing with it. Basically, My gf and I have been together for about a year and it has been a great relationship. However, over the past 2 or 3 months life seems to have gotten hard for her. Her mom and step dad are terrible and controlling so she left them to live with her dad.(They even came after me). Anyways, she has been trying to get a car since September and her parents just aren't supportive at all so I'm always the one driving. Which after a year (30 min one way) gets quite frustrating but I understand her situation.

Also recently, her step mom and dad have been stealing money out of her account. She was just about to get a car and they took $600. But this past weekend just hit rock bottom. After we were done hanging out, I drop her off at her dad's house and we kind of left on a negative note because we fight at least once a week. Anyways, I get a call saying that her step mom attacked and hit her. 

And I'm not gonna go all into this situation but it has obviously been hard for her but me as well. I feel guilty that I couldn't protect her and just the past few months have been awful for her but its like it keeps rubbing off on me. I care way too much about this girl to leave her at this point but my God am I depressed. I have been feeling like this for a while and was thinking about breaking up but now I just can't after this shit. 

Idk what to do. My own mental health is definitely suffering especially cause she has no place to live and always talks about how low she feels but that I can't do anything about it. I just don't know. I love her and she is such a great girlfriend but her depression is making me depressed and its honestly driving me insane.

263,"The first thing you guys might respond with after I type this up is.... you're an absolute idiot. I know that. But let's not have comments like that because I truly need some serious advice. A couple weeks ago I direct messaged this girl on instagram who has over 3,000 followers and who's following 4,000 ... so this person has put a lot of effort into this account. and I said she was cute and she tells me to add her on snapchat. Do you guys know the snapchat screen that allows you to video chat, Where you can send people videos that you have on your phone? Well she sent me a video that wasn't through that. it was a legit video that she sent me and I got the purple snapchat notification letting me know a video was sent to me. In the video was a girl in her underwear saying she wanted me to show her stuff. And like the dumbass I am, I sent her some explicit photos of my genitalia. 80% of me thought that this girl was legit, but the other 20% thought that this girl might be faking the video somehow. But I ignored the part of me that thought she was lying about who she was. To put my mind at ease I ask her to FaceTime just for her to prove that she was who she said she is. But she then said she'd take a shower then FaceTime me. 2 days go by and we don't talk, but then all of a sudden she sends me another booty video through snapchat and tells me to send something to her again. But this time I didn't do it, and I told her I would send her something if we were able to FaceTime because then it would put my doubt of who she is at rest. She doesn't reply for 20 minutes. She then replies to me with a message from the video chat screen through snapchat and the message was of my whole body and face completely naked. She screen shotted it somehow without me knowing she did so. This person then sends me a message saying how she blocked me on instagram but screen shotted all of my followers and said if you don't continue to send me pictures of your naked body, I will send this picture of you to everyone of your followers. I come to find out that this isn't a girl but a guy. He then said if i don't respond within a minute every time he sends me a message or snapchats me he will send it to everyone. For the next 3 hours I sent this person a total of 150 pictures and videos of me doing what he tells me to do. I was trying to get on this persons good side as much a possible because I understood that with a click of a button he could ruin my life. So anytime he asked me to send a video and I didn't know how to do the pose I asked him how to do it and I asked him what he would rate me 1 out of 10. He then proceeded to send me pictures 20 different guys doing the poses he wanted me to do. So it seems to me this person has done this many times before. He asked how old I was and I said I was 15 even though i'm 20 because I thought he would take it easy on me if I was a minor. But he didn't care about my age at all. So he thinks i'm underage even though i'm not, and I'm almost certain he still has these pictures of me. The second to last thing this person had me do was get in the shower and send a video of me urinating on myself, which I had to do because if i didn't respond within a minute he would send my nudes to my followers. The final thing he asked me to do was to send him the usernames of the 3 most ""hot"" guys so he could blackmail them and get nudes from them as well. I gave him the usernames, but before I did I told those people my situation and told them to not reply to him at all. The fact that he asked for my friends snapchat proves my theory correct that this person has done this to a lot of people. He saved the messages of the pictures I sent him and then he let me block him. If I unblock him on my snapchat I can look back at the messages he sent to use as evidence. And  even though this person blocked me on instagram, during the process of all of this stuff happening I got up onto my backup account and searched the username of the person who did this to me. I still have the username of this person on my back up account and really want to go to the police about what happened but i'm really scared to because I don't want them to see naked pictures of me. But at the same time this person is a pedophile and needs to be caught. So the advice I want is what I should do?

264,"Right now I'm 18 years old, this year was difficult for me because my parent just got together last year and they start problems that get worst between them. As their child, I have to witness it or listen what my mother said about their argument and it was an emotional experience for me that I would think that my family will split again. I really don't know what happened to them but it did affect me with my studies in school. I do care about my parents but I had enough with their personal problem that spills over me. But here's the problem, I'm going to college this fall and I don't know if my parents would let me go too far away college and move out there so that I would not deal with them. I don't have experience of job and I need to be independent to myself if i move out to the dorm, knowing my parents are angry to each other that affecting me.

267,"I (24F) had been friends with this girl (25F) for about 7 years, since high school. Following her son's birth (about 3.5 years ago) she started to unravel more and more (she had already spent time in rehab a couple years before). Several times I found myself taking care of her infant son while she was passed out drunk/on xanax or whatever pill she could get her hands on. I grew extremely attached to her son. He was the first infant I had constant interaction with, watching him grow was such a cool thing to watch. She was physically abused by her son's father about 2 months after her son was born. 


Shortly after the abuse, she got her own apartment and thats when she started using drugs and alcohol heavily. In that time, I felt like I had to be over there taking care of her son or he was going to get hurt. Several times I saw her do coke right in front of him. The environment she was setting up for this kid broke my heart. A little while after she moved into the new apartment she started dating this guy who took care of her. I saw it as the perfect time to detach myself from this situation, and so I did. I took all my things from her apartment and left without really saying anything. 


Many months later we found ourselves involved in each others lives again. Everything seemed like it was going a little better and I had missed her son, and honestly her too. She is fun when she's not fucked up. Or appropriately fucked up, you know? On the weekend when you don't have your son or you can find an all night sitter...maybe don't mix alcohol and pills? In the time we spent apart she had gotten her car repossessed and been evicted from her apartment. 


She ended up living with her son and boyfriend, in his parents' home. After things got rocky in that relationship, they broke up (about 2 years later) and she found herself in her own apartment again (that her mother paid for, which I think is totally enabling but ANYWAYS). Her son was about 2 years old. Even at 2 years old he was such a smart kid. I believe thats the only reason he survived living with his mom. 


Her apartment was always a disaster, she never cleaned up after herself. Her son would get sick over and over again because of that. She was either high on pills or weed and drunk at all times. Its like she couldn't bare to be with her sober self. I recall the three of us going to the pool one day. Her son and I started swimming and she sat at the edge of the pool. After a little while I look over and notice she's asleep. I tried to wake her up but she was OUT. 


It was truly terrifying because she goes to the pool just her and her son. ANYTHING could've happened to this kid. He walked up to her and started poking at her face saying ""Mommy? Mommy?? Mommy wake up!"" She did not budge. That mixture of alcohol and pills won't let you wake up for anything. And this is something she would do all the time. I can't imagine how many times they were alone and he tried to wake her up. She let him stay up until 5 AM or later and they would sleep all day. 


Sometimes she would yell at him for no reason and push him to the point of tears and then say ""just kidding"" like that doesn't affect him mentally. The way she yelled at him literally made me sick to my stomach. She never did motherly duties like giving him baths, feeding him regular meals, making sure he brushed his teeth. There was absolutely no bedtime routine for him. No routine at all, actually. Weed was constantly being smoked around him. He knew ""bong, grinder, pipe"" and she thought it was funny.


When her son's dad took him every other weekend she would go out and drink and hang out with questionable people. There was a time that she was hanging out with a guy who sold meth and xanax. She tells me about this one evening that he stayed overnight and he was asleep, so she started stealing xanax out of his pockets. She thought it was the funniest thing. Using people is like a sport for her. Then apparently she helped him deliver meth, one source tells me she had her son in the car but she denies it. 


Some time later she exaggerates a panic attack and tells the guy he needs to find some xanax for her. He leaves to get it but doesn't come back. She calls to see if he has been taken to jail, and of course, he had been. 

She worked as a waitress on average maaaybe 5 hours a week. She brags about a time where she played with her tables receipts so she could forge more tip money from them. She brushes it off by saying “the bank gave them their money back anyway.” She had resorted to selling naked photos of herself online and to male friends for ""rent"" money. Myself and a mutual friend already knew her mom was paying rent. We knew ""rent"" money was alcohol/drug money.


So fast forward to the night I lost all faith in her. My boyfriend's best friend (26M) passed away. To see my boyfriend (26M) in that situation was absolutely heart breaking and he went out to be with his friends so they could mourn their loss. My ""friend"" and I had also known this guy (we weren’t very close to him though) for as long as we had known each other, her a little longer. So I went over to her apartment to just vent and talk to someone who knew him and the situation. 


I tried talking about the situation and how helpless I felt. She overpowered my venting and focused the conversation on herself. Typical. What she did next absolutely flabbergasted me. She calls her mom and tried to get sympathy money from her because ""my friend of 7+ years died."" She got her money and tells me we should go get tacos. I agree cause her son has been asking for food repeatedly. 


What she doesn't tell me is that she just HAS to stop by the liquor store. So we do that, go get tacos and started heading home. At least I thought we were. She cuts through this neighborhood and I assume she knows a shortcut. No, we end up at this abandoned house and she drinks, runs out of the car and tells me ""I'll be right back."" Its already dark and I'm inside of her car with her son, parked outside of this abandoned house. The entire time I'm in the car her son is asking ""Where did mommy go? Whats mommy doing? Is she coming back?"" (Which gave me a flashback to a terrible shroom trip. We were stuck in a car at night with a friend, who kept repeating the same three phrases for an hour lol) 


So, I'm trying to calmly answer all of his questions while I'm just getting angrier and angrier with her. She calls me from the house and says ""I just got in, its so dark and scary dude."" and I respond with ""well then maybe you should get out and we should go home."" We end the call and she spends an additional 15 minutes in the abandoned home. I nearly took off with her car and son. 


When she comes out she has this bag that she stole from inside. She was so proud and excited. I'm silent and livid. We drive back from the house to her apartment without saying a word. As soon as we park I head to my car. Thats the last time I see her. This night hit me so hard because I'm the type of friend that is ALWAYS there for you. Its a difficult thing for me to rely on anyone for anything. That night I actually needed a friend to listen to me and help me through something emotional that I had never been through.


I gave a mutual friend a letter for her. Basically elaborating on what I've just typed out here and that she needs to be better. I don't hear from her for 5 months and a couple days ago she sends me a text. She attaches two photos of her son and says ""He's been talking about you every day lately. You are missed by a little dude."" Is it just me or is this some absolutely narcissistic parenting here? I feel like she's using her son to try to guilt me into a friendship? There was no ""I'm sorry, how are you? I'm trying to better myself and my son."" None of that. This makes me fear that there has been no change in her actions over these past 5 months. I feel like I should’ve just called CPS when everything was happening in front of my eyes. How do I even go about it now? Could it be possible that they are doing better now and calling CPS would cause more damage? I don’t know what to do. All I want is for that child to be safe and happy.

269,"Hello everyone.

I’m currently in a big corporate company but I am essentially no one, front of house. I speak to members of staff through out the building but nothing on a personal level. They know my name through emails only and my face through front of house only. Make sense?

Anyway, I have a hobby from travelling and my own little side blog. I’m looking to progress it and I am finding ways of doing so.

We have a corporate travel team and someone whos name I know, who is important enough for a P.A but not important enough that I would call the P.A for her guests.

Do you think if I dropped her an email saying, “hey, I run a blog, I am pretty serious about it, is there anything I can do to assist you (free) in my spare time or attend any events etc” (obviously a lot more professionally) would be an awful idea?

My attitude towards this currently is “if she doesn’t respond then it is not the end of the world” but I am still really scared to email because of my position.

270,"Hey Reddit, 

Looking for advice about a 17-year-old boy. Here’s a little background on his family situation: 

Jill and ex-husband adopted a little girl from the Philippines who got pregnant as a teenager and gave birth to a boy, Ryan. 

Jill and ex-husband also have a biological daughter, a few years older than adopted daughter. Adopted daughter was not a well-behaved girl or good student and biological daughter felt neglected by parents. Biological daughter is now a late-30s law professional and constantly talks crap about her mother and hasn’t let go of the past at all. He often stays with her during breaks from school and he told us she complains about Jill constantly.

Adopted daughter lives a few states away from her son, Ryan, and does not have much of a relationship with him. Probably on drugs and is always moving from one crappy job to another. 
Jill and Jack, her current boyfriend of over a decade, are raising Ryan. They are both grandparent-aged white people raising an Asian boy who has some communication with his mother and has no relationship with father. 

Jack has his own issues – too old/unskilled to get a decent full-time office job, and too stubborn to work for Lyft or Home Depot and has a long history of dealing with depression. Trying to help raise his girlfriend’s grandson, Ryan, who shows very little respect for him. Albeit, a depressed, unemployed man isn’t easy to live with and take advice from. 

I am the girlfriend of Jack’s son and we have been together for a while now. I’ve known Ryan for almost 10 years. We live in the same state as Ryan’s mother but don’t care to have any communication with her since she seems like a shitty, shady person.

Ryan came out to visit us and stay for a weekend and figured he might as well see his mom since he’s here. She picked him up from the airport around 3. We told her we would be picking him up from her house at 7pm. That’s four hours with a son who she rarely sees and this was the first time he was even in the state she lives is. And SHE SMOKED HIM OUT. It wasn’t his first-time smoking weed… but I feel terrible that we even allowed her to be with her own son for 4 hours out of a 4-day weekend with us because that’s the only thing they did together. 

Boyfriend and I are both really concerned about Ryan at this point. He’s 17 and a senior in high school and I don’t think he has the grades to graduate in June.  Not sure what can be done between now and then to help him graduate. 

He smokes weed and drinks and is sexually active. We can tell him repeatedly to be careful about these things but what can we REALLY do to help him succeed??

We don’t want to lecture him constantly because right now he’s very open with us and we want to continue to be adults he can trust to tell anything to. We aren’t in a position to discipline him but we do want to help him graduate since he’s shown interest in the music program at a local community college. (He wants to make beats and rap… but we’re just happy he’s shown some interest in some sort of higher education.) I think the military would be a great route for him but not sure how to get him connected with recruiters since we live so far away. 

We can’t control the people he hangs out with (who probably aren’t a great influence) and he knows how to get money and borrow the car and basically anything he needs from his grandma. I don’t think he has any teachers or other adults who really care about his future aside from family. 

Is there anything my boyfriend and I can do to help this kid?

271,"Hey guys

This just happened this morning, I like talking to my professors after class when I can, I feel it’s good to establish a good relationship with your teachers.  Recently I chatted up with my art professor about his work and where I can find it online.

So I had some suspicion that he was gay, and for disclaimer purposes I don’t have any problem with that and never would.  So I figured that would maybe have an influence on his work.

It did.

It most certainly fucking did.

I wasn’t expecting the tremendous amount of dicks on his site, and prominent in his collections.  Black guys, white guys, groups of nude men, erotica, BDSM.

Now I get it, it’s college and we’re all more mature then we were than in high school.  I don’t particularly have a problem with the art itself, people can express themselves however they want to in art, But my dilemma is when he asks me next class, how exactly do I respond?  There’s only a few collections that don’t have as much dicks in them. 

Here is his site:  

http://www.gerardocastroart.com

Should I just say:  “Yeah I like how you made art by burning paper, but the other stuff isn’t my cup of tea”

272,"is it possible to send her to a mental hospital(she has a history), or jail for attempted murder? This really isn't the first time something like that has happened though. But it's the first time I've moved out of the house and left after the extent of what she's been putting me through. My mom accused me of underage drinking, because I had slept over a friends house the other night. I denied it, because I really didn't. My girlfriend is the type who doesn't like guys under the influence, because she had bad experiences with her past relationship... and my mom started punching me so i tried to stop her from punching me and she grabbed a butchers knife to try and stab me, I ended up using a chair to block it and she ended up slashing that instead which clearly means, if I hadn't put the chair in the way, it would've been me. I jumped out the window and ran without my shoes on.. she has a background of mental illness and has been admitted to the hospital for attempting suicide multiple times. however, this was a couple months ago. And because she can't force me to move back in with her, because I'm no longer a child everyday she has been sending me messages trying to threaten me, and if I block her calls and texts, she texts my girlfriends family and makes herself look like a victim to make me look like a bad son, which causes all sorts of drama. She calls my friends to get in touch with me as well. I was hoping it would die down, but it's been so long now and she's still on this everyday. I'd had to call her into the hospital already, because she told me she was going to kill herself unless I came back home. I just don't want to be in that toxic environment anymore. Also, I'm not quite sure if this will count as a reason for being able to attain a restraining order, but that would be nice..

I also have text proof that she stabbed me/punched me, will showing that to the cops do anything? She threatened me earlier today sending an ominous message saying she may kill herself and she's going to ""annihilate me"".

The last job lasted 4 months before it faded out to a peachy color.

I don't use the kitchen much so I don't really care. He's 18 and seems kinda spoiled (but nice), so he's pretty new to the living on your own scene. I just turned 21 a week ago so I've been on my own for a bit. 


Recently, he's been shutting off the A/C at night. I'm really not sure why he turns it off completely rather than just turns it up a few degrees if he's cold **our electricity is included in our rent, we've never had overages either, even keeping the apt on 70 constantly**. I always run hot, my roommates seem to always run cold.

I came back from a 4 day trip (I'm out of the apartment half the time) and it was 82 degrees inside. This morning it was 79.


At night, he's been shutting it off after I'm already in bed. I sleep with my computer on for TV, and the heat from the PC + no AC... it gets to be about 80 degrees and stuffy in my room by the time I wake up, and that's sleeping with no blanket or sheets. The humidity is what makes it awful. It would be OK if he set it to 77 or something, at least it would be de-humidified.


I always have trouble confronting housemates... it's different asking to take out the trash or dishes or whatever, but does anyone have any advice on what I can say so we can reach a compromise on the A/C issue?

So, I‘m very worried since my friend [„crush?“] is acting very weird lately. I know him since autumn and we became close very fast and he kinda knows my worries and problems but I don‘t know his. He doesn‘t talk about himself and I‘ve noticed various signs he isn‘t doing great. He followed his ex on all social media pages he has, until recently when he unfollwed her everywhere, then in that time span he created a playlist called „winter depression“ but deleted it after i asked him about it. He said he created the playlist because he „wasn’t doing well in the holidays“. He is quieter than usual, he also tends to get angry faster. Today he was very quickly mad at his best friend for only being on his phone and walked away. Yesterday evening he also deleted all his social media pages and after I asked him why, he said „social media annoys me“. The problem is I only talk to him online, Mondays and Tuesdays and I don‘t know if I even should do something since I‘m a girl and have a slight crush on him [and he already asked me if I like him and he said he doesn‘t want a gf atm]

In my mind it was a long time ago; Max now owns a home on another continent where he lives in with his new girlfriend and Samantha dated some other guy for more than a year. Slowly, over time Samantha and I developed feelings for each other. Month ago, we're both single and it happened and it is amazing. It's profoundly fulfilling to be seeing her and she makes me want to be a better person and all of the cheesy stuff. I am really starting to fall hard for this amazing lady but it's becoming increasingly apparent that she's still not over Max even though Samantha is entirely blind to it, completely denies it. She says she wants to be with me and I want to believe her.

In my circle of friends, no one knows yet because it's probable that Max will not be happy about this and possible that it will end our friendship. I'm not going to ask his permission for what two adults want to do to be happy, but if he hears about it, I want him to hear it from me. Even in the possibility where he does end the friendship, I'd still do it because of how much being with this girl is totally different than other chicks, and because my feelings for her are strong in a way I've never really felt before.

I know it will hurt so bad if I tell everyone that Samantha and I are a thing, then everything falls apart because she is not over my friend. More importantly, I don't want to risk destroying my relationship with Max if in the end I don't get to be with Samantha.

306,"Tl;Dr: Ive always been addicted to something that made me dislike myself. I always kicked out my addiction by another addiction. 

I dont know what to do anymore. Im a college student in a STEM program. I do great in my studies, I play sports and am in the university team, i go to the gym often, i meditate and journal although not consistency, often.  I have an ok social life, ok parents and family. Overall, my i am very very blessed. 

However, throughout my life i was always addicted to something. This addiction always makes me feel like shit and that although im doing great and am successful, i feel like im only giving my 50% and getting back 50% of my potential. 

As a kid it was video games, then it was porn. I realized i was addicted to porn and decided to stop, it was a very hard battle but i won it temporarily. However, my porn addiction was slowly replaced by a hash/weed addiction. Then that was replaced by an alcohol addiction.Then the alchol replaced again by porn. Needless to say, throughout various phases and addiction cycles of my life i messed up a lot, in various ways and hit multiple rock-bottoms. Whenever i fucked up monumentally, i would swear my addiction off. only to replace it slowly by another one.

Like i can go for a week doing nothing harmful, and then feel tired or whatever and tell myself well lets have a cigarette, then some hash and bam it begins.

I feel that i am in a constant cycle of replacing my demons with other demons. I can have a week of clarity, where i am smashing my goals and feeling great, confident and on-top-of-the-world, and then BAM. My mind rationalizes "" just a little bit"" and im full on again. Then a week of clarity and so on. It reached a point where i will do whatever it is (porn-weed-hash-booze) and just tell myself oh well, i hate this i hate myself but fuck it do it and youll be clean in a week. 

Right now I cannot stop watching porn, it reached a point where i am watching and hating myself. Just like i use to smoke up and hate myself. 

I feel that i constantly need a high, any high. Literally any sort of high. Ive always chased highs in some form or another and it always led to a rabbit hole. 

I do not want to be redirected to nofap or whatever niche-addiction-group i want s lea way to stop replacing my demons. If that is possible. ",20Feb2018,1

311,"Hello! 
I am 15 years old and I have this friend, who we can call Tom. Tom, I and a few others were eating lunch together. Anyhow a conversation about their dead cat came up and I said ”where is it now”. Mabye a little rude to ask but I wondered where the cat was laying/buried. I think Tom got offended because in response he said ”Where is your grandpa”, which he know is dead. This was quite embarrasing as I did not show any emotions and also saying to my friend next to me that I don’t care. But that was not because that kind of a comment had I never heard before. So, should I forgive him and move on. Or see him as a toxic friend and ”unfriend” him. This is not the first time he has been mean to me. This is though the first time he has said something this mean.

Some of this stems from, yes, I'd like to meet guys to potentially date. I've done the online dating thing, met plenty of people in real life, and I truly do not feel like that avenue is for me. 

I'm plenty social when I am around people who also want to be social. However, not all ""bars"" and ""bookstores"" are filled with people who are willing to have a conversation. 

This seems like a silly question, but do adult clubs exist? I'm just having trouble racking my brain coming up with potentially social situations I could put myself into. I live in a fairly large midwestern metro area, so I would think that lots of groups for younger people exist.

315,"I work at a coffee kiosk for a grocery store, I've done it before at a previous location so it's not too bad.

My problem is mainly my environment and coworkers. I'm the youngest, but I feel the most mature. My coworkers are always talking about each other and throwing each other under the bus. Even my manager talks trash about the others to me, he's called them ""idiots"" and has mimicked disabled people to make fun of them. My manager is very passive aggressive but usually wraps it up as a joke.

A lot of the times, it puts a lot more pressure on me. I have to pick up the slack a lot and I've grown tired of it. I'm emotionally exhausted. I've had a breakdown and suffer some suicidal thoughts. I have sleeping problems so having a constantly changing schedule does not help. My therapist told me I scored ""severely depressed"" in the questionnaire before our appointment a week ago and now has me signed up for bi-weekly sessions due to worry. I am also going to start taking anti-depressants.

317,"This is a long post but I really appreciate anyone who reads it in it’s entirety

 I don’t know where to start so I’ll give a little backstory, my relationship with education has always been rough, I went undiagnosed with ADD throughout my childhood and never felt like school was for me even though I managed to work my way around it and did OK. When I got to high school my life sort of swerved out of control due to a broken abusive home, drug addiction, anxiety and depression stemming from bullying, so you can imagine I did pretty poorly, I ditched almost everyday to get high and almost got straight F’s my Freshman and Sophomore year. Then after a failed suicide attempt my mom put my in a strict Catholic school because she thought my school was the issue and not me, I was there for about three months before I got expelled lol. Around this time I had a really bad experience with a synthetic drug and developed an extreme panic disorder, I would get insanely strong panic and anxiety attacks all day until I developed a rare disorder called depersonalization disorder that I still have today, I didn’t know what was going on with me so I was absolutely terrified and begged my mom to send me to a medical facility to get help. My mom found someone whose job I think was to find troubled kids a place to be sent to, recalling this makes me so angry because we were so vulnerable and this man really took advantage of us. He convinced me that there was a state of the art medical facility in Utah that was basically like a summer camp where I would get help, and medical professional treatment, me and my mom where so desperate we agreed. That was probably one of the worst decisions of my life, the place in Utah was a total mental and physically abusive hellhole and you can imagine what that did to me in the state I was in, I was also there for 6 months! Anyway, during this time in high school that my life was out of control I found one refuge to express myself and ease my pain and that was music, I played guitar and produced hip hop and electronic beats and had even started playing the piano before I was sent off. When I got back because I had no access to music for so long I think I completely forgot how therapeutic it was and gave it up, when I went to college I hopped from major to major and school to school not knowing what I wanted to do. Finally a year and a half ago I discovered an artist whose sound I really liked and resonated with, he inspired me so much I picked up music again and it was like a fire was reinvigorated in my soul, I started making music and researching as much as I could everyday, I was completely addicted. Now I transferred from community college to a major University, Im a sound design major but it’s not at all what I thought it was or wanted to be doing creatively and it’s also insanely time consuming and stressful. If I were to drop out my mom says I would have to find my own place and work full time at my job, the only thing is though is that I live in Chicago and currently made a home studio in my mothers basement, If I were to get a room in an apartment with my budget it would be way to small for all my equipment, I also don’t like my job at all and I’m afraid if I make this leap I will be stuck there.  My other option that Im thinking is to get a minor in studio recording at my school(they don’t offer the major) and then major in a bullshit degree so I can teach ESL abroad, but this would also be very short term because I don’t see myself as a teacher or living abroad for too long. I only feel happy and alive when I am making music but I don’t want to look back in 10 years with regret for dropping out, what should I do?",20Feb2018,1

323,"I turned 16 a few months ago. I'm now old enough to get my driver's license. However, my father is giving me second thoughts about driving. He doesn't think I'm capable of driving. I told him I'm ready to start driving, and that I want him to teach me. He refuses to teach me. He told me, ""You may think you're ready, but I don't think you're ready."" This made me a little angry. Who are you to tell me what I'm not ready for? He told me, ""If you proved to mom and I that you were ready I would."" I asked him, ""What do I have to do to prove that I'm ready to drive."" He couldn't really answer my question. He then began to get an attitude and told me, ""You're being very combative and argumentative."" No, I wasn't. I genuinely wanted to know why he thinks I'm not ready to drive. He couldn't answer my question because I think he has no reason to think I'm not ready. I'm not an out of control teenager. I don't party. I don't do drugs. I don't sneak out. I help out around the house by; taking the trash out, washing the dishes, doing laundry, etc. I earn straight A's in school. I feel as though I'm responsible enough to start driving, so I don't understand why he thinks I'm not ready.

He told me once, ""I'm reluctant to teach you how to drive because you used to get bullied."" WHAT THE HELL DOES ME BEING BULLIED IN THE PAST HAVE TO DO WITH ME LEARNING HOW TO DRIVE?!?!?!?! My father, brother, and I visited my aunt's house recently. She asked me, ""Are you driving yet?"". I was going to say, ""Not yet"", but before I could answer, my father goes ""Yeah right."" My aunt goes, ""Wow you said that like he's not going to do it anytime soon."" My father embarrassed me and made me angry when he said that. He doesn't think I'm capable of driving. When he said that, it made me feel as though I'm not capable of driving since my own father doesn't think I am.

He tells me driving isn't that easy. However, all of my friends in school that drive tell me it's very easy. My mother tells me it's not hard. So why is my dad telling me it's hard? I'm having a hard time believing my father can be wrong because he's my father. I don't think a parent can be wrong. Another reason why he's probably reluctant to teach me how to drive is because I don't go out much or have much of a social life. I suffer with social anxiety, and because of it I struggle in social interactions and get nervous when I'm out a lot. I'm just trying to think of reasons why he believes I'm not capable.

So I'm asking you guys, is driving really as difficult as my father is making it out to be? How can I prove to him that I'm ready to start driving, and have him teach me?",20Feb2018,2

335,"Okay, I graduated just over a year ago now. I got my degree in interior design. I'm 24.

I decided to move back in with my parents and try to start a business. I figured I would enjoy having control over my work and I could spend time with my parents- who are in their early 60's.

This was a huge and monumental mistake. I poured my savings into building supplies to build a workshop- because I wanted to do woodworking or have a place to build/create whatever. But, my parents urged me to wait until the weather warmed up- and I followed their advice. But, then we had a very long winter. When I finally bought the supplies, then the rain started- and every aspect of building became harder and slower. If it wasn't raining buckets, it was 95-105 degrees. And when I wasn't trying to build, my parents needed my help doing odd jobs or chores.

And in the past year I've learned, or re-learned, my family makes me absolutely miserable. I'm the only person in my family who has a degree- dad dropped out in 8th grade, mom in 7th, sister in 11th (she lives down the road in a house my parents ""sold"" them, while my parents and I live in a house that's 100 years old and beyond repair- full of holes, dozens of Brown Recluse spiders, mice, and I had a snake in my bedroom). None of them have a whole lot of contact with the outside world, and it's difficult to relate to them at all. 

I have my license, but I also have autism- so driving is difficult for me. I have a lot of problems multitasking. I always hoped to live somewhere with a healthy public transit that was walking/bicycle friendly. Where I live now it's a 30 minute drive to Walmart.

I have a building that I could sell for $4k-$6k, and a few hundred dollars in cash. I worked for my University as an assistant/tutor, and interned for an architect doing historic preservation. And I submitted plans for the history department to have their offices redesigned.

TL;DR: I can't drive, am miserable where I am, don't have many funds, and I'm looking for some suggestions. Sorry if I come off as ungrateful, I'm just at my wit's end.

337,"Hi /r/advice,

I'm a 15 year old minor living in Southwest Ontario, Canada. My father and I have been having arguments with one another for as long as I can remember - particularly ones about how much I contribute to his household. We generally have a terrible relationship because of our heavily contrasting views on the world (he is anti-vaxx, homophobic, extremely pro-guns, considers Infowars a legitimate news source - you get the idea) among other things. Most of the time if we argue, he just yells quite loudly and then grounds me for a day or two. I hate this, but tolerate it. Recently, he's taken it up a notch and threatened much more severe consequences, such as simply removing me from the household.

I'm genuinely scared of my dad. He talks about how he regrets not beating me as a child, how corporal punishment would have been a much more effective way to raise me (""thing with it is that they'll remember not to do it again!"" he'd say.) He says that if I can't contribute to the household, I simply won't be in the household. He always talks about how he regrets how much money he puts into me, because I'm an ungrateful shit. He hates the fact that I own a computer, despite all of the money that is put into it being either from my own work or from Christmas or birthday money.

/r/advice, I just want to know where I can go with this kind of stuff. I'm honestly terrified of what could happen right now, considering how much tension there is between him and I. I do have 2 or 3 places that I know I could go to if I am legitimately kicked out of my home, and I have discussed this situation with my best friend who supports me wholly.

338,"Hi all. 
I'm 19 years of age and I allowed my friend to borrow my car almost a year ago. He crashes the car and totals it. Nobody was injured but the car was totally wrecked. I won't bore you all with the whole story but the whole incident was, even by his own admission, entirely his fault and nobody else was involved. The very moment of the crash he promised to pay me back for the car. I have messages, texts and witnesses backing this up. At the start he paid me back a few hundred dollars but then he fell under hard times and said he couldn't pay me anymore. I knew he had other debts so I had abit of sympathy. (The price of the car wasn't very much as I'm only 19 and was my second car, only $1000 is what he agreed upon for him to pay me back) A bit of time past and he continued to tell me he didn't have the money, but I saw him buying things for himself like clothes and alcohol for the weekend. At this point I felt very disrespected by someone I called a mate. I went overseas for a while, recently came back and asked him for the money again. He got annoyed with me for asking about the money and said I should just get over it. This really pissed me off.

I don't know what else to do. At this point he owes me $300. Which may not seem like a lot but I'm only 19 so it's still a large ish sum of money to a broke student. In hindsight it was a mistake to let someone use my car but he was a mate and I trusted him. What should I do next? Obviously I want to go about it legally. Should I just forget about my money?
