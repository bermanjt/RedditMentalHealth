0,"TL;DR: can doctors sign forms so long as you bring in the necessary proof?

So I thought the deadline was August 1 but when I checked today it was July 1. I’m going to be an incoming college freshman, and I might be rescinded if I don’t turn the forms in on time, but I’m not completely sure if that’s a thing.

I have no medical problems/history so all of the forms were relatively easy to fill out. However, there are 2 that are slightly problematic and require my healthcare provider to sign.  One is a vaccination form and the other is titled “tuberculosis screening requirement.”

However, my mom is going to the hospital tomorrow to check up on her high blood pressure. I was maybe thinking I could have her doctor sign the forms for me there? Of course, I’d bring my vaccination history stuff with me, which I’m pretty sure I’m up to date on.

Also, on the tuberculosis form, it has three sections (A, B, and C) and section A and B are questions for me to fill out to see if I’d had tuberculosis or any symptoms, which I didn’t and said no to all of the questions. Section C is for the healthcare provider, but at the top of the section it says, “if student has answered ‘no’ to all of the questions no further testing is required.” Does that mean I have to get screened for tuberculosis or no? Like is there a general test that everyone has to take and then additional ones for the ones that do have tuberculosis? I’m so confused.

Sorry for the little freak-out. My school’s office is closed at the moment so I will call them tomorrow and my healthcare as well.",28Jun2018,1
1,"I’m going to be a senior in high school next year, so I understandably looked for a summer job. My dad offered to see if he can find anything in the company he works for. He gets me an internship at one of the offices, a customer care intern. I accept because why not, its a solid job offer. 
I started on Tuesday. I hate it. I wake up at 5:30 and have an hour commute by train. I work from 8 to 5, mon-fri with an hour lunch break. I don’t feel I was adequately prepared for the job and was hardly given any instructions. I sit at the computer, browsing through tickets. I dread the moment my phone rings because theres so many things that can go wrong when a customer calls. I hardly know anything about the company and its inner works. I scramble to type information as I’m talking with the customer, hesitant to ask them to repeat something for the 5th time because I know they will get annoyed. And it doesnt help that im a social introvert that shies away from interaction. I don’t feel comfortable in my workplace. I’m the youngest there by far, and my coworkers are much more experienced than me.
I want to quit. But I don’t want to disappoint my dad. It’s not about the money, we’d be fine if I didn’t work. But he has very high expectations of me and he has always expected me not to be a quitter.
But its hard. I go home and watch snapchat stories of my peers enjoying their day, visiting sights, and just enjoying their summer. I can’t help but desire to just be a normal teenager, working at the froyo shop 10-4.  I’m thinking I should at least finish this week and then tell my dad its not right for me. But I’m afraid he might accuse me of being ungrateful or lazy. But truthfully I just want to cherish my childhood while I still have it.",28Jun2018,2
2,"I’m a heavy smoker(1-2 packs/day) and will be quitting next week. Any advice, experience or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I’m very nervous but also incredibly determined. ",28Jun2018,1
3,"Okay to get it out of the way don't say go to the hospital. For one, I don't have insurance so that would ruin my life, I'm already in debt. Second, I don't really care if I die. Be a relief at this point.

Okay so to preface, I'm 20, male. I smoke, but I quit a week ago, and I only smoked off-and-on for a couple years, only recently neared a pack a day for a week or so before stopping. 
Today I went skateboarding, it was very hot and I was sweaty. Got too depressed and I left. Went to the store and as I was walking around, the left side of my chest started to hurt, like someone was squeezing the walls of my lung, and my left pectorial muscle. It's mostly towards the bottom/center of my lung but goes up to the left side of my neck. It is somewhat painful in my arm and left back muscle if I move them. It got worse and worse. When I was checking out the machine wasn't working and I started freaking out, getting unreasonably angry and just running my hands through my hair cussing under my breath. The pain got worse and worse till I could barely move. Went home and when I laid down it was a little better, the pain was just mild if I didn't move. My breathing felt kinda weird, like that wheezing that happens after you run a lot, you know where the exhaling sounds hollow. But that's mostly gone. I rested a while and the pain went away. I got up and after walking around a bit it came back. Tried eating some crackers, took an extra strength acetomorphine/asprin pill. Drank water. The pain is still here a couple hours later but I've had no additional symptoms, it hurts only a little if I move and when I breath, still exclusively in the left side. My heart doesn't hurt, or only mildly. It's just the muscles and the lung.

Should I try to sleep it off? Again, can't go to the hospital and don't fear death. Is there any drugs to take to help? Any food? Hot shower maybe? I don't want to do anything physical cause it starts hurting again. What was it? Panic attack? Fluid in lung? Pnemonia? Infection? Heart attack seems unlikely at my age and I'm underweight so not likely.",28Jun2018,1
4,"When I say “better”, I mean a more efficient and cleaner method that doesn’t leave a stink in my room. I’m currently 17 and have been using an old sock that I hide under my bed to wipe up my jizz. I get a new sock maybe once a month or so. I’m not loving that I keep putting my dick in my dried cum and I also don’t like the fact that my room smells like jizz. I first began in the shower using soap as lube when I was 13, but I stopped after I was getting friction burns. I would use tissues but I wouldn’t want them out in the open and I have no room near me to hide them. I just wanna jack off in my bed without having to get up until after I’m done. ",28Jun2018,0
7,"I am at a rock and a hard place. I have lived and grown up in my hometown (Denver) my whole life, there is a ton to do and the mountains nearby offer a nearly unlimited amount of activities, the city of Denver is friendly and safe as well and enjoy it... some of the time. I currently attend University in Arizona and am on my way to getting a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I like both the location of my home and school but I am having more and more trouble dealing with the scorching heat. It has had negative effects on my health, I am very sensitive to heat and I get faint and sick easily from it if I am exposed to it for long periods of time. (The past two weeks have been in the 100s) In addition, neither place gets very much rain. I can’t count the number of times it’s rained here this summer on one hand. I feel I am experiencing the opposite condition people get when living in a rainy place with a lack of sunshine which causes moodiness or depression. I’m getting really sick of breaking into a full on sweat every time I go outside or get into my car. I am a huge fan of nature and the outdoors and being forced to not go outside. The obvious solution would be to go and move somewhere else (after graduation), but I love Colorado during the winter, the snow and cold weather are absolutely breathtaking. Also I have a very promising employment opportunity at my dream company based here. I am really tempted to pack up (once I graduate) and go somewhere but I feel moving because of one season is petty.

8,"I don't feel like saying my age, but let's just say I'm a preteen. My family is very dysfunctional and constantly argues. My mom and dad split up and I'm gonna talk about my mom first.  
So, my mom is depressed as a starter. She constantly does things that are very ""extra"" and will go out of her way to stir up drama. I'm really worried because her (and my dad) think I'm depressed and I mean maybe I am, but I don't want them to worry. My mom always thinks that everyone hates her and as a result, is clingy and emotional. I'm gonna start talking about my dad because he's the main problem  
My dad is a really sweet person, a stereotypical cancer (Zodiac Sign). He's super cuddly and loving but he's sometimes does awful things. He has anger issues and yells at everyone for the smallest things, or nothing at all. My dad's really poor and lives in my uncle's old house with my grandma and they constantly fight. My brother just says to ignore it since it happens all the time but I can't. He one time jumped on the front of a car while my mom tried to drive away. The start of that fight was because her best friend gave her something as a gift and not him when it was his birthday. He's basically a child and has (most likely) cheated on my mom by being defensive, accusing her of cheating, and making it a POINT that he was only friends with his girlfriend when he was with my mom, even though none of us knew about her. I one time stood up for my grandma and I ended up curled in a ball on the couch while he yelled at me, which is unusual since he never yells at my brother and I. He goes to NA meetings, (Narcotics anonymous) and never talks about his old addiction. When I was little, I thought narcotic meant neurotic. He's always late and never is on time to anything, and constantly lies.  
I don't have much to say about my brother other than him being frustrated by his laziness and is worried about my future. I really don't know what to do and I'm constantly filled with anxiety just by asking my dad to go to the store to get me food. I really wish I was in a different family, and I just need to hear what I can do to calm my anxiety and possibly help my family. I'm really sorry for the long post.",28Jun2018,1

11,"A year ish ago I broke up with this one girl because she cheated and ever since she has been on my nerves. First she tries to contact me everywhere (text social media, email, etc) so I ignore her. After I blocked her number she kept asking her friends to let her borrow their phones so she could annoy me. I blocked those too. 

I have already changed, 
- my phone number
- my social media accounts
- my address
- my name (was already in the process of changing it but didn’t tell her) 


Okay so.. I have already gone out of my way to get away from this person. 

Yesterday I got a bunch of emails telling me to confirm my email for accounts created. 

I got email confirmation for a bunch of porn cites, random websites I don’t know about, games, etc. 

One of the emails said I signed up from an IP address and it gave me the IP. I did some digging around and I found out the internet provider for that IP address was the company my ex had. I did more digging and I found out my ex’s IP is where the emails originated. 

All of the emails knew my past and current name(the name I didn’t tell her about)

12,"I'll start by saying I am a 20 year old male.

For as long as I remember I never really attended school regulary. It got really bad around grade 6 when I only attended less than one semester. I feel like it was the same for the rest of the years when I finally dropped out in grade 9. 

I never really had a dad so I was never taught how to be a man or had responsibilities forced on me so a lot of that time when I missed school I was just sitting at home on my room playing Xbox or watching YouTube I barely ate anything and became extremely underweight, not really doing anything with my life at all. 

Skip forward to today I am still in the same bubble and I am so scared that I cannot get out. My mind is so toxic now all my influences and everything I know is from the internet. It's. It even like I read educational stuff on it I just watched brain numbing bullshit... I dont know where to find information thatll help me in the real world. 

I feel so so trapped I dont feel like I have emotions anymore every second of the day I just feel so numb even when I am doing something exciting it just does nothing for me.

I feel sick to my stomach I just feel like an empty shell weighting to die.

Does anyone know a website or a YouTube that speaks on real shit instead of just talking out of their ass? 

I've tried going to school again or joining a club but i just fall so far behind because I can't even think anymore. I dont know what to do... my mind is just toxic.

14,"My father decided to walk out on my mother, me, and my brother when I was only 4. His side of the story was “there was another girl”,  my mother’s side (which I would take more seriously in this case) was “He found a girl online and decided to leave”. As if that isn’t already enough, the girl he left with dumped him 6 months after.

     I don’t know what happened after the girl left him, but I do have a theory. My dad is a HUGE alcoholic, and I can say that with no regret. I believe he started being dependent on alcohol after that girl dumped him. A couple of years later, he met another woman. The only similarities (from my observations) that she has to him is that they fcking love alcohol.

    A couple years pass, my step-brother (about the same age as me) is unfortunate enough to be with them a lot more than I do. He keeps me up to date on what is going on with my dad and his girlfriend (I don’t want to say stepmom)

   So to make a loooong story short, his girlfriend cheated on my father a good 4 times and my father cheated on her once. It’s been 3 fucking years since they got “married” btw. 

   About 3 weeks ago(visiting for summer break), he arrived back from a “party”, and he looked shitfaced and he was yelling at his girlfriend (no physical abuse).  But it still made me uncomfortable enough to go drive w/ my stepbrother just to get away from them.


   My question is, why create a father/son relationship with someone who doesn’t deserve it? He is obviously a deadbeat dad and I want nothing to do with him, but he still tries to talk to me and keep up the fake dad persona. Just wanted outside opinions on this.

21,"She came over from Korea 4 years ago and this is her first job. Her English is good. Shes HIGHLY energetic and is a nervous fast talker, but friendly and positive. Overall nice young person that just needs to learn how to listen to some first job advice. What would you say to this person?

Lets just get you up to speed...

1. She runs in the office. Yep. It's alarming and its a small office. Delivering papers 2 cubes down? Sprints. Delivering copies to her bosses office? Jet Fuel. Multiple people have told her to stop running including her boss. She still runs. 

2. She has difficulty listening. If given 2 tasks at different times, the first one shes been given is treated as ""her"" priority, not her bosses. She's been informed of this. She still finishes her tasks in a ""first task given, first task finished"" approach instead of prioritizing based on SPECIFIC VERBAL instructions to do otherwise. 

3. Fast talking and laughing mixed with nervous smiles. It's rather stressful. Having a conversation with her is a lot like going on Ghost Rider at Knott's Berry Farm. It's fun, but you feel a sense of nervousness welling up inside of you as the ride could kill you at a moments notice because of questionable engineering decisions.

4. She doesn't take her lunch or breaks. She's a hard worker and that's great, but this isn't a place that rewards you for working hard. It's a very laid back environment with an easy going work culture. I understand she's coming off the top ropes because a) its her first job, b) 1st generation work ethic and c) Eager to move up and impress management, but it's making her team uncomfortable. Especially her fellow peers who'm she should be allying with instead of alienating. 

6. She makes unnecessary social visits to the head of HR and her bosses boss to talk about fashion, poor sales numbers or the traffic of the day. She's been here 1 MONTH. 
 
(Side Note)
Kids, if you're reading this and you've worked a job for only 1 MONTH and you are going into your bosses boss's office to discuss POOR SALES NUMBERS because you think upper management will appreciate your eager new found interest in the companies well being, STOP. Not only do they ABSOLUTELY know what the numbers are, they don't need someone they just hired to remind them of that. 

Just curious if anyone else has encountered an issue like this in the work place and how you handled it. ",28Jun2018,1
22,"Hi friends.

So I currently have a job at a video production company in Ohio right now that pays $15.50/hr. But I just got a job offer for a position at a Post Production house in California. It only pays $14/hr though. I want to go to California because it has been a dream of mine, but I am afraid of the cut in pay, especially considering the higher cost of living. 

I currently have around $2000 saved up. The job in California wouldn't need me to start until August 6th, so I could save up about a bit more money before then. But I know $2000-3000 still isn't that much when moving to LA.  

Do I pursue my dream and leave my current job to move to LA despite the cut in salary?

I don't even get paid enough to pocket much savings, most of it goes towards bills. I'd really like to get out of the Fast Food Service industry and maybe move on to something I won't hate to show up to.

I'm looking for alternatives like certifications that'll tell businesses I'm able to do a job, and get hired.

26,"I posted this to r/quarterlifecrisis, but here, I'd like to ask you - is my overall idea correct? Should I be rushing to be things I can't be? Was I being *too* ambitious?

My story:

I graduated from my undergrad last year, intent on moving cities. I planned on moving cities, had a job planned, and even had an apartment and everything. As I moved there, I broke up with my girlfriend (we had only been dating 6 months), and moved to a city where I knew no one. I immediately realized that my job was underpaying me - barely min. wage - and I needed to spend my daytime hours studying for the MCAT. I quit my job within days, and left the apartment. Lost a month's worth of rent.

I moved back in with my parents (my least favourite idea after graduating), and studied my ass off for the MCAT. During this time, I was depressed, moderately suicidal, extremely isolated. Basically, the life I knew in college - where I was winning awards, doing well, knew everyone, and had a bright future - seemed to have disappeared. My friends all moved away and were beginning to do other things with their lives.

At this time, my best friend got the job of his dreams in NYC. I'm so proud and happy for him, but he's making approx. $200K in comparison to my $0 from studying at home in my parents house.

After a grueling summer of just straight studying, I wrote the MCAT. I ended up doing extremely well (99th percentile). I'm blessed to have done so well.

By the time October rolled around, I was done my medical school applications - I applied almost everywhere just in case - and had started a new job. This job is isolating, lonely, and I don't click with the other young people working there. The other young people are Master's students, and I'm just ""working"" there. I make about $35,000 a year after taxes, but I wasn't projected to work for 12 months anyways.

I decide that with this salary I can move out and with some roommates. Their apartment is cheap, albeit a bit dirty and old, but hey - it's not my parents' house. During this time, the need to make money like my more successful peers hits me, and I start ""investing.""

I immediately make mistakes, and sort of forgive myself. I'm currently down $6700. It's not the end of the world, and I'll explain why. After a year of investing/trading/gambling (ie as of today), my portfolio is down that much above. I don't make a lot of money, nor do I come from a lot of money.

In January, realizing that I had lost a lot (about $4000 by that point), I decided to move back in with my parents and commute to work. That savings on rent equals roughly what I've lost in total (as of today, not of January), so I feel *okay* still.

By March, I get into the med school of my dreams, on a major scholarship. When I graduate from med school, I should have about $30K in debt, all because of my MCAT score, I think. I got very lucky, and am happy about it!

But I realize, at the bottom of my heart, the desire to be making serious money like my friends has been gnawing at me. I wish I could speed up a bit and be living life as fully as they seem to be able to. While I still have 4 years of school, and 2-5 years of a residency (paid at about $60K/year), they're going to be enjoying their *youth.*

What I'm realizing now, is that I'm only 22. This rush to speed up, to catch up, to make money in stocks, is only moving be backwards. I need to focus on **being 22.** Chase girls, work hard at school, and try to be the best me - long term. After this whole year of reflection, that's what I've learned. A quarter-life crisis sucks, but the long game is upon us, and that long game is called **the rest of your life.**

I'm disappointed in myself for losing money. I'm disappointed in myself for not writing the MCAT sooner and getting in sooner. But I think I'm also disappointed that I'm fixated on being something I can't be yet, simply because some of my peers have gotten there. I'm going on a trip next week with the same friend I mentioned above - he's still my best bud. I look forward to someday catching up to him, but at a pace that fits my life rather than his.

tl;dr: Chasing the success equal to your peers isn't always the best idea. You need to enjoy the journey, and focus on the long game. Part of that long game is enjoying who you are, right now.",28Jun2018,1

30,"Background: I graduated college at the beginning of May and have been applying for jobs (admin/marketing/etc) all over. I really want to move out of my home state because my family and I just...clash a lot. I won't go into it, but I have the freedom of the average thirteen year old in many respects (this isn't an exaggeration).

So yesterday, I applied for a job across the country. They emailed me back last night, I replied, and they emailed back a little while ago that the salary was less than what I wanted. I'll just give real numbers - throughout my job search, I've only been applying for positions that pay $15 an hour. This job would only pay 12.50 - 13 an hour. I have a friend who lives in the city, and by her account (and my own research), I could scrape by but that's it.

So I'm conflicted. Like beggars can't be choosers, but I don't know how much of a beggar I am. Most recent graduates have trouble finding work - should I just accept this? I obviously can't say for certain that I'll get another decent chance at a job within the summer - but I think I could (I've had three other interviews since graduating so obviously my resume isn't that bad).

I'm just rambling at this point). 




Anyway, the girl has been ANNOYING AS FUCK for the past month or two. She asks non-stop if she can come over and I try my best to come up with an excuse. She asked my mom if she can come over and my mom said to ask me (nice job there lol). Its hard to explain how bad this is getting... Like everytime I'm at church i get harassed by constant ""Can we hangout""? Or ""Can I come over today""? I wish I could get a restraining order against her lol. 


If she ever asks me out I have 3 excuses- I'm ""dating"" my friend (who she knows and it seems like we're dating lol). She knows that I'm 17 but doesn't know when my birthday is so I can lie and say that I'm 18 and its ""illegal"" to date her. And lastly, ""I'm gay"" (which isn't a lie lol). 



I'm planning on talking to my mom and seeing if we can set up a system to avoid her (mom works at the church so she can pull some strings). 



I know this girl has it hard but thats not an excuse to harass and be creepy. 




What should I do to avoid her besides not going to church (I wish I could stop going but I'm stuck with religious parents :/ )",28Jun2018,3
32,"My brother and his girlfriend had a baby that just turned one last week. They are young parents (22 and 21) so to an extent it’s expected for them to be immature but they don’t seem to be good parents. 
Here’s a list of some questionable things they do:
-Give the baby their cell phones to play on when he starts to cry.
- my brother will ignore the baby to play video games.
- the mother left a cigarette on a low table and he was sucking on it and then threw up before she caught it. 
-they put him in his crib when he gets fussy so they don’t have to deal with him. Because of this he sleeps during the day and is up all night!!
-NOTHING IS BABY PROOFED. 
-The baby can’t walk or talk yet. (My dad said me and my brother were walking and talking at like 10 months.) 
- they always try to pass the baby off into anyone available to watch him. 
- they don’t play with him.
-brother is a really deep sleeper and he was in a sleep coma and the baby was crying for an hour or more before I went and got him.

I feel like this is child abuse or neglect at least.
What can I do? I don’t want to call CPS and get them in trouble and I’ve tried talking to them and they get mad. ",28Jun2018,1
33,"This may not be as interesting as the other posts here, but I would love some help!
For my high school graduation gift, my parents gave me $1,000CAD for Flight Centre. I can use it for hotel or flights anywhere in the world. I really want to go on a trip this August (I’ll be 18), but I have no idea what to do! The world is so big!!
I’d possibly take my boyfriend with me and we’d be flying out of YVR/SEA/YLW. 
$1000 is definitely not the limit, but I am going to university next year and don’t want to spend too much.
I just want to see somewhere I’ve never seen I don’t even have a preference

34,"I am currently a 19 year old student enrolled in an internship.
Just like the title, I personally think I am mentally weak. While I have been able to deal with this for most part of my life, yesterday really hit the nail in the coffin. One of my close friend (Lets call him X) was able to earn a load of money off football betting. Don't get me wrong, I am truly supportive and happy he got a huge payday. However, I just can't help but wonder why I can never get this lucky in anything and not just football betting. To give some context, given the country I am currently in, I would say I have had a better than average upbringing throughout my life which I am truly happy and thankful about. X on the other hand has had a much much more challenging upbringing (not going into detail). In that sense, I can see why he deserves more good fortune than me and I can accept that. 

However, I sometimes question why I have to always remain humble and be thankful for what I have while others are openly gaining much more. (Not just X or football betting but life in general). It’s not as if I have had a silver spoon shoved down my throat since birth nor is my entire future secured monetarily. I have had to force this mentality of being humble and being thankful for my above average upbringing on to myself throughout the past 7 years of studies due to fear of being judged or looked down on by my classmates. 

After spending a night thinking what I would have done had I achieved the same feat as X did, it came to my attention that not the money but the opportunity to interact with my crush at my current internship would have been more attractive. I guessed it would have been an amazing “opportunity” to get a hug from her as I would have been too happy from the winnings. I have always led the ‘loser’ type of life when it comes to relationships. What I mean by that is not being confident in myself and not being brave enough to make the first move. I have had to always rely on something as an ‘excuse’ to talk to her. Even then, I am not able to speak naturally as I do with other regular females. 

I guess the main issue at hand I hope that can be addressed is how I can accept the fact that there will always be people who are luckier and more successful than me with the same theory being applied to me for others. I wonder if it is because I am still young and maybe materialistic that I tend to focus on such issues that don’t actually affect me much in the long run. After thinking about it, I might just be mentally weak. I often wonder how people have the mental fortitude just do as they please or not get affected by missed opportunities/potential earnings.

Once again, I am truly thankful for my upbringing and current lifestyle as it is much more fortunate than other people around the world. Any help would useful and please do not sugar coat at as I am looking towards re-moulding my mentality. Any help on how I can make moves on my crush would be helpful as well   Thanks for reading and I hope you have a nice day


P.S: I understand that gambling is a vicious cycle and the more I try to achieve a feat X has achieved, the more unlikely it will happen.

35,"Ok, I’m pissed so this may be partially a rant as well... sorry if this isn’t the right place. I should mention that this was originally my apartment, I opens it up to a friend who needed to get away from a bad situation, and she just came with a few suitcases, so 90% of the apt is my stuff and it is fully in my name. My roommate keeps doing “helpful” things like -rearranging- “organizing” my things in the bathroom and kitchen, and putting my hand-wash only dishes in the dishwasher... another example would be that I also have a cat, and keep most of her stuff in my room to be out of the way, but do have a treat bowl in the main room to give her rewards for good behavior or just a treat in general and she keeps filling it up with water instead and implying that she is significantly contributing to caring for the cat.

 She also keeps making comments about wanting to reorganize more of my stuff for me(even personal things in my room) even though I’ve repeatedly made it clear that that it a.) makes me uncomfortable and b.) is actually not helpful because then I don’t know where stuff is and it disrupts my schedule.

Somehow I come out of this situation looking like a prick who is getting pissed off at someone just trying to help out around the house, while she is like this unappreciated saint - really I feel like it’s more of a power play? Or she’s just bored maybe? Trying to make it feel more like her home? 

How do I get her to mind her own fcking business or at the very least get her to realize the importance of communicating about potential changes? ",28Jun2018,1
36,I work for an agency providing care for families who have kids with special needs. These parents are divorced and I work at both of their houses. This evening the dad texted me asking me out. He also called and left a voicemail. I told him that our relationship needs to be strictly professional and the agency has rules against it and he didn't respond. I feel pretty creeped out. I think I want to stop working with this family but I already agreed to a bunch of dates for the rest of the summer. The mom has trouble finding providers and I feel bad leaving but I no longer feel comfortable. Should I tell her that he asked me out or just tell her it's not a good fit? Am I overreacting?

39,"He’s dealing with it relatively well. He’s coping okay, I mean. It’s only been a few days since she passed, but I have been affected by the loss more than I expected to. When I initially found out about his mother being hospitalized (saturday) through my partner’s family member, I had to try to get into contact with my partner because he couldn’t be reached due to his phone being dead and had no idea this had just happened. So I called friends to find out where he was, asked them to let me speak on the phone with him...

That experience by itself was traumatic. I have never been the bringer of bad news like that, I didn’t know how to process it. My partner was screaming on the phone, crying, freaking out. Perfectly understandable, no fault or blame to him at all. But... listening to that. Listening to that deep sorrow and sense of hopelessness from someone I love so deeply... hearing his screams. I still can’t stop thinking about it. They echo in my thoughts at night. 

I was with him through the whole thing, which only lasted about 2 days. I was with him in the family meeting with the doctor; where they discussed taking off life support as her illness (cardiac arrest, complete organ shut down) was irreversible and she would never wake up. I was with him when he signed the papers to confirm taking away life support, I was with him when they took the machines away, I was with him when she died. I have never seen a dead person before that day (Monday). She looked so pale, still... absolutely lifeless where 30 minutes before she still had color to her skin. My partner was devastated, his family as well. I tried very hard to hold my composure over the course of the 3 days. I held my partner when he cried, I comforted his family members. I knew his mother as well, she was my friend and like a second mom to me. I was absolutely crushed about everything but felt inappropriate about showing emotion (cried a lot in private, also wanted to remain the “rock” to be able to support my partner as much as possible) as if I shouldn’t feel as affected as I did because I wasn’t related to her, I felt selfish for being emotional. I kept saying to myself “if I cry it won’t help my partner at all, he needs stability, I need to be his rock right now”. 

I haven’t stopped crying since Monday. I can’t sleep, it’s hard to eat. I don’t know who to talk to about this, in full. I talked to my partner about it a little last night, as he said he felt sadness radiating off of me and begged me to talk. I didn’t want to worry him, and certainly didn’t want to make the event all about me, as it was his mom who passed so I felt...strange that he was the one supporting me when I needed to be there for him. I felt so self centered, so I didn’t talk in full of my emotions, but I let some of it out. Treading lightly, as he is also still devastated and I didn’t want to bring any traumatic memories back to him. He was supportive, understanding, said he appreciated me showing emotion because to him it meant I really did care. It was a nice and relieving conversation, although short because I didn’t want to stay on the topic for his sake. 

I can’t sleep or eat, every time I’m not distracting myself I hear his blood curdling screams and see her lifeless body. I feel so selfish. I need to be stable, I need to be his rock, I need to be composed. I can’t stop crying. I have never experienced a death, let alone the loss of a loved one like that. I empathize and sympathize so heavily with my partner though. If I lost my mom, I don’t know how I would manage. He’s being so strong and I feel stupid that I can’t be when I’m alone.

I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to keep going to him of course to talk about it, he needs to grieve and he certainly does not need the burden or chore of worrying about me or trying to care for me. That’s absurd. I am there for him 100% when I’m with him, but when I am alone I am blanketed by unmoving sadness. Deep sorrow. The entire event was traumatic, and it happened so quickly. His mom was fine Friday... Monday, she was gone. Crazy how life plays out so unexpectedly. I don’t know who to talk to. I have no one to really talk to, also I struggle with feeling as though I’m being self centered for talking about my feelings about what happened. I feel lost, and I worry about my partner. I want him to be okay, and I don’t want to give him any more trouble so I keep myself intact when we are together. I feel broken. Seeing him so sad, the love of my life, someone you would never want to be sad to begin with. Seeing his family broken. Seeing his mother in that bed, brain dead. A woman who was always so kind to me, so supportive and accepting... I did love her. 

I don’t know how to process this. I feel like I have to grieve secretly, as that would be more appropriate. All I want is to talk to someone who understands though, which would be my partner but as I said I do not want to cause anymore sadness, and certainly don’t want to be a burden. I don’t know what to do. ",28Jun2018,2

42,"Hi, I want to give a bit of background here so this post will probably be long. Also, hi. I've never posted a topic on Reddit before.

I'm an 18 year old girl and just graduated high school, diploma and everything. I was even in International Baccalaureate, or in other words, absolute hell. I dunno if I got my diploma for that program yet though, have to wait till the 6th. Anyway, I've recently been diagnosed with clinical depression due to a psychological visit after I acted out, and was given antidepressants.

I feel wonderful. My mind is more motivated than ever and I am very happy and relaxed with life. I've dealt with depression that according to my therapist and psychologist, was definitely genetic and chemical based due to my results and the fact I did not need therapy at all.  In other words, I've realized I've felt horrible my whole life and this has been closure for me.

But my mother has a lot on her plate. Apparently, every single female in our family so far has had bouts of depression, and life for my mother has been hell for a long while now. As a younger child I had been molested, My grandmother suffered severe depression her WHOLE LIFE and my mom had to care for her. My grandma was also functionally unstable because she had been wrongly given bipolar medication. My dad walked out due to mental illness when I was 2 years old. She now has a husband and another child, but my stepfather also has a few issues, and can't get a good enough job to support us. My mother also had 3500 dollars missing from her checking account, and the bank wasn't helpful. She wanted to buy me a car for graduation and she couldn't. Not to mention her mother, and two of her best friends have died very recently. Some of her only friends actually, my mother doesn't have a lot of friends, and neither do I. We can't pay for me to go to college, or for anyone to watch my 6 year old brother besides me, so I'm trapped at home.

I want to do something to help her. She's going to therapy and a psychologist that's getting her medication...but it's making her an insomniac. She's now taking a medical leave from her job. I listen to her talk about things and we have a good relationship, especially now that I am medicated. But I want to do more.

My depression made me too anxious to ever practice driving, so I can't drive and don't have a car. I wish I had just done it though. Now I actually want to.

I do have one thing I CAN do though, and that's write. I write so much, I write text messages to friends that are way way too long. With all the mental illness in my life, I want to write, and help people. I want to help people understand mental illness and realize life can be better. For example, I know my stepbrother has anxiety, and he's 12, and I try to talk to him, but I haven't told him about my depression yet and want to. I want my voice to be heard so that someone can smile and say I helped them. And I want to provide for my mom and show her what I've learned,

But again, I have no car because we're poor. I could get student loans for college, but I've always hoped not to. I feel as though I could get a good amount of federal aid/scholarships, but my depression made me unmotivated to apply, so I have to wait a whole year. 

Also, I've been a very sheltered child. My mom had to work as a single mother for years and busted her ass to raise me, but I didn't get out much. I don't know much about any of this. I was good in school, especially for someone with depression, but I don't know a damn thing about the world out there.

So, I have two real needs for advice:

1. How can I provide for my mother quickly, or at least get her lost money back at the very minimum?

Part of her issues are financial, and I wish I could help make life more comfortable.

2. Can I somehow get into writing?

 I've done research, but opportunities for getting yourself out there that way seem to be not as out there as something like acting. It's not just specifically books or essays. It's not even just that. I could probably do anything as long as it can get my voice out there to talk about mental illness. I have other interests like art, any kind of general world building whether it be writing a script or a play. And I'm okay with computers, for an 18 year old girl. I've tried learning to code but it hasn't been too great for me, a tad confusing.

43,"My brother brought a “Pitbull” (he looks more like an American Bulldog and American bully mix) that was going to be used in a dog fighting ring or something of that nature. My brother was friends with the owner and they were going to sell him or give him away but I guess he saw how well we took care of him that he caved in. My brother was trying to make him (along with our small family dog) aggressive, he failed but now he’s scared of him and my smaller dog will (albeit playfully) fight my brother on a second’s notice. I have a very meek personality and didn’t say shit, until he became my dog fully. He still says he’s his bit has acknowledged he’s also mine. I was the one who ended up cleaning after him, bathe and fed him, bought him his expensive af skincare items cause he’s sensitive.  
He’s gotten poor habits so at this point if I wanted to give him away he could just end up at the wrong hands or put down. I don’t want that to happen. Even though he wasn’t mine to begin with, I can’t fail him. Due to some physical issues I haven’t finished high school and have an odd job. I can still buy them that expensive food that doesn’t mess with him but he has yet to be vaccinated or neutered. I know, kill me. But where I’m from taking your dog to the vet isn’t a thing, yes I live in the ghetto, so it wasn’t advised to me. But I want what’s best for my dog. I bought a muzzle (size 5) Baskerville or something, but because of his skull it doesn’t fit too well and I’m sure the other size would’ve been too small.
I’m going to take him to the vet soon, the anxiety I get from just imaging it and them scolded me has held me back (even with my own doctor who stopped my prescription not important though). What’s a safe way for a dog aggressive dog who might also be aggressive towards a stranger poking needles at him, to be taken to the vet?

Side note: he was nonchalant about a dog who was by our metal fence, I thought it was female since he’s usually aggressive but it was a male! Even more so it peed on the fence and he gave zero shits! That gives me hope. He still had good aggressive towards other dogs, I can let him and stick my hand in the bowl and it would be fine. ",28Jun2018,1

52,"Jane (who has a boyfriend) and me, James (single), both right out of college, still in the college town, had found each other before the semester ended and started looking for housing and potentially a 3rd roommate. Both our leases ended in July. We invited Lucy to our group, but she was kind of a housing group already, so we merged into a group of 7. Fast forward to now (after months of bad communication), we've split 4-3, and we've just committed to two houses for a year, but haven't finalized groups.

In the standing proposal, I am not with Jane, but rather with Lucy and 2 from her original group. The four of us would live in a gorgeous house on a hill overlooking the town (for $370/mo including utilities).

The group of 3 would live down the hill a ways in an upstairs apartment, much less nice, but for $250/mo. ea. No one in this group really knows each other, but I'm friends with 2 of the 3 of them (Jane and Mary). Mary is one of my closest friends (and has unreciprocated romantic interest in me). Jane is upset because we'd been planning to live with each other for a while. I could easily swap for the 3rd in this group, and we'd all be very happy.

(YOU COULD START READING HERE)
 
Me in the group of 4 would be me in a spacious house I adore with 3 people I have massive respect for (one potential romantic interest) but just didn't get to know too well in college. They're all quite intelligent, would challenge me more than the other group and provide a very different experience from what I'm used to, and I'm sure we'd bond well over time.

Me in the group of 3 would be very comfortable, and things like weed would be much better received. There'd be no common area, other than the kitchen. Just an shabby upstairs apartment. The other 2 would much prefer me to the other potential 3rd. Living with them would be a couteous thing for me to do.

But damn the group of 4 seems like an adventure, and it'd get me interacting with new people. It seems like it'd be a discrete stage in my life, whereas the group of 3 would be a comfortable same old.",28Jun2018,1

55,"This is my first job so I have no idea? I am a casual worker and have been employed by two sisters who are 23 with their first juice truck business along with a bunch of other 18-22 year olds since February.   


To give some background, the work environment is a bit weird. It feels like theres drama bubbling and theres always gossiping here and there? not sure how to explain it

I have probably had less than 10 shifts so I haven't gained the most experience, but I don't think I am a horrible worker either. Im not super slow, I show up early, I stay after if I have to, Im nice to customers etc. Usually I can pick up on something Im poor at. One of my last shifts which was a month or so ago, I was with the team leader and she was on her phone so I kinda thought it wasn't a big deal if I just check my phone. It was very brief here and there when it was dead quiet with no customers and no cleaning to be done, unfortunately one of the event managers took a photo of me with it and sent it to my boss and she called me after my shift in which I apologised, said it was my wrong doing and that it wouldn't happen again.   


Anyway being a casual I know work is hit and miss which is fine when Im studying full time, but I haven't had a shift in like 5 weeks, I contacted my boss 4 days ago asking about some tax thing and she hasn't opened my message at all. So I then contacted her sister, over 24 hours ago and she hasn't replied either plus its not the weekend or anything.

56,"I have 2 parrots which laid 3 eggs. I didn't want to hatch them but my mom wanted me to because she wanted one too. So I ordered an incubator. And 1 day after, I discussed with her that I can still return the incubator because I don't think you really want a bird for yourself. (Also, my mom works out of town 1.5 hours away so she has here own apartment there. She comes during the weekends and goes back to work for the weekdays). She says put the eggs in anyways. 

Its been 5 days, and 1 of the eggs start developing.  And I searched more on feeding the hatchling. I already knew that it was going to be hard but I didn't know that it was very easy to kill the baby. So I told my mom that I'm going to find a breeder to take care of the bird because of the difficulty and dangers of a novice hand-feeding a bird.  She gets mad and says that I will have to pay for it myself or just throwaway the egg 

Its been a couple hours since that discussion and I call her. I talk about the problems that may happen when weaning a baby bird and I wanted to discuss further on what to do with the egg. She says shes tired of me not researching beforehand and that I need to decide what to do. I told her I didn't want to hatch the egg. And she said she didn't want to hear it. I asked her why she wanted to have a bird. She didn't want me to blame her. I asked whats wrong with getting a breeder to take care of the bird. She said I don't even know where one is and how much it costs. I told her I can contact the pet store we got the current birds from.  So lastly she told me to find out the availability of a breeder and cost. And she ended the call.

I'm sorry of how choppy this sounds. I just called her about this and I'm not sure how I feel. What is the point of me blaming my mom?  What do I do with this egg? I know it is alive right now but it's easier to off it as an egg rather than a breathing animal with eyes that can look at me. Am I in the wrong? Its currently 10:30 and the bird places I wanted to call are closed. So I have to wait. I could really use some advice, whether it is some form of comfort or a wake up slap. ",28Jun2018,2

I'm currently doing a summer internship at a company, and they asked me to do a small booth as a part of one of their events.  I came up with a plan and a budget that I think was very well-thought out and systematic, but when I heard back from the event organizer, they wanted me to cut the budget I asked for by more than half.  That's fine, I like working with constraints, but I have to drastically reorganize the plan that I originally had, as it will no longer work.   I wasn't given much to work with, so my question is; How can I make a small budget go a long way?  I'm looking forward to getting creative with this project, but I'm not really sure where to start.

70,"Hello, guys! I’m going to be a sophomore next year and I’m freaking out for no purposeful reason. I feel like I’m dying on the inside...

1.) Social anxiety = no friends
The first year of high school wasn’t too bad. I had one acquaintance of whom I had lunch with everyday. Next year we have different schedules so I will not see her again. She wasn’t too close but now I’m going to be alone. I have such a hard time making friends. I can talk to people but I really can’t be a sanguine, cheery person that everyone wants as a friend. 

2.) Scared of the future/ college
Sometimes I have panic attacks usually triggered when I think about how useless I am. I have very trivial extracurricular activities and feel stupid most of the time even though I had a 4.0 (which wasn’t too hard for my school). People have done ‘piano for 14 years’ or ‘started a company’ and ‘got an internship to a prestigious program.’ I try not to compare myself to others but it’s almost impossible for me. 

3.) can’t talk to anyone that is higher in position/ make presentations
I stutter all the time and sometimes cry when I talk to people in general.

4.) lack motivation
Although I know I’m supposed to do/ not do something, I can’t force myself to do it because I lack motivation. 

I’m ranting on a lot and complaining...sorry! I do realize that there are people who are less fortunate than me, yet I’m still complaining. I have a high functioning social anxiety disorder but I never told my family. I really wish I can change now...",28Jun2018,1
72,"I live in the US. The state I am in allows for people to get their drivers license by 15. 

During my sophomore year of high school, I fell in love with a boy miles and miles away from me. Being in a long distance relationship, we talked constantly in attempt to make up for the lack of physical interaction. Long story short, we spent so much time talking to each other that we had taken over each other’s lives, causing the both of us to stray away from our priorities (of which included learning how to drive.) 

I don’t blame him. It isn’t his fault at all, nor can I say it is the direct result of our relationship. But it definitely was a factor, and I now regret it every single day. Just recently I began to invest my time into what most 18 year olds have already divulged in- a first job, getting a debit card, etc. The only thing left is a license.

I’m trying to schedule my exam and man do I regret not getting this earlier. I just wish I managed my time better when I was 15. Now it seems everyone my age can drive and I feel so behind. I feel like an absolute burden asking my friends and family for rides. Its not fair to them.

I guess what I’m really asking is how to deal with regret. I don’t know how to stop blaming myself. I’m so critical of myself for not having a license that sometimes it’s all I think about ALL DAY. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel sad when someone asks me to meet up and I have to either scramble for a ride or ask them to pick me up. I feel terrible when my work hours interfere with my parent’s because of my constantly need to go back and fourth.

74,"Hey all,

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

My Dad has been an alcoholic since I was young. I'm now out of the house, done with college and pursuing things in life that interest me. My Dad was never physically abusive, but it was a bad idea to get in an argument with him when he was drunk. He's slowed down some, but I think the alcohol has worn down his mind.

He has a lot of past life events bottled up that I don't know much about. He's mentioned his Mom dying when he was young and moving home to help his Dad (he chose to go to a less prestigious college to stay close). He also talks about not being able to pursue his dream in the military due to his eyesight not being good enough. He's briefly mentioned ""demons"" in his dream to my Mom.

Whenever I call home now &amp; talk about my current life pursuits, he brings up the possibility of me joining the military. I've mentioned many times that I don't have the interest (or personality) for it. He seems like he's disappointed with his own life &amp; possibly disappointed with me. (He's very ""Successful"" from a conventional career standpoint)

I don't know what advice to ask for exactly. I'm very sad. He really wants the best for me and has supported me financially growing up &amp; through college. But when it comes to the idea of what a ""Dad"" is supposed to be, I feel like he's never really been there. I'd like to help him or be there for him, but he doesn't open up. It wears on me emotionally to talk to him, so I'm not sure if I need to stop calling home or try and get him to see a psychiatrist or what.

Thank you again. Any thoughts are appreciated.",28Jun2018,0
75,"Last night was the final straw. When this woman talked down to me like I'm a 5 year old little boy. In front of other women. It was downright humiliating and I felt like those other women lost all respect for me. I wanted to retort back but I'm afraid I might be seen as ""ungentlemanly"", because ""real men don't scold/quarrel with girls"".      

You know how women sound when they cajole kids to do certain things (e.g: ""ohhh baby, have you sharpen your pencils oooo"")? The babytalk kind of speech?  

This is not OK and it's insulting as fuck. I'm a healthy 34 year old male but often get talked down like this. In many cases, I often get mistaken as a college kid.  

The next time I encounter this sort of people where I can't walk away from (e.g: leisure class, work etc...), should I just blast them and call them out for it? (""Why are you talking to me like I'm a baby?"")  

To make it worse, I'm short (5""5) and introvert. But if retorting back using sentences like ""Hey, your mom was fun last night!"" can stop these fucks, I'm more than happy to do it. Been tolerating this nonsense long enough.

80,"I'm generally a whimsical person. I don't take life too seriously and I find a lot of pleasure in finding connections between ideas. 

However, in the morning, I really don't feel like myself. I don't really want to get out of bed or do anything at all really. It doesn't feel like I'm groggy but that I'm seriously lacking in vitality on a more fundamental level. I eventually force myself up and into doing what I need to do with various degrees of success (sometimes shower, sometimes not - that kind of thing. I generally feel pretty pessimistic about my life and engage in hedonistic pleasures like surfing the web mindlessly or masturbation. It may sound like depression but that seems like a simplification of a more specific problem. I feel like I've had depression before and this is something more specific. Throughout the day I generally feel more accomplished but it's not until at night when the lights ironically turn on.

At night, I begin to think about what I've learned (I'm almost always listening to podcast style youtube videos or consuming art that I find interesting) and invariably I come up with all sorts of ways that my interests combine and sometimes I get chills from how beautifully they overlap. I become much more emotional and I'm wont to find meaningful songs from movies or anime that capture an idea or emotion for me and just indulge and incite tears because it feels good to cry from such beautiful things. I'll sometimes begin short stories or write empassioned essays or songs. If I'm alone I'll sing them or record a vlog on whatever is running through my head. 

But then in the morning, I think about how dumb it all is. How I have shit to do and that I don't have time to think artistically. I think about how I need to study to get financial independence so I can be myself more often and then have the courage to be myself to those around me. But, the way I need to think to gain the resources to *become* independent is almost at odds with myself. Or at least I feel that way now (it's currently about 10:30...). 

The problem is that I'm not whimsical enough, or maybe too cowardly to fully be myself. If I just drop trying to get a decent job and pursue the vague idea of ""art"" it would destroy my mother (I know, I've suggested it). Yet, when I try to be honest with my parents, I choke up and can't get the words out. Even one time, when I opened up and spoke my true thoughts and grievances through tears, I feel that not much has changed. Sure, maybe it could, but I don't know if I have the strength to do that a hundred more times before they understand. It's just easier to play the game for a bit and *then* be honest to myself... haha right? That's what I tell myself anyway. 

Is getting a normal job even though I *know* I don't want to be doing it just false to myself? Or does it make sense to get a degree in a major I have no passion for because I know it will pay the bills and be a ""fallback"". ",28Jun2018,1
81,"SO SORRY THIS IS LONG I DIDNT REALIZE IT WOULD BE D:

I typically get home around midnight from work in an area known for its crime and the amount of homeless people around. When my boyfriend and I first moved to the location about a year ago, it wasn't too much of an issue for us because we both come from similar areas.

I park my car about 2 blocks away in a parking garage because my boyfriend has to park in the apartment spot next to our building since his car is now more expensive than mine and it's low riding so it scrapes if he tries to park in the other garage. I don't feel comfortable with this because, again, i get home around midnight and i don't feel safe walking alone. I've asked my boyfriend to meet me at the garage to walk me but he's usually asleep by 1030.

Nothing's happened aside from the usual catcalling from drunks (we live next to a few bars) but nothing too alarming until the other night.

My front key doesn't work so I have to use the back side door once i get through the gate. While walking towards the side of the building, i crossed paths with a homeless guy around my age who i see hang out in my basement sometimes. A few local homeless guys in the same age group will go into our basement/laundry room to hang out and drink. They don't bother anyone so we never thought it was a problem.

We say hi to each other and i let him walk in front of me, about 15 feet ahead. By the time I get to the door he's holding it open for me. I say thank you and walk through. from behind i hear ""you're welcome, Bibi"" (my name).

I've never told him my name nor have i ever had a conversation with him outside the occasional ""hello""

i kept walking towards the basement doorway into the building and i hear ""hey come here"" i turn around and he's standing by the door motioning for me to come closer to him. I said no and turned back around towards the door and he turns the lights off. I get scared so i walk faster and get to the hallway. I turn around and he's right there. again he says ""come here"" and i say loudly NO I'm not going anywhere with you.

I run upstairs, make sure he stopped following me and get into my unit.

I call my boyfriend who was parking the car right away. He doesn't answer (he hates talking on the phone) so I text him what happened in one sentence. He immediately replies back with ""wym"" I tell him i'm scared and the guy knew my name. again he says ""wym"" and i ask him to call me; he texts back ""whats up?""

I'm shaking by the time he walks through the door. I go to him and im trying not to cry because i know he hates that. And tell him again what happened.

He asks if the guy touched me. i said no but that was because i got away - ""why didn't you answer your phone?"" i asked. He then said ""well i dont know what you expect me to do about it"".

I then start crying because for me, it was really scary. A guy doesn't turn off the lights when he's alone in a basement with a woman for good intentions. I ask him if he could talk to the guy and make sure he doesn't bother me again. My BF says that the guy's probably gone (it had only been about 5 minutes ago) and my bf's not gonna go down there and look for him.

I didnt want to put my boyfriend in danger by sending him down there so i didnt want to push it but this is the same bf who a week ago was willing to drive 2 hours away to fight someone who was talking shit about his car online.

so i got upset and mentioned that and asked why he was acting so non chalant and it seemed like he didnt care. he got annoyed and defensive and said ""no one said they didnt care you're just being emotional for no reason. stop crying you're almost 30 you're all over the place and i really don't know why you'd call me or what you expect me to do. if youre really scared just call the police""

so i walked away and called the police while i heard him turn the TV on.

I tried to ask him after I got off the phone and the day after why he didn't care more about this and why he didnt do anything and all i got in response was an eye roll and ""idk idk idk, what is it that you want from this conversation""

am i in the wrong? was i overreacting since the homeless guy didn't actually touch me? is it wrong to have expected my boyfriend to do something about? How can I get him to understand why this is so upsetting to me, both the situation and his reaction? Is it worth breaking up over after almost 3 years together?

TL;DR: homeless guy knew my name and tried to corner me in my apartment building's basement in the dark. My boyfriend responded with ""well what am i supposed to do about it?"". is it wrong to expect him to handle this or do something to protect me then or in the future?",28Jun2018,8

86,"Not sure if this is the best place to ask this question, but I really need some advice. Also, this is a throwaway account to protect the identities of myself and others involved. I may also be somewhat vague at times in order to achieve the same goal.

My girlfriend texted me a few days ago while she was at work because she had seen a few of her coworkers doing coke while on their shift and was clearly seeing the effects of it on them. While she felt safe enough to stay the rest of her shift, it freaked her out a fair bit. She works in food service, and apparently her managers were fine with this happening and she was told that even the owner of the establishment does Cocain fairly regularly. This same owner also has a possibly fatal illness already.

I realize that the use of Cocain is not some extremely special scenario, but the drug is very addictive and dangerous and at the very least SHOULD NOT be used in a workplace. We are also both extremely uncomfortable with the normalcy that exists at her work in relation to the drug. While Cocain is not the most dangerous drug in the world by a fair margin, it is certainly very unhealthy and also quite illegal. It should not be normal for an entire workplace to be fine with the drug’s use, especially while workers are on the clock. 

How in the world does she proceed? There are some people who are even higher up the ladder than the owner, but they may be more difficult to contact... Who should my girlfriend call first? Should she call the police? Should she attempt to collect evidence before she does so? Should she just leave the job (which is her main source of income)?

I am not trying to set up some kind of heroic drug-bust, but I also do not think this activity should continue. How can we help the situation and those people?

90,"A few weeks ago my bf of 1.5 yrs went on my phone behind my back. I didn't care, there was nothing to find. He was embarrassed and apologized for doing that. I told him it's totally fine, but if he ever thinks I'm cheating to just ask, because I'd hate for him to be harboring that feeling for long!
I have never been on his phone and I told him ""honestly I'm scared of what I might find haha"" he assured me ""why? There's nothing, I'm boring. I don't care if you did.""

I always wondered if he said I could go on his phone because he knows I wouldn't. He's said many times he has nothing to hide and I can go on it and I've always replied with ""I'd never.""

Well on the other hand, hes one of those people who takes his phone into the bathroom, keeps it in his pocket instead of on the table, if it is on the table it's face down, and aleepa with other next to his head on the mattress.

My curiosity has been growing a lot lately. As my self esteem is low (because of him) and we've been fighting a lot. I really do love him

Well on my birthday last week, I found part of women's clothing by his bed. He said it must've been accidentally carried in with laundry because he does share a laundry room with a older woman downstairs. Honestly I can believe that but I said ""ok let me look at your phone"" and he said ""fine, here!"". He gave it to me but after I looked for about five seconds he took it back and said ""no actually I'm not comfortable with this,  I swear I'm not hiding anything, but this is invading my privacy"" then he made me go home. 

We fought and made up, he stood his ground that even though he went on my phone he regrets it and that he doesn't want me on his because it just invades his privacy but absolutely swears he is hiding nothing. During a phone call he even listed every text and message he has. 
I really wanna believe him.

I spent the night last night and it's all I can think about. I want to go on that damn phone to ease my mind but he absolutely won't let me.

He put Netflix on Chromecast for me via is phone and I waited for him to sleep then grabbed the phone. Within one second he woke up and asked me why I have it. I said I wanted to click ""next episode"" on Netflix. he was like 'oh' and took it and clicked next fore and put the phone back by his head. Boy did he wake up fast? ! 
Also he said 'i might sleep on the couch because the tv is keeping me up"". I couldn't help but think he wanted to go on the couch so his phone was far from me. 

I feel paranoid. I just want to fucking see. Is this actually about privacy or...is he cheating? Does anyone else feel this way about your significant other going on your phone when though you're innocent ?

For some random context, here's some tidbits:
-hes very alpha, I am beyond beta in the relationship, so no, I can't just put my foot down and make him let me see it. 
-on Instagram he posts pics of him, his dog, him with friends. There's absolutely no pics of me/us. When we first started dating a year and a half ago he did but then during a fight he deleted them, and hasn't posted any of me/us since. It's been around 14 months since he last did that. 
-when we first started dating, he deleted Facebook, he said it was too negative and time consuming. I understood, but when we has a brief breakup half a year ago, he got Facebook back that day. When we started dating again he deleted it again. (Well, not delete, but ""deactivate"". When you deactivate you can still use messenger).
-despite our fights or threats of breakup, he always comes back. He always takes pics of me. (And always says he will post them but never does. **SIDE NOTE** I don't give a fuck if he posts us or not, it's the fact that he once did, but now doesn't that gets to me. As if I am hidden)
-ive given him plenty of chances to leave
-i don't feel he's physically cheating, honestly most spare days he has are spent with me and we talk online 24-7. But I'm afraid he's doing something wrong on his phone. 
-i don't know if it matters but he is 33, I'm 31.
-hes a narcissist

To be honest I want to hear that I'm crazy and that this is all normal behavior and I'm just being paranoid but it's consuming all my thoughts. 
Believe me if I could sneak on his phone I would. I would look once and that would be it. If I found nothing id never doubt him again. If I found something I'd definitely be gone.

91,"Throwaway in case she reddits.

I'm 26 and she's 24. I met Susie earlier this year through work and we hit it off. She's a huge animal lover and loves movies, she's adventures, kindhearted. Loves children, she's pretty. She goes to the humane society for fun because petting cats makes her day! She seems so normal and well rounded. That's why I'm kinda freaking out right now because this is so out of left field. 

Through all of this she has pretty bad depression. She confided in me that she wears wigs because about a year ago she had the worst emotional breakdown and that she chopped all of her hair down to less than an inch. She then said that she chose to cut her hair because if it wasn't that she would have cut her skin and cuts and scars aren't easy to hide. She could just hide her hair and say ""she decided to take the big chop.""

A couple days later she admitted that her boyfriend who she's been with for almost 18 months, she doesn't really love him. She says that she can't do any better so why break up. She has 0 attraction for the guy. She says that the only guys that will come up and talk to her are drugged out homeless men, and that guys she's attracted to aren't attracted to her. I've personally have seen this happen and it does suck. She has a great body and she's not ugly so I don't know what gives but I digress.

Next thing is what broke my heart the most. We were hanging out over wine and she breaks down in tears. I thought she probably had too much but she tells me why. We were talking about having kids one day and she was talking with so much passion about her future kids. But then she stopped and said she probably shouldn't have any because she was ""probably gonna kill herself"". That she wanted to experience having and raising children but she could see herself taking her own life shortly after that. She starts crying more and called herself a horrible mother before she can even be a mom. 

I didn't know what to say so I just hugged her and let her cry it out. I put the wine away and let her sleep in my spare bedroom for the night. She's wine sleeping now but I'm freaked out... I know she has a therapist appt scheduled but she mentioned she can't see her till mid august. What do I do? It breaks my heart seeing my friend in so much pain.

92,"Im kinda nervous. I am 15yo and a girl, ive never really had an actual relationship before which is the tricky part about this. I am attracted to people, im questioning whether im bi or straight but regardless i am attracted to people. There are sometimes that i am seriously infatuated and practically in love with others but the idea alone of having any sort of relationship, romantic or sexual, makes me disinterested. Im scared that someday im not going to be able to actually be in love with someone. I have a lot of love to give and im ready to give it to someone who's willing to return it. I feel like most of my fear is stemming from not actually knowing what its like to be truly in love, to know what its like when you look at someone and think ""i want to be with this person forever"". It seems silly but its actually bugging me, my biggest fear is ending up alone. I guess im just looking for advice from someone who's had better luck in relationships then i have.",28Jun2018,1

94,"Hello everyone,

So I'm making this post to receive some advice for my sibling which I could use to help them out. I will keep their name private for personal reasons. To start off he graduated from college for computer programming with honors, which was two years ago (2016). Fast forward to now, he doesn't have a job in his related field which is kinda of upsetting to see because he so knowledgeable with coding and has so much passion. I'm in school for IT and he's very helpful when it came to the coding classes, he took his time to teach me everything he knew.

Anyway, he has no job at the moment, he kinda just sits at home because it's difficult for him to get a job in his related field, I did manage to find him a temporary office job which he did well in but now he's finished. It's very annoying that these companies for entry level programming jobs are so fucking picky, you need a Bachelors, 5+ years of experience or something crazy for an entry level position. Personally If I were a hiring manager I would rather hire the person with more knowledge over education, in my opinion.

I just need some advice to help him out, I want him to be successful in life and his career, I don't like seeing him like this. Any advice given is very appreciated. 

Thank you!",28Jun2018,1

 I feel like I know hardly any girls. I’ve been on a few dates since the break up but I keep dating people I met in high school :/ I want to branch out more, meet new people, but I hate drinking/going to bars and tinder feels so fake. What are some good ways to meet new people/potential love interests? Is going out drinking really the only option? I’m in NYC!! I feel like there should be plenty of opportunity all around me, but I just don’t see it. Idk if it helps at all but I’m super into music, I’m an audio engineer. I thought maybe concerts?

96,"Hey all, so a little backstory. I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 2 years and recently we decided it was time to move in together for a variety of reasons. Mainly, I recently started a new job making more money, almost double what i used to make. My gf doesnt have a good relationship with her parents (dad isnt in the picture and mom is boderline abusive) and was kicked out of the house when she was 17 but she later moved to a dorm for college in Michigan. Now she’s transferring back to houston and she’s currently staying with a friend, however they are breaking lease as shes only allowed to stay for a week without being on the lease, and it has now been 1 month. So she needs to move out asap. She has an older sister who has offered to take her in however her sister has been indicating that she might move out with another friend soon and has told my gf she would need to pay the entire rent (yes ridiculous i know) as well as things like groceries. As for me, i have a good relationship with my parents however i feel like its time to be on my own and tbh i want more freedom. Now, i would offer my gf to stay with me and pay rent to my parents however they disapprove of our relationship because we are of different race and have even refused to meet her when i bring it up. Now this is my dilemna. We have been apartment searching for a week and we found a (imo) perfect place. Its literally 2 minutes from my job, its recently renovated, within our budget, has all the commodities we’re looking for. The only issue is the apartment is 30-40 minutes away from her job and school and she is hesitant to move cause of that. Im worried that we will lose out on this place but i also understand why she doesnt want to. She suggested moving somewhere in between our jobs but whenever we look the cheapest is usually 2-3 times our budget. She also doesnt have a car so she would be relying on me or uber/lyft for transportation so again i understand why shes hesitant. I have considered placing a deposit and moving in myself and telling my gf she can move in when she feels ready but i think this will make her feel pressured to move in with me and i dont want her to regret it later on. But moving to my side of town is the only way to make it work. How should I convince her that its whats best for us? Am i being selfish? Any help is appreciated thanks guys

TLDR: gf is hesitant to move into apartment due to distance and lack of vehicle, should I continue to try and convince her or should i let it go and try to move closer to her area?",28Jun2018,1

98,"Hi all. I dropped out of college after my first year due to a heart condition but also due to depression, and not knowing what I wanted to do. I plan on going back to school soon and now I just have no idea what to do, even after having made decisions on this (I always change my mind as soon as I make up my mind). I was just wondering if you all new what was out there for certain majors. the number of careers that go with certain majors can become extensive and I don’t think I know about everything that’s out there. I’m focused on getting a degree that will get me a long lasting career. So I’m looking more ahead towards my career rather than just my major. A little bit about me:
1. I love kids. I am getting a job at the boys and girls club soon and couldn’t be happier. It’s very tiring, but they give me joy and I feed off of their energy. I can’t physically have kids myself (due to number 3) but this is my way of making up for it.
2. I love animals. I love them so much that I feel a special connection between myself and all animals I come across. I am very emotional when it comes to handling any upsetting matters having to do with animals.
3. I have pulmonary hypertension, so any career I have has to align with my restrictions: lifting, pushing, and pulling no more than ten pounds, not walking up large sets of stairs or big hills, no running, and other physical limits.
4. My only, and when I say only I mean only, talent is writing. I am a good writer. I don’t write enough and want to hone my skills and become the best writer I can, whether this be for fun or for a career. However, I don’t really read and would like to read more to get better at writing.
5. I am autistic. I have aspergers. So I learn and process information a lot differently than others. I need things repeated, I need direct and thorough instruction, and almost all of the time, I need extremely hands on training. 
6. I’m mostly torn between working with either kids or animals. I love both so much and I wish I could do both at the same time. With animals, idk if I have the smarts for the schooling and the emotional stability for the work. But, I like animals more than kids so I’d rather work with animals.
7. If I could do anything for a living, it would be writing. However, I’m not sure I’m good enough to break into any certain industry with that as its focus. Songwriting seems really interesting to me but I’ve only recently written one song that could be considered even half decent.
So my question is, what careers are out there that would be good for me based on this information, and what major would I need to get there? I know you don’t really know enough about me based on this information, so if you have any questions or need more info feel free to ask. I’m a very open person and I don’t mind answering any questions you have.",28Jun2018,1

100,"24 year old professional male here, I make 40k but am living with a roommate to save for house, pay off college debts, etc. 

My mom is 49 and is getting kicked out of her uncles house that she’s lived in for 4 years. Before that she lived with her sister 2 years, and her daughter (my sister) 2 years. She has no money, no car, no job, and most likely major mental health issues. She is calling me constantly but I don’t know how to help her or what to do. I feel like a terrible son for not providing any assistance to her. None of the family will take her in. Technically I make enough money to get a small 2 bedroom outside of the main city I live, but I’m scared for my sanity and own personal mental well being if I let her move in. What should I do? Is there anything I can actually do? She lives in Northern California and I live in Arizona. 



I’ve thought about trying to get her to go to rehab because we think she might be using meth again (won’t admit it) and drinks (but said she claims she doesn’t have a problem). But rehab is usually only 90 days max. 

I’ve tried convincing her to get a part time job, but her life was really rough and she never even attended High School. Her entire life was takig care of her children or working cleaning jobs at the church when we were young. 


A lot of the long term shelters I found require the women to have children under 18. I’m not sure what to do - I feel like a terrible son and awful person if I just let my own mother become homeless. If she does become homeless I’m worried she might kill herself, become involved with bad men, or other things necessary to survive.

102,"i always tell myself not to compare myself to other people but i can't help it. 

my self esteem just crashes into rock bottom sometimes that i can only bring myself up if i look at how someone else is doing and compare and tell myself...that maybe ***i’m not as bad because they're worse***. 

which is incredibly toxic, no matter how silently and internally i do it. It sucks. i know my weaknesses and strengths, but i don't know if what i have is enough for the career or internship i have my mind set towards.

Now listen, I know it's unhealthy but it makes sense to me. I look at people who’ve slingshot and landed into their career with poise and grace and I tell myself maybe my portfolio is shit but these other classmates/people got into my dream career and i'm just as talented and *even more so than they are*.

It's kind of a reverse comparing myself where instead of ""wow they're doing so much better and i'll never get to their level"" i'm comparing the ""bottom rung""  and saying ""wow they're so much worse so i must be doing good"" and it's horrible.

Just as a note, I never talk about this in public. All of this is internalized as a sort of mechanism to not feel as bad about myself. I don't let the judgement I make of peoples work affect how I treat them or view them as people, it's mostly just for me to not feel shitty about myself.

104,"Hey!

I'm a 19 year old college student living with my parents during college to save money. My family rents an apartment to save money, most families own a house or condo. (Note: this is NOT a housing project).

I've always felt weird when everyone but my family seemed to live in nicer dwelling. People go ""oh really,"" when I say I live in an apartment, tell me my family rents because they are poor, and ask if I am ""ghetto"". Obviously, we didn't have many guests over when I was a kid.

My neighbourhood is not particularly unsafe, we don't live in a ""ghetto"", we just rent an apartment.

Sometimes it brings me down, apartments are ugly and my neighbourhood shows signs of lower-income life. I drive by nice houses and feel jealous and even sad. Usually, I turn down invitations to parties/ events at houses since it makes me sad to go home to our dwelling.

I'm looking for people who grew up in such accommodations, who can maybe relate to me. Is it normal to feel sad?

Obviously this isn't forever, when I finish college I'll get a better job, move to a lower cost-of-living place and maybe have my own little townhouse one day (not detached house since I have NO IDEA how to do maintenance).

106,"My father is a narcissist, do you know how I know? Because I am exactly like my father, my therapist currently suspects I am a narcissist and I act exactly like my father. 

Although my narcissism only appears as a reaction to abuse. I have had an easy time suppressing it but I failed a few days ago. My father had cheated on my mother for years and had a secret family we never knew. 

My mother pretended it was a lie until she saw it for herself, my father beat her and my sister had to scare him off with a knife. Later he came to my house to say hi, and although I wanted to hold it back I couldn't. 

In the past, my father used to abuse me, and I was his favorite target. Whenever he wanted to hit my sisters or mother I would make him angry at me to take it away from them. 

But as my father got older and I got bigger than him he stopped the hitting, I talked to him about it and made my stance clear. My narcissism was heavily suppressed by this point and I felt docile and okay. 

But when I found out my dad was back to his ways it came back full blast. I beat my dad senseless to the point where he had to go to the hospital and get stitches. 

I harassed him and threatened him through text, I attacked his flaws and self-esteem and made him suicidal most likely. My father said he will never talk to me again and that I am dead to him. 

My uncle and aunt hate me, my mom hates me, and my sisters hate me for hurting him. I don't regret in the slightest hurting him, and I find it laughable that he thinks he's punishing me by not 'talking' to me. 

Whenever I think about what happened I can't stop laughing at how he tried to run away from me as I kept punching and kicking him. The big man who used to threaten me ran away crying and begging me to stop until he passed out from pain. 

The blood, sweat, and tears mixed together to create a truly beautiful face on art on his mangled face. So I wonder what kind of monster am I becoming? Am I going to be just like him?

110,"Lately (1.5 years), I've grown to REALLY ressent my father for not providing for my siblings, mother and I, as I believe a father should. This comes as I started college and have an objective view of the situation.

My father, as I've come to notice, seems to have low moral character, is lazy, blames others for his misfortunes, and is in my opinion a ""failure"".

He moved to US from his and my mom's home country to ""start a new life"" and never did well, often only worked 20 hours a week at ""pretty office jobs"" instead of working any job he had to in order to pay the bills (ex: he quit a labourer job after three days and my mom's parents had to provide). He cares what people think and only hangs out with people who have social status, and invite him to dinner at their house, but never reciprocated, so he doesn't maintain friendships. BTW he makes a low income, he can't like throw parties to ""thank"" these people.

We don't live in a nice house and never had fun activities to do. Vacation? First one when I was around 11. 

He always complained about EVERYTHING (politics, work, people he dislikes). I'm not exaggerating when I say one of the reasons I refuse to talk to him for longer than 5 min is because he just complains about everything. How can I maintain a relationship with someone who is ALWAYS NEGATIVE and ALWAYS COMPLAINING (again, not an exaggeration).

Please, be understanding. I have come to the realization that I recent my father because he is lazy and has low moral character more so than his low income. I genuinely used to believe it when he told me (as a CHILD) he's doing bad because of excuse X, Y, Z (boss, people are stupid at his job, etc), but now I see through that and can't look at him the same way.

My poor mother, living a low-quality lifestyle in a foreign country, all because her husband is lazy. When I finish college I hope to provide her a nice apartment or place to live.

116,"Backstory
-My mom and stepdad own a restaurant and my gf's grandmother works there as a dishwasher. She's worked there even before I started dating her granddaughter. Things were pretty normal for the longest time, my mom and her grandma got along at work, my gf (let's call her ""C"") was able to come over to my house, drive with my mom to all my sporting events when I was in high school, etc. Practically any normal high school relationship between the couple and the families. But now, this shit has completely flipped upside down.

C will be a senior this year, and I will be going into my sophomore year of college. We dated since I was a junior and since she was a freshman. We went through a pretty serious issue during my time in high school but since talked about it and resolved the issue. We split up during my freshman year in college because we had to figure ourselves out with personal issues and we ended up doing this and got back together. Now let me tell you guys something, our love is very strong. and she makes me the happiest guy in the world. She has a lot of physical and mental problems such as rheumatoid arthritis and severe depression. She relies on me for happiness and I give her exactly that.

I can't really explain what happened, but it just seemed like in the blink of an eye my mom and C's grandma started to dislike each other at work. My mom told me she would cuss in anger in front of the customers and always have an attitude along with always accidentally breaking the dishes. And I would be lying if I said some of those things were kind of true.

A situation happened at work recently where the tip money got stolen from off a table and I my mother told me she told all of the dishwashers to not touch the tip money off the tables. Well, that somehow turned into the grandma saying that my mom putting the blame on her. and My mom said she called C's grandma's attitude pathetic, and then that turned into C's grandma saying my mom called her pathetic as a person. Obviously, this got to C's family, and specifically C and her mom. Now as you can tell, they're not too happy at this point. It should be noted, that C and her grandma and C's mom are the type of people to say something and when they say something they mean it and own up to it.

I asked my mom if she did say these things and she said that never happened and C's grandma took it out of context because she's a liar. My girlfriend is getting really sick and tired of my mom being the way that she is. It should be noted that my mom said C isn't welcomed at my house. My mom isn't happy she's bisexual and she told me she doesn't think she's a very trustworthy person. My mom even said her grandma is out to get after the business. 

Now, me being her son, that's my mother. My caretaker. And I love her. But those things really hurt me because that girl makes me the most happiest. My curfew (because I'm dating her) is 11:30 P.M. I'm 19.

And then the icing on the cake. 

Yesterday, C was at cheer practice and some girls decided they wanted to go into town and eat at my family's restaurant. C said she didn't wanna go eat there. Somehow, some girl overheard that and got in contact with my sister (my sister and the girl who overheard) said ""Hey your brother's gf said she didn't wanna eat at the restaurant because of the way they treated her."" This got back to my mom and said ""wow I like how you're gf can slander the restaurant. If I ever catch her in your car I'm taking it away.""
I talked to C politely and nonaggressively and she almost teared up and said she never ever said that. She told me it wasn't only her and a couple of other cheerleaders wanted to eat somewhere else as well. Well then, I told my mom ""Hey. C never said that. she said she didn't want to eat there and that was it. I'm sorry, but she teared up and swore up and down she never said anything about you guys treating her a certain way."" My mom's response was, ""Yeah. because she's a liar. and she has you so whipped. Glad you take their side instead of your own families.""

Tomorrow I leave for Electric Forest in Michigan and I won't be back for 4 days. So, being the good boyfriend that I am, I'm gonna go see my girl before I leave. Right now, she's not in the best mental state. She's not herself. I reassure her before I leave and go up there, that I love her with all my heart and she's my happy person. Her mom told me she's not doing so good right now.

I got this text message from C's mom just a little bit ago:

""She doesn't think you believe her and she is very upset. I believe you, but I also know that this thing with your mom will be the reason you guys don't work out. I keep reassuring her but crap like what happened before our vacation just keep building up. I don't blame you for wanting to believe that your mom never said shit. But I wholeheartedly believe she did. I also believe she wouldn't want you to know she did because she knows you love C. She knows the frustration will eventually win and C will break up with you. She wins then. C may not want all this said and she may not want to make you feel bad or uncomfortable or ill feelings towards your family, but the fact of the matter is, it is employees and customers that have come to us and said shit. There is only so many times someone can be treated this way before they break. I just think it's sad that the outside shit from someone who should want the best for you and see you happy is putting such a strain on the two of you. I don't get involved until her well being starts being messed with. She was happy again, and this bullshit with your mom is now ruining it. You better do something, or your love for her isn't going to be enough. I really don't want to see that. You need to tell her you believe her and have her back and that no one else no matter who it is is going to come inbetween again.""

Am I dealing with an overbearing mother? I'm so confused with my mom. I love her to death. I just want things to be great again. If you made it down this far, thank you so much for reading and I look forward to your reply. ",28Jun2018,1
117,"I am getting my wisdom teeth removed in two weeks. I am signed up for local anesthesia, but if I feel really nervous I can change it to general anesthesia.
I’ve been thinking about it, and I honestly think general anesthesia would be a better fit for me since I am so nervous. But I have seen videos on facebook/youtube of the aftermath that are shared millions of times. I honestly don’t think they are funny, and think about how awful it would be to be in such a situation.
My parents said they wouldn’t record me, but my dad is the worst and always does things when he says he won’t . I made a comment the other day about it and he made a joke. Like no I am being serious about you not recording me. I would feel no sense of privacy anymore.
Also I’m scared I would tell secrets or spill things I wouldn’t want my parents to know.

I told my dad if I decide to get general anesthetic that he is not coming. I don’t care if that upsets him, but I can not trust him right now.
Is there any possible way that a dental assistant or someone could watch over me until the anesthetic has completely worn off?

My dentist said my teeth will only take 2-4 minutes each to take out, and that they don’t have roots yet so they should come out easily. So either way it shouldn’t be that bad.. I think I’m just overthinking this?

121,"So this girl and I are pretty good friends, and she’s one of a very small amount of friends I have that I really get along well with. I used to have more romantic feelings for her, but now with certain events taking place, we are more friends than anything. Recently the two of us agreed to go out together to get lunch to celebrate my birthday, all mutual feelings. She told her boyfriend, I don’t know why exactly, but he was not happy with it at all and wants her to talk to me very little if at all and not see me, definitely not for one on one stuff like that because he thinks I have feelings for her and/or that he doesn’t trust that she won’t do anything with me. Basically, he would be ending our friendship because he was not happy that we went together to celebrate my birthday, and taking away a really great friend from me and one of the best people I know. I’m not sure how much he knows about me or my relation with the girl, but we have had a lot of fun times together like singing in the car or in the back of an old classroom singing and playing guitar in the downtime, making origami and doing homework together, the feeling has essentially always been mutual. It probably doesn’t affect anything, but she and I just graduated, her boyfriend is a junior-going-to-be-senior. I know for a fact she sees me as a friend, I doubt that she sees me as anything more, but it is always a possibility. I am just a good friend to her, I have no real intention of going further than that as long as she has a boyfriend; I always have and always will respect her decision to be with a certain guy; it’s just my personality, yes I know it’s not typical. She has told me before that she plans to break up with him by the end of the summer for college reasons, and I don’t know where their relationship stands as of the moment I make this post or how she is/has dealt with him not wanting her to talk to me or see me. I’m just asking 1) is it ok for him to try to tell her to do something like that, 2) should she even listen to him and do what he says, which would basically end our entire friendship, even though she plans to break up with him, 3) should I say something to her (I don’t really have a way to talk to him) and what should I say? I don’t want our friendship to end cause I value it a lot and at least from my perspective we get along pretty well and she has helped me through some stuff, and I don’t know what to make of everything, granted what her relationship status is like and how it affects our ability to really be friends as of this moment.

123,"To be honest, since I've decided to decrease contact with my bipolar sibling, I feel much better and happier. It's not like I've chosen to avoid any contact or decided to exclude her from my life, I just want to make sure that her toxic behavior does not affect me now as a grown up as it did while I was growing up. I am a survior of many trauma, from bullying to family drama, and my therapist believes I have potential PTSD.
Now while living alone with my loving and understanding partner I have finally come to terms that I finally accept myself with all my flaws and history, I have become very ambitious as well, concentrating mostly on my studies and future career.
The problem occurs when some relatives ask question about my bipolar sister, and make me feel guilty about the whole family situation. I know they care and worry dearly, but I don't think they are allowed to judge since they never lived with her. The other day my uncle remarked that I should contact my sister more and even in the future take care of her, cook for her and let her live with me. I felt offended and triggered by this remark and all the trauma came back.
It's simply not fair. One day I will have a family of my own, a job and my own life to organize. My sister is ill, but she is not handicapped. She is capable to cook and take care of herself, yet she chooses to live with my parents and criticize them daily. She attacked me multiple times about random stuff and even stolen from me, my parents and other siblings. I don't want my children to encounter this, nor I want my partner to be a victim of her manipulation. My uncle told me I should accept it's because of her deasease and I should be mentally more stronger. I don't know how can  I manage that with anxiety attacks and fight/flight mode when I feel endangered. I am aware he makes these remarks because family means everything to him, but I cannot take care of one person so I myself and others around me would suffer.
Am I a bad person for being realistic? For wanting myself to be mentally well and finally cure my trauma? For wanting to have a healthy relationship, and a healthy family life?

TL;DR: my relatives are forcing me to take care of my bipolar sibling, but I don't consider that fair since she caused me many trauma growing up. They are making me feel guilty for my family situation.

\- We met on a dating site a year ago, but she wasn't interested in dating me at the time. We stayed friends

\- Over the course of the year I got to know her very well.

\-- She told me about all her previous relationships and how she was abused emotionally and physically. She dated some really horrible people

\- I never really considered dating her until recently, when we started hanging more frequently (almost everyday we go biking and explore the city or watch tv shows/movies are her place). A lot of her friends and my friends think we would make a great couple. She seems to agree and shows a lot of renewed interest in me

\- She wants to date. She constantly hints at it, but I'm kind of nervous at the idea. Like I said before, I've gotten to know her really well

\- She suffers from depression and social anxiety. She can be very mean and judgmental. I've heard her constantly make fun of the physical appearance of people she had hookups with. She's sexually picky and openly criticizes people that don't know how to sexually please her

\-I've never dated anyone before. No real sexual experience either. I'm 24, she's 25.

\-I enjoy hanging out with her, and she's very attractive, but I feel like the experience gap between us and her high standards will make this a very awkward relationship.

125,"Hi Reddit, 

So I am in a bit of a weird situation with work. I recently got a job at an environmental consulting firm as a summer field technician. Everything was going smooth and then my boss asked me to step into his office one day. 

He told me that he wanted to start a new company and that he wanted me to lead the project and get it up and running. Obviously I said yes right away with minimal questions as I am trying to make a good name for myself. Now that I have done a lot of work for the new company, I've built proposal packages, materials costing, list of equipment, operating procedures and I'm getting paid under the environmental consulting firm. 

The thing is... The new work that im doing for the new company just got registered and I'm wondering if I should ask my boss if get a title out of this? Shouldn't I be getting double compensation or am I being greedy? I don't want money per say but I would like something on my resume or CV saying John Appleseed (XYX company, Lead biologist) or something of that sorts.

131,"Hi, I \[29M\] am in need of some help on a situation that I recently found myself in. I'm a stay at home husband that has a loving wife. She is my best friend. We are completely open and honest with each other and never want to lose one another.

I became a stay at home husband when the Affordable Healthcare Act went into effect about 5 years ago (before we were married). We figured out with the insurance, I would bring home only a few hundred bucks a month. She was starting her career with 60+ hour weeks and me working nights and weekends we would never see each other. With her career we could actually live off her income alone and be happy. See each other more and household cleaning and cooking would get done (aka she don't cook).

Today we live very comfortably off her income with no worries. I actually stated a small business from home that helps pay some extras, plus keeps me busy.

My wife came to me recently and told she is willing to consider a serious V poly relationship (several reasons why, see below) we me as the hinge.

I just don't know if should pursue something like this. Or even if a lady would be interested in me and something like this. Any advice, thoughts, input would be helpful.

More Details:

She has some female issues that makes sex uncomfortable and painful. Making sex unwanted most of the time.

We both have only ever dates each other, which is very cool and all but makes you wonder.

I have always enjoyed the company of female friends but in recent years have found myself with almost no friends (moving and marriages, you know life stuff)

At times I would like to have another strong connection with a companion.

133,"Hi Redditors!

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit so I apologize if I've posted this on the wrong sub and whatnot. (If so, if someone could refer me to another sub, that would be great!) I also apologize in advance if this is long but I feel like the context is important.

So to give a little context, I've been raised by a tiger mom for the past 21 years, pressured through unimaginable hours of school and extracurriculars, ""guided"" into a path toward medical school, and raised with the expectations of good grades. However, in my 3rd year of college, I was forced to take a break due to depression and anxiety. I believe it's due to the stress from my parents and knowing their constant expectations for good grades and high achievement standards. However, my mother believes everyone deals with anxiety and that I'm simply lazy and unable to sacrifice my ""fun"" time.

Everyone I've talked to says that I should take a break, relax, and sit back and enjoy life and maybe re-think my future. My mom believes it's all to do with working hard, and that since I'm not working hard enough right now, there shouldn't be any fun time to be had. As she describes me,I've already wasted so much time, I'm not a normal college student, I don't have the attributes of a good student, etc. She expects me to constantly be worrying about my future and that she be the one to tell me to take a break.

Well, honestly, I feel like I'm at my breaking point. I found an incredible oncology research job for the next 6 months as I take a gap before hopefully returning to college with a set goal (obviously the 6 am - 7 pm workday isn't enough for my mom either - she expects more). Do you guys think it's time for me to leave the house? I've always been scared of leaving, and as much as I appreciate everything she's done, I don't think I can take it anymore.

Thanks for any advice!

Once we got home he acted as if nothing happened, I told him I wanted to talk about what just happened he got irritated and walked away to shower. Once he got out he countinued acting like nothing happened. So I told him again I wanted to talk, he said he would give me 10 minutes and in those 10 minutes didn't say much and left me feeling very unheard and stupid. I asked him why he was acting like this and he said I'm annoying......I told him that he keeps having a bad attitude and calls me names when he's mad so that's why I want to keep talking. 😕 I countined to talk and he walked away with our son in his arms. I continued talking saying how I felt knowing he was hearing me. Was upset but not yelling or calling him names. Just saying how hurt I was and tired of his bad attitude. I then walk up to him and ask for the baby and he said no I said let me have him and he got so mad and said, "" Here bitch take him"".

Every little thing he does is very annoying and just comes into my room whenever he pleases, not even a knock. I have told my mum to turn him away but she said she feels bad because he’s old and has helped her bring my brother and sister over here.

Did I fucking mention he just invited himself to our family trip? This is my first time going to see my other brother and grandmother and he just fucking decided to ruin this trip by not even asking my mum to check with me or my brother? I have cried a lot because I’m disgusted in my mum for not turning him away because he offered the help, not her and am disgusted that this man thinks because my mother is single she is looking for a new partner. My mum isn’t in the fucking mood to be screwed over again and I’m sure as hell doubt she’s wanna end up in some loveless relationship like her sisters and cousins. She has escaped abuse from her mother and partners and has said multiple times to him that she loves her space and doesn’t need anyone else but he insists. He has a home here he rents but decided to sleep here which was a huge inconvenience as my mum took my sister and slept in my bed.

 I am not comfortable with this. Initially I wanted my father to go, but he couldn’t as he spent most of his funds on making a documentary on the homeless and also spent money on my brothers switch and Xbox consoles. This isn’t the first time he’s invited himself on our trips, he decided to go to Germany with us and it was a nuisance. Not to mention ruined our Christmas last year. 

I’m very thankful for how he’s helped my family but he knows my mum isn’t one person but she’s me and my siblings as well. It hurts that she didn’t ask us. I can’t just suck it up, I’ve lived without a father in the household and I don’t fucking want one who isn’t flesh and blood. Someone who asks if it’s okay to come along with us on holidays, someone who is easy to get along with and someone who is considerate.
I speak very highly about my father who hasn’t gotten his shit together, but it beats some old man who is just outright rude and annoying. I’ve tried my hardest to be kind and be nice but that kindness ended when he decided to force himself on our lively hood.

So the question here is:How do i cope with this old man trying to act like a father to me or my brother. He has nothing in common with us. It’s revolting that he knows my mums situation, yet decided “I’m gonna we inconvenience them on their holiday again.” Mum didn’t tell us he was going until he got here and I cried to my dad, not telling him why I was upset because I’m afraid my dad will do something drastic. How do i cope? Is there a way to tell him not to untergrabe himself with our family? My sister is also getting married there and he’s putting me and my mum and brother in a foul sour mood being there. 

We don’t hate him, we just wish he wouldn’t insist on things without our consent and we wish he wouldn’t push marriage on my mother as if she signed a deal with the devil because she never asked for his help.

This sounds like we are awful, but I’m really thankful for what he’s done and of course you don’t help people for nothing and he obviously wants something which disgusts me even more. 

Please if anyone has been through something similar how do you cope? How do i build up the courage to tell my mother I don’t accept what she’s forcing on us, how do I tell her to just turn this man away? He knows our situation and he knows my brother is depressed and I have mental issues. All I can do to vent is cry. I have no control over it. Today we are flying to Singapore then Philippines and his very presence ruins it. I genuinely feel angry, betrayed and guilty that I feel this way but this man doesn’t belong in our family. We have so many difficulties and we don’t need another person adding to the stress of our everyday lives.


TLDR;Old man who has been friends with my mum decided to invite himself on our family trip and invited himself to our home. Everyone is very uncomfortable but I don’t have the courage to tell him he’s adding to our stress. Is there a way to cope or tell him that his presence is hurts me and my brother? ",28Jun2018,1

Now we basically both ""friendzoned"" each other (more in a comedic way so to speak) and all, I wasn't really looking for someone after I got rejected and friendzoned by a lesbian (at the time didn't know that fact), but at one point, we were watching some history movie, and (we sit across from each other) she basically put her shoe on top my shoe, and I was almost having a panic attack and just pulled out my shoe from her and tried to avoid looking at her for the rest of the day, we never talked about it at all btw. She has also said that I'm a Male verison of her, could just be a compliment tho. She has also agreed with almost everything I saided and pretty much knows a lot about me.

Me and this girl got along super well the whole trip,  had all the same interests and everything. After the trip all of us spent the night at her house the night after the trip. During the camping trip i slept next to this girl and during the sleepover i slept next to the girl and she let me sorta cuddle up to her without caring.

I now have what feels like a crush but without any sexual feelings, i want to remain friends but cudde and sleep together (literally sleep). She makes me feel extremely comfortable and like i'm at home and even the smell on my clothes after cuddling with her makes me feel really at home. I have an urge to be around her now like when i have a crush on somebody but only to talk and do the previously stated things.

So I figured I would take some time off to figure out if music is what I want to do with my life. I was able to answer that question for myself and it is what I want to do and still is, but I have to interest or passion in classical music. What I really enjoy is the production/writing end. I am in a fortunate position in that I have a really good music scholarship that they held on to for the past two years while I took an extended leave. I finished the spring semester and I just felt inadequate the whole time. I know I've never been the best Violist and I think it's because I can't spend hours a day praticing, I just don't feel the passion to do it. The school of music I'm in also has a production program, but my parents want me to stick with performance because it's what they think I have the best future doing. This summer I was given a huge set of music to learn and I just don't want/can't do it. What I find myself doing for hours and hours each day is working on mastering friends recordings they send me, writing songs, and making my own tracks. I'm really stressed out about of I should switch majors, which could mean losing my whole scholarship, but it could also mean losing the financial support I have from my family currently.

When I had to look up something on my BFS hotmail account, in his search history bar it contained the following words: bi, hot, out, meet. So he searched for these words inside his mailbox. I asked him, he doesn't recall writing those. Checked his entire mailbox, couldn't find a thing but ofcourse he couldve deleted it

Hotmail stores all the email addresses you ever sent to or received something, even though you deleted everything. So for example you write something to deborah@hotmail.com and then delete eveything, 3 years later the mail still will show up if you type 'deb' . I could not find any dating sites or hookup sites, but of course it could be done without these sites.

She hates the way I act, the way I drive, the way I hug/kiss her, she doesn't seem to want to have sex with me anymore, and the next day she blames me for not wanting sex, even though she's the one that turns me down.

I'm really trying my best (in everything, not only sex), but I can never seem to make her happy. She looks down on me, she taunts me with things like ""I don't get you, why have you started having sex so late?"" and ""normal people aren't like you"" and stuff like that. I had my reasons for starting so late, I wish my situation was different and I wish I was different, I started hating myself for this, but there's nothing I can do now.

161,"Hello,

To preface: I've signed a lease and was to be moving next Friday to my unit. 

Earlier last morning, I received an email from the apartment people that the tenant that's currently residing in my unit needs more time. I replied saying that I'm unable to do that because I already bought a ticket and everything was ready for my move in. 

A couple hours later, I received an email from the apartments saying this:

""I hope you are having a great day. I attempted to call you but the phone number we have listed for you does not seem to be correct. I wanted to let you know that unfortunately, we will not be able to move you in on your scheduled date due to the resident refusing to move. I am very very sorry for this last minute inconvenience. We would be able to place you in a different unit, however, all the units we currently have available are larger and higher in price. We would refund all of your fees back as well should you decided not to switch units and just cancel the application. 



Again, I am very sorry about this and hope we are able to work something out. I will be in the office tomorrow 9 am to 6 pm, please don't hesitate to give me a call or reply to this email. Have a great rest of your evening!""

Any advice on what I can do? I'm thinking about asking for the larger room for no further cost to what I previously agreed to or a discounted price for a duration. But, I'm also not sure how to word this without sounding too demanding or rude and ruining the relationship.",28Jun2018,0

Meat however is incorporated into my diet a lot and to be honest, I like the taste of meat. I don't eat a lot of it, but going out to eat at restaurants,  sometimes the only thing I like has meat in it. I being a broke student lol, don't really buy a lot of meat to cook at home but when I do I get proper free range. I went to an elephant sanctuary recently in Thailand which was amazing taking care of rescued elephants from abuse and I am volunteering this summer at a small wildlife center. 

I basically feel guilty that I eat meat, because I understand a lot of vegans/vegetarians look down on people who say they love animals but still eat meat. For example, today I saw a poster that said ""If you say you love animals, are you sure it's not just the ones in your house?"" Or something like that. 

Am I wrong to say I love animals and want to pursue this career goal and still eat meat? 
Is it weird that I don't instinctively not eat meat?

Gonna join societies and clubs when im back at uni to try and make some friends but how do I stop the shitty attitude?**

Been a loner and outsider most of my life. Moved around a lot and always lived far from school. 

Moved out of my parents' house and across country for university at 18. When I moved, I had bills to pay so I worked 7 days a week and went to uni 5 days a week. Essentially haven’t had a social life.

This led me to develop a really shitty attitude towards people. It made me realise that the only person that will ever stay in my life is me. I can only rely on myself and therefore im the only one that I should care about.

At first it was amazing, I could do what I wanted, when I wanted. Complete freedom and self-sufficiency. Friend holding me down or annoying me? See ya later. Its become so easy for me to just cut people off that I don’t think twice about it.

Ive always found comfort in loneliness to an extent as too much social interaction just wears me out, used to have some anxiety issues when I was 14-16 but the job helped me get rid of that. Now I just don’t care about anyone but myself.

Just to give you an idea of how withdrawn from others I am. Finished uni for the year in early may. My mother (bless her) drove across country to pick me up and my shit and drive me home the same day. When I got back into town, I didn’t get in touch with any of my high school/college friends for at least two weeks. Ive met up with two of them once (separately) and that’s it. For now I live with my parents and brothers until I go back to school but even though I live with them, easily go for about two weeks without seeing any of them.

Last night I had a dream and this is where shit gets a bit weird. In the dream, I was in a relationship with some girl. Don’t even remember what she looked like, I just remember how amazing it felt to have someone. Obviously it was a perfectionist relationship since it was a dream but when I woke up I realised just how alone I am and started to wonder why. I think the first few paragraphs sum up why pretty nicely but how do I change?

I guess my end goal is a relationship but for that I need to make some friends in the first place. To make friends, I first need to fix myself and my attitude towards others but I have no idea how",28Jun2018,1

171,"Ok, so my roommate (RM) and I have been living together for 7 years. We started out dating, moved in together, and fairly quickly discovered we are better off as friends. Since neither of us had SOs, there would be occasional fwb times, but RM would remind me that he doesn't love me and we are just good friends/roommates. No biggie.

I (30f) recently had to move to a different state, bought a cheap place, and since RM (41m) didn't have a job or car at the time, he decided to come along since I'd have a spare room and decent roommates are hard to find. Been here about two months. 

I find a new guy (NG) (32m) that I really like and have been hanging out with him for a little under two weeks. It's been a fun whirlwind, we both feel like we've known each other for years, have talked about deep stuff, have both said the ily stuff, etc. He's the guy I feel like I've been searching for my entire life.

Monday we were planning to go dancing, I figured this weekend I would talk to RM about NG, and make sure we were on the same page and I wouldn't hurt anyones feelings. (Before the move we had had another conversation repeating that RM doesn't love me and we are just roommates.)

Three conversations with RM happened, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning. The conversations outlined that fwb times were done, that I like this guy I've met, and hope to have some sexy time with NG. He said ok, whatever, he just didn't want to see ""it"". I interpreted this ""it"" to mean didn't want to see us fucking (which made sense contextually). Ok, no problem there. 

So me and NG go dancing, come back to my place and have a great conversation while wrapped up in each other's naked arms, because skin contact is awesome. We half fall asleep and I lose track of time (my mistake here, I admit that) and RM comes home from work. Shit hits the fan. 

RM stated yelling, saying fuck you and Im going to grab my gun (he doesn't have a gun) and runs to the kitchen to grab a knife. I run from my bedroom to the kitchen and get the knife out of his hand (he had it next to himself, more in a self hurt position) and then NG comes out dressed and started to say stuff like don't you dare threaten her, I should call the cops etc. They get in to a pushing match by the door, and NG leaves. This is the biggest blow up I've ever seen from RM. He is usually an easy going guy.

RM and I stay up most of the night talking and de-escalating. Apparently the ""it"" he didn't want to see was NG at all. He still doesn't love me. He apologised about possibly ruining a good thing for me and that he had flashed back to the time he came home to his fiancee fucking someone and just freaked out.  During the conversion it also came out that he and my best friend had been sneaking around and fucking even while RM and I were dating. She (best friend) also told RM things I had told her in confidence. RM also doesn't have the finances to move out right now without being homeless.

I talked with NG on the phone today (2.5 days after). He says it's not my fault and he still really likes me, but that kind of drama isn't something he wants in his life. He is taking a few days to think. I understand.

I have no one to turn to, I can't talk to RM or my best friend, and I'm trying to leave NG space to figure things out. My heart is breaking, I fear I'm going to lose NG over this. I need advice.",28Jun2018,1

Fast forward to 2012, I am in highschool and join the Future Farmers of America club. I later learned that my mom started having an affair with my agriculture teacher on the first overnight field trip I attended (Neither family knew until around 2015). My parents got divorced in 2016 and my dad won custody of my sister. Everyone I have talked to about this has told me that taking care of my sister drove my mother to a breaking point. And that once my sister was healthy enough to survive without literal constant attention she decided she was through. My mom now lives 120 miles away and is married to my old teacher. I still harbor resentment and I know I probably shouldn't. Up until this point I was fine just ignoring the issue. That is what I have done for the last 3 years.

Maybe I have to work some stuff out interconsciously. If you want more context or have any further questions feel free to [ask.](https://youtu.be/VPaXDRfOMeM)",28Jun2018,1
178,"Hey everyone, I'm not sure if this article is in the right spot, pardon me if not, also sorry for my English as it's my second language.

So.. Here is the thing, I've got a 22 year old brother who is apathetic to absolutely everything, since the childhood he was a quiet introvert, he never wanted to do any physical activity or any activity at all. For the most part he was studying and playing video games (where he also wasn't good at - comparing the time he was spending on it). I'm his older brother and I never struggled with these problems, I always been open-minded extrovert, had a lot of friends, been doing sports for the most part of my life, buying fancy clothes not just to show off but it's the way I like it. However I'm not blaming him as we all are different individuals and we choose ourselves what we wanna do in life, and how we do it. He always been a mums child, she was always protecting him and describing as a very different and fragile character, but he's like everybody else. I've spoken with mum numerous times that she needs to give him a little push towards any goal even the smallest one, but it gave no effect.

For the past 4 years he shown no interest at all, he works minimum hours just to pay his phone bills and buy some video games, he doesn't look after himself (no hygiene), he never had a girlfriend, never wanted to pass his driving license (not even talking about buying a car),  never smoked a cig (as most of us did in our teenage years) he never paid rent even there were times when we barely made ends meet. I never had this ""Privilege"" to skip my rent payments and all sorts regarding with family business. Don't get me wrong it's completely fine if you wanna live healthy and not smoke nor drink, but that's just an experience we all go through.

Long story short, he doesn't want to experience anything in life, even travelling or going to new places.

I was thinking for a while that he has some psychological issues that he's dealing with and not telling anyone, I've tried to have a chat with him but that led nowhere, as he seems quite a happy person, playing his video games and having no responsibilities whatsoever. But that's the thing he's not very talkative, about 3 years ago he bought a new pair of earphones and since that time he's always worn them (before the sleep and immediately after waking up). The only topic he wants to talk about is how he slaughtered an epic monster on the Witcher (PS4 game). Maybe he thinks everyone else are too stupid to understand him or even have a conversation with him.

It might seem that I'm blaming him for not being like me, but I just want the best for him with no idea how to actually show that he can achieve anything he wants, and how rewarding life is when you put a bit of effort.

What would I do ?

179,"I didn't know where to post this so I guess i'll just post it here and I hope you guys can help me. If not, any guidance to another sub would be amazing. So ill start by saying that im 15 years old and I have been gaming for over five years. It was never really an addiction. I wouldn't really consider it an addiction, but I love gaming and spend countless hours doing it. I used to play every now and then but over the past year its changed to an every day thing. I have lost most of my friends, we barely ever hangout anymore. I miss it, but I also love playing games with my online friends and chatting on the mic all day. My sleeping schedule is flipped. I go to sleep around 8am everyday and wake up at around 2 or 3pm. I then shower and sit in my room and in my chair until the next morning. I obviously eat and go downstairs every now and then but im usually in my chair for over 14 hours a day at least. Then I think about what else there is to do. I can't think of anything. Never. I live in a small town, don't have a lot of friends, and I don't really have a hobby other than computer/tech shit. I don't have my license yet and the nearest gym is 30 minutes away. I haven't been able to find a job. Well, other than fast food places. I love the outdoors. I love nature and all that but there's just nothing to do around here and I don't have any money or a vehicle. I've become very depressed and I feel broken. Gaming makes me feel better. If it wasn't for gaming, I don't know what I would do with life. I don't know if i'd be here. Its so comforting and I love it. I just need some advice on how I can get away from the game because I know its not healthy. I just don't know where to start. Any advice or help is greatly appreciated. Thanks :)",28Jun2018,1

183,"I'm 16 years old and I feel apathetic towards my immediate family(father, brother, step-mother, step-sister).  Now it's not like  I hate my father, in fact I think he did a fine job as a single parent raising me.  Although, it's not like he raised my brother and myself alone, as we did live in the same house as my grandparents and cousins, so I did have a good support system.  It's just I can't be bothered to do things with my family, nor do I love them really.  Like if they disappeared, I probably wouldn't cry.  It's not like I don't cry or have emotions, I cry all the time when watching tv/movies.

Now I'm no psychology expert, but I'm just gonna throw some stuff out there to maybe give reason to why I am the way I am.  I'm not saying that these are the exact reasons, but these are just some things that stand out to me:

1)Mother.  My father, mother, brother, and I used to live together in Asian Country(The country being the one my family is from, father included, and the place my father went to school).  My mother was a part of my early life(I don't remember a whole lot of that), but my parents got divorced a while ago, and I haven't been in contact with my mother for years.  She stayed in Asian country and my brother and I came to America.  I actually googled her and it turned out she was involved with a dude who killed a school girl(crazy stuff).  This did not shock me or anything, I was just like, ""Oh shit, ok then.""

2)Step-mother.  I'm pretty sure my step-mother married my father in order to come America, my father has like 15 years on her.  She's alright though, she works, and is nice.  This is more of knock on my father for being creepy, as my step-mother did what she had to give her daughter a good future, and I think that's respectable.

3)Name.  I hate my name.  Now it's not like it's an asian name, I think It would be dope to have an asian name.  It's a western name.  I hate the sound of it.  I hate why my father picked it.  It doesn't fit me as a person.  I think this is a big reason on why I usually keep to myself, as I hate introducing myself.  It's not like I'm socially awkward, I just avoid talking to people.  I will 100% change my name before going to college. 

4)Myself.  I'm happy with myself.  I'm physically attractive, I feel that I have a good head on my shoulders, I do well in school and I have things that I enjoy.  I enjoy movies, anime, dramas, sports, esports, and video games, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of my room.  I feel all this can hold me over until I go to college, where hopefully I'll be more social.

In short  If my father didn't pay for my expenses or drive me places, I would have nothing to do with him.  All I want to do is go to college and be financially independent already.  Is there something wrong with me?  Maybe I sound entitled.  Maybe this is normal, and I'm just growing up.  I don't fucking know.",28Jun2018,1

191,"Hi all,
I'm not really sure he is but all signs point to it.
I have been best friends with the guy for 10 years or something and we used to go to the same highschool (I live in Belgium, it's not the same as highschool but similar). We drank a lot in our days but ever since we went to university things changed (obviously). We went to different places, but we still managed to hang some times, with our group of friends (4/5 people). After one or two years of uni, he started to smoke weed a lot. I joined him every now and then but it was almost never more than once, maybe twice a week for me (which already felt like a lot to me). He's now smoking on a daily base, to not just get one quick high, but lots of them. He recently quit uni and started looking for a different study, which is fine. But it has gotten to a point that he is in debts, and borrows money from his parents. He's still spending that borrowed money on his daily high which I think is problematic. I really don't know what to, don't know how to help. I'm afraid that if I try to talk to him about it he might turn against me.
I hope this is the right place to ask for advice.

192,"So I recently did a test to get into a selective science school in my state and I got into the interview stage (no fucking idea how, I'm still in shock). The test was $200 so I initially didn't want to do it because I didn't want to waste my parents money but I pushed myself to do it because its something that I've always wanted. 

Half of the people who took the test got into the interview stage so about 100 people are going to get interviewed and of those people, only 30 are getting in. All these people do a lot of extra curricular activities and have done a lot of state championships and stuff while I do absolutely no extra curricular activities although I used to table tennis over 5 years ago but I stopped and started isolating myself instead. All I have is a few certificates to show and nothing more. 

Getting into this school would mean the world to me because the people in my current school are utterly horrible. The interview is in 2 weeks and I'm really nervous and I have no idea how to prepare and it doesn't help that I have really bad social anxiety (yay). I need as much help as possible so any help is greatly appreciated no matter how mundane you think it is.

194,"I hate having a religion. Writing this even makes me feel like I’m going to get cursed and it’s gonna be harder for me to get a job cause I feel guilty I doubt my faith. But I hate having that burden of thinking I might have upset God that’s why I’m not being successful in life. I’ve applied in so many companies already and one company already asked for my papers so I can work 2 weeks ago but it got cancelled cause of my educational background (which I talked about in the 3 interviews they conducted) that even when I’m very qualified for the job (it was written on my interview paper they gave me so I can show the HR) they didn’t accept me. It’s quite a longer story but that’s the jist. Finding a job isn’t my only problem. There are other things that happen in my life that I sometimes feel like I might have upset God and he wants me to suffer. But sometimes I wonder why my asshole of a father is having the time of his life when he doesn’t even go to church anymore. He left us years ago when my family got bankrupt and he’s keeping the money he got from our business to himself and left us. He’s cheated on my mom multiple times and used prostitutes when my mom went to the states with my grandparents. (We know because his friends cheat on their wives and our family driver told my mom that he went to a hooker’s club right after we sent my mom to the airport with my grandparents) I feel like I’m going off topic but even though some people do bad things I feel like they’re not getting cursed by god and I might have upset God so much for me to be suffering like this. I’m broke. My family is broke and we’re just trying to survive life now. I know a lot of people don’t believe in God and I don’t know if they feel guilty of anything when things don’t go their way. I still pray sometimes but I want to not believe anymore because I hate feeling guilty of something I don’t know I’m guilty of and feeling like I’m paying the price of something bad I did that I don’t know what (maybe doubting but why isn’t my dad having a horrible life? Do you get what I mean? I don’t want to compare but if it’s about sinning why am I suffering so much and he isn’t?). I know a lot of people have it worse but it doesn’t mean I’m not having it bad. Different people, different problems. I wanna know your opinion with life. I’d appreciate non religious comments cause I hate having my life connected to religion but I’ve been in this since birth and having this at a very young age and having a mom and a brother who are very religious makes it hard for me to get out.",28Jun2018,2
195,"Hi Reddit, I hope this is the right place to post this. A little backstory, my husband to be and I have been together since we were 17, now 25. I basically accidentally landed my dream job about five years ago. He had been a chef for most of our relationship (a damn good one) and recently was let go due to budget cuts and shitty management from the owner. He decided he was going to leave the industry as he felt cooking at work was unlike the joy he gets at home from cooking, which I don’t blame him. Even though he has a new job he feels like he is starting over and it has sent him into a pretty bad depression. He isn’t where he wants to be in life. 

I love him to pieces and he has been there for me through some pretty dark times. I feel like I’m struggling to find ways to be empathetic and supportive, I’ve never been in his shoes, I plan to retire with the company I work for and knew that at a pretty young age. Even though we are making ends meet, I can tell he feels like he isn’t pulling his own weight. I try to remind him that we are okay, but I’m sure it’s hard for him. I’ve never seen him this way and my heart feels like it’s sinking when I can’t find the right words to say. 

Any advice? I know therapy is probably going to be suggested, but his insurance won’t cover that, and we make “too much money” as a couple for any assistance. I feel like he holds a lot of anger towards his old boss and that’s what started all this. How can I help him cope with that and help him find his new passion in life? I feel overwhelmed with sadness that I can’t empathize with how he’s feeling. He’s very much an old school, take care of your lady, provide a home, children etc. kind of guy. I feel like a bad person for downgrading the situation. I could care less how much money he makes but he will never see it like that. ",28Jun2018,3
196,"A while ago I met a girl, we were hanging out pretty much everyday for various reason (sports and commitments and such) and got along pretty great. Thought it was going somewhere but I had to cut down the amount we were seeing each other a lot because of exams, I'm doing stuff that just takes a long time to study. Im always going to, and always have, put study above pretty much anyone for some reason or another. Apparently Im a lot more attracted to her than I thought though because now that I haven't been around her as much it seems like shes seeing other dudes and it kind of hurts a bit. Now when I say ""it seems"", I can full well admit that it might just be my brain assuming BS thats not even true. Even when admitting that though, it still hurts my lil soul. I havent been active with women at all since I stopped doing drugs cold turkey a while ago because its hard to transition from druggy girls to \*not\*, so I'm not exactly sure what things I should be doing. 

Now dont get me wrong, I am confident I can rid of this feeling by filling in my free time with stuff, and I have plenty of stuff to do. Its just with exams Ive been forced into sitting and thinking all day which is often something I avoid because I know my mind can slip like this (It's happened countless times when I was younger and didnt know how to help it) when I'm aloud to think freely.

200,"I grew up in a townhouse (two stories, shared walls with neighbors on either side, about seven houses in the building total).  Growing up, I almost never heard anything from our neighbors through the walls.  A few years ago, a woman moved in next door with her teenage daughter and elderly mother.  At some point, I moved out for college and grad school, so I didn't interact with them much.  A couple years ago, they got an elliptical machine, and put it in the second-floor bedroom that happens to share a wall with mine. 

I'm a light sleeper and a night owl, and the use of the elliptical around 7 a.m. has, without fail, woken me up when I've come to visit my parents in the past.  It's made me unable to go back to sleep unless I move to another room.  Earplugs don't help--it's a bass-y, echoing, pounding sound that isn't easily blocked.  I have a lot of anxiety around sleeping, so when I'm woken up, it's often hard for me to fall asleep again.

Now, I'm back.  I just got a job in the area and I'm living with my parents for a few months to save money.  My work schedule is 12-8 p.m., and I have a long commute, so I'm often up until midnight or later.  I've been here about a week, and my neighbor just used her elliptical for the first time since I've moved back, waking me up at 6:40 in the morning.  I believe it's the teenage daughter who uses it.

I couldn't get back to sleep, so I knocked on their door, and an elderly woman answered, who claimed that she didn't live there, and that she would relay my message to the person who uses the elliptical, who wasn't in.  I told her that the sound of the elliptical wakes me up, and that I work pretty late, and I asked if they could either move the machine to a different room, or only use it in the afternoon or evenings.  She said it would be up to the person using it, and that she worked a variable work schedule, and couldn't use it in the afternoons since she would be at work.  I asked when the person using the elliptical would be back (if I should come back in the evening or tomorrow morning), and the elderly woman basically blew me off and refused to answer.

I've knocked on their door about this issue twice in the past.  The first time was a couple years ago, when I spoke to an elderly woman, and asked if they could move it away from the wall or use insulation or something.  The next day, it seemed like it was quieter, but it still woke me up.  Eventually, my visit to my parents ended and I went back to wherever I was living at the time.  The second time was a few months ago, my most recent visit to my parents' house.  I knocked on their door and asked if the elliptical would be used that weekend, and the woman who I believe owns the house said no. She also expressed surprise that I could hear it through my wall, and claimed they couldn't hear it in their house at all. I've never spoken to the girl who I believe uses the elliptical.

I have a lot of social anxiety, and this most recent conversation was pretty hard for me, especially because I won't know the resolution to the problem for a while.  I'm also anxious that I haven't been able to fall back asleep and I'll be tired at work and unable to go to the gym later.  Again, we've lived here for almost 20 years, and almost never heard a single sound through the shared walls.  Is there anything else I can do?  What if they refuse to move the elliptical or stop using it in the early morning?  I contacted the condominium management and left a message on the answering machine.  I'm not sure if this noise is loud enough that it breaks local noise or nuisance laws.

tl;dr: neighbor's elliptical wakes me up early in the mornings and I can't get back to sleep.  I've talked to them about it, but what else can I do?",28Jun2018,2

But the worst problem with the job alone is probably because I barely even walk while doing it. I hate the job because it gives me terrible feet pain.

204,"my life just going to be so.. below average, for lots of reasons, i m already having a below average life right now.i am autistic, but high functioning, i know this is better than having missing limbs, but being autistic is still below average.  i did alot of things i shouldn't have when i was growing up that caused me to be like this, pathetic, and dumb.  i have nobody else in real life to seek advice . this just feels like the only place for me to seek hope even if nobody replies. right now, the way im being treated because of the way i am.. is disgusting. i have been thinking about this for years, how do i stop being autistic or at least appear not socially retarded? ever since 7th grade when i started to have no friends untill now. Now, about the things i shouldnt have done that messed me up.. masturbating since i was 4. masturbating is like a drug, you know? its easy to do and you get the best experience/reward out of it. i discovered it from an accident, of course when i was a kid, when i masturbate, i dont think of sex, i think of something else, things like been dominated. ya i was a weird kid, and i still am inside, even though im 18. masturbating since that age, could have ruined my life, i am just not sure what else could have turn my life into this? i m unable to focus, i lose focus on stuff that takes more than 3 steps and mess up and end up making people looking down on me. masturbating at that young age could have messed up my brain development, i can imagine my body be telling my the part that controls focus and memory and solving problems ""hey stop developing! this kid doesnt need that much of a developed brain for solving complex problems to do things to be happy or feel rewarded!"". but you know even then, i still have dreams, like migrating to a nice country ,becoming a millionaire and stuff. i thought it was possible,i thought i dint have to rely on anyone. how wrong was i.  since i was 15, i started noticing how friends and connections are so important to get things done. getting important info, getting exposure, getting into a group. thats when i noticed how i have no friends, and thats what makes me powerless as a human. thats the reason why people mess with me. 100&amp;#37; of people i know in real life, tell me i look ""drunk"" or ""stoned"". i never got what they mean untill recently, it could be related to me masturbating at age 4 and being autistic? perhaps autistic people should never masturbate otherwise they appear stoned. how people me never changed even if i stopped masturbating for few months,because the damage is done. they are right, you know? i am stoned, somehow, since i lose focus on things that take more than 3 steps, and even if something takes 3 steps i get confused, im a person that gets confused easily, and its the cause of masturbating too i guess since its =easy reward so less focus. my brain development was fucked up because of doing""it"", thats my theory. i just feel like a powerless being, i am at college right now, and how people see me is the same, they see me as less after seeing my face. ""stoned"". even a guy whos 5'1 thin guy whos malnourished disrespects me and im 6' tall and have a nice jawline compared to other people here in a developing country. its the way i talk to people, like for example, i would ask someone a question while looking at their face, and they just look at me blankly, and they dont feel like answering. and everyone does it you know? when i ask something, they look at me with a blank, little jaw dropped reaction, and slightly respond to what i am asking. this is bad, its my 4th week at college. these are all signs, that i am gonna end up dropping out of college or spending way more money to graduate, because of not having friends. the feeling of being powerless sucks, people would stare at me sometimes innapropriately,and i would feel offended and look at them but they dont look away, so i end up looking away. thats how weak i am,  i was unaware of being powerless untill now. even my childhood friends are shunning me, only my comment isnt responded or liked. i am very suicidal, how can evolution be so cruel? i was a kid who was very talented at drawing, my language ability was also above average when i was a kid. but now, people who were below me are now doing great things like studying medical school gonna become a doctor, pharmacist, because they have rich parents and they had a tutor or friends to share knowledge, a few dont even go to college and are doing great things too but requires "" connections"" or they have rich parents or are salesman becus they have great social skills which i dont so i have to go to college.  i still have dreams, like becoming rich, migrating out of this shitty country that have people who bully autistic people to somewhere cold with snow. right now, i am not sure what i need in life to achieve those dreams as fast as possible without being pushed down by people. so for those of you who arent autistic, have you ever saw someone and instantly avoided them for no reason? is it possible to read about someone through their eyes and some clues subconsciously and know everything about them subconsciously that makes you treat them a certain way?  because sometimes people just look at my face with disgust. and trust me, i am not ugly,i dont have acne, i have a slim face, i have a chiseled jawline while most people here look like ""mouth breathers"" and dark skinned.",28Jun2018,2
205,"~LONG POST WARNING~

I've known this girl since I was 12. Shes two years older than me and we used to be best friends back in highschool (I knew her through church). I never thought anything of the age or maturity gap. To this day, she is the nicest person I have ever met and she has been loyal to me through thick and thin.

HOWEVER, when I hit about 15 or 16 I started to notice that she was a bit different from other people. She comes from a super weird family that lives in the middle of nowhere and has a ridiculously overprotective Dad. As a result, she just doesnt seem to know anything about how life works. 

She thought that catching a taxi would be cheaper than catching a bus because buses are bigger. 

She's always really sad that I can't just take time off work (I work full time) to see her whenever she's free (shes in third year uni). Like, I've told her at least eight times that I can't just take annual leave to go get coffee with a friend I see regularly in the first place, and at least once a month, without fail, she asks me the same thing again. 

One time I was out in public with her and we were walking behind an Indigenous Australian and she says, reeeeeeeally loudly ""You know, I don't think the Abos (a kind of derogatory term in Australia) are that bad, I don't know why people are always telling me to be careful around them. I've never seen one steal anything."" I was SO embarrassed, I think my jaw dropped open. Thankfully the lady in front of us had probably dealt with dumb white people before and didnt say anything. This was the point where I realised that she'd never actually met someone who wasn't white (at 17 years old??) and I had to make a point of introducing her to all my Asian and Indigenous friends.

She thinks pretty much every bird is either an ibis or a pigeon. She can name elements of the periodic table but can't tell you about their properties. She apparently did higher Maths but didn't know what integration was. One time when we were playing Scattergories I also discovered she dead seriously thought Holland was the capital of Poland. She was legitimately shocked to find out it was a different country. No, I'm not kidding. It's like an entire chunk of her education just never happened (yes, she was homeschooled by her weird dad if anyone is wondering) Tbh this aspect of her has seriously improved since she's been at uni, but I still feel she lacks any independent thinking skills. Shes going to a pretty poorly ranked university and just does whatever she's told because she's never had to think for herself. 

She seems to just live in her own world where everything is all fine and dandy, which I'm sure is great for her, but a pain in the neck for me. Like, we'll arrange to go see a movie together and I'll have to book it at 3pm because I'm working that morning but in her head she's already decided we're going to the 10am one because thats the one that she would usually go to with other friends. I have to repeat myself about three or four times before the real world finally connects with her world. 

She was convinced for about three months that I had my automatic license when I'd frequently been driving her around in my manual car. Like, changing the gears right in front of her. She actually asked me twice, in the car, WHILE I WAS DRIVING, if I ever wanted to get my manual license.

When Moana came out she learned to sing that ""How Far I'll Go"" song and every time she had half an audience she'd sing it for them. She's a pretty good singer, although there were a few off notes in there. I just found it extremely annoying that she was so proud of learning one song that she sang it over and over and over again for about a year straight. Why? WHY?? If I ever hear that song again I will scream and then crumble into a ball of tears.

I have many, many more examples but this post is long enough as it is so I'll leave them. Due to my circumstances I feel like I've really had to grow up the past couple of years, and she still seems to be stuck in the mind of a 15 year old, like it was a phase she never grew out of. 

On the one hand, she is an absolutely lovely person with a heart of gold who would do anything for you at a moment's notice, and I love that part of her so much. I also understand that she comes from a kind of messed up background and her behaviour isn't so much her fault as it is her parents. For years I've felt responsible for protecting her from the world.

On the other hand, her behaviour is slowly becoming more and more and MORE exacerbating. I feel like I'm babysitting rather than hanging out every time I see her now. I dread picking up the phone each time she rings because her voice just annoys me for seemingly no reason. The cons are beginning to outweigh the pros and I feel trapped in a friendship I want to just end. I would honestly be so much happier if she moved to the other side of the country and I saw her once every three years.

Any advice on what I should do? I know completely spontaneouslg cutting someone out of my life is probably not the smartest option.

207,"
Hello, I am in my late 20s f and I find that I am constantly bullied by women and some socially awkward men. I am a very kind and respectful person. I am often picked on by younger 20 year olds. I have been told I look younger than my age and I have been perceived as good looking. I take care of my appearance but I often give out weird vibes because I constantly have to deal with people picking fights with me for no reason or being rude.

Two examples this week, at the restaurant the early 20s waitress approached me and her smile turned into a nasty look and she started batting and rolling her eyes. This instantly made me treat her how shes treating me. Anytime I gave her a nasty vibe back, she was forcing to be a bit more polite. If I was kind again to her, she was nasty again.

Another example taking my neice and nephew to the washroom at the theatres without tickets, the podium person let us through but another person (I will not describe him but he seemed socially awkward, power trip) stopped us and said we are not allowed because people sneak in.

I took this very offensively as if I am a theif.

I deal with this regularly and I don’t understand why. Some have told me people are jealous.

It doesn’t happen from men often but when it does it is from the socially awkard type.

All of thes events happen when I am kind and polite. I don’t understand? I try my best to stay classy and avoid confrontations but they seem to come at me often.

Another example at the gas pump the other day. Lady paid for gas at the pump I parked at and was moving her car, she starts yelling hey I paid for gas there! Very classlessly. I said ok so Ill move. She kept saying things despite me moving. So I went up to her and told her normally people park at the pump and then pay. She kept mouthing off. My sister said dont stoop down to their level and fight with them.

I don’t understand how I am supposed to deal with these situations in an educated manner. What do proper and classy people do and how can I avoid these issues?",28Jun2018,1

She also has posted the license plates of people she believes were bullying her online, and the vans of companies she believes were bullying her as well. Should I report this to the conventions? Should I contact the company and let them know someone is accusing them of slander?

211,"My (19F) parents (40s) get really annoyed by my clothing choices during the summer. They think I’ll die of heat stroke or something, which is just crazy because I stay hydrated, use air conditioning, go outside and take breaks in the shade every now and then throughout the day. 

Here’s a bit of history on the situation. For years (since I was 13-14) I’ve hated wearing short sleeved clothes on its own for a variety of reasons. I prefer having some sort of texture on my arms (I have Autism, this is a big deal) and it’s also partly due to confidence. My parents (my mum in particular) would either force me to get changed or they ban me from whatever outdoor thing is going on (BBQ, walking dogs, simply sitting outside etc). They got a little more relaxed about it last year, only mentioning it but not doing anything about it. This summer however, they went back to square one because of a heatwave (it’s 30C in Ireland today).

My regular clothing choices include thin pyjamas in the morning and evening with a dressing gown (which I wear solely for the pockets). If I get dressed that day (which is where most of the “issues” arise) I’m usually wearing a short sleeved shirt, a pair of thin leggings, thin socks and a jacket/hoodie. Sometimes I’ll just wear a long sleeved top instead of a jacket but that’s more effort since they require a bra (I can usually hide my braless figure with a jacket).

After talking to them about it for years, I eventually won with the leggings (they insisted on shorts in the past), but they won’t budge on the rest no matter what approach I use. Moving out or just “dealing with it” aren’t options since I don’t have the funds to move and I would feel physically and mentally uncomfortable. I’m not in any health related danger since I’m doing everything else right so what can I do?",28Jun2018,1

217,"Hey internet! I’m a first year uni student (18 yrs old) who wouldn’t mind getting a little advice on a  situation I’m in. I’m not too sure what the best course of action would be or how things are going to play out so any advice/ thoughts would be greatly appreciated :) 

I’ll try keep it brief but here’s some context: 
I live on campus at uni and my first semester just finished a few days ago. Throughout the semester I had a huge crush on a girl (let’s call her Bell). Bell and I had a complicated relationship in the way that we got a long really well, were super flirty and both liked eachother only problem was the fact she had a bf (which I didn’t know about, but kinda had a feeling she did). That relationship left me super confused and so I began to start speaking about it with one of my friends (let’s call her Kate). Kate was a lot older than me (23 soon to be 24)  and I saw her as an older sister type of confidant on campus. Kate and I got on really well and I would often spend hours and hours just chatting with her initially about what to do with Bell but then soon just about anything and everything. 

Over the course of a few weeks, i decided I really just needed to distance myself from Bell despite how much I liked her. In doing so Kate made me go out to clubs and stuff a lot more than I use to. One night at one of the clubs I saw Kate dancing with some guy and walk off with him, I usually wouldn’t care but it got to me and I realised I had feelings for Kate. 

So a few nights pass and we’re in a club again, this night was my final night in town before I head over seas for a 3 week holiday and so I drank a lot... I’d always assumed she thought I was too young and that’s why nothing would ever happen. At the club she’s off again talking to someone so I start talking to one of her friends and tell the friend that I l think I like Kate, the friend says well go tell her and so I do. Kate says “well i like you too, look I know you’re going away and i know you’re young but I like you so do you wanna just go for it and see what happens.” I agree and we end up going home together and have “sexy fun times.” It’s great and then the next day I have to leave and go over seas.

We’ve chatted every day since, even called eachother a couple times and agreed to an exclusive relationship for the mean time... her idea.

Flash forward to now... I’m currently over seas and won’t see her for 3 weeks. There’s a few things that keep ticking over in my mind:
A. She’s moving off campus and finishing her uni career in 2 months (3 weeks of which I’m away for) 
B. When she moves off she will be living over 3hrs away 
C. I’m at the start of my Uni career, she’s at the end of hers
D. We both really like eachother tho

I guess my question is; what’s the right thing to do? Do I just keep going for it and see what happens? Do I try stop what we’re doing and just try be friends again? I don’t want to ruin our friendship and I especially don’t want to hold her back.

Any advice or thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated. As you can probably tell I over think things way too much so any guidance would be great so I can get some peace of mind and enjoy my Holiday! 

Thanks guys/ gals! ",28Jun2018,3

225,"I am going to the party which my ex Bff is attending, idk what to expect and how to behave. Please give any tips if you have any.

We were friends with X for five years until recently. I thought that we were always there for each other, helping each other in distress, being armchair pcychologist at times, heck, we even decided to go to the same school together. I always was the rational one (almost never cried even as a teen), whereas X was the emotional and easily hurt (cried over almost anything). All of our friends aknowledged that she was overall a pleasant person - though acting selfish a lot, but it never had affected anything major. Until I was raped.

So, the problem is that I was a victim of a sexual assault three years ago. The perpetrator was the guy out of her friend group, and the three of us attended the same school at that time. I've had a school project to complete, so he offered his help and invited me over to do so. And then he raped me.

And once X learned about the rape, she told me that I was the one to blame, cause I had gone to a guy's place, so I was basically asking for it. After I started having PTSD, she dismissed my emotions and suicidal tendencies - ""so what if you want to die, I am not ranting about my bf of one and a half months dumping me!"". The rapist was still welcomed to our friend group, even though everyone knew about the assault. So I've been suicidal and depressed for two years after that, but every time I tried to discuss my condition, or the fact that I used to cry every fuckind day, I heard ""lols you're still thinking about that?"" - even though we HAD to discuss every little problem of hers. Because we're friends, you know. I was still trying to convey how I felt, what I was going through. No result was there to be seen, so after a while I was tired and hurt of hearing all that crap, so I wasn't very detailed about that anymore. I grew more cold and distant.

I was emotionaly neglected for two years until I told her to fuck off. It was hard to tell her that no longer we should be hanging out. To do that I had to drink a bottle or two of beer, and told her tearfully that I genuinely loved and cared for her but she had betrayed me, so I couldn't be friends with her. She's like ""why haven't you ever told me?"", even though I did a thousand times at that point... Later our mutual friend told me that in X's version I'd been severely drunk and ""shittinig on"" X bc of that. For fuck's sake, I've been working up courage for months to say that!

Call me crazy, but actually I still do love and care about X at some extent, even though I haven't talked to her in a year, she didn't try to reach out either. But I am not sure if she's Narcissistic, or I'm just being dramatic and blowing everything out of proportion. Maybe she didn't get the message, maybe I wasn't clear enough. Maybe it was hard to understand that I have feelings too? X never did anything bad to me, but that shit got for real. What do I do?

For now I know that she's been discussing me behind my back and talked a lot of shit, and she doesn't think that she's done anything wrong.",28Jun2018,0

A day after he broke up with me, he was on his way home from work at around 1am and got Tboned by a drunk driver who hit his driver side door, totaling his car. She had a 0.22 BAC, the legal being 0.8 ... I thank god everyday he’s okay. I hate not being able to be there for him and I hate not being able to tell him how much I love him and how lucky I am. He’s my best friend in the whole world and I’m miserable without him. 

He’s already begun flirting with other girls like where I can see it ( on twitter ) and also while he’s livestreaming he will play with them and flirt. He wont talk to me or anything. He just tells me to “stop”

... I have very severe (general and social) anxiety, and I also have OCD and ADHD. I haven’t eaten anything except for little bites of banana and fruit and one piece of sushi, I’ve been vomiting bile, and even looking at food makes me want to throw up. I havent slept more than 2 hours. I lost a couple pounds and I’m already tiny due to having anorexia in my past. I’m 5’0-5’1 ish and I now weigh 97.8 lbs. Ive never weighed more than 107.5 lbs. I’m scared to move on and start with someone new. He’s all I really know.

I love him so much and this week could’ve not gone any worse, but I hate saying that because I know he actually physically got harmed. I don’t know what to do with myself. I really don’t. 

I can’t stop checking his social media. I feel like it’s become a part of my OCD in a way, It drives me insane if i try not to &amp; also because I have such an instinct to just care for people. He blocked me but I’ll still look. It sucks. 

I’m at a dead end. I don’t know what to do. My body is so weak right now.

People call the cops but by the time they show up the jerker is gone or finished. Some people take photos of the person to send to the authorities, but I'm not a big fan of photographing people jacking off. How do you handle these sorts of situations?

I suppose ideally I'd grab the guy by the back of the neck and shake him til he stopped then bring him to the police, but I'm not physically strong enough to do that. What are the alternatives? I fear like this is the perfect crime and that's why people get away with it all the time. ",28Jun2018,2

I was stood holding onto a rail on the tube and a male was stood behind me. I noticed that he kept inching further towards me with his face facing the back of my head. I kept trying to move forward but got to a point where if I moved anymore the poor lady who was in front of me would've had my crotch in her face. So I had to stop. 

I felt what I can only describe as an erect penis being rubbed very slowly up against my butt and at one point I also felt a hand caress my butt cheeks. I also felt a finger hook onto my belt strap at the back to try and pull me closer into him. I could also hear lots of heavy breathing and could smell his disgusting breath. 

I am not a confrontational person at all. I am very quiet and hate causing a scene and to be honest with you I completely froze up and didn't know what to do. 

The male then got off the tube around 10 minutes into the journey thank god but I did not enjoy what happened at all and I feel a little upset about it all if i'm honest.

I feel the person who did that to me was a bad person and maybe I should do something about it? what though is the question. I'd also like to hear if anyone has had any of the same experiences. 

Many thanks.",28Jun2018,12
234,"Please excuse any errors - on mobile. 

I’ll try to keep this short. I live on second floor, neighbor moved in below me with husband and two young kids, toddler and maybe first grader. I live alone with my large dog. 


Didn’t hear any complaints for a year. Re-signed my lease. One month later neighbor texts me out of the blue: “you are so f*cking loud.”  Had no idea my walking was an issue. 


I work east coast hours but live on west coast so I’m regularly up between 3-5AM local. I told her I didn’t know she could hear me walking and promised to tiptoe in the mornings. Bought some runners as well bc I have laminate. 



The texting became a weekly issue. Every week complaining about walking, me sounding like a “herd of elephants,” when I’m barefoot in my house. 



Fast forward to last weekend. I’m laying in bed, dog is on the bed as well, hadn’t gotten up yet. 



My dog shakes his head/ears. She texts me “Dude it’s f*cking 6am in a Sunday....for Christ’s sake.” I was literally in bed and told her that. She accused me of calling her a liar. 


At that point I told mgmt. I’m constantly scared that washing my clothes, or vacuuming or running my dishwasher will trigger her. I actively try to keep my dog from wagging his tail against the wall for fear of waking her. 



Last night I took a shower at 10pm. Had turned my dryer on at about 9pm. I’m not sure which but one of the two triggered her and her and her husband came pounding on my front door at 10:15. I’m talking repeatedly pounding for probably over 10 minutes. I did not answer. They were clearly looking for confrontation. I also did not feel safe as my porch light just went out, so I didn’t feel comfortable being confronted by two grown adults by myself at night in the dark. 

At this point I’m scared of the next steps in escalation. Is there anything I can do? I hate being at home. I am scared they’re going to slash my tires or something. They are always home. 

**TLDR: psycho downstairs neighbor is harassing me. Is there anything I can do?**

236,"My fiance had an emergency craniotomy Monday morning after head trauma. He had both an epidural hematoma and a subdural hematoma. He's already walking fine and the doctors have told us that it's rare for someone to come home so soon after this type of injury but he's doing great.  He's the strong one in the relationship. He's the one that would know exactly what to do. I go to him for guidance and I can't with this. I've had this whole week off but we have a home and bills so I have to go back to work next week. We had savings but both of our cars broke down last month forcing us to get new ones, and our water heater broke, and it's just been one thing after another so our savings is down a lot.  

We don't completely know the extent of his injuries yet and how long he will have to stay home to recover. I've been trying to think of things I can do to make this easier. I work an hour away from home from 8-5 M-F so I need to prepare for everything. He's very active, so I know this is going to be hard on him and I want to try and keep him as healthy as possible to keep his spirits up. I guess my questions would be:  

What are some easy, healthy meals I can prepare in advance so he has food available all day? 

What else can I do to help him? What should I expect these next couple weeks?  

I'm not sure if this is the right place, but any help would be greatly appreciated.",28Jun2018,6
237,"I'm not sure if there is a more specific subreddit out there that this could be asked in so i'll just post here.

About 3 weeks ago, I had brought a potential candidate for a job down to conduct a face-to-face interview. Because of the distance and the way we like to do the interview process, we will book a hotel for them to stay in while they are here.  

I book the hotel through our company's travel agency, but since the booking will automatically be put under my name and company card, I then need to call the hotel and let them know that a different person will be staying in the room, but I will be the one paying for it. So the hotel requires me to fill out a 3rd party authorization form so they have on file that this person is allowed to stay in the room and charged to my card.

I have done this a few times before already and everything usually goes rather smoothly.  However, one of the last few candidates we interviewed, had their credit card charged instead of my corporate card, which shouldn't have happened because they had my card on file with the authorization form.

About 5 days after not seeing the charge come up on my card I took another look at the receipt and saw that the card number was not mine, so I asked the candidate if they had been charged instead.  They checked there CC account and it turns out they did in fact get charged for the room.  I immediately contacted the hotel about this, and confirmed they did receive my authorization form and the charge to my candidate was a mistake. Okay, no big deal, they said they would let the manager know so that he can fix the transaction.

To save some time I will just summarize the next few calls.  Basically, after waiting a few days at time and never seeing the transaction get fixed I keep calling them about it, they take down my info, say they will let the manager know to fix and then it never gets done and the cycle repeats.

Its has been 3 weeks since the initial hotel booking and about 2 weeks since I started calling about this to get it fixed and nothing has been done.  I always get told that they will let the manager know so he can fix the problem and that I will be contacted back the next day, but I never am and have to call them instead.  Its been at least 4 or 5 times that I have called about this now.

I don't know if its the front desk that just forgets to tell the manager or if the manager is the one just not getting it done, but it doesn't really matter whose fault it is, I just want it fixed.

I'm not sure what else to do in this situation.  Should I tell the candidate to just dispute the charge on their card, then maybe the hotel will finally take notice and do something?  Any help would be appreciated.",28Jun2018,1
238,"Hello,

DISCALIMER : Wall of text incoming and a brief summary of how I've lead my life up to this point in my 20s. I am feeling very confused and stuck and I don't know where to ask for help. YOU. HAVE. BEEN. WARNED. 

I come from a very modest family and I was always told I could not receive pocket money or afford things because we were poor. 

Parents had regular fights. Father missed for important events and weekends. See him only early mornings and late at night when he would come home, most times drunk. Never went out as a family except the times we had to go over to his friends houses. He had unstable work. Mother stopped working after I was born and spent her days telling me what a good person she is for raising me herself and how this is better than other parents going to work and barely seeing their children. Mother has cancer when I am about 9-10 ish years old, spends many years getting treatment. Father finds more stable work, nightshifts and sometimes during daytime as well, gets bank money to be able to buy things and help mom. 

I was a good kid, the type that does never cause problems. My mother made sure to treat every mistake, every vase broken by accident with harsh criticism and beatings. I was called in many ways, told to go to hell many times and whatever else you can image since I was very little and till my highschool years. In her vision, the only thing I had to do was study and life would be good to me. Lower grades than the maximum possible meant yelling, throwing things, beatings. Always had to be home on time, always had to tell her where I was, with whom and what I was doing, preferably every hour. This went on even when I was 18, 19 years old. Now that I grew up, many things I did out of being naive and foolish and things said without fully understanding life at that time that resulted in my getting beaten up now seem ridiculous and abusive. She never let me accept anything from anyone, be it books or even a slice of apple from a friend's mother at the park. If I accepted, later at home I would get yelled at and have the door to my room slammed in anger. 

My father would get home pretty late, never hit my mother in his life nor me, but verbally he was extremely abusive to my mother. He would spend time with his friends and their families rather than with us.  He would complain to mom a lot.  His friends would lie to mom to where he was when he did not answer his phone. The consequences were: Every time my mother was angry and upset about this whole thing she would spend hours coming in and out of my room, yelling to me the story of her life and how she was miserable, didn't matter if it was 11 pm and I was about to go to sleep or if I was doing homework or studying for a test. She would repeat for the entirety of my life the same story about dad and his friends and how she felt ashamed and miserable and how his friends and him ruined her life. Sometimes it was every day. Sometimes it was only 3 times a week. Now here are **two things** you need to know : 1. Mom **never forgets or forgives** any single little thing about ANYONE she meets. 2. I was to **never speak back** to her about ANYTHING. If I ever dared to, the monologue would be prolonged by another hour at least about how ungrateful and stupid I am and how I should go live with my father's friends and their families and then the cherry on the top : telling me she wished she were dead or telling me she would leave the house and us in that very moment.  While I was little, this also included slaps and kicks and a god damn lot of hair pulling.

I spent my life being the nerd, getting good grades towards average, getting some awards, winning some contests, gathering diplomas and getting good grades on municipality-wide School Olympics in english and biology. I regularly felt anxious, scared, and become some sort of shut in who played a lot of video games meanwhile. But you see, I have always been patient, hopeful, seemingly cheerful and happy outside my home. I cracked jokes, played charismatic in social situations. Family members and friends would express their worry sometimes because mom was taking the scoldings outside the walls of our house. Most times it was because I was hanging out with some cousins and I would get the beatings for their mischief for simply being there, the youngest sibling, the scrape goat. 

Mom would not let me meet certain people because to her it seemed that something was wrong with them.  I would be dragged every weekend and holiday of my childhood, pre-teen years and teenage years to the countryside over to my mom's side grandparents. I was happy to have some friends over there and play with them except the times I was dragged to work on the fields, vineyards and to take care of animals. This became the number one reason I could not have a stable relationship with my friends from home. Every single time I had to tell them I was busy working at my grandparents. 

Fast forwards 12 - 13 years old. Mom's treatment seemed to have worked she was now almost clear of cancer. But then my father's health went downhill and by the time I was 14 he had died. I promised him I would get into a good highschool studying what they both wished for even though I have been struggling with mathematics and physics. And we never ever afforded to pay extra tuition like all the other children. I was a very shy kid too and we had strict and harsh teachers. Mathematics was a rollercoaster of emotions and I would sometimes cry at the blackboard after being yelled at in front of the class. I cried easily and often. Highschool was a grim time. I became extremely withdrawn following my father's death. Mom's depression was very difficult to handle and I could not really settle my feelings at that time. I was in a 4 year state of numbness. She went on to have arguments with most people we knew and slowly but surely pushed everybody away. And thus, her new favourite thing to say to me was that we were all alone in the world and that she only had me and lived for me. Her nagging escalated and even if it was not accompanied by beatings that much she started telling me that I was never going to make it in life. I was going to end up just like her. Oh and also during those years she also started a bad habit of sending me out to buy her alcohol every day, sometimes multiple times per day. 

But you see, that is when I had snapped. Around the last two or one year of highschool, I started yelling back, slamming my door and yelling my lungs out if I had to, in order to end arguments and to have her leave me alone in my room in peace. By this time, we had a history of at least 6 years of her barging into my room and not leaving me space to breathe always telling me the same story. Then, she would be even more enraged. . . I found out. And it would all end when I, exhausted and frustrated would just start crying. She would stop but we would start it all again few days later. And then I got another tactic similar to my younger years : be quiet and stare at the wall behind her till she has nothing more to say. 

Only this time, I would ask her to let me say something at least once and I would kindly ask her to seek help, to write it all down and to make her realise she has been obsessively doing this for so long but also that I had never had the courage to ask her to stop. 

Anyway... my life improved the year I finished highchool. I passed all exams and got a good final grade. The boy I was crushing on for years began to like me back. And, that summer, in order to calm my mother down I went on to apply and get accepted into 3 university courses in the scholarship spots. ONLY did that, to have her let me try the Fine Arts admission exams, aka following my dream. Had her promise to let me go there if I made scholarship spots on it as well. Fast forward 2 weeks of drawing for my portfolio, I made it there on the 7th spot on the list. And thus began 3 years of undergrad course where I barely saw my mother during the day because of all the work. I was happy then. I had dreams but also a lot of fears and anxiety. I never had much self confidence and relied on other's people feedback entirely all my life. All my life obeyed mom's orders and plans for how and when I had to do anything. Obeyed teachers and did all things asked as well. Took my art teacher's words in university as the holy grail. 

Fast forward university thesis exam, passed it with great difficulty, had a period of absence right before it because I was scared to go to university. Teacher was a bit mean and strict and her ideas always opposed my assistant's ideas. Listening to one of them had me receive harsh words from the other, that was university as well. Oh and SHE ALSO had the bad habit of shaming us in front of the entire group of students, she threw people's sketchbooks across tables and on the ground regularly. Oh well... 

The point is : I was someone, who despite all this wanted to do things, to have a nice career, to be a creative person, to create things I liked, to draw a lot, to visit places, to make a lot of money and make sure mom would never worry at all anymore, to be a nice person to my significant other, to be more feminine, happy, to not be overweight and sad anymore.

But starting the last year of university, I lost that drive. It happened gradually. It was around the time I had decided to leave the country with my significant other and start life together and become a freelancer artist.  Mind you, I still have goals, great goals even, I still want to lose weight, to create things, to make money. But on a daily basis, I consistently procrastinate, tell myself I am no good, am afraid of failing before I start things. 

I have tried my usual coping strategies, putting stickers all around with what I have to do, setting alarms to ring throughout the day, getting a gym sub, using phone app. It works for a few days, then I suddenly lose track of everything. By the time I know it, 6 hours have passed, I have not done the work for the day, I have to prepare dinner and I did not go to the gym. I put on 20 kg in one year without realising. One day I try to starve, the other day I open the fridge constantly even when not hungry. I have always stress eaten but back then I used to walk a lot every day.  This happens a lot lately. I am afraid of what I am now. I do not understand. Why can't I pick myself up like before and just get in the F L O W of routine? Of getting work done and feeling good at the end of the day? 

I catch myself prioritizing pleasure before work every day. I do things in the last minute, sometimes the work is sloppy too because of this. Then I realise what I do, I hate myself, I cry, I feel worthless again, I hide it all from my S.O. Sometimes I tell him, he tried to lift me up, mind you he helps me a lot with things. Especially because of this, I am so ashamed to look him in the eye. I feel like a bad person and the cycle goes on. 

What do I do? I know the things I need to work on for my career, for my personal project, for our future, to get money and help mom. I just, I just collapse at the start. I do a day well, 6 hours of work at least, I hit the day's gym target, I keep the house clean, I work on my personal ideas, make time for us too. Then the next day I do worse, then the next day I am a mess : I sit on the chair procrastinating, I don't do the dishes, I sometimes even miss the shower, night comes and I feel like a total idiot. I try to keep the diary of daily achievements but even that is difficult.

Why am I so inconsistent? I dislike myself so much. I want to be like before. I want to do everything I have set for myself. I used to forsake my free time in favour of getting things done before. Now I just turn all the hours for my personal pleasure and ignore the work and chores and stuff. I think a lot about my past and I realise many things now. I want to change, that is for sure. 

For whoever had the patience to read through all of it, I thank you sincerely. 

TL;DR : I used to be a hard-working and obedient person through childhood and adolescence. Now, in my 20s I find it difficult to be consistent in work, personal life, my own health and hygiene from day to day. Procrastination is difficult to stop. ",28Jun2018,1
239,"Long story short, me and my girlfriend had unprotected sex, I didn't finish inside her but I know there are still chances that she can be pregnant.

She said she had some period cramp before but no period, but after searching l it up, people said that those might be signs of pregnancy. She will do a pregnancy test next week.

240,"I'm 20 years old. I'm a guy. My dad is a 55 year old man. I still live with my parents because I'm going to school. My father is a very bigoted person. We're a White family. He talks poorly about all races that are non-white. He's also narrow-minded when it comes to gender. He says things like, ""Men shouldn't work in customer service or be teachers or nurses."" He thinks men should only work physical labor jobs. I like to spend a lot of time with my mom and sisters. He doesn't like that. He tells me, ""You shouldn't spend so much time around women. You're a man and need to be around men more."" I think that's so ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with a guy spending time with women. He's a big homophobe as well and talks poorly about gay people. He thinks being gay is a choice and that a man can become gay if he spends too much time around women, which is why he expressed his concerns.

He's also racist. Yesterday he was talking to me about how he doesn't like Hispanics because he thinks they're illegal, etc. etc. He asked me. ""How do you feel about Hispanics."" I just said ""I don't feel anything about them"". I got the impression that he wanted me to join in on the bashing, but I have nothing against Hispanics. I don't look at them as an invasive species. I'm afraid to go against my father because he can also get pretty hostile when you have a different opinion from him and don't agree with him. He also asked me, ""Would you ever have a Black best friend?"" He wanted me to say no because that's how he feels. If I would've said yes he probably would've got mad. So I just gave a neutral answer, ""I don't know."" My father is also the person where he's nice to everyone in public but says derogatory things behind closed doors.

Mind you in school and in my life I have developed friendships with people that come from many different backgrounds. Black, Hispanic, Asian, Middle-eastern, etc. They are all nice people. My father's views simply don't match up with my experiences. I don't know why he only sees color and gender. That's literally what he talks about all the time. Black this White that, women do this women do that. It's exhausting having to listen to it. I don't think like he does. I judge people by their character. Not by their race or gender. I have never invited friends over my house who are non-white because of my dad.

I always get the impression that my father wants me to share the same views as him. Whenever I state a different opinion from him he gets mad. 

What can I do about this?",28Jun2018,1
242,"I've never really posted on Reddit so forgive me if the post is weirdly typed or anything. 

So, me and my best friend work at the same job. The job is a rental company dealing with bikes, across from the beach. The way the job is set up, there's just one person working at a time. We have a counter that we sit behind and it's all under a big tent and we keep bikes right in front of the counter under the tent. To the side, right next to the counter there's a little hidden wall that you can't see from where we sit at the counter. 

Yesterday, while my friend was working, she was standing on the far end of the counter talking with her boyfriend who was visiting her at work. A guy walked by, and cut through the side of where we keep our bikes and they didn't think anything of it because right next door is a condo and people often cut through our business to get to the sidewalk. When she went to go back behind the counter, she said she saw a man sitting on a cinder block masturbating!!! She saw everything. She said they made eye contact and she ran away back to her boyfriend who was on the other end and told him to go look at what she just saw. By the time he got there, the man was already gone. She said he was embarrassed by the look on his face. 

We don't really know what to do at this point. We're both young girls who work alone outside. People come and go all the time just walking on the sidewalk past the business. The man was wearing a durag and sunglasses so she didn't even see what he looked like, so if we told the police, they couldn't really do anything. We think it's pointless to tell anybody because there really isn't anything anybody can do because we don't know what he looks like. I figured if we told the police at least maybe every once in a while they'd drive by the business to make sure everything is okay but we don't know if it's a big enough deal to get the police involved.

244,"Hey everyone,

I've been thinking about this day-in and day-out for awhile now. This has been going on for almost 7 years and I genuinely do not know what to do about it but I can't keep it in my head anymore. I met this girl freshman year of high school (senior in college now) and ever since I met her, I've been extremely into her. To this day, I have compartmentalized those feelings because we have always been best friends and friends first, so I would never ever want to loose her as a friend. I've wanted to tell her for years now but our timing was never right and I was honestly always afraid to loose her as a friend if I told her. For these past 7 years whenever either of us had any sort of opportunity, one or the other was in a relationship or messing around with other people. I'm not the type of person to intrude on another relationship as I find that disrespectful to both her and her significant other. The reason it has been on my mind more than ever now is because for the first time, basically since freshman year of high school, we are both single. A few nights ago, her and I went to a club with a group of our friends. Prior to this night, we had never hooked up or anything, in fact, I always thought she friend-zoned me. This night was different though. Yes, we were both extremely drunk, but we ended up hooking up a few times. She was all over me and I was all over her. We briefly talked about it the next day and I was nervous that she would she would feel weird about it, but seemingly she didn't care about it and nor did I. We haven't talked about it since and just kinda passed it off as a funny night. I'm at least glad that it wasn't awkward and we just passed it off like it's nothing which I mean making out really isn't anything huge. Since then, she's asked me to hang out a few times, though I'm pretty sure she probably means just as friends. I snapchat her every day, we also usually facetime each other every day or text a bit at the least. Since we are friends, she tells me about other guys and I tell her about other girls, that's why I feel friendzoned and  I'm just stuck thinking now... is this the right time to tell her how I've been feeling? Even though we hooked up the other night, I'm still worried that if I tell her, I might loose her as a friend. Its been on my mind so much because I'm worried, if I don't tell her now, the timing might not work out again and I can't wait another \[x\] years to tell her.

249,"My father was a terrible man. He was a violent alcoholic and abused my mother physically and sexually. He neglected my sister and I and wanted nothing to do with us because we weren't born as boys. He never called or sent cards or even paid child support after my parents got divoriced. 

My sister started talking to him a few years ago to ""get closure"" and their relationship has slowly escalated to the point where she now visits him. She lets him hold her son and bond. Meanwhile, my sister and her husband have pushed away my mother. My mom has depression and can be difficult to deal with at times, but has never abused or hurt my sister and I. It doesn't make sense why she is giving preferential treatment to our father, after everything he's done...my mom isn't allowed to visit or hold her grandson yet my father gets to bond and visit with him. My mother doesn't deserve to be slighted like this. She has always wondered why she is treated like garbage by my sister and her husband. She just found out about sister visiting with our dad because I told her and now she is completely heartbroken. She told me that my sister is completely dead to her and that she will no longer be in her will. I don't want this to happen. I feel like I shouldn't have told her.

How do I keep this family together? I haven't talked to my sister at all about this yet. She doesn't know that I'm aware of her visiting our father (I found out through a Facebook post/photo of them together). Should I approach her? How? She always get defensive when I try to dissect her interest in talking to him, saying things like ""it's none of your business who I talk to""...I just don't understand or agree with any of it.

I live in a very small town and there are no apartments open in a 30 mile radius plus I have no car.. what should I do?",28Jun2018,1
252,"Disclaimer: I don’t hope to spark a political debate. I will include as many details as possible to help you best understand the situation. 

	I recently graduated from a small high school in New York State. The school is very rural and is surrounded by many farms (this will give you an idea of my towns background). Because it is such a small school, I was forced to have the same Spanish teacher all four years. My first three years, I really enjoyed learning Spanish. I didn’t mind the teacher and had very good grades. 
	However, my fourth year turned into college level Spanish (this might affect the teaching criteria). I would take Spanish as a normal class but take a final given to our school from a local college and receive college credit for it. This scared most of my classmates and only the smartest members of my class decided to take this course. I’m not trying to stereotype anybody, but the kids taking the college class were not the farm kids with big trucks that you’d expect to find in my town. Although the course was harder (as expected with a college class), I was still very successful and didn’t mind the class. Then things started to change as we began the immigration unit. 
	First, let me give you some background on my teacher.  Spanish is her first language and she is not afraid to tell you that at one time she was an illegal immigrant but is now here legally.
	Even though my teacher claimed it was, I never found any proof that immigration was on the college syllabus and the information we learned never showed up on any final or midterm provided by the college.  In the end, we spent about a month and a half of our course learning immigration.  In this entire unit, we did not learn or speak a lick of Spanish.  It was all in English so our teacher could get her point across.  This was when I started to get frustrated.  The first thing she told us was that she was giving us only the facts, not her opinion, and that we should use the facts she gives us to form our own political opinion.  She would say things like “most immigrants have done nothing wrong and are deported for no reason and that’s a true fact.” (Which 1. Isn’t a fact. When I think fact, I want at least some numbers. And 2. Isn’t true.). She would openly attack Donald Trump and make us watch films with illegal immigrants as the protagonists.  Even though I know many of my history teachers had strong political views, they were professional enough to keep them out of the classroom.  But not this teacher.  This teacher even had an immigration lawyer come in and tell us why “everyone should be let in.”  I was forced to give a presentation about how immigrants “save our economy” and I continuously got points off on assignments for writing “illegal immigrant” instead of “undocumented immigrant.”  Even though I am smart enough to form my own opinion on the topic, I know my classmates were not.  I would look across the classroom as she lectured and witness my friends and classmates getting brainwashed.  There is no other word than brainwashed to describe it. Keep in mind this is my class’ best and brightest.  (I’m not saying my classmates should be against immigration, but they should do more than listen to a Spanish teacher to form their opinion).
So I guess I have two questions:
	1.  Is this even legal? I know colleges have basically no rules on how politics are taught, but shouldn’t my high school teacher be required to give a less biased lesson or just leave it to the history teachers?

	2.  Should I report this behavior to the principal or guidance counselor? Or should I just give up on it because the likelihood of something changing is very low, and hope that future students are smart enough to research it themselves?",28Jun2018,1
254,"Hello!

So I'll try to keep this short-ish because I don't think it is some sort of mind blowing problem, but it sure is an awkward one to talk about so I've come for some anonymous advice.

**The Background:**

* I am a male in my mid/late 20s.
* I am considered traditionally attractive.
* I am extremely fit and outgoing.
* I have no real problems talking to women.
* I am a virgin with a low sex drive.

**The Problem:**

In my late teens and early 20s I was in a relationship with a lovely young woman who, while I am non-religious, was a Christian who considered her pre-marriage chastity to be important. So while we had a very deep and loving relationship it was predicated on the idea of not becoming physically intimate. Which I was largely ok with. Well our paths drifted apart and while we remain on good terms it became obvious that we weren't going to get married.

During this time I obviously did not engage in physical intimacy with any of my other female friends. When our relationship eventually ended and I moved to pursue career opportunities I became buried in my job and while many attractive women over the years have expressed interest in me, I have always kept them at arms length for a variety of reasons. With a hold over idea that when I meet Ms. Right that will be the appropriate time.

Well, my entire worldview changed fairly recently when I was consoling a close female friend during a camping/hiking trip. She was quite broken up about a strained relationship and was expressing frustrations with me amongst others. She confided in me that sex was extremely important to her and it was an incredibly intimate bonding moment where she got to fully experience and enjoy the other person. Where great sex was an important sanctuary and comfort. I realized that I have been being selfish all these years, because I have been ignoring the fact that a good relationship is not simply built on emotional fulfillment but also physical fulfillment.

I would like to be able to provide fulfilling sexual intimacy for Ms. Right rather than be fumbling around with my dick like I'm reading an ikea tutorial. I would say this is less performance anxiety, though I'd be lying if I said that doesn't play a role at this point, than it is the desire to be able to satisfy appropriately. Some of my bro friends have basically given me the advice of just go to a bar and pick up some girls for one night stands for practice. That is 100% not my style and feels kind of disgusting. Likewise I don't want to use women in some bizarre fashion like this, even if it's just playful sex.

My dream scenario is to find someone who is very experienced (aka not the new interns who should leave my desk alone and get back to work) and can essentially be extremely communicative with me in a comfortable environment where were not half drunk people from the bar trying to recreate a scene from national geographic in my apartment. Does this sort of thing exist? Like a sex coach? Someone who'd be able to tell me stuff like ""You're just jackhammering kid, slow down and be more playful"" which is I imagine a sentence no girl from a bar has ever uttered without going home to update her tumblr about how she just had the most retarded sex of her life.

**The Solution:**

This is where you guys come in. Some extra information that might help you in prescribing something:

* Money is no problem for me, though I'd prefer not to be blowing money out of my ass.
* I have an apartment to myself
* I have transportation and regularly drive long distances
* My career has regular hours.

***TLDR: Guy wants to be good at sex for Ms. Right without having to have to sleaze around and sleep with a lot of women.***",28Jun2018,1
255,"I was wondering, in your opinion is it possible to continuing to be friends with a girl that you liked for almost 2 years, after she told you that she didn't feel the same way, and that she like your friend instead?

Long story short, I liked her, told her, she had a boyfriend, she told me she had a crush on me when we first met, she liked me but still had a boyfriend, she broke up, she didn't like me no more and now likes my friend. All this happened over the course of just under 2 years.

She told me that she didn't have feelings for me about 2 days ago and she liked my friend instead, I don't want to cut her out of my life, but it's going be tough just going back to being friends. Right now it's winter break so I'm not going to see her until school starts again, as she's in my class.

257,"Hi everyone. 

So my best friend has gone MIA for the last few days. She's a 23 year old female. The last communication I had with her was on Saturday night around midnight when we were texting about random stuff. I didn't talk to her Sunday but on Monday I texted her several times throughout the day and she didn't respond. I called her that afternoon and it went straight to voicemail. I then messaged a girl that I knew worked with my friend and asked if she had been to work that morning. The coworker said that she had been sick and went to the hospital without her phone. So at this point I got worried and asked her what was going on. The coworker didn't respond to any of my messages until last night (Wednesday night) when she said that she didn't want to spread any gossip around but that my friend's dad was with her and that she was still in the hospital. My friend and her dad have a terrible relationship (estranged for years and only talk a little now) so that was another red flag to me. I called around to the hospitals in the area this morning (Thursday) and found out that she had been admitted but had been discharged within the last 5 days. I texted and called her dad but got no response. She still hasn't responded to any of my texts but her texts seem to be getting delivered and when I call it does ring several times but goes to voicemail. 

She has been in the hospital before several years ago for self harm and as of the last few weeks had been doing a lot of partying (drugs, alcohol). My gut feeling is that she either hurt herself or collapsed after too much partying and was taken to the hospital and now has been committed. Is there any way that anyone knows of to find out if she's ok and/or where she is? Any advice on how to find out more information would be very appreciated as we've been best friends for over 10 years now and I'm worried about her father being in charge of everything since he has been abusive to her in the past.",28Jun2018,1
258,"I have been straight my whole life. All of my romantic interests and fantasies have been solely on the other sex. I watched gay porn recently and got off to it. Now I am not really getting turned on by women in porn. 

The thing that gets me, is that ever since I don’t feel like myself. My fantasies aren’t the same and when I have masturbated to gay porn my orgasms aren’t as ‘emotional’ or mind blowing as they have been thinking about women. I have no idea what my sexuality is now. And I am not coping with that I am aroused by homosexuality because this has all been so sudden and I feel like it’s stripping me of my identity. I don’t have any desire for romantic relations with a guy.  And I really don’t this belongs with me.

I filed a report with the LAPD towing hotline and they are investigating and they said it should take between 30-60 days. Should I schedule the court date on a day after the investigation would be completed so I can have better evidence?

263,"I'm 14 and the youngest of three with two older sisters. Before I was born, my parents decided to adopt another baby from China. I'll call him ""Jim"". Jim is loud and annoying and I personally can't stand to be around him. My parents are divorced and dad insists on sending Jim to visit my mom along with me at the same time instead of alternating like we used to, so there is no chance to ever get away from his shenanigans. And now I'm also going to need to share a bedroom with him. I used to live in my sister's old room, but now my dad is moving to a smaller house.

I said a joke once about how I wanted Trump to deport Jim back to China and my dad has blown that so out of proportion that he brings that up and gives Jim whatever he wants when there's any kind of conflict between us. 

He's stolen all my friend along with my alone time. It's obvious looking at us both how much happier he is than me. Everyone defaults to loving him and hating me. I invite someone to hang out and they ask if Jim will be there. I'm tired of him ruling my life like that.

275,"Hey there Reddit! Long time lurker, and terrified first time poster. I thought i'd turn to you all for some words of wisdom or outsiders advice on this predicament since I can't seem to separate emotion and advice from anyone I talk to, since everyone I love is involved.  Sorry for the SERIOUSLY long post- I guess I needed to get it out. You could probably just skim it... ANYWAY.

 ***Basically, the story goes like this-***

*Backstory:* My relationship with my mother was rocky in my childhood due to some issues with her taking money/paychecks/grandparents christmas checks from me and on of my brothers when we were kids (until I moved out) , her buying drugs from my oldest brother who was mostly in jail my whole life and her constant odd behavior and outbursts of anger, which my friends always teased me about. Lots of inside jokes with my friends were about my moms erratic behavior, which didn't feel great. Generally being in a distant terrible mood most of the time. My dad was under the radar and didn't really get involved. A lot of the time, her anger was taken out on him too... Flash forward a few years, I moved out at 18 with my boyfriend at the time. I didn't speak to my parents for months until my mom reached out and wanted to set up lunch dates once a week. We never spoke about what had happened when I was a kid, never got an apology, but our relationship was renewed. I loved hanging out with my parents and our bond became super strong. I started to prefer to hangout with them over anyone! The relationship my family had became super awesome and we never brought up the past, but we were proud of how close we were. 

***The lead up:*** I moved to another state to be with my boyfriend at the time, and a few years later- He proposed, and my mom was excited. She told me the night of that she would be willing to put in $25,000 for the wedding budget, which is AWESOME. *I wanted a traditional, formal wedding*\- **which would be the first in my family**. All of my immediate family, parents included, have had very small backyard weddings. She went out and got me some bridal magazines the next day and wedding planning commenced. We set the general date to be a year and a half later, during the summer, in my home state. We flew out to look at some venues, But I had just gotten a promotion at my job and I began working 70+ hours a week and my request offs were being criticized. I couldn't put enough time into planning my out of state wedding because I was working myself into the ground every day. I would discuss wedding planning with my mom at least once a week and she would tell me about what she and my sister-in-law had been planning and their thoughts. Time was creeping up and I still couldn't find enough time to fly out and lock down a venue. 

 *This might be a good time to mention my mother has a GPS tracker (find friends on Iphone) for me, since she was worried about my well being when I moved to a big city alone. I was totally fine with it.* 

One day I get a text at work telling me she had just found and booked my wedding venue for me. *Put down the deposit and everything*. This floored me in a bad way because I didn't even know she was up in the city looking at venues for me.. and I didn't even have a say in my venue. She spent the whole day up in  the city looking at venues and picked one for me without checking in with me on what I was looking for. I was so mad that I missed out on this huge part of my wedding planning, and to my horror- I **hated** the place she chose. I was so angry I cried for days. I called her and she got upset with me for ""being an ungrateful bitch"" and ""she was just trying to help me"" because every time she checked the GPS, I was at work and venues were starting to fill up and she just went ahead and did it for me ""since I didn't have time for my own wedding"". I asked her why she didn't just ask me what I was looking for, or to notify me that venues were filling up and she said ""It didn't matter, all you do is work. Every time I'd go to ask you about the wedding, I'd see you were at work.."" *First big red flag.* 

She helped a ton for the wedding planning process by helping be my eyes and feet since I lived out of state, and she signed contracts and looked over them, as well as various other things to help. This was all voluntary on her part, but you wouldn't we able to tell by how when the wedding would be brought up, she'd roll her eyes. Or say things like ""I just can't wait for this to be over"". Or her nickname for my wedding, **""The damn wedding!""**. I started to get offended when I would watch my SO's mother get excited about our day and my mom would never express any happiness toward it. I asked her the week before the wedding if she was happy for me and she just said ""I will be happy at 11pm the day of when it is all over and the last person leaves..."" *Great. Thanks mom.* 

***The straw that broke my back:*** 

The week of the wedding, my mom was super emotional, as was everyone. But she was lashing out irrationally, to be honest. I was hand making most of the decorations for the wedding to save money, and I had flown out every other month for the past 6 months to put it all together. We were finally on the biggest detail of the wedding- The hanging floral I had designed. This was the ""life saver"" for me and the venue because it would make the venue a little less ugly and tie in some sort of theme. It was the part of the decor that I cared about the most, it was a make or break for me. I had frustrations that it wasn't looking the way I had hoped (I'm still the sole person putting this floral together) and just a couple days before the wedding I was feeling discouraged. She got upset with me that I was disappointed in my ability to get it together and we broke out into a fight. She started going on and on about how much money she has spent on this wedding and how much work everyone was doing for it and how much of a burden it's been on the whole family- Which was not relevant as to why I was upset. The next few days we fought about **EVERYTHING**. Everything! My wanting a seating chart, what I wanted to do with my hair, my mother-in-law inviting her friends and, *the worst*, one of my bridesmaids. Who she had an odd outburst of rage over, when brought up. She started slapping her fist into her hand violently and yelled about her being a ""controlling officer"". It was such an odd outburst that my family fell silent after she did it and we all looked around at each other in a very ""what the fuck?"" manner. 

 She was the only parent to not stand up and say something at the rehearsal dinner, and she never thanked my in-laws for putting it together or paying for it. The wedding day comes and she is still a walking ball of stress and anger. Stomping around the bridal suite, coming in and out of where I am getting ready and huffing. 

 You know that magical moment when the bride puts on her dress and the mother says she looks beautiful and possibly tears up? Nope. Put it on and she came in and said"" we gotta hurry, we are running late."" hands me my veil and and gets visibly miffed when the photographers start snapping pictures. Throughout the wedding she is visibly annoyed, and when I come up to her to thank her and she how she's doing, she lets out a ""fine..."" and sits in silence. When the wedding is coming to an end, she comes up to me and tells me its time for the send off. I hug her and my father and thank them for everything they have done and tell them I love them. We send off and go to our wedding night hotel.

 The morning after I need to meet my parents so I can hand them off my dress before flying out of the country for the honeymoon.  My dad warns me my mom is ""In a bit of a mood"" because of how *that* bridesmaid was last night. We approach the car and she say's nothing. ""Hi mom!"". S*ilence*. My dad takes the dress and my mom drops us off for our ride (my in-laws AirBnB)  to the airport. She is short and rude to both me and my husband the whole ride. We get out and she points to the back seat for stuff we need to take with us. My husband thanks her for all that she did for us. ""sure.."" she saids shortly. I can't wait for this interaction to be over. To my horror, his parents come out to say hi and thank her for ""Such a beautiful wedding"" Her reply? ""Sure."" and stood in silence. She hugs me goodbye, I say thank you again, so does my husband, and she gets in the car and drives away, only replying to us by complaining about the city traffic. And that was our honeymoon send off. ~~Awesome.~~ 

She apparently had some issues with *that bridesmaid* that night, with her being bossy and ""yelling at people"" which I never saw. I know she can be a bit much, but yelling? No.But hey, that's what she says. She also apparently thought I was ungrateful for the wedding and didn't feel thanked enough. My brother texted me to ask me to send her a thank you text, which sent me through the roof with rage. My mother and I didn't speak the whole week we were on our honeymoon and when I got back, she called me to pretty much reassure me how horrible my bridesmaid was to her, How hard it was to clean up after my wedding, how much she cried about it after my wedding and to remind me that ""she wasn't happy during my wedding but at least she didn't make a scene."" Not apologizing for being an asshole to my husband, myself and my in-laws. Not asking about the honeymoon. Not telling me she was happy for me. Nothing but to remind me that she hated the wedding and how she thought it was tearing my family apart. Oh, and to let me know that my bridesmaids behavior almost ruined my mother and I's relationship. She said ""she'll get over it eventually"". I called one brother for advice but pretty much got ""Well you know how irrational mom is. You won't get a sorry. Just move past it."" 

I was supposed to call her later after I finished dinner but I made up a lie as to why I couldn't call her back because I can't stomach talking to her right now. Our relationship was awesome and now it's full of anger and hurt. I know she will never apologize for how she acted, and my memory of the wedding is tainted by this guilt that I ruined my families lives , my relationship with my mom, and that everything was my fault by having this bridesmaid. I also have this hurt that I cannot have a fond wedding memory with my mother, who's relationship I have been working to improve for YEARS. I'm just hurt and confused and I don't know where to go from here. I know my mom's favorite method of dealing with things is to pretend they never happened but shits broke, yo. It's not okay. I feel like this selfish butthole for wanting a nice wedding. Or a wanting anything for my wedding at all. 

 Should I just go on and sweep it under the rug and move on or let this effect our relationship and take it back to square one? 

TLDR; My mom and I after years of repairing our relationship are in a bad place because my wedding ""ruined her life"". I associate pain with my wedding because of how she acted towards me. I want my relationship back with her but she doesn't apologize.. Or maybe I'm a selfish asshole for wanting a wedding. Where do I go from here?",28Jun2018,1
276,"Im getting closer to 30 and i have no true friends or tight connections in my life. Had back is school but they are moved to foreign county and the connection is lost.

I had one best friend and a social circle, but this best friend since he has this circle (rather his than my circle) is more and more dropping me. I remember when i was his only option but in the same time i was an emotional trashbag to him (he only did this with me only).  I remember when i jumped when he was down or gave advice to him. Or when he ""you are my best friend "". He took way back. And this emotional stuff didnt worked reverse. When i had something serious (twice a year onlyk, he wasnt supportive. And this cirlce is cool we sometimes met, but we never had true talk, only small ones.

This is bums me the most: i deleted my facebook profile image, cover photo, and didnt even logged in, using only messenger. No one cares. I could easily die or something.

I never knew how to get friends, im not the most outgoing person but im not an energy vampire ( im the funny one). But i always had difficulties to keep up connections or start friendships. Those always came at me, and i dont know how to.
Any advice?

280,"I’ve literally exhausted every option that has been offered to me by my friends or I have come up with myself so I’m hoping someone on here has some answers

So I’m 18 and my younger sister is 10 years old and makes my home life hell

She doesn’t do anything she doesn’t want to do. Which includes leaving my room which she will often wander into of her own accord on a regular basis. (Before you ask my room is the attic and has no door and we can’t fit one in because it’s rented). I wouldn’t mind this but it makes it awkward to chat or play with friends online and she will constantly make noise or take my things which really makes it hard for me to work or study.

This is obviously because she craves attention and I have tried giving her more attention but this has not helped at all. I will allow her an allotted hour a day to play with me which takes away from my ability to socialise or study. As well as this my sister will refuse to leave once the hour is up and she will just go back to her usual antics of making noise and taking my things 

I live with my mother who is always onesided towards my sister. If i tell my mother what’s happening she will always respond with ‘tell her I want her’, which doesn’t help because my sister will always say no. At this point my mum will just give up and respond with ‘what do you expect me to do about it’

This is annoying because my mother always tells me to tell her if my sister is doing anything wrong. If I shout at my sister I immediately get called the bad guy and told to grow up and my sister gets into no trouble whatsoever. 

I also refuse to in any way use physical force against my sister unless it is to get something of mine off of her. When I do manage to get my stuff back she pretends I’ve hurt her and my mum goes ballistic at me about this.

I’ve tried being as nice to my sister as possible in a hopes that she will change, including giving her money to buy sweets or walking with her to the shops. But this doesn’t help because she will then come into my room every day and say she will only leave if I give her money, which I clearly say no to. When I tell my mother this is happening she just laughs

This is literally driving me crazy because I can’t even play a video game or even study without my sister managing to make me miserable. She once got me so angry while I was in a Skype call to a girl that the girl hung up and blocked my number. When I messaged her on Facebook she said I had scared her and then stopped talking to me

What can I do?

281," I never thought this would happen to me. And I cant believe my own mother won’t support me. 

About a month ago I was raped by someone close to my friend group. It was very painful and violent and I am ashamed to remember the details. I’ll never forget it.

Ever since then I have blamed myself. I don’t care how many people tell me otherwise. It feels like it’s my fault and I cannot change how I feel, sadly. My rapist left a lot of damage. I tried suppressing my feelings but that only worked for so long. I became incredibly depressed and stayed in my bed, unable to get up for days. 

Eventually, I stopped feeling anything. No emotion, no sadness. I was in a state of denial. For a little while, it didn’t really happen. I was just being dramatic and I needed to get myself together. And that was the end of it.

It wasn’t until I started getting severely nauseous that I knew something was wrong and that brought me back down  to reality. And then the realization that I’d never gotten a period was devastating. But I knew I didn’t want to keep the baby and be reminded of that disgusting man. I knew I was going to need a support system to go through with abortion.

When I called my mom, I started tearing up. I said, “Mom, can we make plans to meet up? I really need you right now.” We did.


When she came over, I got it over with and told her everything. It was so hard. Tears streaming down my face I told her, “ Mom I was raped and I got pregnant from it. I’m going to get an abortion and I need you for support.”

I’ll never forget her words. She said, “Jesus! I should’ve never vaccinated you, you stupid, autistic fuck. You know damn well middle aged men cannot get pregnant and I’ve told you this before. This is why I don’t visit you. I’m not falling for this shit again!”


Then she stormed out and slammed the door really hard. I don’t believe her. I feel pregnant even though I’m not a woman. Why does society think only women can be pregnant?

I still need support.

284,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8tdahl/a_friend_of_mine_asked_me_to_babysit_her_daughter/

Please read the previous post to start with. 

A summary of events is as follows: 

- late April, my friend A asked me to watch her daughter for a weekend. Unbeknownst to me she actually told the school I’d have her daughter, Mariana, for the rest of the year. 

- friend had a history of disappearing with men, cheating, and being a party person. 

- despite being a mother she frequently left Mariana home alone or brought strange men home while Mariana was as young as 6 months old. 

- CPS got involved so she switched to babysitters. Namely myself, and three other mutual friends from high school. 

- Mariana shows symptoms of abuse and neglect, and was previously seemingly malnourished. She seemed to have a lot of behavioural quirks.

- her clothes stunk of sweat and seemed to be unwashed. 

- A left to go to her boyfriend C’s place and never returned. She didn’t return anyone’s calls. 

- I reached out to A’s abusive mother who hit her growing up, B. B is Mariana’s grandmother. B refused to tell me when A would be back, and didn’t offer to take Mariana from me. 

- whilst with Mariana, I got her to eat healthy and stop eating fast food and take out and soda for every meal.

- I got her to open up and come out of her shell. 

- I earned her love and trust to the point that she started to call me daddy 

- but it’s been 2 months, I can’t just keep her forever. For one thing I can’t get her the glasses she needs. But I love Mariana and don’t want her to be taken away from me. 

So, here is what happened. Sunday night, I called B and stated that I wanted to adopt Mariana and that I’d be calling CPS in the morning. She didn’t take it well. She accused me of trying to hurt A and ruin her life, and steal her family. Then she insinuated that the only reason I’m doing this is because I’m mad that A wouldn’t have sex with me. I assured B I am not interested in sexual relations with her daughter, my sole interest was Mariana’s future and happiness. I have never attempted to court A for sex or romance. I have never considered it. 

Over the weekend I prepared a journal listing all of the details I know of A and B and of how Mariana came to me and how she was treated before me. I detailed her weight and some other things from the first week compared to now - she smells better, I completely replaced her wardrobe with new clothes, her old shoes had holes in the soles and were so small they were causing her to walk funny. I actually included some photos I took on my phone. 

I detailed how I taught her to cook and how I made her so happy. I noted her routine and schedule to the letter. 

Facing reality, I figured we could be separated for a long time so I wrote a cookbook for her. I detailed all her favourite recipes, noted all the tasks she could do, noted some common ingredients to keep on hand, everything. I wrote Mariana a beautiful letter and put stickers all over her cookbook. I packed it up for her with the journal, some photos I had printed, and a stuffy from when I was a baby. I slept with the stuffy so it’d smell like me, and I gave it to her to cuddle when I wasn’t there. 

Monday, a CPS agent came.  

Nothing went well. She was a rude and unpleasant and unprofessional person. I... I wish I had a male agent for this. 

Look, I understand that if you work CPS then almost every man you meet on the job sexually abuses the children in his life. I understand that that’s the type of man you encounter when you work that career. I get it and I’m grateful that CPS is so diligent and tough on potential predators. The very things that hinder Mariana and I protect other children. I am well aware of that. But I can’t help but feel angry. I’m sorry for feeling that way but it was so very frustrating. I hope other CPS workers following my story don’t feel like I’m being critical of them or their careers. You are wonderful people and heroes to many children. Thank you for the work you do. 

On with the story. 

The lady showed up, and asked about my relationship with Mariana. She asked me why I didn’t contact the police and I said that I was trying to resolve this issue within the family but that the family proved negligent and impossible to work with. 

She asked me who looks after Mariana while I’m gone. I explained that I am on permanent disability (technically true, but if I can find work my disability payout ends). 

She asked if I looked after her myself. I said yes. 

She asked about her hygiene, and I said that especially because of the summer, she has a bath once a day, twice if it’s really hot, and we wash her hair every other day. The lady got really rude with me and said “who baths her?” And I said “I do.” And she made a disgusted face at me and said snottily “so you bath another person’s child by yourself without the parents permission?” Or something like that and I said back, frustrated, that I am the only one here and her family didn’t want to take care of her, they abandoned her and I’m the one who’s been taking her to school, buying her clothes, doing her laundry, bathing her, feeding her, giving her shelter, making her smile and laugh and feel happy. 

She asked if we slept together, I said truthfully that we did for a few nights when she was having terrible nightmares as it was the only thing that calmed her down. The lady again was very unpleasant about that. I mentioned she helps me cook and she talked very condescendingly about how I could have hurt her cooking with her and she didn’t listen to me explain what I let Mariana do and how I keep my eyes on her. To elaborate, I never let Mariana handle anything sharp. I let her stir or hold pots with my direct supervision, and add things to pots and pans and whatnot. She was never at risk as I was close at all times and if she ever reached for something like the side of a pot I’d stop her. 

She scrutinized every single mention of physical affection and point blank said it was an appalling case of grooming for me to have Mariana call me daddy. She did that on her own without any mention from me. 

The lady treated me like a predator and patronized me, then she left with Mariana, and that was it. Literally. End of story. 

I asked how I could keep up to date on things and she told me I had no right to pry, nor would I be allowed to have information released to me. So basically I was told “you are never seeing Mariana again”. She said I should cease contact with the family. 

I asked about emergency guardianship and how to apply and she said I wasn’t eligible. I rejected the notion that I was a stranger but she emphasized that my role was done. She seemed outright creeped out that I wanted to get involved and stay close. 

I called B multiple times but she told me to fuck off and to leave her alone and she stopped answering. 

I talked to Mariana’s teacher whom I befriended, but she knows nothing. Even if she risked her job for me she wouldn’t find anything. 

I drove by A’s house and there’s a for sale sign. 

I contacted a family lawyer. He told me it was pointless if I wasn’t a blood relative, I would never win against one.

I went by B’s place and didn’t see them. 

There’s nothing I can do. Absolutely nothing. Mariana is gone and I don’t even know where she is. I feel like I’m going crazy. I can’t believe it. She’s just gone. I go home and I hug her blanket at night and cry through to the sunrise. 

No one ever came for her things. I still have half her clothes and a pair of shoes and her books and bedding. 

Is there any way I could see her again? Is there anything I could do? I just want to see her again. I miss her so much it hurts. It feels like there’s a hole right in my chest. What do I do? How do I get over this? 

I really would appreciate someone to get me out of the house, some friendly company to distract me from everything, especially at night. The evenings are toughest. I always loved playing with her curly hair and reading her to sleep. And when I went to bed I would listen to her breathing from her little futon, it helped me fall asleep. 

For the people who offered us clothes/books/toys, thanks so much, but I have no need now... 

For the people who offered money, I don’t really want to accept it especially now, but the reality of me skipping my phone bill to pay for Mariana is catching up. The lady at the phone company was very impatient with me so I may just end up losing my phone, but oh well. Who do I have to call anyways. ",28Jun2018,1802

286,"Well my aunt and uncle have been married for 6 years I believe and they have a child. Well I think she is cheating my uncle with my brother. Noticed that something is going on between her and my brother ever since she watched 50 shades of grey. Do keep in mind that all those thing that I'm about to say happened when there was noone else arouns but me since my uncle is at work and it is not happening when he is home. She randomly came in the room and started saying some wierdly named sex position (she thought I wouldn't understand what they were talking about or that I wouldn't look it up I guess). Then texting started, like some suspicious texting. They were in the rooms that are next to each other, I see my brother typing and when he put his phone down I hear a ringtone in the room when my aunt is and then she starts giggling, then he gets a message and so on. Like seriously if you have nothing to hide you would walk up to the person that is few meters away from you and would tell/show the person what you got to tell/show, I repeat if you got nothing to hide. And then when I have headphones on and she is talking to my brother and has a chance to say something inappropriate she says my name first to check if I can hear her (like I'm one meter away ofcourse I can hear her, I'm 18 and she knows she can swear infront of me but the cases she says my name to check if I can hear her are the times when the inappropriate stuff could involve my brother) and ofcourse she doesn't say anything then. Later they just went in the other room and didn't talk almost at all (also heard someone behind me at the enterance of the room probably to check if I have headphones on). One day heard a sound of what seemed like someone pulling their pants up when I was coming upstairs. And the latest thing was that they were in the room right next to the one I was in and didn't talk AT ALL (unless they were whispering or something) and when I was walking right next them to go downstairs she started laughing for no reason then I decided to stay downstairs close to the stairs to maybe hear something, I heard what seemed to be a underpants hit (as when you pull the top of your underpants away from you and then let them go and they hit you) along with some other noices that I can't identify but sounded like a handjob or something I don't know. That would be it that made me make this post. I might be wrong but I don't feel like I'm wrong. Even if I actually do find out they are doing it I wouldn't know how to tell my uncle about it since I'm the only one who would know that since I'm the only one on this floor beside them.

Our security deposit was initially $1,613.50
We lived in the NJ apartment for about 4 years so we figured there was some normal wear and tear he might want to take from it, but he ended up taking $990 of it. I’m pissed because what he’s claiming isn’t any damage we ever did, and a lot of the things he’s claiming to fix are issues he never fixed when they were presented to him when we were living there. So I have absolutely no proof that we requested those things to be fixed unless I somehow also voice recorded our phone calls over the years. Some the prices for the things he’s going to “fix” seem outrageous to me. 

I requested he send us the receipts of everything he’s claiming to fix, or at least a basic breakdown of the costs he’s claiming. He’s ignoring my calls and not returning them, so I’m not sure what to do. I feel like we were cheated from a big amount of money and he also never sent us proof that the security deposit was in a bank. He literally just sent us a personal check of $622. I requested he also send proof the deposit was in a bank as well, because I don’t believe it was. It was foolish of us not to request this when we first moved in after he claimed it was in a bank, but I feel like my hands are tied with a lot of things. ",28Jun2018,1

My “parent” decided to last minute move everyone and everything back to our home state within a flash of a week. I did not go. Why? I have a serious relationship with my significant other. We have been together for a bit and live together now in our apartment, but things are rough. SO pays for the majority of things while I am a full time “house wife” and part time minimum wage earner. He has a fairly decent job, but it barely just covers. I, on the other hand, produce squat. I feel so bad and ashamed.  SO and I are doing our best in our situation and he tries as hard as he can to not spend money on things he wants. And that is so sad to me. I am trying to get into school, but I have to pay for it. I can not get any scholarships or grants or loans because I can not get the information that the government and school needs from my “parents” so I am not entitled to anything until I get that (I’ve been told this by financial aid office at my school) so everything has to come out of pocket. Without actually having anything other than a high school diploma, I can only get shit jobs. Nothing good is ever hiring someone with my “expertise”. It’s so hard in this state because it’s so small. There isn’t really anything here besides grocery stores or fast food places for someone like me. But I have rent,ect. And absolutely no one else to lean on besides my SO and SOs family. An incident happened yesterday, where me and SO went grocery shopping and came back home to see something we had purchased, which was $7, did not work.

Both were living at parents house and not having to worry about bills but now things are different. He’s not so happy now and I completely understand. I really don’t know what to do or how to approach him about talking about this subject.

\*\*Main\*\* \*\*Contact\*\* \*\*Phone (Home):\*\*  Sam Doe's Number (Co-chair)

\*\*Main\*\* \*\*Contact\*\* \*\*Phone (Mobile):\*\* 'Jane Doe's Number'(Or my number)

299,"For the record, I'm no longer in school. I'm 17. I've almost got my GED, but most of the time I am bored out of my mind. I don't see a lot of people during the day, and end up painting/reading/ and listening to music. My friends are out of town for the summer, so I won't see them much.

I live with my grandparents and they work 90% of the time, and things just aren't good between us so I really don't talk to them much. But I'm tired of sitting inside all day, or going outside and sitting around for a few minutes. I have NOBODY to talk to but people online, and it's incredibly boring. I'm not really close to the neighbors, my grandparents are, but it has made me incredibly depressed due to how much time I spend alone. 

Don't get me wrong, I like being alone at time. But I feel stuck-up and like I'm no fun to be around because without computer I guarantee I'd just sit around the house all day doing nothing. Family doesn't come to see me much, and my house feels completely and totally dead. It's soul-sucking. And nobody seems to understand exactly how soul-sucking it is. 

I can't really go anywhere either, I have a bike but there's just..nothing to really do in my town. There's a bowling alley, but that's pretty much the only thing I can do except loiter around stores.

305,"Long story short after two years and about half a year of trying to make things work and him cheating on me we broke up. I was ready to spend the rest of my life with him, move in together, get married and I feel like I still like him even after about two months of being broken up. The worst part is he acts like it didn't affect him and that the 2 years were nothing. We are trying to be friends because we have the same friends and don't want them to feel awkward and we both don't want to never see each other again.

But main point here is that ever we broke up I've felt so alone, I've tried to keep myself occupied but nothing fills that void, not even alcohol or weed anymore. I spend my days at work which I enjoy, then drinking or smoking and end my day on hookup apps sending pictures. I go out every weekend and spend about £100 a night, adding to my debt. I just want to get to the point in my life where I can move on, meet someone else and start dating, be happy, make new friends, enjoy life. I have no idea how to do that, I live on a small island.

Kind of just wanted to get this out and talk to someone who can help.

307,"In the nearby future, I plan to live in 2 countries: one which I already live in (where my family is) and another where my career will be mostly based and where I can enjoy and make friends (for once haha). 

I want to maybe live in my home country for a couple of months, then go to the “new” country for a couple of months and keep doing this. (Also my sister will be doing this with me so I won’t be alone in the “new” country) 

The only thing is, if I get a boyfriend in the “new” country, will the relationship last? Knowing that I will only be there 6 months in a year in total?? Also what if in the future I want a family, is it still possible to keep alternating between countries when in each country a different language is spoken?

But in the last few years, specially at work, I’ve noticed that my colleagues/coworkers tend to not take me seriously because of said reason. Even some family members make jokes and comments about how “childish” I am because I’m never serious about most things. Things I think you shouldn’t be serious about because its no big deal, to me anyway. Note that I have a steady job, in school, live on my own so basically an independent individual.

I think because of my personality, I’m always underestimated and made to think that I am “childish”. I don’t wanna change the way that I am because I love being this way and so does my long term boyfriend.

315,"Years ago, a woman contacted my family looking for information about her biological mother, who is my aunt. It turns out this pregnancy was a secret that only my parents knew about, and now as an adult, she wanted to meet her mother. When my parents approached my aunt about it, she was extremely dismissive, and wanted nothing to do with her daughter or for my cousins to know that she exists. We all chose to respect my aunt's wishes - after all, this woman is living a very happy life and only wanted to meet her mother if my aunt was open to it.

Now, through the DNA site 23&amp;me, I've begun speaking with a man who also was put up for adoption by this same aunt. This child even my parents didn't know about! Knowing my aunt's reaction to the prospect of meeting her daughter, I won't even approach her about it.

However, it is something I've struggled with for years, and now moreso, seeing my cousins and knowing that they have a sister (and now a brother!) that they don't know about. I believe it would cause real problems for my aunt if I told them about their siblings, but I also really believe that they have a right to know and be given the opportunity to have a relationship with them.

316,"For the past three years, I've worked as an intern for a research team at my university. I left that internship last month after I got a new job offer to work for a professor on a pilot study after he was impressed with my skills. Before I left my previous internship though, I was under the impression that I would be working at both jobs, just part-time for each. That hasn't been the case though, because on the last day I was working there, my former boss e-mailed me a thank you letter for all the time and effort I've put in. In it, she mentioned there wouldn't be enough funds to employ me until later this summer (she didn't specify a date or month, so I guess she didn't know when exactly). That was because a new intern was hired to replace me in what I thought would be my part-time absence. So I've been working for my new job only.

  
While I enjoy it a lot more than my previous job, it does have a couple downsides. 

1. Since I'm only working part-time at it, I'm usually working 2-7 hours per day for $10 per hour. I'm making a lot less money than I have in previous summers (the other job was usually 7-8 hours per day when full-time for $11 per hour), and it could affect my financial stability later on if it keeps up. My new job can't be full-time because of protocol restrictions on when I can take data.

2. The job is causing me to be pretty lonely. I'm living alone and none of my friends are in town, which has been the case for the past couple summers. But now I work alone as well (except during meetings with my current boss), so it's been taking a toll on my well-being. That's in addition to another factor causing me to feel lonely, but that's a whole other issue.  
I've been thinking about asking my former boss if the funds to reemploy me are available yet, but I'm hesitant to do that. Despite the issues I'm experiencing from it, I enjoy my new job way more than my previous job because it mostly involves working outdoors (as opposed to working in a lab a lot of the time), and it's not tedious. So I'm not sure if I want to go back to it. I can't decide for myself if I should or shouldn't, so I'd like others' opinions on it. What would you suggest?",28Jun2018,1

318,"We didn't get to know each other until a few months ago, where one night  we randomly hung out together after previously hanging out in a group.  From there, we started hanging out more, always 1 on 1.

Over time, I grew to like her as more than a friend. And I could've sworn she liked me back too, but in retrospect, I must have been seeing what I wanted to see. Because recently, she stated that she's gay in the middle of a conversation (we were talking about political stuff and the topic of gay rights came up and...yep). I'm actually grateful I never admitted feelings and had it come out \*that\* way, because that would've been more embarrassing, and awkward, than anything.

Now, the exact moment she said that, my heart sunk. But what I knew even at that moment was this: any feelings of a crush, any sense of being attracted to her, I needed to make it disappear, because it's pointless (and probably disrespectful) admitting a crush on a girl that likes girls.

That being said, I'm feeling myself grow distant from her. So, while I thought there was zero upside in coming clean, I'm not sure now, because the last thing I want to do is hurt her by getting distant inexplicably and leave her wondering why.

323,"Backstory: My mom owns an apartment (she bought it) in an apartment complex that is my grandmother’s. We’ve already moved out of that complex to a new apt (5 years ago).

Now my mom is in a bit of financial trouble and was thinking about selling her old apartment but because my grandmother doesn’t want anyone outside of the “family” to live inside the complex, she refused. So now my mom has got something in front of her that would solve her financial problem but she can’t sell it nor rent it because of my grandma’s preference even though under the law, mom has every right to do so. 

Mom being someone who’d rather avoid conflict, she decided not to spark a fight between her and her mother and closed the subject. But me being stubborn, I opened said subject, had somewhat of a fight with my grandmother and now my grandmother thinks that my mother sent me to say these “words” and now mom is the bad daughter even though she has nothing to do with this whole ordeal. 

I just couldn’t stand seeing my mother stuck in a financial trouble that can be easily solved by selling an asset that belongs to her and her own mother refusing to help her.

325,"So I’ve had a crush for a while and now all of the sudden he’s being super touchy and I am so socially awkward that I cannot tell the lines between friendship and flirting.

I was hanging out with him and he kept touching my hair and like poking me and like looking at me and stuff, then when we were just watching tv he put his head in my lap and he kept looking up at me with this smirk on his face, even though I hadn’t said anything. He went shopping before he came to hang out, and when he got there he was clutching a stuffed animal that he had bought before he came to give me.

He always tells me stuff and says that I’m really the only person he can talk to, including his best friend. I don’t really want to ruin our friendship, but if he is returning my feelings then I’d want to go on that.

I don’t really know if this is considered flirting or him trying to show me that he likes me, or if I’m just reading too much into something because I’m too much of a sucker for romance.

Even if he was flirting I don’t really know where to go from there.",28Jun2018,1
326,"So I'm sorry for rambling but I'm straight up pissed. 

So I always get a phone call from Texas talking about how I qualify for some credit card shit. I usually don't answer these calls because I'm like ""meh"", not worth my time.
 I guess I should mention my husband and I get these calls regularly from different numbers although his is usually from India, (mine aren't) and he's fucked with them on multiple occasions and they just hang up after a small argument.

Well today, I was in a particularly pissy mood so I listened to the automated person, then pressed 1 to talk to a ""representative"". I was transferred to some guy, who asked me ""how much debt do you currently owe?"" Which is a dumb question considering the automated voice said I had ""no debt and made outstanding payments therefore I qualify, etc"".

I then replied ""well I actually have a shit ton of debt actually, so stop fucking calling me."" Not badass or anything but whatever.

Now he's currently blowing up my phone with 3 different phone numbers, leaving me voicemails, calling me a bitch, bimbo, and won't stop freaking calling me. He's not threatening me unless you consider ""bitch, I'm gonna call you till you die."" a threat. Everytime he calls I answer (except now because I'm writing so I'm dismissing them haha) and he either says some stupid thing and immediately hangs up, or it's some weird elevator music.

If you've had any experience with these scammers, you cannot call any of the phone numbers back at all. So I'm stuck getting a bunch of this calls and no way to return them.

I know of this website I think it's called isaidstopcalling.me or something like that, where you give them the phone number(s) that are bugging you and it automatically calls them a bunch of times. But like my above statement says, the phone calls just won't go through.

I know everyone will just tell me to block them, but he could easily change the number (ithink?) And just keep calling right? Is there seriously NO other way I can do something about it? 

Again, sorry for any confusion, I'm pretty annoyed.

So I’m in somewhat of a problem. I am a recent graduate with my Bachelors degree in Sociology. I have been working with a small non profit as a communications and marketing intern for the past year or so getting only 30 hours a week with a salary of $13.50 an hour. Just recently when I graduated a close family friend offered me a job as a recruiter at a job agency. This job offers benefits and a starting salary of $60,000. On another note, one of my “dream jobs” so to say, is working in the communications or public relations dept of a bigger company. I have been trying to get an internship at the Disney program in Burbank and even have a family member who put in recommendations for my applications this year. Now my problem is if I take this job at the job agency it is long term and I essentially give up the opportunity for any internships I am trying for at this moment. I do plan on continuing my education and going to get my masters. I could really use some help to decide what to do? Is this opportunity for the stable job good? Will I get these opportunities when I am doing my masters? Will it hinder my ability to get my dream job at some point in the future? My main concern is that if this is the time to get the internships with something related to an industry that I am interested in since I have just graduated. I don’t want to make a decision that will close other doors, but as a recent graduate i feel it is also important to get a stable job.

He then asked me if I was getting glasses and for what insurance I was getting the glasses on, later telling me that the insurance was down and that I should come back later.

So the next day, I called (I record my phone calls because it is legal where I am). I asked him if the system was still down and he said yes so I asked him should I go somewhere else...? He then said yes and then had the nerve to tell me to hold on and in the background I heard him pick up another phone and start speaking with that customer on the phone while he was STILL on the phone with me. Anyway, hung up because I don't have time for that and I called the next nearest store in the same large chain (example, if the store I called was a Walmart Optical, I called the next nearest Walmart Optical). I told her the situation and she also said the system was down however, it wasn't an issue. All she had to do was manually put in the values. I was shocked that the guy from the other store nearest to me didn't even offer that and even encouraged me to go to another store even in a different chain. Anyway, went to the second nearest store and got my prescription.

Since graduation I have dabbled in sales as well as email marketing, yet I am still very drawn to forensic psychology. I do not have any experience with forensic psychology, yet I'd like to start moving towards that career path.

With all of this in mind I was wondering if anyone who is in this field could give me some tips on where to look for someone with little experience as me?

I don’t know where to start.
but here goes.
I’m a 22yo female and recently lost my mother. Her and I have been apart since I was 14 when she lost control of her life after my dad left. She ended up on the streets and that’s where she died. 
I convinced myself all that time we were apart that I didn’t need her. My father who is now almost 70, raised me alone. 

I’m really struggling now that I’m an “adult”. 
I’m struggling because I spent most of the rest of her life resenting her. She had many untreated mental health issues and that made it so hard. I could never help her. I wanted to but I couldn’t so I shoved all the pain from that deep down. Now that she’s gone (been less than a year) I’m just so lost. I feel tremendous guilt for how things ended between us. I’m 22 and my family is completely broken. I just don’t know how to cope. 
Today I broke down and walked (well, ran) out of my job in the midst of a panic attack and don’t know what I’m going to do to pay rent or how I could possibly hold a job right now. I get no financial assistance which has always been fine but now that I need money I’m having trouble getting loans or credit cards with decent limits due to my lack of credit history. 

 I try so hard to be strong but I have such a lack of a  support system. I’ve lost my relationship with my half-sister after our mom died. This morning I woke up to a text from her that was the last straw. 
Don’t really have any interest in fixing that right now she makes me feel terrible about myself. 

I do have an amazing, patient and supportive boyfriend. but, I fear wearing him down. I’m such an emotional wreck a lot of the time. I don’t want to place all my burdens on him. I don’t want to lose him. 

I know I’m a strong and able person, I know I have my whole life ahead of me but right now I’m just so lost. 

I don’t know where to start. ",28Jun2018,1

346,"I've been in the process to join the RCMP for almost two years now. From the onset they have known that I have Type 1 Diabetes. Recently I was moved into the final stage of the application process, the health assessment,and found out today that the recruitment doctor, wants my blood sugar A1C (currently 7.9, down from 8.7) down within the next 4 months, and for me to lose a little more weight (I put on a lot of weight back in university) I've already dropped 25ish pounds during the application process. Then I'm to reapply (typically it's a year, but I was told that they don't want me to retake my hearing and eye assessments, I assume they don't want to pay for it again). 

The problems that I foresee are two fold, and they are connected, 1) I think it's futile, I won't be able to meet what the doctor wants in only 4 months time, 2) During my time being applied, I've not been working towards any other career, I've only been taking temporary jobs, because full time employers don't like training people who will up and leave after a few months. 

Therefore, I'm wondering if I should just drop out of the process and pursue another carrier? I'm almost 26 now, and I've been out of university (with honors) since 2015. As I said I've been in the process for about two years already, and even if I pass the health assessment I have no idea how long it will take to get a Troop offer. Or should I continue to try and follow my dream for another 4 months? Unfortunately I'm still living at home, and I absolutely hate the idea of being a burden on my parents. Personally I feel like I should just quit the application process, and pursue something else. Thoughts?",28Jun2018,1
347,"Now for some background about me, I have really deeply rootede daddy issues, in short, my dad has always criticized everything I've ever done to the point that I've grown up believing that I'm a good for nothing piece of shit, I struggle a lot in seeing my self worth to this day. So like 6 months ago I started working on my thesis with this professor I never met before in class. So he's a really cool guy and we bonded a lot while figuring out my thesis, the subject he teaches is one of the hardest in my course and he told me himself right from the start that it wasn't gonna be easy and I could say it was too hard form me and quit at any time without shame. I never did quit tho, I worked my ass off and managed to be quite good at what I was doing so he started telling me how good I was doing and how proud he was of me and all that, he took me under his wing basically. Obviously this kinda thing coming from a man 20+ years older than me triggered my daddy issues pretty bad, it's not that I fell for him but we bonded so much, I finally felt that I worth something if someone so smart said that he was proud of me. He also treated me so well compared to the other people also working on their thesis with him, he's really strict with others, and he was with me as well at first but then we became sort of like buddies. The point of all of this is that I graduated not long ago and I can't deal with never seeing him again, I've been once to his office to say hi to him and his collegues etc since I graduated but I would love to ask him to hang out as friends outside of work sometime to have those really cool one on one conversations we had, but I'm afraid it'd come off as weridly sexual and inappropriate. I don't know, I don't wanna let this relationship shrivel and die cause I'm afraid of being weird, what should I do?",28Jun2018,1

349,"Please help, I honestly have no idea what to do right now. Growing up, I can completely say that I  was raised by my grandmother. Both my parents would work, and my grandmother would watch over me. She had moved in during my infancy to take care of me, and lived with my family up until I reached the age of 17, when my home had become extremely broken and dysfunctional due to infighting between parents and occasionally me. Needless to say, she went to crash with an aunt until things blew over. My grandmother is my mother in my eyes, she raised me from birth and was actually there for me. My parents were somewhat distant, and as a result  never really understood me as a person, whereas my grandma would always listen to me and just, actually be present. As of now I’m 19, things with my parents calmed down, but my grandmother never came back. Her and my father were constantly at each-other’s throats, mostly due to her tendency of hoarding things. Back in the old country she and my mother were EXTREMELY poor, living in dirt homes with little to nothing actually to their name, so I completely understand why she has a problem with letting items go or altogether getting rid of them. It’s not healthy, but it’s understandable. This isn’t TLC level hoarding either, simply put, her side of the room was cluttered but well kept and organized. Today I called my grandmother, and I just found out she’s on the verge of homelessness. My aunt charges her rent when she’s too frail to actually work, and on top of that the small amount of money that she did have was stolen from her on the bus, 2.5k to be exact, which she had been hoping to put towards buying a vehicle she could live in so she wouldn’t “burden” anybody. My aunt mistreats her, not to mention meddled with her source of income, so now she no longer receives money in the mail. I fucking love my grandmother to the moon and back, and would do absolutely anything for her, however I’m in the middle of a move and jobless atm without any money to my name other than a car. I don’t want my grandmother on the streets, and I feel awful about how she had to leave my home because of altercations with my father and between the family. She can’t move with us either, our new space is much smaller with only two rooms and it’s already a five person household. I called her on the phone, and she tells me how she’s miserable not being with my family, along with the fact that she’s extremely close to begging on the streets. I don’t know what to do, please help me Reddit.

TL;DR: Aunt fucked over my grandmother’s source of income, and what little money she had left was stolen from her in a bus, which she wanted to spend towards a vehicle to live in. My grandma’s miserable and on the verge of begging on the streets, and I’m unable to help her because I’m penniless and job searching. I need advice on what I can do for her, please help me Reddit.",28Jun2018,1
350,"I (19M) just recently realized this due to me living abroad in LA from BCN and having a relationship with someone (24F) they said was a shitty person without them actually getting to know her and it ended up in them giving me an ultimatum saying her or studies. I choose studies, but I kept seeing her because I loved her and was my only friend in the whole country. Now as I am in my summer vacation in Spain they are refusing to let me go back to America due to the fact that they saw my phone history and are destroying my privacy.
I have tought of becoming independent and leave by myself since I broke up with her due to the incredible pressure I had from my family. They ruined my relationship, made me loose a year of college with a 3,66 GPA and threaten me to kick me from my house.

351,"I'm about to turn 30 and I am in the former camp.  It had to do with being very self absorbed tunnel vision in my late teens and 20's where I just focused on my own hobbies alone in my room, and went to school/work and came home and sat on the computer/internet all night.

  
 My social life is completely non existent, I have never had a girlfriend.  My last remaining friend cut off all contact with me 2 months ago and I don't know why.  I am in a job I despise with no promising leads on anything better.  It was a bait and switch so I'm not even doing what I was doing before (software development).

  
 All I have are my parents and sister.  They all sat me down in the past and expressed concern about the state of my life and the direction it is heading.

  
 I don't even feel like a real man and I still feel like a boy.  My parents did everything for me growing up.  I still sleep over at my parents house on the weekends because I don't like my apartment (Gets very hot in the summer, and cold in the winter.  If you turn on the window a/c unit, or a portable heater (building heating sucks), then they are so loud that you can't do anything such as watch a movie, play guitar, etc.  So I am either constantly sweating, or freezing cold depending on the season.)

  
 I come to their house after work every day to eat dinner.  The fridge at my place is practically empty except for drinks and snacks.

  
 I recently realized while cleaning that the couch in my living room had a layer of dust on it because no one ever sits on it (I sit in the bedroom) and I never have anyone over to hang out. The friend that I mentioned earlier has told me that the only way I will ever have a girlfriend is if they are an obese single mom, or a gold digger.

  
 I've been on and off on dating sites for the last 8 years.  Both free and paid.  I have never gotten a date on it.  I have never gotten a match on tinder nor on bumble.  The only likes I get on other sites is obese women. I don't consider myself fat and slightly over 5'11 and 170-175 lbs.  But I always felt ugly, with a asymmetrical face and boring personality.  
 I've slowly accepted that I will never be with an attractive partner.  I feel now at this age that my options will very quickly become women with kids, etc.  I have no desire to get married or have kids.  I feel like I barely even got started, because its true.

  
 I used to think I wanted to save up for a house but realized that there is no point because I am alone.  I barely even use my 1 bedroom apartment fully.

  
 So now I am extremely scared for the future and don't even know what the hell I am working toward.  I've been to a couple therapists but I felt it was a waste of time.  I felt like even they were overwhelmed with my situation. The funny thing is that I actually enjoy sitting at home doing nothing and just browsing youtube.  But the loneliness gets crushing sometimes.

  
 I am constantly on edge with anxiety now and it's slowly been getting worse over the years.  I worry about everything now.  I got anxiety recently about even thinking about having a girlfriend and introducing her to my family.  The concept of me having a partner would be so foreign that the entire situation would be extremely awkward to me.

  
 I sometimes have this urge to literally jut disappear  Pack my stuff, buy a plane ticket, tell my work that I'm not coming back, and leave.  Call my family once I arrive at my destination to tell them I'm sorry but I won't be coming back, and erase all phone numbers and all contact to me.

  
 I know all my habits would follow me though.

  
 I am hoping that people who have been in similar situations can chime in with their story and how they overcame it?",28Jun2018,2
352,"Details are kept generic on purpose. I apologize if it makes it more difficult to understand.



I have planned a week long vacation  for a group of friends. Everyone bought in upfront knowing that costs would be cheaper as more people agreed to go. 6 of us immediately had a price range we agreed to and I booked a beautiful cabin  that is large enough for 10 people. We agreed the money would be non-refundable to prevent people from “flaking” whether or not it was by choice. The other parties agreed.

One party heard about this and bought in shortly after I booked the cabin. I communicated how I was handling this and the party agreed it to it. This party has since had other things come resulting in an inability to go and asked for a full refund. I declined and I offered the party two choices. 1. Find a party to buy you out or 2. We can all use part of your share for CO souvenirs.

The party then accused me of basically stealing money from them when I declined. Which all I’ve done is plan a nice vacation for my friends.

This party and I work in the same field, live in the same city, and know the same people. I’m trying to decide if I stick to my principals and risk tainting a relationship or if I go and ask the other 5 parties for the money back.

At this point if the party is going to ruin our relationship for this I’m not sure if the relationship is worth maintaining.


Also: this is not the first time the party has done this. Just the most grand.


Has anyone else dealt with an issue like this?

353,"I am 21F, but I have had some low self esteem issues since I was about 14. I struggle with feeling as though I am ugly and comparing myself to others. With this comes what I would say is my worst characteristic trait: I am a jealous person. I compare myself to these beautiful girls who have lots of money and friends and I am immediately jealous which spirals into a sort of depression and a feeling of inadequacy. Basically, I have a best friend of mine who I cant help but be extremely jealous of. She is naturally beautiful, boys always want to go out with her, she is spoiled by her parents, everyone loves her (mainly because she is attractive...) and she always gets what she wants. I love her to death but it honestly doesn't help my self esteem. I'm having a hard summer so far and tomorrow she goes away for a 2 week trip across Europe. Jealous is an understatement, there is no way I could afford a trip like that, not anytime soon thats for sure. I am just so sad because I can't help but compare my life to hers and just feel shitty. My life sucks in comparison. How can I get over this horrible habit?",28Jun2018,1

I feel good because I was honest to my manager about what was bothering me but bad because I changed my mind about how I felt. In effect, part of me feels two faced, the other feels like I came to my senses but shouldn't have expressed this to my boss.

360,"I will try and make a long story short, but I need some advice on dealing with a boyfriend/SO that’s addicted to porn. 

I’m 20, and my boyfriend is 32. He’s had this addiction for almost 6/7 years now, and to my knowledge, I am the first girlfriend of his to bring the issue up, and try and get him to stop. 
The issue is that he’s addicted to watching/looking at porn. He has a laptop that is FILLED with porn, I’m talking a month or more worth of movies and videos. On top of that his phone is filled with porn as well, he will never use his phone to take pictures bc he only uses it for porn, he also has a separate document app that’s filled with porn, as well as his Instagram. 

Now, when I brought the issue up I told him that it’s normal to watch porn, and that just bc he’s in a relationship doesn’t mean that he can’t ever watch it, or masturbate. I’ve even told him that we can watch it together in the bedroom. The issue was that he was constantly more obsessed with finding and looking at porn than he was with me. If I was texting him on his lunch break AT WORK, he would not reply for the sheer purpose of looking at porn. While we are on the phone he would also be looking at naked women/saving there pictures to his phone.  He would even watch porn video while I was in the other room cleaning/showering. 

Now while this was going on he also would have no physical contact with me. He didn’t want to have sex, he didn’t want blow jobs. He would turn down every offer with me to go and watch porn behind my back. 

We had a pretty long argument/ discussion about it and he told me that he would delete his Instagram, to which I replied that I didn’t want if it just meant he would be more sneaky about finding it. For a few days he seemed to cut it off completely. Then I went out of town. 

While I was out of town he pretty much had a porn marathon, which almost hurt my feelings. Again, it’s not that he was watching it or doing it, but was so excited for me to leave so that he could only do that. It’s hurtful to me that he would rather watch porn and masturbate than doing anything with me. Since I’ve been back he’s been back to his usual looking at porn and saving it while we are talking, and he’s started following people on Instagram again. 

I’ve done everything I can do incorporate that part of him into our sex life. I’ve tried to watch porn with him, make porn, wear lingerie he likes, and even do anal with him bc it’s one of his main interests in sex. 

I don’t know how to bring the issue back up, or if I even should. The last time I brought it up he got extremely defensive and we didn’t talk for a day or so. I don’t want to offend him or hurt his ego, but it’s also not healthy to choose porn and your phone over your in person gf. 

Any advice on maybe how I deal with the issue, and if I should bring it up again or not?

361,"Disclaimers: I'm using a throwaway because she reads my comment history, and posted this to another relationship advice sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8um94w/my_27f_friend_20f_wants_to_get_into_my_field_but/)

**Me**: 27F business owner in an industry that is notoriously hard to get into. I started at 20. ""Tough love"" isn't a perfect descriptor of my style, but I do present things as honestly and concisely as possible. I don't believe in the bootstraps argument, but I do believe that this is an industry that doesn't have many barriers to entry in her case.

**Her**: 20F best friend currently working a dead-end job. Has dreamed of doing what I do. She struggles with anxiety and depression, and her work-life has consisted of short stays at low-paying, entry-level jobs. She gets very excited about ideas, but she struggles with details.
When we became closer friends, I opened up to her about how my business works. She was interested and eager to do something similar. At her request, I sent her links, long checklists of things she needs to do, examples of what I did, proposed timelines for her getting onboard, etc.

This is an industry in which it's very difficult to get business advice because people fear competition; I experienced it when I was just starting out, and I don't want to be that for her. My man is already planning on quitting his job to join my business, and it would be a total dream to have my best friend working alongside me.

**The details**: She's not doing enough. She has done *some* things, but she only selectively follows advice. It's worth noting that she has zero experience in this industry, so she has no way to know what's a good idea and what's a bad idea. The advice she has followed has had tangible, measurable success, so I'm struggling to understand why isn't following the rest.

For example, last week she complained about being broke and asked if I have any resources for easy money-making side gigs. I had emailed her a list with over 20 opportunities the week previously, so I asked her if she followed up with any of them. She didn't. At that point, I sent her a long, carefully worded text about how frustrating it is to see someone cosign on their own misery. She derides people who don't help themselves, but she won't help herself.

**My frustration**: I respect and value people who defer to others' expertise. My boyfriend knew nothing about the industry, I gave him direct tips and research suggestions, and now he's ready to quit his high paying, stable career to join this. I started out knowing nothing and no one, and I did my best to accept criticism, take advice, and research novel approaches myself.

**My bad**: She's very frustrated with a dysfunctional sister she has because her sister continues down her abusive, shitty lifestyle despite having a full support network that will help her escape. I said it's hypocritical for her to judge her sister for that when she is doing the same thing. This upset her a lot, and she said it wasn't a fair characterization because her sister is dealing with a man and she (my friend, F20) is dealing with being broke.

**Other things**: I already sense this causing a rift between us. Money wise, we have very different situations, and it's causing practical day-to-day friction. For example, I don't mention my expensive shopping sprees because she has to gather coins together for a $5 Taco Bell box. Now, I do treat her all the time. I have no problem doing cheap things because I'm low brow as fuck, and I also don't mind paying her way to expensive things I suggest or want to do. I firmly believe in elevating everyone you love, so I want her and her BF to be rich and happy. However, if she doesn't achieve this, I'm worried that the discrepancies in lifestyle and stress level are going to cause us to drift apart, and I'm extremely sad (and maybe naïve) that one of the best friendships I've ever had in my life might end over money.

**My questions**:

* How can I help her?

* What is the best way to motivate someone who has previously been unmotivated?

* What's the best approach to take in discussion?

* If I can't help her, how can I prevent myself from feeling such guilt?

* At what point do you throw up your hands and say, ""I've done all I can do""?

* Anything else, please!

EDIT: If there isn't anything I can do, how do I proceed? How do I navigate a friendship where I am working someone's dream job, and they aren't? I'm NOT a braggart, so that's not the issue. Maybe it's just me, but I'd feel some resentment if my friend did something I've always wanted to do and I couldn't. Are there ways to minimize that?

Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance for any advice or stories you have!

**TDLR: I work in a very competitive industry that my best friend wants to join, but she's not taking my advice and frustrated that she's not doing well. How do I help? Or do I stop helping?**

I hate socializing and I’m so negative and unwilling to do anything now. I literally just gave up.

373,"I'm going to paste the story here since i already tried asking people for advice, i hope you guys dont mind.

 It was actually about a post i saw on the home page. It was from an officer who was muscular and he was doing pull ups while eating a donut, when i watched that, it felt like the video was a little sexual, the way he ate the donut etc.. when i read the comments, there was a girl who said 'am i the only one with a lady boner?' or something along those lines and another guy said something along the lines of 'im straight and even i thought it was sexual', someone else then replied that if you thought this was sexual, he 'had news for you'.

So i started to wonder if i was actually gay/bi, even though i don't think i am. I felt the compulsions to check, 'just to make sure', so i started to look at 'gay' images to see how i reacted to them and i didn't get aroused or anything. I don't really enjoy thinking about gay things (im not a homophobe either) and i don't think i was ever in love or attracted to another guy, though i do think that sometimes a guy can look good. This same thing happened to me in the past about a year ago, where i had this moment where i suddenly thought i was gay and i did the exact things, looking for confirmation, 'checking myself' etc.. and after that i was fine again, and now, when i read those comments, i felt a flashback, it was like i knew i was going to spiral back into these thoughts/compulsions. I've looked online as well and HOCD comes REALLY close to my experience atm, though i keep doubting everything.

I was wondering what you guys thought, do you think i am bi or do you think it's nothing?",28Jun2018,1

375,"I’ll get right to it, I’ve been in complete awe of this girl for over three years. She’s got everything I need. Her beauty and her personality make my heart beat at incredible rates. 

Her and I used to be extremely good friends.  We texted and spoke often, then she started dating my ‘friend’. She cut me off and we broke away for the duration of their relationship. He treated her like shit and obviously didn’t care for her. Why do girls always date assholes? It’s such a hard-to-answer question and it really boggles me. Anyways, a few weeks ago, she broke up with him - finally at the realization that he was an asshole and treated her like garbage. We began to hangout again in a group and I got my hopes up. I thought I’d finally have my chance. When she talked to me, it’s like I was in this whole different world. The voices and people around me were of little importance to me. She was extremely happy around me and touchy at times. The next time we hung out however, I found out her and my best friend had a thing. I still can’t understand it. I see no potential in their relationship. Either way, she continues to be talkative and enthusiastic around me, but it just depresses me. I know she’s going to date this guy and I’m going to be left without this girl again. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m in love with this girl. Actually, I know I’m in love with her, and I want her to feel the same about me. What do I do? Do I confess to her and risk a tense relationship with my best friend? Or do I wait it out for another few years feeling alone? ",28Jun2018,1

377,"So I live in a pretty new house that is about 10 years old with a finished basement. I spend a lot of my time down there, often watching tv for multiple hours a day. However, lately I have been noticing the air seems a lot thicker. It feels as if I’m breathing in a lot of particulates and possibly some form of asbestos. It was tolerable but recently I have been noticing that if I spend more than an hour down there my lungs start to hurt and breathing becomes harder. In addition, my throat is constantly hurting, and I suspect my basement is at fault.

381,"Hi everyone,
My father is a recently retired man who has been traveling a lot lately but seems to be going to one place in particular, the Philippines. I've been suspecting something was up until now but never had any concrete proof.

Today I was at home but I slept it until very late so I assume my dad didn't think I was still home. He kept playing some voice messages from facebook today that sounded like a girl and I heard this so I was pretty confused. I went downstairs but made some noise so that my dad would be able to know I'm home because honestly I didn't want any part of this and wanted not to believe it.

The woman on the message kept asking about how he's going to explain to his family and that he will be in great trouble with his wife. She also kept asking for allowance to which he replied he won't be sending to her anymore. Fast-forward an hour or two of sitting through these types of messages every couple minutes my dad left to go somewhere in the car.

I know this may be unethical but he left his computer on so I decided to see if his facebook was logged into as he ALWAYS has it locked on everything. That's when I realize that he HAS been cheating and sending an allowance to a Filipino woman for many months now, which I took picture of so I can keep as proof for another time. There's also statements her saying how they won't date anymore and how she's cheating with another man. She also talked about what he will do about his son (me) and his wife to which he didn't answer.

I don't know what to do but I'm going to talk to my mom about this tonight and show her some of the pictures. I'm very insulted because my father treats me like shit and can't even pretend to respect or care about me but is able to do this so easily. I'm asking for advice because I don't want to make a mistake due to my anger. Hope everything makes sense, I can't think properly but I tried my best to describe everything.",28Jun2018,3
382,"Hello everyone,

So about a year and a half, I stopped drinking. I never really enjoyed alcohol so I just thought I might as well stop. And since nightclubs are extra lame sober, I stopped going there, too. Just not my thing. However, what I did enjoy was the one night stands and the fun with random strangers, which I feel is something you can only do when both parties get drunk. But that might have just been the people I partied with.

The other problem is that while you remain sober, others don't. When I go to a bar with my friends and chat up a girl, by the end of the evening when we're ready to go home, most are usually drunk. And in my opinion, sex with someone drunker than you is a no-no. They can't give consent and I feel like I'm taking advantage of them. 

So, how can I hook up like I use to under these circumstances? I do miss the no strings attached occasional fun.",28Jun2018,2

I need help deciding where to go my first year of college!
I just graduated high school, and I’m going to nursing school this fall. I was accepted to a local nursing program (college a) and they gave me enough scholarships that I will only pay $8k a year. I live near NYC and can get a great nursing assistant job somewhere in the city! It’s a decent program, but it doesn’t matter where you go to nursing school undergraduate. I like it there, but I turned down the offer.
I was accepted to one of my favorite schools (college b), one of the best nursing schools in the country, it’s in Boston and the nursing classes are in the best hospitals in the world. Problem is it’s 5 hours away, and about $50k a year with my scholarships. I have been nervous about moving away.
Both schools have same job placement and salaries out of school because it’s nursing lol everyone wants to hire you.
I called College A, they said they still have a seat for me and the scholarships.
I wanna care for my father, he’s my best friend. And when it’s coming close to the end of his life I will stay home for him. I just do not know when that’s coming yet. I know that no matter where I go to school, I will do great. I wanna get out of my shitty town but I can do that when my dad is better or passes. I just don’t know where I will be happier. I will be happy away at college b but I’ll cry every day away from my dad and live with guilt the rest of my life. He will be happy to see me go to Boston but he’s gonna have a hard time just getting to his daily radiation because he can’t drive anymore. I also honestly think me being around will help him. We are a dynamic duo guys we do everything together. It’s really expensive too though. At College A I’ll have to be stuck in this shitty town but I’ll be with my dad and I’ll be able to afford living on campus still so I can have the “college experience” and still take care of my dad. I won’t be around like minded people or feel challenged though. I know test scores aren’t everything, but they ask for a 21 on the ACT and I got a 33. I was really looking forward to pushing myself. For nursing school, your undergrad isn’t too important. I just know I’ll have some amazing opportunities and experiences at college B.

389,"Hi, everybody. 

I'm an 19 year old girl. I've always been turned on by forced sex and incest. I engage a little in BDSM, namely in incestuous parts of it. But my partner is not really captivated by the idea, so it's on ""low"". I also have a boyfriend who's not largely into these things.

Was brought up in a toxic family with dysfunctional patterns. I am being treated for different types of personality disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, psychoses, mood disorders (I assume my PDs can be mistaked for this) and OCD (maybe this goes under something else; I'm not sure).

I am outwardly high-functioning.

My therapists have always considered me a child of both physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect, even though their definitions of or borders where it no longer counts as *physical* and *sexual abuse* aren't aligned with mine. We don't talk much about my parents or past, mostly just focus on my eating patterns (because they affect my personality disorders, which affect my general patterns in life negatively, so we have to start somewhere), and they recommend me that I go to the center for child abuse when I end therapy at theirs, which might take many years, because you cannot be connected to both the psychiatry and aforementioned center.

Still, I'd like to hear some constructive views and get advice from others, either people who don't struggle with is and can offer some rational thoughts (please, don't judge, but share your thoughts in a constructive way); people who have struggled with it in the past; or people who are going through it like me on how to deal with the incestuous thoughts in a positive, mindful way.

This type of incestuous fantasies are separated from the BDSM, in which I, sometimes, have more or less of a ""father figure"". I get almost uncontrollable urges and they are set on my father, my mother, my stepfather, my sister, and my future children. I feel almost taken over by the lust and I feel so slutty and get very scared that I give in. Because I know it would follow me for the rest of my life. Usually, I am opposed to the thought of being humiliated, degraded, hit, and a few other things, that show up when I think about real incest. It's like my entire life purpose changes in an instant and, in that moment, I feel so lured by it. My orgasms are greater here and the only way I can cum is by watching forced, incestuous \[legal\] porn while grinding on a teddy bear I got when I was 2 years old and identifying with the porn. I started masturbating this way when I was a tween, exactly in this way.

Like I said, I obviously don't want this because I know it would affect my life in a bad way and I think it would become a pattern. Needless to say that, even though I am still young, it affects my thoughts about becoming a parent as well.

Can anyone offer some insight or advice on how to deal with this? I'm pretty scared of what I might do. I moved out 2,5 years ago but might stay with them for a few months next year while I'm between countries.",28Jun2018,2

392,"Hello! I will try to keep it short and simple; I am sure you know of the economic crisis in Venezuela. **I DON'T COME TO THIS SUB ASKING FOR MONEY.**

I have been homeless since October of 2017. I currently reside in a Christian shelter for women drug addicts (they made an exception for me and a few others who, while not being drug addicted, are homeless). While I am grateful for the roof over my head, they believe mental illnesses are caused by demons, and so are homosexuality and drug addiction. This is a dangerous place for me to be in. They do not let me leave the compound for work or to go to college; I can't rebuild my life like this. They also do not let me seek professional treatment for my bipolarity.

I know of friends that have left the country with outside help, and often I hear stories of people on the street who receive donations from friends from other countries. The most common method is through PayPal. However, to have a Paypal I'd need a bank account in a USA bank. As a poor Venezuelan that has never even left the country, I do not have one.

I've reached fellow Venezuelans in social media, included Reddit, and they have been either unhelpful or downright hateful toward me. The Government programs have been of no help. There's no private organization around to ask for help (which is why I am highly suspicious, and you should be to, of alleged charities that claim to help Venezuelan people in this humanitarian crisis).

**I come to this sub in the hopes that some reddits users can offer an alternative to Paypal for me.** I will be asking to donations and I don't know how people can reach me, send medication, clothes, money, hygiene articles (toothpaste, soap, shampoo...), whatever they want and is in their possibilities to donate to me. I've heard DHL is good, but I don't want to burden people with the cost of sending the packages; I assume they are expenssive.

Please, help me. I want to gain some sort of economic stability before I attempt to leave the country. The situation is highly unstable, prices rise from one day to the next, minimun wage is not enough to buy food for a week and even less for rent, there are no jobs, professors and doctors are fleeing the country, it's is virtually impossible to get a passport and the documents necessary to safely emigrate to another country without paying exorbitant amounts of money.

399,"I've been experiencing a lull so to speak. A definite lack of drive when it comes to pursuing a meaningful relationship with a potential significant other...

I get this feeling that I don't want to inconvenience anyone else...  Like I'm not sure what benefit I may bring to someone elses life. I have been in relationships in the past with the last one ending about a year ago. She was much younger, the youngest I have dated, and it she was just about to go to university after working for a while. I felt excited for her remembing my time in university. I didn't want to be a burden but felt like she would be better off being single. That may be the beginning of the feeling but it could go further back.

This is a couple relationships back now to what I word describe as my most meaningful relationship to date. We had met abroad and dated for two years, I will call her J. She was a year older which I've learned I feel more comfortable with (vs. a SO being younger) there was a moment where I had to switch jobs and where I was living and felt constrained when I was forced to choose between visiting her and looking for a job that would allow me to continue living abroad and graduate my master on time. I kept catching flak from her for needing to focus on the job search over her and called for a momintary break while I figured things out. In that time an old friend of mine had come to visit and some things happened between us. Nothing serious but more of an infatuation. J and I got back together after I found a job and everything was back to the way it was - incredible, hands down the most meaningful relationship I've been in. J learned about the visit from my friend during our break and that did not go over well... It put a sour flavor on our relationship but we stayed together and, together with the constrain during the job search, it was just known as something that had happened - we got over it. At the time I did not feel guilty in the slightest. I had to move back home to finish my master studies and we kept in touch but grew apart more and more. We met up once again back in Europe but for her it was over. Looking back at the meeting with my old friend I feel more and more guilt as time passes. Was it wrong to do. In the moment it didn't seem that way. 

We have since moved on but I keep coming back to the thought of what if. Maybe I'm building it up too much in my head as an ideal that actually wasn't?

Present.
Back to this feeling. Like I don't want to inconvenience anyone. That feeling is paralelled by this tempered feeling I have towards ""love"" or what I feel I have experienced to be love so far in my life with a significant other. That is, now that I have experienced it, I know it's something that cannot be rushed. And I'm not in a rush. I am still searching. But while there have been some opportunities and I am still open to finding another love I'm not as quick to just try and test have fun. There is this real seriousness to it all now...

I've never had an actual, steady job, so I have no real work experience to build off of. While my parents are fine with me living at home for a couple years while I get my feet wet and become more independent, I still need a way to support myself and not be a total burden on my parents. I've been starting to look for part time work just so I can have a small income and also have time to pursue my film career and other interests, but I'll be honest, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. I'm starting to feel a lot of pressure from my mom who desperately wants me to find work and things have just been very sad and confusing lately. If anyone can give me some pointers on how I can find a small, part time job without any work experience I would greatly appreciate it. I live in Ohio if that helps.",28Jun2018,2

405,"My grandfather passed away 8 years ago. 

Since then, I haven't been able to relax or be happy, and I've constantly been fearing my other relatives' deaths.

Here are some concrete examples to illustrate:

I've tried getting a massage, multiple times. I couldn't sit/lay still without having a massive influx of thoughts like: ""I shouldn't be doing this. How can I be relaxing when I have work to do. How can I be enjoying myself when my siblings aren't. My grandfather is dead and I dare enjoy myself.""

I graduated college, but I couldn't really be excited. I was ""relieved"" at most, but I couldn't enjoy it. In my head, I would think to myself: ""My grandfather isn't enjoying this with me. How dare I enjoy this when my grandfather is dead and can't share this moment with me."". 

Every time I drive, I try to never take any sibling (or anyone with me). I've been driving almost everyday for the past decade, without any tickets, without any accidents, etc., yet I can't bring myself to have a passenger. Every single move that I do while driving, I imagine that exact scenario with an accident and my passenger dying..and I keep replaying that scene in my head thinking ""imagine if that would have happened, my god did I dodge a bullet"".

I'm not in depression, but it's as though my maximum potential ""happiness"" on the ""happiness scale"" has gone down. I just can't get excited about anything anymore.

I'm planning on having children and I already know that I won't be able to be happy. I'll probably think ""how dare I rejoice and my grandfather isn't here enjoying this moment with me"".

It's as though I don't feel like I have the right to enjoy something without my grandfather having been here with me.

I don't want to take pills and I don't want to see a psychologist/whatever they're called. I just want to fix myself, but I need help.",28Jun2018,2
406,"So I will try and keep this brief but there are a lot of important details. Sorry if it is too much

The story starts with the start of a new school semester. My classes aren’t really what i hoped they would be so I change classes. End up having 5/8 classes with this girl that we will call Becky

Becky is a pretty cool girl ( she plays a lot of the games i like, we both really like Rush (fellow Rush fans will know how hard it can be to find a girl that actually likes rush) and just share a lot of interests) and since we have a lot of classes together we talk somewhat. As the year goes on we talk more and more. She talks a lot about her boyfriend (ex now) which i don’t really mind.

Her boyfriend kinda joins my friend group and so does she. 

It goes pretty well until the day she finds out that he was cheating on her with some like five other girls. She like screams at him in front of everybody and seems mad. I see her next class so i ask her about it and she starts to go off about how much of a scumbag he is. So that day can be like marked as the day we really started to talk

So about a week goes by until the day where i get an instagram dm from her. You could say she slid into my dms and she eventually asked if i wanted to hang out more and be her bf. I thought she was moving a little too fast from relationship to relationship, but she seemed like she really likes me and I said yeah.

We would spend a lot of time together in school and then for like 6-7 hours straight after. I kept wanting to like do things out of school, but she couldn’t. Other than that is was going really well. I was happy and she seemed too.

Now i will introduce you to Evan. He was been a friend of mine for about a year. He has had a lot of asshole moments but for some reason i brushed them off. He always seemed to have something out for me, i just never could figure out why.  My friends are pretty sure that he has mental issues as he can get pretty emo sometimes. He is also know for manipulating people. Anyway during this time he had about like 5 different girlfriends in 6 months and had just been dumped by one for the first time. He gave Becky my instagram so i knew that they had talked at least like once before. But like overall he doesn’t really care about anybody except himself

Now Becky sort of new a couple of my friends from her ex. She would ask them what i liked and like how i was doing. I thought that like meant she really cared about me . 

So flash forward a week and its like halloween time. She is making her costume and we are chating over snapchat. Anyway halloween is on like a Monday or something so i see her before. I could not go because i had made previous family commitments . So we all ways meet up at lunch, but today she wanted to meet up with some of her friends. I know how important friends can be so i was pretty cool with it( plus i knew a couple of them and they seemed cool). So she comes over towards the end and we are talking about her costume. Then suddenly Evan comes over and joins the conversation. Apparently she was also showing him what the costume looked like. I thought this was fishy and when i asked her about it she said how he messaged her first and that she would never do anything to hurt me

On Halloween Evan had just gotten dumped and was getting really sad ( which is understandable). My friends tried to reach out to him, but he just kept distancing himself away from us. 

My birthday was coming up and it seemed like everything was really going good.

Suddenly two days before my birthday i get a message from her saying how she doesn’t want to be together anymore. This was just out of nowhere as like a couple of minutes ago she was  just saying how happy she is. 

I was just kinda shocked and didn’t know what to say. I just panicked and said okay, and that was it. That night i just couldn’t sleep, something was up.

The next day i tell my friends and one of them said how that day they saw Evan and Becky together and they were getting pretty close to each other. 

I really don’t like fighting with people and i just felt that the best thing to do was to just block them on all social media. 

During this time she asked my friends if i was mad and i told them that i was more mad at Evan than i was at her( which is true). She said how Evan told her that i wanted to fight them. This is not true, i never said that at all. I told them to say how he should know what he did and why i was mad. She responded with oh Evan would never do that to anyone to which i responded with all the asshole things he had done to us. She asked him about it and he said that none of it was true and that we are all liars. I just tried to cut them out of my life

Over about 4-6 weeks I convinced myself that what ever i thought happened before was wrong  and that all of that was just a coincidence. Eventually Becky asked me herself if i was mad at them and i said how i was mad at Evan. She responded with the same “ Oh my Evan would never hurt anyone”. I tried to ask her what happened but she avoided the question 

This whole thing happened a while ago and i have just been avoiding it until now. It has also made me more and more angry overtime. I don’t mean to dwell on the past its just that it bugs me now more than ever.

 Also recently Evan has been even more of a dick. I want to just confront him and just show him how much of an asshole he has been, but i am afraid due to his mental issues he will try and do self harm.

I am just looking for anyone who has been in a similar situation or not, just any advice you have would help a lot.  

TL;DR: I am 99% sure a good friend of mine encouraged my gf to break up with me so he could then date her.

410,"When it comes to love and relationships, it is hard for me to grasp and understand. I feel like they are too complicated and I don’t know what I really want. There are some days when I dream of getting married someday and there are days it is better off being single for the rest of my life. I am tired of holding on expectations of people and getting hurt because of the expectations that I put upon people. I am tired of the expectations that I put upon myself.

When it came to dating, I was always insecure that I have never been in a serious relationship. A lot of times I feel like guys just dismiss me because of this without getting to really know me. And it just leaves me with either the weird ones or the ones that I am lucky to find, but I am just not right enough for them. And now I am in medical school and I don't have time to date new people. I am afraid that I will become a person that will be so undatetable because I won't have that much experience in doing it.

415,"So, long story short I’m 22 years old and all of my life I’ve been coddled. My parents have been divorced since I was 7. When I wouldn’t get along with one, I’d move in with the other. At 22 I’m still doing the same thing. 

I’ve never been able to hold a job for longer than a few months and I’m very prone to falling into very depressive episodes. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 when I was 19. I have never continued medical  treatment. 

My dad was my best friend growing up. We aren’t close anymore. I live with him, but he’s very sick and dying. And we’ve been non stop fighting. 

Yesterday evening during an argument he said to me “I don’t get it. I don’t know what’s wrong with you. You’ve never been able to grow up.” He said, “You’re 22 f*cking  years old and you’re still living in my f*cking  House. When are you getting the f*ck out”  he told me I’m inconsiderate, I only think about myself and that because he’s dying, he thinks it’s time to right a few wrongs. He went on to admit that he’s the reason I have victim mentality. 

I want to say that before this argument I didn’t think I played the victim. It wasn’t until he yelled at me, that it sunk in and has stuck with me. I blame all of my bad outcomes on other people and situations. I’m constantly negative. I assume things all of the time and I have a “that’s not fair” mentality. I always mistrust people and assume that they hate me and have bad intentions for me that way if something bad does happens I can just blame them. 

I know you might be thinking well just change? But the thing is I’ve been like this my entire life. And I’ve been trying to change my thinking. I’m constantly on edge my child like view of the world has me feeling like a victim 24/7. I’m always comparing myself to others. I have extremely low self esteem. I always make unrelated events intangible. Say, my ex boyfriend left me, and I just lost my job, I’d think they both have to do with each other when they don’t. 

I have constant negative thoughts going through my mind at any given moment and This has caused me to become extremely sensitive to everything. I get stressed and angered more easily than others and I always move more  slowly and take longer to understand simple things because my mind is stuck on thinking everything is a challenge and hard and *against* me. 

I don’t know how to grow up. I don’t know how to be alone. I do not know how to stop playing the victim of every situation so that I can finally enjoy my life. ",28Jun2018,2

418,"How it is:
Im a mid-twenties lady, and currently after a bout of bad luck I am living at my moms house with my younger sister and her newborn. This has been the case for about 6 months, and the time is approaching to make a decision on how to move forward. My mother has very specific wants for how I should move out, but I am aware of and trying to consider other possibly better options. 

I do not have a vehicle but I do have a valid license, I have very poor credit, but I have a savings of about $3,000 and at the moment two jobs. One is a 9-5 office job with benefits where I make about $1200 per month after taxes, the other is a work from home that I have been averaging about 15hours/$150 a week at. Also dog. 

The choices:

1: 
(this is what my mom wants) Use my savings to put down on a vehicle and move into a rental property that my coworker owns. This sounded fine, until I realized my credit is so poor that I have basically no chance at getting financed. I've been all over, and it's become clear I'm either buying a used car outright for $3k or less, or no car. She doesn't want to accept that though for some reason. Also my coworkers property, while ideal in every way, is at the very edge of what I can afford. Living there will be a struggle, and not possible without a vehicle considering it's distance from my job. As much as I love the property, I'm leaning far away from this because it feels unsustainable. What good is spending everything on a nice place if I'm under constant stress over how I'll keep affording it? And if I can't find a car, I'll be stuck asking for rides. This is way out in the country, there will be no walking or even biking. I just don't think it's a good idea, but I'm feeling pressured.


Option 2:
There's a trailer park 3 miles from my job, that I could safely commute by bike to my job and to all the places in town I might need to go. The grocery store, city hall, etc. Etc. It's a bit run down, and not the best people live there, but I've lived in worse places and been fine so I don't think it's such a big deal honestly. Tiny yard, so no puppy running free like he's used to, only leash walks, which will suck. But it's sooo in my pice range and it has all the appliances and air conditioning and reasonable move in fees. And my mom tells me I wouldn't be physically capable of commuting by bike, but it's 3 fucking miles and I'm a healthy 25 year old who exercises 3 times a week so I think she might be insane. The route is also completely flat with no hills so come the fuck on. I could live alone, I could get a kitty, I could know that if I lost my office job that my side job would be able to cover my bills if I just put more time in it which is crazy security the likes of which I've never imagined. I think that's all my points, but I'm leaning for this one.

Option 3:
A friend of mine in a nearby city is in need of a roommate. He is about 5 years younger than me, which fair or not rings ""undependable"" bells in my head when considering him as a roommate, and has a decent job and all that, just can't afford the rent on his own since his roommate is moving to another state. We have worked together, and he always displays awesome work ethic and even temperedness. We get along super well and hold many of the same interests and tastes. But in order to do this I would have to quit my office job thus losing my health insurance, then either entirely depend on my work from home job, which is doable but makes me nervous, or try to find something in the city and take public transport or lyft/uber/taxi whatever, also doable as long as it's $15 hourly or more, which ~I think I can do with my history of work. But it's all kind of a gamble. And in the event that anything goes wrong, I'd have little in the way of a plan b.  It's not that I don't trust him, but it's giving me hardcore flashbacks to a bad roommate experience I rushed into with a formerly close friend. Also there's the slight concern of, ""is he gonna try to fuck me or something? Because no."" WhT if that happens? What if I give him the benefit of the doubt, then I'm out there, and then shit goes down and I'm like nah, and then he's like ""well get out then"". I don't have a reason to believe he's this type of person at all, but you just never know and I've been screwed over many other times. So I don't know if I'm overly distrust in or just being realistic.



So those are the options. The first two would have me out sept. 1, although idk about the first one even being viable at all, and the third would have me moving august 1st. 

I'm just not sure what to do. I've lived with others and I've lived alone, and they both have their issues. I'm not sure which I prefer, I feel like he and I would mesh well as long as it never got weird/sexual and it would be nice to have someone else around because living alone caaaaan be lonely SOMETIMES, but I also know I'm okay with being alone for the most part. Another not would be that while my office job is  pretty comfortable and low stress itself and I'm unlikely to ever be fired for anything other than the company not doing well, and it seems to be on the upswing after some hard times, and I love my boss. She's awesome. But my mother also works there, in a position of authority but in a different department. I have issues like, her repeating personal things about me to all of our coworkers which is humiliating for me, and she also hates my boss and constantly fights with her which is unpleasant of course. My boss is just trying to do her job properly, and my mom is a dick head who has an unexplainable personal vendetta against her and flat out refuses to cooperate with tandard fucking pocedure! So I can never really shake this feeling that ""she got me this job so nothing I do here counts as my own accomplishment"" and also ""all of my coworkers have been told in graphic detail about personal and bad things in my life all coloured in the ""I'm the perfect long suffering mother of idiots"" light, that I'd rather they not know"""". And also I've been there three years, laid off twice for short times bec the company was doing poorly, and never been given a raise although I started in a ""we are training you then you get the real pay"" position, did the fuck out of that, and have taken on additional responsibilities. Just. Meh. I kinda would like to just go. But I'm paranoid that things with my friend wouldn't go well and I'd be super screwed. 

What would you do if you were me, given this information?
