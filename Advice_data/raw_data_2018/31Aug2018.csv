0,"This is long I apologize: 

Just started my second year at university. My family is super poor so I was lucky enough to get grants and things so the only loans I have are ""small"" loans for textbooks. I have severe social anxiety so I can't speak in class or to most people at all. I'm slightly agoraphobic. I shake and get tunnel vision and get really nervous when I have to present or talk to my professors or anyone important. My parents are a burden and are both ill and I have to help them financially. I usually have no money, I work overnight (3rd shift)  every other day, I have zero friends (literally none) and I have never had a boyfriend or dated or anything (I'm 21). I get depressed and am generally really lonely. I am awful at math and I was thinking of getting a degree in business or HR but I can't even understand pre-algebra &amp; the degree requires like two more math classes that are stats and something else. 
Also I take zoloft and saw a therapist all year last year, and she did not help me much. 

What do I do? I thought going to college would help me overcome my anxiety and help me make friends but nobody tries to make friends with me and my anxiety is worse than ever. I'm also really sick of my parents and being broke all the time.  Ugh man.

1,I'm starting my sophomore year at a big college and I have felt starting the year off that it just isn't the place for me. I feel completely alone and that I can't push myself to do anything productive as a result of this loneliess.  The other option I'm considering is going to a smaller school closer to my hometown where I have friends that push me to make myself better every day. The thing holding me back from moving is thinking about what the future me would think about the decision. Is it worth staying in a place I don't feel good everyday to probably have more opportunities going after college or being in a place I feel comfortable now and make myself a better person for the future. ,31Aug2018,1
2,"I am writing on behalf of my mom. My mom (Martha) really DOESN'T want to attend her niece's (by marriage) wedding. The bride, Krista, age 28, has been rude to my mom in her adult years. For example, my mom recently gave her a $30 gift and the Krista snatched it out of my mom's hands and didn't say thank you. Krista is kind of bitchy in general. 
My mom REALLY doesn't want to attend this wedding, but she already committed to it (she RSVP'd yes), and is helping her sister in law with some of the minor logistics. My mom already bought her flight from AZ to the midwest (it's refundable), and booked the hotel. 
What is a really good excuse (better than a stomach flu) for her to get out of going to the wedding? How can she duck the fuck out? I appreciate your advice in advance. 
P.S. I don't want to go to Krista's wedding either but I am not as opposed to going as my mom is.",31Aug2018,1
3,"Hey thanks for helping out. I moved into a new apartment a week ago, and every day I've heard neighbors fighting. Screaming things and loud thumps and wailing. I would call the police, but I can't figure out for the life of me what apartment they're in! I'll be talking to the landlord tomorrow, I figured it wouldn't hurt to mention while I dropped off my rent check. Should I just hope someone else reports it? Can I do anything even if I can't tell which neighbor it is?

4,"Okay.. so a few months ago, at the beginning of summer, like Mid June, my friend randomly face timed me asking for money ($1540). She gave a very vague explanation as to why she urgently needed that money so bad. And so like the nice friend I am, I gave it to her, under the impression that she’d be returning $600 because that’s the agreement we made. 

Usually when I lend people money I don’t expect anything in return, I only give out of my overflow so that I don’t have to count on people paying me back.. but she rly (seemed like) she needed it.. so I pretty much picked up shifts and gave it all to her.  

But I haven’t heard from her ever since I gave her the money.. she transferred schools and just left me hanging. This might not seem like a lot of money to some of you, but as a young student that was a lot. I haven’t messaged her about it, and now I’m wondering if I should just let the whole situation slide and act as if it didn’t happen",31Aug2018,1
6,"I apologise if this is a bit scattered, but im pretty scattered. I've been my partner ""John"" just under 5 years. He is amazing, we get along so well and he genuinely makes me feel happier than I thought possible. We have a unusual living situation and have been travelling full time in a campervan for the past year. It has been tougher than i expected as john has struggled not having a job. I work from the van to fund the trip, he drives and takes care of van maintenance. This trip was partly to see the world as well as to give John sometime to figure himself out. He hasnt been satisfied in his job and we set off with the idea that he could use this free time to learn new skills/study. 

An overview of our relationship is that 95 percent of John is amazing, and 5 percent is really really tough to deal with. We have really been through it in terms of John acting in ways that have been unacceptable. From sexual assualts, to lies, hiding things and taking things further with women than he should. As well as setting unrealistic double standards, and some manipulative behaviour when he gets caught out doing the wrong thing. Because he makes me so happy and it is a rare occurence that these issues happen i have tried my best to move on and grow as ive always believed we are strong enough to make it. A lot of these issues subsided when we moved into the campervan, i took this as an improvement on Johns part. But in reality i think it might be because were not living in a standard living situation and we spend all our time together. Its lessened the amount he drinks to bare minimum and the root cause of his past mistakes have been closely linked to the amount of booze he has consumed. 

We went on a trip to meet his family and friends as they live overseas. The first part was amazing and i was so full of love, i felt closer to him as i was seeing where he came from and what has shaped him into the man he is now. One day when we were out with his friends, one of his friends ""jess"" made a comment about how shitfaced they were last time he was in home town without me. This made my ears prick up. A week before he left was the first time he assaulted me. His way to rectify this was to promise not to drink. I was prettty clear and said i didnt need promises, especially if there was a chance he could break them and that i was i no way giving him an ultimatium - he could do what he wanted. 
After his friends left i brought up the convo and after dragging it out of him he did get shitfaced, did some drugs and stayed at a female friends house and not hia dads like he had said. I was pretty devastated, i knew he had been friends with this woman for years and never saw her as a threat, im also not the type of person that would get angry at him for letting off sone steam (he was overseas for a funeral so it was a really tough time for him) so the fact he hid it made me question what really happened
On top of that he mesaged his friends to let them know i didnt know where he stayed and to not tell me. Mind you this was a few years ago. 

At first i was livid, absolutely fuming. I thought we were past this stage, and after so long of not lying i thought he would have learnt his lesson. 

Now im lost, im in his country on my own as i dont want to stay with his parents and i need some space to think. He says all these issues are based on a mental health problem he hadnt noticed until recently. Part of me wants to be there and support him, i have had mental health issues my whole life and know how hard it is to become aware that you have to work on yourself. That being said i have tried so hard to help him, from motivating to helping him try and organise himself, countless conversations. He has been to therapy once after countless years of trying to find a happy balance between motivating and not too pushy. 

I guess im lost cause ive repressed a lot of my anger. He hasnt made things easy for me and the effort he puts in, in areas that need work are no where near where they should be. He helps in every other way than the ways i ask for help (for example hell cook dinner and do his beest to help me with my work, but he wont make a plan or stick to a plan to work on his mental health.) 
Theres a few things that i cant decipher. I cant figure out if these personality traits are manipulative or genuine behaviour of someone in a tough mental state: 
- when he makes a mistake, he gets sok upset to the point of hitting himself. Everytime he does this i have to console him and the focus quickly changes to him and making sure hes okay, i think this is why ive forgiven behaviour i didnt think i would.
- he is convinced he never realised that he had any mental health issues and that he blocks everything out. Ive had my fair share of issues and i know there was a time i thought i was okay when i wasnt, but i woke up one day and i work on it everyday to be the best i can and not let myself act in a way that affects others. He compliments me on this quite often, but never drawn the paralell that he needs to address his own issues. 

- I find it hard to not feel guilt about our situation cause i know he needs help. I have pushed, consoled, brainstormed, listened, advised. I mean ive really fucking tried. I was alone when i realised i had mental health issues that i needed to work on, so ive done everything in my power to be as supportive as i can so he doesnt feel alone. The guilt comes from feeling like it shouldve come sooner, hes making all the promises now but thats only because i caught him a lie. The 5% of him that acts this way is very reactive, so its hard to know what hes saying thats true and whats being said to convince me its true when it isnt. 

- he treats me in 2 ways. He either places me on a giant pedastool. Examples: we only do what i want, hell never push for anything he wants let alone mention it. Everything has to be signed off by me in case he gets it wrong. It baffles me! He can want something for dinner but wont feel like he can get it until i convince him i want it. 
The second way is like im less than. He can do what he wants without thinking of the impact of his actions: stay out all hours without just letting me know hes okay, being very touchy with women, spending time with friends of the opposite sex. But he would be so visibly uncomfortable if i was to do any of those things as well as said that he wouldnt like it. For example the lie he told about staying at jess's house was because he thought i would feel like i could stay at a male friends house if i knew and he didnt want that to happen. 

Since im in another country ive booked a hotel for the rest of the trip. Every time he hurts me i forgive so quickly as he seems so sad and remorseful - but its been building up all this hurt and resentment. 
How do i know if these issues are genuine signs of an bigger issue he needs to work on (granted he shouldve been more self aware of how his actiona effect others a lot sooner). Or something he shouldve addressed earlier and its not acceptable behaviour - point blank. 

I flip from thinking is best if i leave now before it gets toxic - im unsure if i can move past how much ive been hurt and i
dont want to turn into someone im not. I then start thinking that we can make it through everything and his good 95% makes up for the not so good 5%, and if i throw it away and he cleans up his act ill be devastated i didnt stick around to be apart of it 

Help reddit! 

Tldr: boyfriend with history of lying/unfavourable behaviour got caught in a lie again. I thought we had moved past this but he claims its a underlying mental health issue he needs to work on. Do i stick with him while he works on it or is it too far gone?

10,"So i’ve been thinking alot lately and am thinking about cutting ties with one single good friend and reignite friendships with old friends i’ve grown apart from about 7 years ago. 

The question is, how.

Backstory:
My one single good friend
We’ve been friends for about 11 years now and for the last couple of years it’s always me who’s trying to make plans and do things together, never him. 
We used to chat alot through whatsapp and facetime Lately when i send him a message it’s like ‘oh yeah you’re still alive aswell’. And for example when he get’s a new girlfriend there is no communication for at least 2 months. ( it’s always me initiating conversations) 
Don’t get me wrong, i know when people get into relationships they don’t have as much time to make plans with yours truly but a few beers shouldn’t be an issue once a month right?
We go out to 2 festivals a year but that’s it ( we hung out more before but the last 2 years it’s just been these festivals)

- also we used to have deeper conversations but he doesn’t tell me anything anymore. For example last month he got a new girlfriend and i had to hear from my dad who saw them in the city together. I’d be fucking extatic if i entered a new relationship and would’ve invited him over for a beer and update eachother about life. 

My old friends
We stopped hanging out so much because they had to repeat a year in high school and i advanced and couldn’t hang out much with them. I have a whatsapp group with 2 of those friends and i see them grabbing drinks together occasionally and going to events and stuff which i’d like to join aswell. ( one of the friends girlfriend is an active member of social media)
A couple of years ago we started working together at the same supermarket and we went out on a yearly team event after which we went out, so the two friends and the girlfriend and 4 other friends of them. Ar the end of the evening all 4 of their friends told me they didn’t expect to have so much fun with me. 
Every time i talk to these friends, seperate or together we think about the good old times and how good of a friendship we had. One of the guys’ girlfriends actually enjoys my company too, thinks i’m fun to hang out with. 

I really miss these guys. They are top of the line people and i would love them to be a bigger part of my life and vice versa. 

I want friends that don’t hide things from me, i want friends that aren’t afraid to open up to me because i don’t judge and love to help.


Should i cut ties with friend 1?
And how do i reignite the friendship i had with these 2 fine fellas?",31Aug2018,1
12,"So here’s the situation. I was hired a year ago into a company, starting part time then moving to full time within the first two months. I was told that after a specific period of time I would be offered their benefits plan, and didn’t really think much about it after that. 

The accountant brought it up a few months saying she’d be going over the benefits plan with me in August which is my year anniversary. During this time I had some help by my parents when getting medications and prescriptions, and looked into getting onto my boyfriend’s benefit plan.

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago. A new employee was hired and I heard the boss explaining to him that he’d get the benefits forms after three months. I questioned him about it and brought up that I was told I wasn’t eligible until August. After a few days, he came back to me and pulled me aside explaining that they had made a mistake and that I was supposed to be offered the plan probably around December. I explained that I had been getting help by my parents, but I had just gone through the process of going on my boyfriend’s plan and am waiting on getting a benefits card.

He then went on to say that there was a fine he would have to pay for not providing paperwork and getting me to sign either yes or no to going on our plan. He mentioned that if I was covered he could take my info and basically provide it under the pretences that they ‘forgot’ to send in the paperwork because I was going onto the company plan. I said I’d look into it, but basically dismissed him about it hoping that he would suck it up and pay the fine.

Today the accountant spoke with me and said that she will be meeting with my next week to ‘fill out’ the required form to show that I was presented the info on the benefits. I was hoping this would just be a standard form just documenting me rejecting the plan, but she asked me to bring my current benefits card.

Does this seem fishy to anyone else and should I be looking out for anything when I go into this meeting? I live in Canada if that makes a difference. Thank you all for any advice or pertinent info, maybe I shouldn't be worried at all but I'd rather be sure.",31Aug2018,1
13,"Throwaway account because I feel so stupid and embarrassed and scared.

I've been going through some tough times, and made some impulsive decisions, namely, signing up for dating and hookup sites, and even paying for some of them. It's been three days now and I feel guilty and embarrassed for doing this, so I started deleting all of these accounts and just accepting the losses that I paid for. One hookup site I paid for is called BeNaughty, and when I signed up for it, my credit card company contacted me because of suspected fraud. I authorized the payment. However, today, I guess a pending(?) charge was posted to my account because of the monthly subscription, so my credit card company flagged it and contacted me. I think it showed up as a different vendor name, so I declined the charge. I had to call my card company to confirm. They said that they noticed it was a similar service as the one I authorized two days ago, and I panicked and told them that I didn't recognize that transaction either. So they're likely going to do a charge-back for that transaction. I'm scared that I did something illegal. I lied about not authorizing a transaction when I actually did. I think the site might be a scam, but I'm not sure, and even if it is, I'm afraid that they're going to take legal action against me. I think it's too late to admit to my credit card company that I did in fact authorize the transaction, and they already cancelled my card and issued me a new one.

Ok so on the hookup site, I had to email them to remove my billing subscription, so I did, and I just got the confirmation that my subscription has been cancelled, and it looks like my account was successfully deleted as well. I hope that means that I'm in the clear?",31Aug2018,1

It worked for a while, but now the toilet still gets clogged even if I flush multiple times. Why are my shits getting so big lately? It's so annoying when I clog the toilet every other day. I didn't used to do this. My diet is a lot healthier than it used to be, and I haven't been eating any more food.

17,"I am 19 and my son is almost 4 months old.  His father is not in the picture and does not want to be.  I currently live on my own with my son.  I was awarded with a full ride scholarship to a school that doesn’t offer family housing.  I already have my associates but my desired career choice doesn’t hiring for anything less than a bachelors.

I’ve decided that I am going back to school so that I can be able to provide my son with the life and things he deserves.  I’ve worked something out with my his paternal grandmother to where I will move in with them and be able to attend a school nearby.  I would technically be living on campus and only able to come home on breaks and weekends.

I would retain custody and his grandmother would have temporary Power of Attorney while I am attending school.  We have basically worked everything out in case my ex tries to claim that I have abandoned our son and other things.

My family is very upset with me because they either feel that I am abandoning him to live my life or feel hurt that I didn’t ask him to take him.  I understand their hurt, but I don’t understand why they are saying that I am abandoning him.  I understand that I would be leaving him with her for almost a year, but I am not dropping him to simply go party or travel the world, if that makes any sense.

I’m just wanting to receive some insight as to why they are feeling like I am abandoning him when I am doing this so I can give him the life he deserves.",31Aug2018,1
18,"I work for a Fortune 500 company that’s going through major changes to stay competitive in the market (very reasonable). They are attempting to increase efficiency by consolidating and utilizing new technology (also very reasonable). However, they are a master of delivering negative news and convincing employees that it’s good news. The ole’ “piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining.” I’m only aware of what’s going on in my region, so I’m not speaking against the entire company. About a year ago, it was announced that my office is moving (42 miles away) and consolidating with 2 other offices. This was devastating to people that already commuted over an hour and the office was moving further away. This announcement came a couple months after they centralized a department in my company to my office and people already moved for that job. Since then, employees have been dropping like flies, leaving those behind having to make up the work. We’re being told we’re not receiving more work, but everyone is overwhelmed by the workload and we have fewer people doing the same work. On top of that, they influence us individually to believe that our performance is suffering. When I speak to coworkers they say they thought they were the only one, since it’s done in private. I have a solid rating and up until a couple months ago, been told I’m doing well. In the past year, they told us they are eliminating a subclass of positions, but will give them opportunities in other roles. They are moving people to positions they were previously considered unqualified for. My theory is they’re expecting them to fail so they can fire them for underperforming. They cut our lunch break from 1 hour to 45 minutes. This is by no means an issue itself. 45 minutes is still a reasonable break, but to have a benefit reduced when morale is already down seems like an intentional kick in the groin. Last week we had an office-wide presentation on how our pay bands are being restructured to stay competitive in the market (sounds like a good thing). It was asked if the market comparison considered workload and the response was, we may have a more thorough process, but in terms of quantity (of what we) it’s about the same. We are expected to do way more per (thing we do) than our competitors. So it seems like they’re planning to cut salaries. My theory is they won’t need as many employees down the road, so they are making the workplace difficult so people quit now instead of laying people off later. Layoffs include negative PR for the company and additional costs in severance pay. My coworkers who sit near my manager said she’s recently been saying, “we’re all going to get fired.”

Advice I’m looking for:
Can a claim be made for constructive discharge?
Do you advise that I attempt to form a union? If so, what’s the best way to go about it?

I understand:
Life sucks and many are in the same boat and I should “suck it up” or just leave. My complaint is not for myself, but for everyone who is being taken advantage of by their employer. I’m willing to put in time and money to make a difference for everyone, especially if it sets a precedence for workers in other companies to make a meaningful difference. Leaving because something is wrong is just running away and allowing it to continue. I want to stand up and fix what’s wrong. There will certainly be backlash from the company and I’d put my job on the line, but I’m single and young and am in a position to take a risk to help others.",31Aug2018,2

I don't even watch the hip Netflix shows or play video games, not because I wouldn't enjoy them, but because I'm to lazy to want to start, and it's not like I'm using that spare time for anything productive.

20,"There is a house a few down from me that I’m fairly sure is selling heroin.

Every time the person gets out of rehab, it’s only a matter of time before before the break ins start again, hypodermic needles and burnt tin foil begin littering the neighborhood.

Cars come and go constantly; all hours of the night.  They come by for as quick as 5 min or as long as a few hours.  We’ve caught customers shooting up in their cars.

Earlier in the year someone who lived at the residence died there of an overdose.  Earlier this week we had one of their customers get high as a kite, get in his car and nearly hit a house at 60mph (they hit the tree instead...no brakes, no attempt to swerve.)

Once a day, 3 laundry baskets of full of duct taped packages are delivered by the same guy in different cars to the house.  Just before 0730...right in front of my son’s bus stop.

Myself and 4 other neighbors have given times, description of activities, license plate numbers, and times to the local PD.  Zero fucks are given. County sheriff says it’s out of their jurisdiction; and tips to FBI and DEA have gone nowhere.  This has been going on for over 3 years, and not even one patrol car has passed by, no detective called just to gather more information. Nothing. The officer that came for the car wreck of one of their customers did not want to get bothered with the fact he had left a drug den not 200ft away from the accident.

I know I have called, emailed, and entered anonymous tips multiple times (7, I think), with our other neighbors doing about the same.

Moving would be ideal, but financially isn’t an option right now.

21,"I need to get this off my chest because it's been eating at me.

All in all, it looks like my life is pretty great. I'm in my late twenties and well-educated, I make an above average salary, people often say I'm one of the most physically attractive people they've met, my friends are fantastic, etc. That said, my life has not been without its problems. Growing up, I dealt with some trauma that led me to dislike life and fantasize about dying as a child. A congenital connective tissue disorder also created many problems for me, but it wasn't diagnosed until last year, so I never understood why I felt so physically and emotionally uncomfortable.

Basically, I never understood why anyone wanted to be alive because I never learned how to love life. Everything seemed so pointless. I've got diary entries from fourth grade wishing that I could somehow simply stop existing. I never actually attempted suicide because I had a severe fear of fucking up and living through it with major disabilities. It took having a complete nervous breakdown and hitting rock bottom to completely change my way of thinking.

Last year was the first time I understood why people want to be alive and fear death. This happened after I started meditating, reconnecting with friends, exploring my true passions. There are so many wonderful moments where even the simplest thing like my cat rubbing against my hand or a delicious cookie make me smile and feel genuinely good. I still have moments where I feel stressed out, but I generally don't think about dying anymore. And if I do, I remind myself that life is only temporary, so why not make the best out of it while I'm here? I don't need to hurry nature.

Here's where my current issue begins: I've been reading a lot about physical immortality (where the aging process is significantly delayed) and I'm completely terrified that it's going to be forced on me one day. Terrified to the point that it's making me incredibly anxious. While I'm OK with being alive for now, one thing that gets me through stressful times is remembering that none of this is permanent. But if I live an extra 100, 300, 500, or whatever years, it will all have a feeling of permanence. I like the idea of slowly fading away one day and either having a super trippy experience or enjoying a permanent nap. I don't need to know everything that happens hundreds of years from now. I don't need people to know who I am. I see the appeal of living, but what if I have to live for way too long? It makes me feel like I'm right back to square one, wondering how the hell I'm going to get through this.

How can I stop obsessing over this fear of physical immortality? It sounds stupid and I know that people will have a choice if physical immortality becomes a possibility that's accessible to us, but my worst fear is having to live forever.",31Aug2018,1

first of all I apologize for my poor grammar. English isnt my first language.


My boyfriend (of 6 months) just told me today that he has a “little crush” on someone. Now, I appreciate his honesty, but that made me incredibly uncomfortable. 

Im pretty sure its more than just looks, otherwise he wouldnt say it is a crush.

We’ve discussed this a bit and everything he really said was “Is it cheating?” 
I honestly cant know since I have no idea about the relationship between them, and id wanna dig deeper into that.
At the end I just said “It depends on you”, and i regret he fact that i have said nothing more.

But why do I think this way frequently? It's because I feel like the majority of people in this world act as sheep; just living in their little world with no direction and always living to make money that shouldn't matter. Why can't people just take a step back and see the world for what it is: Gang violence, rape, theft, murder, moonlight, sunlight, smiles, love, sound, taste, smell, experience, passion and happiness. But that's not how the world works.

Were we really created to serve others? Why does society think I'm the person to work for 40 hours a week for the next 40 years? Why does society think ANYONE should be working at all? Work, work, work...That is fucking stupid. You may say to work for myself? Nope, even more stress God never intended us to accumulate.

Computers, meetings, agendas, deadlines...so much BS in this world! How does everyone else do it? Have you all just given up?

I want to be in a world where money doesn't stand between life and death; where we are able to live and sustain our living by helping others that are in need. That is why I am taking the risks I am today. I hope one day to retire around age 40 or before so I can live the rest of my life the way I want to live it and actually make an impact in this world.

Whenever I am working/gaming on my pc I heard the voices outside my window demeaning myself, telling me that I am worthless, telling me to die, telling me that there is not point living and very very harsh stuff. It has been pushing me down to hell and makes me depressed and want to cry.

There have been shadows and figures following me around whenever I am alone, for example whenever I am alone in my bedroom I see this darkness, darker then my room just standing there as if its watching me. I sleep with the lightbulb now so no dark figures but I always see them lurking around somewhere. And they scare the fuck out of me.

I have tried talking to my friends and family, apparently I have a lack of sleep and that everything is going to be alright soon. However I am getting tired mostly of these figures. My family doesn't believe in anything I have been saying and just brushing it off as ''Teen Drama'' and that everything is alright.

What should I do? How should I approach my family more seriously about this? How can I stop these? I am completely lost.",31Aug2018,1
25,"Hi. This question is geared towards programmers/software engineers, but any helpful advice is appreciated.

I started programming late 8th grade, sometime around January. My first language was Java. I got the basics down: variables, classes, OOP (some of it), useful comments, useful variable names, an attempt to structure my code and use DRY, etc. I wouldn't say I've mastered it, because nobody can, but I've gotten to the point where I feel like I'm repeating things if I go to beginner tutorials and am too confused if I go to advanced tutorials. I'm trying out Unity because I heard it uses C#, which is similar to Java, and I've always wanted to create a game. When I'm choosing a new project for Unity, it feels like everything is too advanced for me to do.

My first question is what programming concepts should I learn before I get serious with game development, and if you've created games before, what's one of the first games you created where you learned a-lot? I'm also looking for general programming advice you wish you knew when you were starting out.

I know everyone has their opinions on degrees, and that's fine, but what's your experience? Do you have a degree? Do you think many employers rejected you only because you didn't have one? When I turn 18, what's the best advantage I could have over someone else in the market that could potentially impress employers and allow them to accept me? I'm contemplating whether I should go to college or not. 13 seems too early to make a decision, and I'll definitely reconsider it later. Currently, I'm just trying to figure out if employers only check if you have a degree or not, or if you have skill. Thanks.",31Aug2018,1

29,"I am in college and have been for the past 5 years. I have 5 classes remaining before I am to graduate, but I can't seem to find it in myself to want to finish.

The classes are boring and I am learning nothing that I don't already know. 

The workload of these final classes requires 200-300 hours outside of class just to pass the course, due to the type of projects they want the students to do (The program coordinator is also the professor of these classes).

I do not mind putting in the work even though I find it a bit ridiculous. I want the degree. 

But... I withdrew today. I cannot find it in myself to give a shit anymore. I know that I am not supposed to compare myself to where others are in life, but I feel behind. Far behind. 

At this point in time, I just wanna focus on getting back in shape and working to pay down the debt I took on from all this schooling, but even this feels like a grind that won't end anytime soon. 

I cried as I walked out of class and withdrew today it felt wrong but was also a relief. I work 4am-2pm, then go to class from 5pm-10pm. Im exhausted. 

I am lost and not sure what to do. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Got advice on what to do? Do I take a year or two off college and focus on my health and paying off debt and return when I am ready?

30,"Like loads of people I have quite a caring mother, for which I love and adore her. I always understood when she called me asking ""when I'll be home"" or to check up on me and I found her curfews reasonable. Now I'm 18 and I know this means little when I still live with my parents, but her calling me every hour isn't really ""cool"" in front of my friends anymore (not that it ever really was). She can't fall asleep when I'm not home. It's always been like that and I don't get it. She should trust my friends by now.

Very good to his daughter and son in law. He has been very good to me and my wife since we have moved in about five years ago. And always great with my daughter.  I came home from work and was doing some work around the house and notice cops rushing to his house. I grabbed my radio. I am a fireman and Work for the town I live in so I have capabilities to listen to some things over the radio. And I hear the dreaded “call the ME” over the air.

32,"My parents have 2 kids, me (F, 29) and my brother (26).  We are not on the rich side financially.  We grew up with a simple lifestyle but we had food and a home over our head.  I was fortunate to get a scholarship + loan for my degree, and eventually landed a good job oversea that pays decently and I manage to pay back my degree.  My brother, unfortunately, didnt graduate high school, got kicked out due to fighting in school.  He then started a business which failed and my parents used their savings to help him start over again.  Unfortunately, it failed again.  What more with 2 car crashes, he owes the bank a considerable sum of money for the payment of both cars.  After my wedding last year, he asked if he could borrow about 9k to pay off his workers as his business didnt do so well that month.  A month later, I was told my brother was going to be sued for embezzling company money about 200k.  My parents, didnt want him to be jailed, mortgage their home + all their savings to pay off his debt.  Dad and mom asked me if I could pay back the mortgage (80% of the value of the house), in return ,they will give the home to me.  Apart from that, they also needed an increase of a monthly allowance.    


I have been feeling, very sad and dissapointed.  Its been months now and yet, I find it hard in my heart to let it go.  I felt that I worked/save hard to pay off my education and now that when I finally get to have savings and starting a family of my own, I am technically paying off a home due to my brothers mistake.  What more the agony his mistakes are causing my parents.  The mortgage + additional allowance takes quite a sum from my salary.  What more when I heard that they used the extra allowance to help my brother with his monthly car payment.

34,"Hi, before I start this post, I was diagnosed with Major  Depressive Disorder. I am no longer in therapy, due to a very bad experience with a therapist. I can't afford therapy right now. Anyway, I guess I'm really doubting if I am depressed. I always try to convince myself that I'm getting better. Lately though, I haven't been feeling anything at all. Literally, nothing. I think it's because I'm a selfish asshole. For about the past two months, I stopped feeling anything. It was like I had so many emotions I just shut down. I dont care about anything anymore. I just got promotion photos done for my band, and I know I should feel excited but instead I feel nothing. I've lost interest in everything and have also been having extremely severe memory loss. Ive completely withdrawn from friends and family because I feel like i am only bringing them down with me abd that they deserve better than me. Also been planning my own suicide, just in case one day I can't take life anymore. I just got my will written. Anyway, I'm really looking for any and all advice. Has anybody been here before?

35,"Sorry this is going to be so long. I need advice.

When I was in college I met this girl in my dorm and we instantly became best friends. We spent every day together, and I basically lived in her room. She was really truly my sister. I am not great at relationships at all and I'm  very distant. With her I felt like I really found my person. 

 Then I met my husband  and started dating him. She hated him so much because she thought he was bad for me and because of that we stopped talking for a good bit.  When we finally reconnected, things weren't  the same anymore. She was dating a guy who is now her fiance and  I had become engaged. We had missed big parts of our lives and I think that played a major role as to why we couldn't get back to how things were.  I graduated and I moved in with my husband. I had left on good terms with her and we promised we would stay in touch because we still had a lot of love for each other. 

I tried.  Like I really tried  to keep in contact with her. I even asked her to be my maid of honor for my wedding, but she never answered my phone calls or texts. I was constantly  trying to reach out to her and I wouldn't hear back. She blamed it on her being bad at texting. She missed my wedding and when I found out I was pregnant  and she didn't  even give me the time of day, I quit trying to  keep in contact. 

One day she randomly  calls me and tells me she really missed me. We talked for hours and it was like we were never apart. She apologized  for being so distant  and explained that she had a really dark period (she was also really sick during this time) . All was forgiven  and she invited me to go to her upcoming wedding. I was so excited  and ive been making plans to go, but when I called for more details, again she went MIA. She hasn't  returned my texts or calls, I try her on social media and nothing. 

I've just become so sick of it all. Even if she doesn't mean to be so distant. I can't be the only one working to keep this friendship we once had. It just kills me because she was the only one I considered to be my family, and she's  missing my daughter growing up, and  im missing her stuff too. So what should I do? Should I just give up for good and be thankful for the friendship we had in the past? Or should I keep trying.  And should i even try to make it to her wedding?",31Aug2018,2

38,"Hello, I decided to get reddit just so I can get some help with some phone harassment that’s been happening. 

For the past few days my step-father has been getting calls from a unknown number, I only found out today because my sister told me about how the guy called my step-father and asked him “is this ____’s father? This is her boyfriend.” 

When I found this out I immediately thought it might be my friends pulling a prank on me (they have FaceTimed my family before, just for shits and giggles) but my Step-father said it sounded like a fully grown man and thought it might have been my teacher at first telling him about my grades or something until the man said he was my boyfriend (I’m in high school)

My Step-dad has major anger issues and I’m scared he might freak out at me if the man keeps calling him. He gets mad even at the little pettiest things.

This is making me really creeped out and uncomfortable. I’m scared the man might call him again and start saying more things about me. I’m very confused since this person knows my step-fathers number and my name? I am very conflicted on what I should do right now. Should I call the police? or should I just hope that the guy will get bored and leave my family and I alone?

39,"I am a widower on hospice care at home. I have a 21 year old son and 18 year old daughter. My son was my primary caregiver for 2 years and he has recently returned back to his out-of-state college to complete his final year.

Now my daughter is my primary caregiver. She goes to a college that is close to my residence. She has taken classes such that she can stay at home 3 days a week but has to go to college for 2 days for a couple of hours.

My son has always been a level headed, smart, person with lots of patience and understanding. He took excellent care of me.

However, in the past 6 months, things started going bad. We started to have regular arguments over small things and especially over our bad financial situation. And I guess the stress of my health outlook also took its toll. Adding to this has been discovering recently that my inlaws grabbed all my property in my native country and despite hiring a good lawyer, chances of getting back anything is slim to none. 

My son's behavior changed dramatically in the past few months and one time he started arguing with me and my daughter for 3 days non-stop. Then, he went to the kitchen, slashed his forearm a few times, swallowed a couple of my prescribed morphine pills, wrote 'death to rats' in his blood and started yelling that he is dying. 911 was called, they took him for evaluation and released him after a few days.

After his return, we sat together and calmly tried to sort all matters. Things seemed ok but again my son's behavior worries me a lot. He yells, shouts and says anything that he can think of about me. I have often cried and tried to calmly explain or discuss the matters but to no avail. Yesterday he again cut himself and texted me a photo saying, now you must be happy. In his anger, he texts or says anything that is extremely hurtful to me. My daughter joins him too, saying hurtful things. She told him on the phone in front of me, I am sure he did not feel anything after you cut yourself. Its a different matter that I started crying and called a close friend immediately who tried to put some sense in my son.

As a father, I did everything I could to support my kids. After their mom died, people thought that I will leave the US, but I stuck and took on both duties of mom and dad, making them breakfast, lunch and dinner, schooling etc. Everyday I woke at 4 am and slept at 10 pm, dead tired with the work coupled with my stressful office job. After I was diagnosed, I fought my disease and bore all kinds of terrible pain, suffering and treatments just to be able to stay alive for my kids.

I made a trusteeship and gave each half of everything I have/own. They fought about it, so I dissolved the trusteeship, made separate accounts for them and gave away all my money to them equally. I have only $25 in my account.

And yet the arguments don't stop. Anything I do or say or ask is a problem. My love for them is questioned even though I sacrificed everything. I have even opted for the cheapest funeral (direct) possible to save them some money. 

I myself feel suicidal with this situation, but even though I can do so easily with my prescriptions, I am not doing so because then my kids will be denied life insurance due to the suicide clause.

I am lost and don't know what to do. How do I stop my son's dangerous, erratic, senseless behavior ? What can I do to bring peace to my house so that atleast my last few hours/days/time goes away peacefully and I die in peace ?",31Aug2018,1
40,"I'm a 16M and I want to forget my whole childhood and it isn't even over yet. My dad is in the military and we move about every three years and the last place that  we were at was my favorite out of these total 7. I lived in Fort Meade, Maryland. I was popular, the adults liked me, the local police liked me (they let me get away with stuff like staying out past curfew), I got to ride my bike all over the neighborhood with my dog following behind me, I'd go on walks with her and my friends at night, then in January of 2017. My dad gets orders to go to San Diego and the neighborhood that we would've been living in didn't accept pets, so my  dad gave away my dog that I had from when I was 2 to 14 the very next day and I didn't even get to say goodbye; she was gone before I woke up. They canceled the orders the next week so that makes things worse because I could've kept my dog if my dad had waited a few days. Two months later they give us real orders to Norfolk, Virginia and we pack up and leave within half a week and I didn't even get to say goodbye to my friends, my girlfriend, nobody. Now we're over here and the kids break into cars so my dad won't even let me go outside so now I'm home schooled, inside the house all day, only going outside to help my mom grocery shop on Saturdays which means I now have no friends because my parents don't want to let me have an Instagram so I can get back in touch with my friends from  Maryland. So I wish I didn't have any memories of my childhood because all they bring me is pain, anger and depression. And another kick my  dick is that we could've stayed in Maryland, but my dad said that he  wanted to buy a house here in Virginia so that made my mom want to go and as soon as we got here, my dad changes his fucking mind and now he wants to go back up to Maryland when he retires next year when everyone that I know isn't there anymore.

43,"So I'm posting here and realize that maybe rationally speaking this isn't an issue but nonetheless I'm not happy it's there. For the past 2.5 years, I visit a strip club in my city. I wouldn't say I'm a regular, go there once every 3 months or maybe two weeks in a row depending on my mood. My issue is that I go there alone when I have a craving for women and I spend hard-earned money fast. I spent $550+ last night.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm only 27, socialize well with people and I just feel like I shouldn't be there. I get turned on more when I'm flirting with people I know, coworkers or random girls I meet. I feel too young to be spending nights at strip clubs alone and I don't want to be old anti-social guy who spends his money/nights there. I have a sexual appetite and anyone I date would need the same appetite and compatibility but I also want someone intelligent and classy and I know most of these girls aren't for me. The girls I go and meet when I visit aren't even the girls that are the best looking girls but the ones that are able to have interesting conversations with me.

I'd feel way better if I was dating or keeping occupied travelling, going to night clubs, etc with friends while I'm young but I've tried to put that on hold short term to focus on my career. I honestly was feeling great about myself, my pursuit of my goals and positive thinking but the craving just got to me and I had to go visit the strip club. My main issues are the money that I end up spending, how I get girls numbers there in the hopes we'll actually meet up, and honestly just self-loathing feeling like me being there means I don't respect women.

It's just short term feel the need to go some nights to get that craving but the money and hating myself for going and it being a night I wish didn't happen always bugs me. I just don't know how to fight the urge to not go and think about the long-term impact it has on me.",31Aug2018,1

45,"A little over 3 months ago, I showed up at work at 7 am (like normal, about an hour before anyone else would ever show up) and was shocked to see my boss and an HR representative waiting for me. As soon as they saw me, my boss asked to speak to me in her office, and when I sat down with the two of them, this is what I was told (verbatim): “Due to the recent miscommunication issue, it has been discussed with senior leadership and the decision has been reached that you no longer have the chance to be successful at this company.” 

And that was it! Just under a year of working there (my first job in my field after college) and that’s how it end. Ironically enough, just a few days before my one year anniversary, so I wasn’t entitled to any kind of severance or payout for my accrued vacation time (about 2 weeks at that point). 

*Back story* 
This occurred on a Thursday morning, and that prior Monday I had had my semi-monthly 1-on-1 meeting with my boss. In this meeting, we discussed ongoing projects  and other things going on, to see if there was anything we couldn’t handle, wanted to change, etc. It was in this meeting that she told me that a comment I had made via Skype IM to her boss over a month before had been viewed as insubordinate. What happened was that in or prior 1-on-1 meeting 2 months before, she had asked me if there was anything I was handling that I could no longer handle because of a greatly increased project load, and I told her that managing/running our entire departments global SharePoint site (I was an assistant project manager for a bioscience company, not a tech person) was getting out of control due to my increased workload and some other factors. She said she understood and agreed, and said it was no longer going to be an issue. I took this to mean it was no longer on my plate, and that was that. 

Fast forward to the “insubordinate” moment: her boss had publicly asked me to do something on the SharePoint site, and I sent him an IM letting him know that I was no longer in charge of that site per the discussion with my boss. I was waiting for him to respond before going ahead and doing anything, as I was unsure if someone else had been tasked with the management of the site in the meantime. He never responded, and it wasn’t brought up or mentioned again until that last 1-on-1 meeting with my boss. When our meeting ended, she told me she had been dreading the meeting but thought it could have gone one of two ways and that she definitely felt it went the better way. As soon as the meeting ended, I sent her boss and email to clear the air and offer some explanation (he wasn’t in the office), and again sought him out in person two days later when he was in the office. We had a good 30 minute chat, and everything seemed right as rain. The next morning, I was fired. 

I don’t understand why I was let go, or what actually happened (and still don’t). I had been told by others during my time there that when people made mistakes, they made a corrective action plan moving forward (even for the woman who was addicted to hard drugs).

In the 3 months since, I have been applying left and right to every job remotely in my field (and plenty that aren’t) anywhere near where I live, and I have nothing to show for it. I’m starting to get very frustrated and down, and I’m just feeling incredibly lost right now.

They’re both born again Christians, but my dad is still the more understanding level headed one. I mean, when I wanted to start raving I asked my dad not my mom, and he convinced her to let me. 

But in the more recent years, I’ve seen a sort of shift. My mother has now become more relaxed and my father seems to be more uptight. Like one night, we were all at my uncles.

I feel like I need to be funny and interesting to be liked or loved by other people. 

Whenever I just fail at trying to be interesting or funny I feel like no one really values me. Even when I’m with close or new friends I constantly wonder “What do they like about me? Why do they keep me around?” I feel like all this self doubt will affect me a lot more than it is now. 

I am afraid of talking to people and even letting 3 or more seconds of silence go on and it’s torture to try to talk to people when I think like this. I feel like I can’t let anything about me come out naturally so I constantly force myself to act and talk, but this puts a great amount of stress on me. 

Every interaction feels like a game of chess that I have to constantly think about. I can’t feel natural at all around people and I have to think about every little thing that I have to say. I want to feel valued and I want to feel good about being me. I don’t want to be constant thinking about why the people who do like my company keep me around, and I want to be able to see the beauty in myself.

58,"Hello,

I really need some insight, this is driving me crazy. I work in the tax industry where overtime is mandatory. I understood that when I was hired as my previous firm had similar policies. I love the work I do but my direct supervisor is insufferable. I can't ask any question about overtime without him chewing me out. Simple questions like ""do you need me to stay tonight?"" or ""Is there anything you need help with?"" start an argument where he reminds me that he mentioned in the interview that there would be overtime and I should just expect to be here. The problem with ""just being here"" is that I often don't get any tasks and I'm stuck sitting at my desk unti 10p terrified to ask any question. I have a seizure disorder that requires that I get a good night sleep. I explained that I couldn't work past a certain hour because I needed rest. He grilled me about why it was necessary. My grandma was sick and I had to work 2 hours of overtime instead of 4 and it lead to an argument. I don't know what to do. Should I just continue to shut up, cancel any commitments I have and sit patiently at my desk for 4 hours waiting for work?

71,"What is the point of living if I’m just going to die in the end? 

What’s the point in anything I do? Years from now on, none of it is ever going to matter.

So why not just end it all now?

I’m not passionate about anything. Sure I like some stuff. I like basketball, video games, some books, writing, music.


 I don’t have any motivation. I still like to think I’m pretty successful at 18 years old. I’m in community college taking 17 units in my first semester, planning to transfer to a UC and get a masters in business. I have an unpaid business internship and they will offer me an office position after my internship is over, which is in about 3 months maybe longer. I also have a second job that I keep just to have some source of income for gas and all that small shit. But at the end, when I come home, I just don’t care for any of it. All the shit I’m doing now isn’t going to matter so why do it? Why work so hard just for some day it’s going to mean nothing? Poor or rich we’re all going to die. 

Some people might say who ever kills them selves are weak and selfish. That they run away from the problem. That they don’t think of the people that they’re going to affect. I don’t think that’s all true,well at least in my case. People don’t really care about me. Yeah I have friends, I don’t talk to them or hangout with them every day except for a couple. So I won’t have a big effect on them if I’m gone. As of family, well, fuck family. They’re toxic, selfish, and manipulative. I can never tell when they’re lying or telling the truth anymore. I don’t know who to believe. It’s like sometimes I think they do this on purpose like it’s all just a joke behind the scenes and I’m just not in on it. Like watching a YouTube prank video, I’m the one getting pranked but I never get told “it’s all just a prank bro.”

The only person that I care about, that I think I might affect is my little sister. Me and her are close and I make sure I’m there for her for everything.

Well I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore but it was nice writing all my thoughts down, maybe you’ll read this and give some advice, or maybe you’ll think I’m an asshole who should be appreciative of what I have and make use of it.

But to say this, if I do live and become successful in whatever I do and be in a good financial situation, I will help those who need it, and make sure future kids are in a good environment.

My father’s dementia is so bad he can’t make simple decisions like what he wants to eat for dinner, or can’t even remember what he did during the day. Beside the point, but I asked him if he wanted to go and he said he doesn't (he was worried about his girlfriend, and me not going) and my mother somehow managed to get him to tell her he DOES want to go one time and booked the ticket without even talking to me about it.

74,"I need some advice on how I can help my brother. I think he's been having anxiety problems? For the past year and a half, he stopped being able to eat out in public. He always declines going out to eat and if we do go to a restaurant, for like a family dinner or something, he won't order anything. He's doesn't seem to have any problems eating at home. In the past, we used to go out to eat together at least once a week. 
In the past six months, he's stopped wanting to go to the movie theater. We used to go around once or twice a month, but now any time I suggest it he says he just doesn't feel like going, even if it's a movie he's really been wanting to see.
For the past three months, he's stopped wanting to visit with family (besides me, but we live together in an apartment). He's actively avoiding seeing our mom. Whenever she texts us to come over or go do something, he'll say he doesn't want to. He never gives a reason, just ""I don't feel like it.""
I don't know, maybe this sounds like nothing, but I'm just worried about him. We're both super introverted and like to stay at home a lot, but this is a noticeable decrease in his activities outside our apartment. He works from home, so he never sees coworkers. He doesn't have any friends (which is true for me too, but I do at least chit chat with coworkers and go out to lunch with them). He's very non-confrontational and doesn't like to tell anyone when something's wrong. 
I want to know how I can talk to him or approach this? I'm scared of pushing him away though, since I'm really the only person he sees every day and actually talks to or hangs out with.

75,"My boyfriend(34m) and I(32f) have been living together for 2 years now. We've been together 3. We started off long distance, visiting 3x a month. I lost my house about 6ish months in due to some financial hardship, and moved in w a roommate, still in my area. In this time we decided to build a house together, and found some undeveloped, undervalued land. Purchased the land, bought a motorcoach and a truck. He sold off his car, we turned in our house plans.
 I moved out from my roomies and 4 hours away to his home with his aunt. We thought this would be for 1 month while plans we approved. This process was strung out by our home owners association, and we were required to hire a special structural engineer to build our wanted home. We found someone to work with, but the process would take much longer, years even. We poured all our collective money into the process. 
His aunt and I had some personal differences, and long story short after not pandering to a lonely old womanbaby, I was asked to leave, harassed and bullied into leaving 2 weeks later from my dream job and the only home I had in the area. My bf had no balls and basically forced me out as well, choosing emotional comforts over my basic needs and legal rights. 
So I moved up to our RV, now 8 hours away, and lived there alone for a while, only running the generator a few hours at night, on barren land. My bf stayed behind to finish his growing season, and moved up after. 
It's now been about 10 months in this RV together and I'm Losing my mind. He does not work, receives disability and grows a garden. I am an online full time student and have been looking for a job for a long time. Because we live in a very rural, unpopulated area, jobs are scarce, 1 movie screen runs 2x week, couple restaurants, it's very quiet and slow. 
We're together 24 hours a day. He talks to me when I'm trying to study. We bump into each other. There's no privacy. No alone time. 
This morning I snapped when he said he was going to skip watering his garden this morning. It's usually my only solitary moments, and I exercise my fat ass off, sing, shave my legs etc. 
I find myself longing deeply for my days and nights alone, and neeeeeeed space. I cherish his trips to the store. I make up excuses for my own. This week I've been studying at the library, it's been nice. 
 We're both kinda sensitive people, how can I meet my needs without making him feel unwelcome or unwanted?

76,"To give you the entire backstory, I’ve been at my current desk job for about 9 months. When I first started, I noticed that a lot of people would take long breaks/lunches and would leave a few minutes early or come in a few mins late. While these people didn’t do this all the time, it was common.  I asked the manager what the policy was regarding this, and he told me that nobody watches anyone’s time because we’re all adults, and as long as we’re getting everything done and the time isn’t unreasonable, it was ok. He said that if I needed a few extra mins getting to work/leaving a bit early/ taking lunch, he didn’t care. 

I consider myself to be a punctual person, so I never took advantage of this like my other coworkers. They will often go on 15-25 min walks outside, and go to the gym on lunch and it takes 1.5 hours for them to get back. I never cared what anyone else did though because we all get our work done.

Fast forward to today, I get told from my supervisor that “someone” told him I am getting to work late and leaving early which isn’t true. I usually get to work right at 8AM, sometimes earlier, and a handful of times I get there 3-4 mins after 8AM usually when traffic is backed up. And I almost always stay right until 5pm, however, my manager often tells me that “it’s time to go” at 4:56, so sometimes I leave at 4:57 or 4:58.  Everyone else does this too.

I want to mention that I almost never take both of my breaks during the day, and I have often cut my lunches short. I have also stayed past 5PM multiple times without asking for overtime. I feel insulted that someone in my office is watching me and I haven’t been confronted about it being a problem until now. I also don’t understand why I am being singled out for these few minutes. I feel like I do everything possible to be a good employee, everyone praises my work ethic, and yet someone is talking behind my back about showing up to work at 8:04 once in a while. They don’t take into account that I NEVER take all of my breaks that I’m entitled to during the day. 

I need advice on how to address this to my manager, who doesn’t know anything about what my supervisor said to me, and advice on if I’m being unreasonable. 

Thank you!",31Aug2018,1
77,"Last month I started a new job and on my first and second day there this guy started talking to me. He would tell me very strange things that made me believe he was on drugs or something he kept asking for my number and asking if I could come over to his house so we could chill. He asked me out on a date to go to the fair with him. 

He would invade my personal space and would stand too close to me I felt uncomfortable especially since he’s in his 30’s and I’m 18 so I told my boss and my boss talked to him and after that he left me alone and never talked to me again she also moved me to a different section far away from where he works. Btw I work in a big warehouse so that’s what I mean by a different section but anyway even though I can avoid seeing him during work hours I can’t avoid him during break or lunch because he can go anywhere he wants. 

Most people during break or lunch go outside or hang in the section they work in but I go to the break room and this week he’s been going there to. Before he didn’t but this week he randomly started hanging in there during lunch and break, he said hi to me twice this week but each time he did I ignored him. Yesterday he was acting strange. 

During break I was having a conversation with someone and he pulled a chair from right next to me and said “sorry continue your conversation I’m going to sit right here” and then it got awkward but after a few seconds of sitting down he got up and sat somewhere else. Then during lunch he was walking around and was looking at me and then decided to sit at a table across from the one I was sitting at and started staring at me but I ignored him by focusing on talking to my work friend. 

Idk if I should say anything to my boss yet because the only time he was acting strange was yesterday and the only time he talked to me was when he said hi to me twice this week and when he pulled the chair.

In the last six years i have watched as the childrens mother has placed full responsibility on her two parents. The children, their mother, her parents and her sister (my girlfriend) live in a small two bedroom apartment. Before the mother came back to live with her parents, the entire apartment was renovated. it cost the two parents tens of thousands of dollars to renovate the home. In the last six years i have watched as the children have destroyed the walls, the floors and furniture while their mother laughed it off. I have watched as the mother became lazier and lazier and has becomes very disgusting in her living habits. Aside from that drama, the children's mother also has a bad habit of working 7 days a week. She says she has three jobs but she has admitted me to that when she isn't home, shes actually not at work and just waiting for her current boyfriend to contact her. The children see their mother very rarely. In fact, the only time the children see their mother is when she takes them to school in the morning. The children's grandparents, aged 61 and 59, do the rest of the work with the kids the remainder of the day and when the mother comes home, its usually after 9 or even 11 pm and by then the children are asleep.
The children often times go days without bathing because the grandparents are under too much pressure to handle 3 very disrespectful children. The oldest child now has a habit of claiming that people have bit her, hit her, or watch her when she is in the bathroom. All of those accusations are completely false. The middle child also makes up tall tales the likes of which could land any man in jail. The youngest child has now picked up the habit of using words no child their age should use.

The grandparents try their best to make everything work out but now they are becoming sick and have no power to keep up with three children. The childrens mother has now taken to bringing her new boyfriend around and the man, who only just met the kids two months ago, has taken to trashing his girlfriends parents and trashing my girlfriend and i as well.

Green light comes on and there is a car in front of me and I a bit to the right and a car from the right lane went straight for some reason?

88,"Ive been depressed for a while, about a year and a half to be exact. I can never seem to find happiness in the things I once enjoyed. I’m not happy with who I am anymore. I lack the motivation to do simple things, I’m lonely and antisocial. I don’t sleep. If I’m not eating too much, it’s too little. I think that the world would be a better place without me in it. I’ve gotten the result of severe depression on every test I’ve taken, but I don’t tell anyone about it. I lie on tests my doctors and counselors give me because I don’t want to hurt those who love me. 

I cut, almost every day, on my thing where nobody will see. I think about killing myself but I know how selfish it is so I could never do it. I’m quiet, but on the inside I’m calling out for a friend, someone to confide in. I feel like every day I fall deeper into this darkness that entraps me and keeps my happiness from being free.

89,"TLDR: So my(18m) parents drink every weekend and end up fighting, complaining to each other about shit the other does. 

So just like everyone in life, they’re stressed out about their lives. In order to cope with staying sane, they drink their minds away and end up fighting throwing mindless thoughts at each other, acting stupid and just being a pain in general. I’m the youngest in my family and I seem to be the only one that cares about their wellbeing. Now as I mentioned they dislike what the other does and yell about it to each other when they argue. They never listen to reason with me so I was thinking maybe send them to therapy so they can calmly talk their problems out. I’m looking for advice on how to soothe their relationship, breaking them up seems like a bad idea because I don’t think my mom would be in any position to properly take care of herself and my dad would just throw his life away as well.

90,"Hello! I’m 16, and next month I’m going to get my wisdom teeth removed.

I’m pretty nervous about it. They’re going to knock me out for it, but I’m still pretty scared. That’s not what I’m here for though.

Recently, I’ve taken a ton of time off work (for personal reasons, although most of it I didn’t have a choice but to take time off for). I know I’ll have to take the day of the removal off, but what I want to try and do is go to work the next day. I feel really guilty for taking so much time off, and I want to make it up to them by working as much as possible, even if it’s painful. (Btw, I work at a pizza place, which can be reasonably taxing/stressful at times)

I feel that this is the responsible thing to do. Even though I’ll be in pain and kind of out of it the next day, I feel that it’s the adult thing to do, if there’s any way I can possibly tough it out. I feel like my co workers already hate me enough for taking so much time off, and I want to make it up to them.

However, I’m conflicted about it; my friend doesn’t think I should go, something about taking care of myself, which is something I’m not very good at.

Anyway, what do you think I should do? Tough it out and be responsible, or take the next few days after the removal off and be lazy an irresponsible? I don’t know what to do.",31Aug2018,1

She left me before I even went to rehab. She never tried, never waited never tried to see if I could get better... Which I have. I've been clean for years now. I call my son and I see my son and I pretend everything is fine when I see her, for him. Secretly I'm always super mad because I feel like she never really cared at least never tried to make things better.

104,"Hello reddit, been a long time lurker, this is my first post ever! I have done much introspection but cannot wrap my head around this, so i have decided to submit myself to the collective wisdom of the internet.  


Storytime: I'm 27, and have been in a few long relationships; 1year and up, and I've come to realize, they always end up in a phase whereby we fight about the smallest things. And those small fights happen very frequently(once a week), and i feel like this deteriorates the relationship, and eventually becomes the reason for the break up. 

I'm with this girl now, and i think she's amazing, but as always, i end up in that phase again. We're together for just about a year, and i don't want for us to head towards a break up(because i think shes amazing). I'm kind of at a loss, I try my hardest to ask her to voice her thoughts so we can discuss it and fix/grow as a couple but she remains mum and wants to let it blow over. 

The past few ""small fights"" always end with about 2 days of silent treatment, and everything goes back to normal. But i cant shake the feeling that its chipping away incrementally at the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My relationships always end because i reach a phase where we have frequent fights about small issues.

&amp;#x200B;

So i guess my question(s) is:  


1) Am i caring too much? Should i let things(i.e. everytime we have a fight over a small issue) blow over?

2) Should i encourage her to communicate more?

3) Are all relationships like mine? i.e. small fights are common, and even if we never discuss/settle it, the relationship is still fine?

4) Am i the problem?  
I'm open to ANY perspective, its really what i'm here for, so ask/criticize away.

107,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost seven months, but he never compliments me. He never has. For some background, we've known each other for a really long time; he's been a family friend since I was really young, and we even dated when we were thirteen. We went our separate ways but never stopped thinking of each other, even though we both had been in serious relationships for years. We somehow ended up single at the same time, both getting out of these serious relationships, and found our way back to each other. I compliment him all the time, but he never compliments me. I've told him how I have self esteem issues, and how him never complimenting me makes me feel like he doesn't really find me attractive. He claims he isn't good at complimenting anymore, because his ex cheated on him several times, and now he has a hard time doing it. But I told him I need him to at least try, because although I feel petty for this, I need to hear at least every now and then that he thinks I'm attractive. I've pointed out that my ex was abusive, and some things are hard for me, but I still try for him. I've reminded him that I'm not her. It feels like he hasn't even tried since our talk. To make matters worse, our sex life has also diminished. When we first got together, we had sex really often. At least once a day. Then it started tapering off to three to four times a week, which I understood. I'm aware there is a honeymoon phase. But now I'm lucky if it happens once a week. Referring back to the honey moon phase, I feel as though at four or five months of being together (when this started), that passion should not fizzle this early. I broke down crying, telling him that the fact he never compliments me mixed with the fact that he never wants to have sex, has really made me feel like he just doesn't find me attractive. All he could do was tell me I was wrong, and it's been one excuse after another since. He's stressed from work, he's too busy working on his project car at the moment, he isn't feeling the best, etc. He doesn't compliment me, doesn't try to grab my butt or anything, rarely wants to have sex. When we do have sex, I'm usually the one initiating it. Am I overthinking things, or is there genuine cause for concern? ",31Aug2018,1

I had no clue that this was a part of my job because it's in no official documents. We're both college students working for the school newspaper. I asked our faculty advisor why an editing job had to be a mental and physical health hazard and if i needed to get a prescription for Ambien to cope with my job. He thought I was being dramatic and recommended exercise over Ambien. He said that it is normal to lose sleep over an important job. She talked to him, and I don't know what she told him.

Some people made small complaints about me, such as misreading my normal personality traits as aggression. For example, I noticed that pretty much everyone was putting too much subjectivity into their news stories, so at a meeting, I brought that up and explained why it's important to be objective. I named no people or stories. Some people perceived that as me trying to embarrass them. My boss took all these little complaints so seriously that she said I was being a dick. I pulled the high functioning autism card to protect myself, and now I'm worried it might backfire. I tried to reason with her and she perceived every other thing as a personal attack. In a moment of outrage, I asked, ""Is any other place on campus hiring that has a position similar to this one?"" Later that evening, she said she was thinking about demoting me. Holy shit. I begged and pleaded for her to slow down and think things through. We're supposed to have a meeting to decide what to do. She's offering to let me keep my position if i obey her terms, which will probably make no logical sense or will be more than I can cope with.

Basically, I think my boss is insane, but this job is a ticket to a career in journalism. I can't stand to think that I have to fundamentally change the course of my life because of one person.

110,"I tried my best to learn the job when I started learning at *aco *ell (censored to protect the innocent), however my MIC (manager in charge) and coworkers put in charge of supervising me whenever MIC was busy didn't want to worry about me when things were hectic (most of the time, because it's fast food in a plaza on a busy street). I would often get told to find something to do like wash dishes, clean the floor, prep food to be served on the line, but I'd spend less than half my shifts actually on the line. 

One coworker, who oversaw me the most, even went so far as to *lie* to the managers to cover up her slothful behaviour. She told them all I was unwilling to work the line, that I would wander off on my own, rather than doing so because I was following her instructions. After I cleared this ""misunderstanding"" up, I was told to follow only the directions of managers from then on until I got the basics. Problem was, managers were still not doing it either. I didn't learn how to read any of the acronyms for orders on the screen until more than 2 months in! I asked on many occasions about cheat sheets for ingredients or other resources that I could use at home but they were convinced that 1 time training on the computer and on the job training would be enough.

Soon after, a new position on the crew opened up, a dedicated prep person. I was deemed perfect for the job and I seemed to perform better than all my colleagues in my new position so I was given more hours. After a while though, the staff seemed to get used to having cashiers do prep, dish washing, and limited cleaning duties that had techically been in their job description before my position even existed and had stayed part of it even after the fact. Managers stopped putting prep people on the clock since they could survive without us while saving money. I asked for more hours from the head manager and was put back on the line. However, people (particularly this manager) are acting like I should have the food line experience of someone who has been working food line non-stop for 8 months, rather than 2-3 followed by a ""break"" longer than that. They're telling me I should know what comes on everything as a starter *and* a finisher (a position I've never worked on the line) and be able to solo an entire side of the food line even on big complicated orders. They've shown no mercy as I attempt to re-explain my situation, even going so far as to mock me, so I'm at a loss for what to do.

111,"Hello all. A little backstory.   


I have just gotten out of a very deep relationship. The girl I was with was very influential in helping me get started on going to school. Shes 3yrs into the degree I want to go for. And showed me how I can do it. It was something I never dreamed of being possible do to life/financial circumstances. Through our relationship I really discovered a lot about who I was. All the adventures and, life experiences we had together. Really brought things about me to the surface. She completely changed my life for the better and, made me want to pursue dreams I had let die.   


Basically. I want to go to college. Yet I have no money to do so. I have applied for fasfa. I can live with my father until he moves for about a year or two. I still would have to go into a little bit of debt. And would have to work part time to save money to move out. When he moves do to his job. I have no idea how I am going to put myself through school. I have been looking into it for a long time now. Every day it feels like I hit another brick wall.  I really have no idea how I am going to get myself through 4yrs of school. Much less continuing on to graduate school. Moving out of state to go to grad school as well keeping myself afloat and, alive. With unpaid internships.   


I have always had an interest in joining the coast guard. I know they would help me pay for school. Through T.A and, the G.I bill. But part of me really does not want to join. For the past year I have had some life events and, also that relationship. That have shown me I need to be pursuing my degree. Everything inside of me is telling me too. My heart is set on it. Yet I know the logical adult choice. Would be to join the service. Make myself steady. And use the benefits to go to school.   


Me and, this girl are also kind of on and, off again. I have known her since childhood and, we have a very long complicated friendship. She wants me to go to school. She wants to be there with me during school and, help me get my degree. Yet every day we are falling away more and, more. I have nothing left for me in this town. She was the only reason I was staying and, pursuing college here.  If I join the Coast Guard. I will probably lose everything with her. Life will carry us separate ways and. I may never be able to make it work with her. I have had had quite a few relationships. Most being long term. I know there will be other women. But do to our history. Our backstory. Everything we have been through together. This is more than just a girl to me. She is beyond my best freind. She knows and, understands everything about me. When we dated it felt like I was dating myself. We were so much alike one another. We understood another on levels that were almost telepathic. It was weird. The relationship ended do to some personal fuckups. But I know down the road. If I stayed here. It may work out. We are very complicated. Life is getting in the way of us right now. I know I cant put my security in one human who is indecisive. Im just tired of losing all the people that matter to me. I have lost so many people in my life and, it hurts. I have issues with attachment. I am working on it through therapy.   


I am just deeply afraid of joining the coast guard. It is the only option I have at a successful debt free college career. It is also the only chance at stability and, building a future for myself right now. At least that's how I feel. I also feel if I dont join. If I just pursue my dreams and, go to school. I will regret not taking the opportunity.  I also feel I may get out there. Be stuck with a job I hate do too being a non rate before A school. And wish I would have stayed home. I just feel extremely pressured to join. I feel like my back is against a wall and, this enlistment is the only way to successfully better myself. College is a complete unguaranteed gamble for me financially. Even though I am going to a small local school. With $7,000 tuition plus books. College deep down is where I feel I want to be though. I feel like I have had a deep awakening for it. Do to some life events that happened while dating this girl.   


I am also afraid of losing her and, leaving everything behind for an unknown future in the USCG. Even though that is the most logical healthy thing I can do for myself as a young adult. I have a fork in the road. Whatever I take I cant change. It will be a final decision and, I will spend my life wondering what if?",31Aug2018,1

117," My friend is having a really hard time, and her thoughts have turned very dark. She says she doesn't feel anything, like she doesn't exist anymore. She hasn't said she is considering suicide, but she has repeatedly said that she wishes she were dead. We (another friend and I) keep trying to tell her we love her, but she says she can't feel anything. 

Is there any advice out there for how to talk to her and what to say? ",31Aug2018,1
118,I'd like to preface this by saying I've been depressed since grade 8 but only started going to counseling a couple months ago (I'm in grade 11). The reason for this was my moms reluctantly to let me go despite practically begging for years. I know how I feel now is awful and I want to fix it. Next week I have an appointment where I'll get evaluated to see if I should go on meds. I'm almost certain that my mom will never allow me to take them. How do I change her mind? Should I even take it? I've heard from lots of people saying that meds made them feel like shit but I figure it's still worth a shot. ,31Aug2018,1
119,"I currently work at a bowling alley, and have been there for only about 6 months .The position I hold is the front desk. Basically, I am the guy you talk to if you want to bowl a couple games. My manager quit about a month after I got there, and the rest of the workers kinda fell through as well. I am the only one left and thus kinda promoted as ""manager"". This was not so bad during the summer because we where only open Wednesday- Saturday and I had a Bartender work for me Wednesdays. I worked the rest. Now that it is almost league season I am completely stressed out.

First off, my leagues are starting up starting next week and I am still the only one here. For whatever reason my boss (the owner) does not want me hiring people, he said he would take care of that. Which i foolishly believed. All I have working for the front desk is 2 people and me. Both of these people work very specific shifts during the week and they will not come in on a day they don't work or during a time they don't want. In other words, They are working what they want and I have no say in it. So in total the amount of hours I have to cover is 62 hours a week.

Secondly, I am in college and my school, and where I live, is about a hour away. This gives me very little time to do school work and I am very worried that This will make me fall behind. Currently  I'm struggling as it is to do what I need to do to pass because of my short attention span.

Thirdly, I am doing multiple jobs for a very low cost and its discouraging. By multiple jobs I mean I work the front and also there is a truck rental company that we also do. That is fine and all but I am Payed $9.50 a hour. I looked it up and working for the truck rental company and doing exactly what I do minus the bowling alley gets payed around $12 a hour. Honestly that is infuriating. On top of that I also bus tables (more on that later), help fix and run machines in the back, and serve drinks when the bar is closed. I am suppose to get a pay raise but the guy who was my manager before only made $12 a hour. I don't know if that would be enough for me to endure all of that work with no complaints.

Lastly, the bar staff. I love a lot of the people I work with like the chefs and the mechanics, but I cannot deal with most of the bar staff. Here the waitresses clean the tables they serve because they get tipped. No, its not a great system but that is just how its always been here I guess. There is only one girl who works here that does this and the rest I have to bus for because i need the tables to put people on the corresponding lanes. Normally I don't mind this if we are busy and they obviously are running around, but I NEVER get tipped out. When I brought this up with the bar manager she just told me to not clean up after them. This is not a choice because if I follow that advice then the customer suffers with dirty tables. On top of that some of these waitresses will even complain that I am not cleaning their tables. Normally when I do not clean tables I am busy. Some of the girls just flat out don't care. I have even had one lie to me telling me that my boss told me to help clean her tables. The last part that is very annoying to deal with is that most of them will drink on the clock as well. Sometimes they are okay to deal with and others they are just flat out drunk.

 

Back to the topic at hand, I want to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want out of this job, but If i quit i will be leaving the owner at a very bad spot. Like I said, I am the only one who will work more then twice a week so I am all he has to train people and to do leagues. I cant get over the guilt of it. He is a great guy and all but does my own sanity warrant destroying another ones business? If I leave no one can run the leagues coming in. I have tried to talk to him but he just dismisses that there is anything wrong. I just don't know if i should just quit, or force him to sit down with me and talk, or just deal with it until new help comes along. I just don't know.  Everyone around me thinks I should quit without caring about him and the business because Just recently I have been losing a lot of sleep. Before I got about 8 hours of sleep a night, now I'm lucky to get 4. Also i have been eating less and less to the point where I'm eating half a meal a day. Which after I thought about it is probably from the stress. Should I quit and not care? Will the guilt eat me alive? Or, will it end up making me happy and going back to normal. I just don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I do not have another job in line but I am basically already making minimum wage in my state so I figured getting a job at fast food or something like that wouldn't be that hard. On top of that I have no money saved because most of what i get paid goes to bills and all of that fun stuff. If i where to quit right now I will be getting a $180ish paycheck soon and a $600ish paycheck in 2 weeks. Which will barely cover everything I need to pay for the next month but not any farther then that. This is also what is making it so hard to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR  Job is overly stressful and I want to quit, but I have no saved money other then checks I will be getting. On top of that I will be hurting the company I work for very horribly, and I feel guilty.

120,"This situation I'm about to explain is probably going to be a little complicated, so please bear with me. I'm going into freshman year of highschool this upcoming year, which also means i'm going into a highschool and no longer going to be attending my middle school. In middle school, i had somehow connected to video gamers of the highschool and I played and voice chatted with these older friends for a year. The problem is, i'm going to be going to school with them which means i would eventually have to meet them in real life. I've never ""actually"" met any of them in real life other than at times before we met over video games, so before we knew who each of us were. All of them do know how i look from pictures and things, but i'm still really scared to meet them in real life. it's like meeting an online friend in real life. how can i deal with this? how do I build up the courage to actually speak to them in real life?

I've met one of them.. or actually saw them 3 times but never actually talked or ""met"" with each other. one time was at a dance, i knew he was going to be there so i hid a lot from him. he probably ended up seeing me anyways. the second and third times were today, and i was being incredibly awkward both times. i was at a football game and walking up the stands when I unexpectedly saw him. I kind of freaked out and quickly went down the bleachers. he definitely saw me and saw me trying to run away. I can't help being super awkward. The last time I met him was near the end of the game, my friends went up to him and dragged me with them. they were talking with him and I was too nervous that I turned away and went on my phone. How can i make this relationship less awkward and be brave enough to not run away? I'm really embarrassed and I know I can't undo these stupid moves. 

I think the reason why i'm so nervous to meet them is because i'm really self concious about myself. and I want to look attractive and pretty in front of the older friends. because I want them to not regret playing games and voice chatting with me for a year because I'm ugly. 

I really don't know what to do, and I know this post is a mess. Please leave advice on how to be less anxious when meeting them. It's really hard for me and it's not realistic for me to be able to just flip a switch and become super social towards them.",31Aug2018,1

122,"i’d prefer to not get into too much detail into my last relationship. i will say that i met him at 17, dated for almost 3 years, and it was unfortunately physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive. the relationship ended around seven months ago.

since then, i’ve been trying to make personal growth. i’ve made a lot of progress, but i still suffer from depression and i’m still trying to fix my own self-worth. and, i go through times when i go through pits of having no motivation or will. 

anyways, i’d like to get back into the dating scene. i’m having a lot of trouble with it. admittedly i’ve always has more trouble befriending/talking to other people. i’m not sure how to approach a guy. 
my biggest issue is intimacy and sex. i’m not affectionate at all. i recently went out on a date, and when the guy went to kiss me i jerked back. something like a simple kiss, i can’t do until many dates and i’m comfortable. and something like sex wouldn’t happen for a much longer period of time. and, i’ve found that it’s really difficult to find someone who’s fine with that. 
not sure what to do? :/ where to look? if i should just give up on dating for a while?

I had a crush on bitch, from Sophomore year till junior year. In junior year I had grown balls to ask her out. When I was asking her out, she was with her friend. Let’s call her friend bitch 2.0. And don’t forget about bitch 2.0 ok? So Bitch rejected me because I was fat. She had all the right to reject me since fat guys weren’t her preference. What I had the problem with is how she rejected me. I’ll quote what she said, “Sorry I don’t date fatasses such as yourself pumba!” She literally insulted me and told me to get away from her and that I’m a freak. So after that incident with her, I branded her as a bitch and I still do till this day. But I gotta thank her though. Because of her I vowed to better myself. I started going to the gym and I lost a shit ton of weight/fat. I was actually average now with well defined muscles. So after like 2 years, I bump into her.

So goodbye.” As I was walking about her friend had the audacity to slap me for being an asshole. What the frick? I’m the asshole? For giving bitch a taste of her own medicine?

128,"Hello Hi I'm Unstable:

Here's my problem: for the past 6-7 years my relationship with my mother has plummeted into the dirt. I live in a house with my mother, father, my older sister (she's 22) and myself (I'm 19). Everyone knows my mum's psycho. She has problems - but is she mentally abusive? I legitimately don't know if the things she has been doing and saying to me are considered ""abusive"" or if I'm just overly sensitive.

&amp;#x200B;

Intro:

In 2008 my family moved from South Africa to Australia. This is when my mum started changing. My speculation is that her life got harder - she no longer had the luxuries we had in Africa; she no longer had a maid to cook and clean for her etc.,. She started targeting **me**. Not my dad, not my sister - just **me**. My sister even acknowledged this multiple times, saying she doesn't understand why our mother is so aggressive towards just me - as she tends to leave my sister at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Actual Problem:

When I was around 12 is when she started noticeably get abusive. In this case, I know she was physically abusive - she got in the habit of punching me multiple times in a row (they were like short outbursts). But it's the things she says that hurt a lot, LOT more. Of course the police got involved a few times - I started running away on multiple occasions - I lived with friends sometimes - the school started bringing in psychologists to take ""care"" of me (they did nothing for me personally). My dad works full time in mining and he's rarely home so he could do minimal to help me except listen to me cry over the phone multiple times (omegalul). 

I'd always been a good student, never got into trouble, good grades blah blah blah - everything you'd think would make a mother proud. NOPE. Not my mum. Got 99% in a test - why the fuck didn't you get 100%? All that jazz. Nothing was ever good enough for her. Nothing I did or achieved in my schooling or outside of schooling ever seemed to impress her. I learnt musical instruments, I got into concerts to perform, I did sports and performed exceptionally well in it all. But for what? All to try impress her. All to try get that big thumbs up from my MUM. My MOTHER. I felt like I needed to impress my mum - like I needed to EARN the love from her. It's the most pathetic feeling to know your own mother doesn't even have love for you.

Anyway, she has a habit of calling me names. We speak another language at home so translations are a bit off - but I get a lot of condescending remarks. I got a nose piercing and she said I looked **disgusting**. She'd call me the normal names like ""bitch"" and all those. Say things like ""You useless little \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" - and then 2 minutes later act like nothing happened and then often asks me to do something for her. I normally confront her at this point as calmly as possible so she doesn't go psycho on me, and tell her she can't just call people names or make remarks like that and expect them to WANT to help her with anything, and she doesn't even apologise for it. That's usually followed up with her saying she doesn't have to apologise blah blah blah - it literally goes in one ear and out the other. She doesn't care what I'm saying. She doesn't care if I'm crying. She used to be condescending when I would cry or when I wouldn't look her in the eyes when saying something (probably because I was younger and was actually SCARED of her). Now that I'm older I can hold back any tears and stare her right in the face and talk to her rationally, and she even then disregards anything and everything I say. 

My mental health is trash, It's down the drain. I cry almost every day - sometimes for NO REASON. I don't know if it's subconscious stress or what, but it's frustrating. I hate showing emotion. I hate feeling like my own mother doesn't care about me. I hate seeing other people with their mums, having a good time, getting encouraged by their mother to do things and all that. I despise it. I want a mother. I don't even know if I can call her a mum. I don't feel like she is or ever has or ever will be a mum to me. I want nothing to do with her anymore - over all the years of her messing with my emotions - being nice to me and making me feel like there's hope and then using that hope against me to make me feel like absolute garbage. I got involved with drugs, used sex as an outlet. All that's over now - but the pain's still there. I feel emotionally drained. I feel like I was stripped of something really important - a relationship I'll never be able to get from anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Send Help Please:

I don't know if I'm just making her out to be a bad person. I don't know if this is normal? 

I feel hopeless at this point. And it's to the point where I've just come to the internet to rant about it. 

I'm stuck with her at the moment. I'm a full time uni student. I'm broke. I basically don't have friends because I have a hard time trusting anyone. I don't know what I did to start this.

I started as a cook at this restaurant in February. Nobody seems to want to do their job correctly and I'm not sure what I should do about it. I come into a kitchen so dirty I don't want to eat anything coming out of it let alone serve it to someone who is spending their money on it. There's food all over the floors cause nobody will sweep/mop them. The grills either don't get cleaned or they spray degreaser on them while it's hot and everyone has to breathe that shit in. There's food floating in other food. They are not storing produce properly causing it to rot quickly and still want to serve it. I've found mold on several things since I've started here. I've even got proof that management isn't temping anything and just fill out the sheet. Even when they are not here they fill it out like they were. This place is going to get someone horribly sick.

I've tried saying something to my boss about all of this on several occasions, but it doesn't do any good nothing is changing. I try to do my best to keep this from happening by cleaning everything as much as I can and I throw away anything I even think might be tainted, but I'm just sick of it. I really want to go out and tell every customer we get to just leave and find a better place to eat.

No matter what I will be done with this job asap. I'm really not sure what I should do about this though. This place needs to just close it's doors forever. I'm not sure who I should contact about all this though or how exactly I should go about it. Do I contact OSHA, his boss, the news, the health department, or just all of them?

I went to the doctor for an unrelated issue and the doc mentioned that I hadn’t gotten the Tdap in a long time and asked if I wanted it. Thinking my wife wouldn’t even know and thinking about my children’s safety, I said yes. 
A few weeks later I got some mail from our insurance provider and she opened it. It had the information from my Tdap shot. Well, she freaked. This sparked an argument that left me upset and wishing I had more information. 
I still don’t understand the ins and outs of vaccines, but honestly trust the medical community over what my wife has found online from anti-vaxers. I mean, you can find whatever you want online, and she wants to find the bad, so she finds it. Her dad, someone i see as the smartest person I know,  is also anti-vaxx which is where her fears stemmed from.

However, I also wouldn't want to close off that possibility, because, though I'm no longer desperate for affection, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to a relationship. Should I just ask her to hang out sometime? Should we start hanging out in group settings first? I don't know how to do this type of communication with people, because in the past I have always been too anxious to approach people in general, let alone girls I have a thing for.

141,"I’ve worked for the company for 7 years total, and a branch manager for the past 14 months. Moved to a different franchised location 6 months ago, and needless to say, it has not been as fantastic as I had hoped it would be. However, I have not received any verbal negative reviews of my work, or documentation indicating that my work is anything less than satisfactory. I regularly work 60-hour weeks, showing up early, staying late, working on my days off, etc. I am paid a salary, so no overtime issues for my employer. 

I had started applying to other locations, and received an interview. Out of professional courtesy to my current employer, I informed him that I was looking elsewhere, and had an interview lined up, but would work out my September schedule, as it had been finalized for the month, and it is easier to work t out than move it all around. 

My interview was this morning, and I received an offer of employment two hours later, which will start in October. Bear in mind, this interview and job are in another city, and I have not been in town, let alone in my store, today. 

One of my assistant managers sent me the finalized schedule for September this evening, and I am not on the schedule after September 16, which would indicate that I will not be working those last two weeks of the month. At this point, I have not handed in my notice of resignation to my boss, and he has no reason to terminate me. This situation does not violate any conditions of my employment as detailed in my employment agreement. 

My question is this: can he stop my employment mid-month, with no termination pay, no grounds for termination, and no resignation yet? All he and I have discussed is that I had an interview coming up elsewhere.

145,"Im not sure how to start so I guess I'll introduce myself? I'm 19 and in college and live with my father during the summer months. Only problem is, he makes me his labor slave and refuses to say anything uplifting about me. To my face, to my family, or anyone. When I say he treats me like his labor slave, I don't mean he's making me do a few chores and I don't like it. I mean, he's making me do *all* work that needs to be done inside or outside of the house while he just sits inside. I know that doesn't sound bad but he doesn't ask, he demands. He also told me that it's my ""job"" to do anything and everything he said and that in order to live in his house I have to work for it, though my aunt and extended family have come to my aid by saying that I'm his son and my living there shouldn't be conditional. When it comes to my sister though, she has to do literally nothing. She's a typical princess, with my dad wrapped around her finger, to the point where she's getting half of my family contribution for college. On top of all that, he's extremely picky and controlling when it comes to how I do these ""jobs"" so if I don't do them exactly how he wants me to, he gets angry with me and tell me to go back and do it right even though I accomplished the same goal with a different path. 

The worst part is, he can't bring himself to say anything good about me despite doing all this work for him. He always assumes the worst and expects the least from me, and when I show him I'm more than that and I'm proud of my accomplishments, he finds everything negative about it and shoves it in my face. My extended family see it and have confronted him about it but he's so arrogant that he won't listen to any opinion that doesn't agree with his. He does it so much and I feel so defeated all the time because of it. Literally nothing I do can or will gain his approval. All I can get is beration and disapproval. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I've talked to him about it personally but I don't think anything is going to change, and if it does, it'll probably be for the worse. He just got angry and started yelling at me. I would move out, but I have college coming up soon and no source of income + living in Portland so rent is expensive as hell. I just don't know what to do. What options do I have?

I don't want this to make me sound like a spoiled brat cuz I'm far from it. I'm refused everything I ask for even for the smallest things like food.




TL;DR: Father uses me as his tool to manipulate into doing whatever he wants because he feels my living there needs to be bought. He also doesn't do anything but berate, talk down to, and speak negatively about to anyone at any point, even if I have a great accomplishment. It makes me feel like shit constantly and that I'm never good enough. I and my extended family have confronted him about it but he just gets angry with me or ignores my family. I don't feel like his son. And I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have the funds to move out or anything and I'm in college. What are my options?",31Aug2018,1
146,"So recently I’ve started noticing that the family in the flat across from me are a bit... loud.

A few days ago, I’d just come home from an errand and as I’m unlocking my door, I thought I heard their kids scream crying, a man yelling something quite loudly (I have audio processing problems, so I couldn’t make out exactly what he was saying but I thought I heard him say something along the lines of “I ______ pushed him” or “That’s why I pushed”)

I lingered in the corridor for a while to eavesdrop and make sure the kids were alright, but after a while they turned the TV up and I can’t hear anything anymore. About an hour later the man and the kids (2 kids, very young, like 5 or 6?) went out to get shopping and everything seemed normal.

It’s 8am where I’m at now, and I can hear the kids crying again through the walls, as well as the dad (?) shouting at them for crying. I can’t make out what they were saying, but I heard the kid crying for his mother and saying something like “I don’t wanna”. About half an hour later, the dad and one of the kids left again and everything seemed normal?

I’m concerned, but also wondering if I’m just paranoid as I do forensics and have seen my share of abused children. I don’t see them up close very often as our schedules are different so I can’t get close enough to examine if the kids have any signs of abuse. 

Also, I am an only child and don’t know the first thing about children’s behaviours, so I don’t know if they’re just fussy and the man is just trying to tell them off or something.

I’m not sure what to do, or if I should do anything. The noise doesn’t bother me, I’m just concerned for the welfare of those kids (and possible wife/girlfriend too? I’m not sure). How do I distinguish the two? Where do I draw the line and call the police to check up on them (without making it obvious is me since I’m the only neighbour that lives within earshot of them)?

149,"**TLDR: My SO's mother is strangely cold and then very childishly excitable and then switches to overly demanding his attention and smothering him (Changes from day to day). She's so paranoid that it affects her daily life. I need some help to point me in the right direction. What could this be? What can we do to make both our relationships with her to go smoothly? Should we be concerned?**

I'm confident that she has some kind of mental health issue but I don't know where to begin with finding out what it might be so that my SO and I can navigate our relationship with her. She's a great woman and I like her very much. I want to have some sort of basis with how to go about supporting my boyfriend's interactions/relationship with her. He says she makes him very tired.

She gets \*extremely\* paranoid to the point where she cannot drive properly anymore. She drives so slowly that it's a hazard on the road and swerves out of the way of people waiting to turn onto whatever road she's driving on.

She is very anxious all the time and behaves in a flighty, nervous manner. She talks fast and disjointedly, doesn't like people over-hearing her on the phone at all and mumbles into the microphone when on the phone to my SO to the point where he can't understand her.

She can be very cold and distant and then will be ALL over him, calling him non-stop over and over again when he doesn't answer, sending multiple texts in a row asking him to answer and calling him pet names (which I think are endearing, but they make him uncomfortable). It's very clear to me that she loves him \*so\* much, but she can't express affection physically and won't hug him or anyone. (That's fine to me but I thought it might help paint a picture of her to include.)

She rarely helps him out with money, lifts anywhere or anything really (which is absolutely fine, of course. He thinks it's strange though because my parents help me out all the time. Maybe it's just different parenting styles?) If he's struggling, there's a 30% chance that she would help him out. But then she goes and smothers him when it suits her. It's very confusing for him.

She gets very childishly excited about things sometimes, shouting in happiness/excitement.

I know that she had a very traumatic and at least an emotionally, psychologically and physically abusive upbringing, so I know this is likely to have contributed. Apparently her father used to make her comb his hair for \*hours\* when she was a child. He was apparently a narcissist and literally a psychopathic type of person. I don't know much more about him than that.

She's a very intelligent woman who I believe would have thrived at university if she'd gone.

She has a phobia of psychiatry and psychiatric hospitals/wards because her brother was committed to one in childhood and came home from it with worse issues than before. Apparently he behaves like a 'zombie' now. She attributes this to the psychiatric hospital. She apparently used to see a therapist but refuses to use medication and is \*very\* against anyone else taking any psychiatric medication. She is estranged from everyone else in her family and her sister stalks her. (I'm not sure whether she actually does, she certainly has reached out to her but I don't know whether it's just innocent attempts at contacting her or whether she's actually malicious and stalking her.)

My SO's mother seems to regard him as the pinnacle of her life's achievement and gushes about him to almost everyone she meets, including me whenever I see her. But then turns around and doesn't contact him for a couple of weeks until she blows up his phone again.

Apparently when she was pregnant with him, she threatened suicide after the father left her and my SO's ex-step-dad begged her to get an abortion as he didn't see her being fit for motherhood. My SO's father agrees with this. They both call her crazy.

Like I said, she's a lovely person and I like her very much. It's just that she behaves strangely and it has me and my SO scratching our heads a lot of the time.

I know that the best way to find out would be for her to be diagnosed by a professional but I can confidently say that I don't see that ever happening.

158,"So over a month ago, I talked to a couple of our friends who were able to take time off to go to the seaside next week, 3-6 of September. My boyfriend agreed, I called, made reservations, and transferred a small deposit to the place. In the meantime, I found out another friend and her family would be there too, was glad.

Now, I'd been telling my boyfriend constantly to let his work know he would be taking those days off, and he put it off forever. Probably cause he felt uncomfortable asking for more days off (we had another vacation recently this summer that didn't go as planned cause he got terrible food poisoning).

So the dumbass decided to tell them *yesterday*. Literally 3 days before leaving. And you guessed it, they said they don't think he can go, because a big, urgent project is due end of next week and they need him for it.

I got extremely angry at him when he told me this, because it was his own fault. If he would've told them in due time, they either would've said no outright and we'd had made other plans, or they could've found someone else to do his work for a few days. I'm really stressed out already and this shit was just the cheery on top. I can still go, but have to pay for the whole room and well, be the third wheel (both friends there are couples).

After much arguing (mostly me being pissed off), he said he was really sorry and admitted his wrong. I know he feels bad, but I can't help still being hung up over this.

Now, I thought I could give up on seeing these friends and try to reschedule the vacation for next Saturday through Tuesday, because of course I wanted to go with him too. But I checked the weather and it's gonna rain and be colder. My friends are saying to come with them anyway and are also mad about him doing this, but I don't know...

everything is nice and looking good now, though. I didn't give them a rating  because they do everything via FB (They only have a FB group, like most piercers where I live. piercing culture is not big here and having a website is extremely rare, if it even exists) but I wouldn't recommend them to people really. 

Also, they contacted me a few days later to check on me and I'm TERRIBLE at confrontation (working at it) so whenever I tried to say something to them, I just coulnd't say it properly or ""loudly enough"".

Now last night, they messaged me and said they were in desperate need of money ...like really really need money (I've been noticing a lot of offers and stuff on their FB group lately as well) and they need people to go to them to get pierced so they can make a bit of money and they asked me to just post a review on this other gigantic FB group where people sometimes post reviews and whatnot.

now obviously, if I post a review it won't be a good one and it would drive people away tbh. but then again I keep thinking what if this is actually serious? they're a bad piercer but not a bad person and I  wouldn't want to hurt someone over something as little as a piercing, what if this money is for a life or death thing? and there are so many good reviews and people were happy with their piercings (admittedly, my piercing was complicated and VERY uncommon where I live while theirs were mostly nose or ears or belly...etc common areas)

but then again, I can't make people go there.

and yes a review on that group is likely to make a difference, that's how I found out about them, didn't even know they existed before then.

What do I even do?

 I was thinking I'll just tell them that it's a secret piercing and my friends/family don't know I have it so I can't  post about it publicly.

Thank you if you read so far.

\*tl;dr: Had a bad experience with a piercer (infection + crooked piercing) and they contacted me last night (about a month later) asking me to post a review on FB because they desperately need the money. It sounds serious.  But if I write a review it won't be good because I won't lie (many others had positive experiences though) but like I said, it sounds serious.....but I still can't ask people to go there.

I recall that that it was faith in God that allowed me to quit these addictions in the first place, because I used to pray to God to give me strength which allowed me to push through these addictions. Now, it's really tough for me to fight back my urges, since I don't know where to draw strength from, and pure will power and grit isn't working for me. But now, I feel completely lost, almost like I'm depressed. I keep pondering as to why I'm here in this Earth. It used to be that this life for me was only a way to transition into Heaven, to an eternity of pleasure. Now, I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with this short span of 75 years on Earth. It's just that, faith used to keep me happy. It made me content to know that there was a person up there who I could share all my problems with and would grant me everything I asked for. Religion kept me positive. It kept me optimistic. It made me feel good to know that I was a good person because I followed everything God told me. 
 I would love to be a believer again, (and I know this is sounds r/iamverysmart) but my intellect isn't allowing me.",31Aug2018,1
171,"Welp here it goes, I’m a 17M on my senior year in high school. And I’m attracted to a good friend of mine (17M). For some background we go way back, we were like a Pb and J sandwich. I guess I’ve been subtly growing feelings for him over the time we’ve spent together. I never told him how I felt, just to keep things from being weird if he wasn’t ok with that. So about two years back I moved from the area, about 80 miles away, and we kinda kept contact. Ya know a few convos here and there, reminisce about the old days. But eventually he came out. And I told him something along the lines of “me too dude I’m a bit disappointed we didn’t hook up”. And he was cool with me feeling that way. Anyways, I was back in town for a night. We were both staying at a friend’s place, and after everyone passed out we got down to business. After that we called it just “dudes being dudes” and like nothing serious. After that night it sparked back feelings I thought were dead. So here’s my situation, it’s senior year we’re both about to be adults. I was thinking about moving back to my old hometown after school because a different friend offered to rent a place together. I figured maybe I could spark some kinda relationship or something with my friend. But I’m pretty sure he’s going to college out of state. And I don’t know if he’s really interested in me or if it was a spur of the moment kinda deal. I have no clue what I should do. I want to tell him how I feel at a concert we might go to, but I’m like ready to burst and just lay it out at this point. I’m terrified of saying something that’s gonna sound really retarded and fuck things up between us and for him to distance himself from me. Plus, since he’s probably moving out of state is it worth it to bring it up? I would just talk to my friends about it, but everyone gets super uncomfortable when I bring this up. So uh yeah, help?

174,"(TL;DR at the bottom)This morning I dropped my girlfriend off at school. We are 19 and in college. I’m a male. As soon as we pulled up to the drop off this group of black dudes started looking at me funny. I read situations well and these guys were shifty. I gave her a kiss goodbye. She gets out of the car and I drive away (I would have stayed but there were a bunch of people around and it was broad daylight so I wasn’t too worried about her)

As soon as I took off they apparently started screaming at her “AY YO IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR (unintelligible word).” She at first heard the word “lizard” but we think it might have been “brother.” Anyway they kept screaming at her as she just walked to class minding her own business. This was in front of a ton of people too. (At least they didn’t follow her.)

It really rattled her, and myself upon hearing it. I’m kind of a thin nerdy white dude. And this morning I was dressed a little weird and my hair was a little messed up. I really had no idea what these guys were trying to say about me...or us. I just find the whole situation really weird. I don’t know what they were trying to accomplish but they certainly rattled me. These grown ass adults acting like children. Took a big bite out of my self confidence. 

TL;DR: Dropped my girlfriend off at College. Group of black dudes looked at me weird. I drove off. Black dudes yelled “AY YO IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR (we think they said brother but aren’t sure)” to my girlfriend. Took a bite out of my confidence.

Any advice on what they were trying to say/why they would say it/ how to deal?

175,"Hi, I recently found an old booklet in vintage/antique shop in Downtown Gresham, Oregon titled The Kitty-Log, 1916. It’s pretty strange and at this point i’m leaning towards it being some sort year book. Let me explain.

Whoever originally owned this booklet kept it in pretty good conditions, other than the rips and tears paper and discolouration on the cover (which is just some thick green paper being held together with yarn) it looks pretty okay. If this was published in 1916 then it’s in really good conditions though the last owner jotted down some sort of suspicious stuff in pen and pencil.

Okay, so there’s about 7 pages dedicated to only the female students of The Library School of Western Reserve University, it includes their picture, names, where they lived and kind of weird poems like one comparing a woman to a fat, rosy cheeked baby and talking about her love for a cat, also adding “While when still in cribs she would cry to trade bibs” Freakishly enough the last owner wrote in above her picture “Died almost 1959 on trip to England” 

almost?

The last owner did a lot of stuff like this, writing their death dates or street adresses and one of them the name of their divorced husband. But whenever i tried looking them up i got nothing except for one who may live in Maryland. 

The address led me to an apartment there which makes me want to call and see if I can get any info on the woman or her family, if not then maybe the school and see if they have any records of the staff members that were mentioned in the book. 

My mom looked it over with me and told if it was her great grandmother in this book she would definitely like to see a photo of her and read it. I figure if not then maybe i get some more info on this for my own satisfaction.

So, should i keep it and do what i originally planned on doing which involves me taking it apart, or attempt to contact these people? if so, does anyone have any advice on getting in touch with the members of their existing family if stuck at a dead end? Also, Does anyone know what this is? I’ve googled it and not a single thing comes up. ",31Aug2018,1
176,"I F/28 have lied about having a University Degree. When I was 18 y/o I didn't get the scores I needed to secure my place in my University course. I was immature and too focused on boys and irrelevant things. All of my friends got what they wanted and were moving on to better things so I decided to do that too and attempt University in a couple more years once I was more mature. I moved to the capital city, got myself a full-time job (waitress at a 5 star Hotel) and lived in a nice flat with my best friend (who was attending Uni). Through her I lived the Uni life, attending student parties, social events, parties at our flat, meeting Uni kids etc. I had the perks of a Uni life, without having to study, and I was earning £400-500 a week working. However, I was embarrassed about not being a student so I just allowed people to believe I was one of them. My best friend knew I was embarrass so she too just nodded and changed topic if anyone assumed I was a student. I kept this up for 3 years. It didn't feel like I was lying because no one ever asked me about my studies, if they did I mumbled something and then talked about something else. 

By now I had considered attempting University but I kept delaying it. When I had enough money saved I decided to relocate to a different country and take a stab at trying to work towards what I actually want to do in life - education. I moved to a knew capital city, knowing no one. It was an opportunity for me to introduce myself and tell the truth. I couldn't. I got a job as an assistant in a school and I kept my lie going. It was easier this time round as we are all adults and no one really cared. Luckily, when I apply myself I am extremely bright and I love to read so I never come across as uneducated when people meet me. 

Last year I began a relationship with a colleague from work. When we first met we were friends and he knew me as the girl from abroad, studied X at Y university, works at Z and lives 5miles away etc. We are still together, almost hitting the year mark and I have a strong feeling he will be my future husband. We don't often talk about our educational background but I'm pretty sure if I told him I have no degree or have I been to Uni and that I have been pretending, he would be gobsmacked and perhaps disappointed. Along with all of my other friends that I have made at my new job.

190,"My fiancé and I are getting married next month - the night before the wedding, we’ve reserved two cabins near our venue - one for those in the bridal party affiliated with him (who happen to all be male), and one for those in the Bridal party affiliated with me (who happen to be majority female). I invited my good friend who will be reading in our ceremony to stay in my cabin, and let her know her boyfriend is welcomed to stay in my fiancé’s cabin with the rest of the guys if he’d like, but we didn’t have much space left and he may be couch crashing it. (With her, we’re at max capacity in my cabin.)  She said she would love that, and he could bring an air mattress and it would be great for him to stay with them, and that was that. Last weekend, she invited my fiancé and I over for dinner and to see their new place. It felt like the dinner party episode of The Office. It was painfully uncomfortable. Weird, passive aggressive comments, my friend was acting suuuper out of sorts, being very loud and ‘jokingly’ confrontational, and her boyfriend was uninterested in talking to us AT ALL. It wasn’t that he was being shy - he was being obviously judgmental of everything we said, which made us uncomfortable to try and keep on attempting at conversation. He seemed annoyed that we were there, and was overtly annoyed by anything she said. I don’t think either of them are naturally rude people - it’s obvious they’re at a really bad place in their relationship and kind of hate each other, immediately after buying a house together. Last night my fiancé mentioned, ‘Is there any way to ask him not to stay with us? Or for him to not feel like he has to just because she’s staying with you?’ And I don’t blame him. He was so uncomfortable, awkward, and rude that my fiancé doesn’t want our friends, some of whom he hasn’t been able to hang out with in person for a couple of years and are all very outgoing and kind, to feel pressured to make him feel like he’s a part of the group all night when he’s uninterested. I’m not really sure how that’s going to naturally come up in conversation with my friend, but I also want my fiancé to have a fun night with his friends the night before our wedding without having some guy who doesn’t want to be there sitting in the corner, who may not be a part of our lives in the next month or so. (I don’t expect their relationship to outlast the next year.) I’ve known this friend for 14 years, we’ve been close for the past 5 - she’s very sensitive, depressed, and I don’t want to hurt or anger her right now. This was only our second time meeting her boyfriend - the first time was at a dinner party in spring at our friend’s house, and he was interactive and fine. They’ve been dating for about two years now. I don’t know if I should wait it out, hope that he just loosens up, or if I should make up an excuse that I miscalculated space. I feel bad that I volunteered space in my fiancé’s cabin without reaffirming that this guy was okay - this is totally my fault, I wouldn’t want to spend the night with this dude either.

193,"Long story so let me jump to it.

8 months ago, I started working for my boyfriend's family business. Although my boyfriend's family business was successful through their friends and word of mouth, they had no online presence - no website, no social media, no advertising, no 0800 number, nothing. I basically did all of that for them. Everything. Purely because I was 'now family'. I even got them a new client in my first week. Anyway... his father realises my potential and wants me to work for them. He tells me that if I can bring them clients that I can take money from that project. I won't be an official employee or have a salary or be paid for my general skills. I only make money if I can bring a client and create a project. He did pay me £500 for the website, I won't deny that. But that's about it. They want me to work for them off paper, bring in clients and the project would be my income. No project, no income. It works great for them because they have me, someone with a masters degree level education, with a bachelor in marketing and communication, working all for free.

The issue: My boyfriend and I just do not get along. We break up for long periods of time and this happens very frequently which means I no longer have a job when we break up because I work with him from his home for his father. This happened so many times and the last time we broke up, it lasted so long and I had no money in my account, I was desperate and decided to start my own business in the same industry.

So I told my boyfriend about it last week when we had made up and he lost his shit saying I copied them and I'm evil? The business is purely online, it's consultation type of work, I know exactly who their clients are and he knows that I will never try to contact their clients or take anything from their business. He said that, that isn't the point and that he was mad because I stole their business model. The thing is... there are millions of companies who do this work. It's true that I learned the ins and outs from them but there are companies who are much, much bigger, big commercial companies who his father was inspired by. How does that make me 'evil'? They don't own this business model. I explained my situation and that I have no money. No house. No car. I am almost 30 and depressed. I said it wasn't fair that I would bring clients in for their business and when we break up, they take all the clients I bring in and I'm jobless all over again? Isn't that unethical? They aren't officially employing me, I have no stability and my job status depends on my unstable relationship status. It's been a year, almost, since my best friend died and I am just starting to feel my depression lift a bit and I'm not feeling sorry for myself, I'm just trying to do something but when I look at my boyfriend, all I see is someone who has everything, whose father is stinking rich attacking me who has nothing? I think they're afraid of my potential, they saw how I lifted the face of the company and brought a new client who was a complete stranger, so easily. I am lost as to whether this anger is because I am genuinely doing something unethical or they just don't want me to be successful and are using me.

Having said that, my boyfriend is a great guy. Just blindly loyal to his father but a great, generous guy. He gifted me a car once for no reason and I know for a fact that he loves me and wants the best for me. It's just his father that I don't trust. He is a savvy business man who puts his family with his current wife before everything and my boyfriend, who is from his first now ex-wife, isn't a priority like his other kids. Of course his father loves him and pays him well and takes care of him, but my boyfriend runs the company entirely alone because his father doesn't know the first thing about the internet and he has no share in the company. I just can't trust someone who won't give his own child a share.

I just want to know if others see what I am doing as unethical. Many thanks in advance.",31Aug2018,1

195,"My friend, we'll call him Z, has conflicting ideas as to how the story goes. The story is basically the Book of Revelation, but told in a spaghetti western style. I want to make the movie more as an allegory for it, but he wants it to be as accurate as possible. We reworked the story to make it a bit more accurate character wise (which was for the better). The other day I told him when we are acting like we shoot people don't do recoil, because I havn't seen many westerns that show recoil and that would add to the spaghetti western-ness. He responded ""I've seen plenty of westerns and all of them have accurate gun physics."" I responded with ""Which westerns?""

""I don't know. I don't really watch westerns""

He argued with me for about an hour as how I should shoot the FIRST FIVE SHOTS. The scene goes like this - 
Shot 1: he walks into frame in a peaceful forrest
Shot 2: it cuts to the ground as he picks up the sealed scroll (the camera follows him as he stands up)
Shot 3: it slowly zooms out as he opens it (starts as a close up of the seal but reveals the whole paper as it zooms out)
Shot 4: it cuts back to the wide and he is now in a burning forest
Cut to the opening credits

He said if i zoom in on the seal I won't see the paper and the scene should go like this -
Shot 1: walking through forest
Shot 2: pulls scroll out of pocket or harness or something.
Shot 3: shot of opening seal from over shoulder. So you can see the paper
Shot 4: cut back to wide shot of burnt forest

I told him the audience would be able to see the paper. 
""Not if you zoom in""
""I'm not zooming in I'm zooming out""
""But if you do that you won't see the whole paper""
""I'm zooming OUT. You are talking about zooming IN""
""What's the difference?""

198,"I had recently had a Football (Soccer) grand final last weekend. The score was tied 6-6 FT and no-one scored during extra time. We then went to penalty shootouts. When I was called up, our team was down 3-2 so the pressure was on. When I went to shoot, I stuttered my runup causing me to trip on the ball. The ball missed the goal by a long shot and, despite my team's ressasurance that it was bad luck, I felt ashamed and frustrated in myself. It wasn't the pressure that got to me, in fact I was feeling pretty confident up until that stage. It was a small thing that put me off was that when I walked up to the keeper's box, a spectator gave me a thumbs down and shook his head, laughing. Looking back on it now it is a stupid thing to mess with my head, but it worked because all I could think of is what I had done wrong when I hadn't even taken a shot. This isn't the first time something like this had happened to me; I second guess myself all the time when friends talk trash to me during friendly matches.

202,"Background:  I got a new job more in line with my degree about 10 months ago.  Took my horrible, anxiety-filled commute from 50 minutes to 5 minutes, but it's had some drawbacks.  I've been trying to cope with a psycho boss, but it's not working out well and has actually led to a re-emergence of some mental health problems on my part.  The salary is good, the hours are extremely flexible, and we had thought we might buy a new house here.  Now that I'm not sure I'll stay at this good-paying, flexible job, the new house idea is gone.  

Me:  I'd like to move away from Oklahoma so that my husband and I can find jobs in a place where my degree actually means something and we can both make a good salary.  In the meantime, I've been looking and looking for jobs here.  There is nothing for me in this place.  I have a graduate degree in economics and can do really great data analytics.  Unless I want to commute an hour and work in the volatile oil and gas industry, I'm screwed.

Him:  He has 'too much stuff and doesn't want to move it.'  It is too expensive to live anywhere else and we won't be able to get ahead like we would here.  We would immediately be taking on a large mortgage or high rent and be in a bad position financially.  In addition, we would not have the financial freedom to spend like we do now.  He makes pretty good money and has enough to buy all the toys he likes.  I also buy all the clothes, shoes, and toys I want.  We have a little savings and I can definitely return to frugal mode.

--Possible options that I can see:

**Try to find a job in the city and return to the long commute.**

*Pros*:  get away from current crazy boss; possibly get better-paying job.

*Cons*:  unknown unknowns; possibly get worse-paying job; return to horrible commute; leave a field I was starting to enjoy.

**Convince my husband to move out of this state.**

*Pros*:  get away from crazy boss; live in a place with values closer to our own; better-paying jobs.

*Cons*:  expensive to move; expensive to live; difficult to find jobs in a place you don't already live; no guarantee any job will be better there.

**Continue to closely monitor all my interactions with my boss in the hopes my boss does something fire-able and/or DO NOT ENGAGE.**

*Pros*:  save my company the boss's inflated salary if something is discovered; learn coping mechanisms for dealing with jerks since jerks are in every job; improve my skills while waiting for something in another department to open.

*Cons*:  continue to hate life; unwittingly engage in passive-aggressive or game-playing behavior; be hospitalized again for stress; potentially rage-quit, leaving me in a worse position than having a plan.

My request is for what other pros/cons I may be missing in these scenarios, in addition to alternatives I may have missed.",31Aug2018,1
203,"I’ve known this guy for a while and I’ve completely fallen in love with him, we spoke every single day and were very flirtatious with each other, recently he’s been very withdrawn and not texting me or talking to me the same way he used to etc.

Growing up, I was a pretty motivated person. I would do my homework the second I got it, kept my room clean, and would take pleasure in accomplishing things. In the last year or so, I’ve stopped feeling any of that. I simply don’t care anymore. 

I don’t grocery shop. I live in an awful mess. I pay my bills late. I turn in assignments late. And it’s not like I don’t have the funds to pay for things. Sometimes I’ll just be laying in bed thinking “I should really pay rent right now it’s due tonight” and I simply just cannot muster up the willpower to get up and open my laptop and press a button. I just can’t do it. I feel like I physically can’t do it. The same can be said about literally any simple task, texting someone back, doing laundry, going to the bank. I am aware that there will be consequences to my actions (or inactions) but I just absolutely do not care. And I think it might be slowly ruining my life. 

I feel like it might sound like I’m depressed, but I don’t think I am? I have a job I enjoy and a great social life. For the most part I think I’m a really cool person.

212,"So I am an European living in South America in a small village and I have been here since two months or so. Yesterday went to work but the night before there was the bar opening of a close friend and we got pretty fucked up like super drunk. So next day I went to work pretty destroyed and confused. So during mid-day there this guy coming to the office (work in a small tienda that rents stuff) this guy comes up and tells me my boss owes him money and that I should give it to him. I said no he can come by later and talk to my boss. Then he came closer and close like really fucking close to me and starts talking random shit I was sitting on my desk looking at him his appearance was obviously a little dodgy. So we finish our chat and he leaves pretty fast saying that he comes later to check it out. After he left the neighbors called me to talk to me telling me that this guy pretty frequently robs people or Steals stuff and he did that before at their office before I came. So she asks me if everything is still there because she saw something under his shirt when he left. I start thinking Where the fuck is your backpack you had it for sure. After 10 minutes I was sure this guy stole my backpack from under the table, I still hungover af start to freak out a little bc my passport was in there. So neighbour offers me to guard the business for a sec while I go to police and report this guy. I went to the police talking to them and after a minute they knew who it was she talked something in her radio and 10m later two policemen show up with the guy not having my backpack so I tell him look there's nothing super value in it so I offer you to bring it back tomorrow and I will tell no one. The guy said no he didn't take it. I went back to work pretty fucked up still and kinda furious. I finish the day and close the office and I go home with all my stuff in my hands. And at home there is my Fucking backpack waiting and laughing for me. So now I denuncianted a guy who didn't do anything, everyone in the village know that I fucked up and  I have to clear it up somehow but since the day started I don't want to come out of my cave. I feel really bad about all that and can't think about how fucking stupid it was but the neighbour triggered me and I was kind of out of my mind. Maybe you guys have some general advice what to and maybe minimize the embarrassement and still live here without having a bad feeling about it. ",31Aug2018,1

217,"A year and a half ago, I was looking for an apartment following the fairly traumatic end of a 10 year relationship - I was just finishing my Masters and did not have a sure job lined up or a clear idea of what I wanted to do next, so the cost of rent was a big concern, particularly in the city I live where cost of living is incredibly high. I ended up in an apartment I was initially cool on but grew to love, and my roommate and I became very close despite not knowing each other before.

This past February I saw a mouse in the apartment. We're on the top floor of a 4-storey building, and the exterminator the landlord hired said that they were clearly getting in from somewhere else in the building. Because of this, there is little I as a tenant can directly do to prevent them - the owner's association needs to take action. The landlord's agent assured us they were looking into the matter and supposedly actions are being taken.

Over the past 8 months, singular mice have been appearing at random intervals - sometimes within a week or so, and sometimes it will be months and I'll think the issue is resolved - until the next one appears. Some have been caught in traps the exterminator has set, others I've seen running around and one I even caught live in a pot and carried outside. I call the exterminator every time and they come in, look around, set more traps, and say they've plugged all the holes they can find but reiterates the issue is the building. 

My roommate has seen mice in the stairwell as well so this seems true, but I don't know if there's really nothing else to be done in our own apartment. Legally the landlord does have to respond to pests, but I'm not sure if I can claim they aren't doing enough or not, since they have brought in this exterminator, and are paying for his visits.

Last weekend I stayed at my boyfriend's and when I got home Sunday, decided to wash my sheets. It had been several months since we had seen a mouse in the unit, but there had been a dead one in the building stairwell. I pulled my pillows off the bed and noticed some dark brown pellets, and immediately got nervous. Sure enough, when removing a bit of knitting I'd left on the bed off, I saw a dark brown shape hit the floor and immediately run behind my bed, and freaked out. I spent the afternoon calling the landlord's agent and then every exterminator that was open trying to get someone to come out, but was unable to find anyone available.

I told my roommate when she got home and she was nearly as upset as I was, and we began brainstorming what we could do about it - requesting a new exterminator, asking if we could be allowed a cat, and so on. We talked about moving out too, but were unsure we could find something affordable - even less so if we were looking for places individually. We made an appointment with the exterminator for the following weekend, I set more traps in my room, and tried not to think about it when I went to bed each night.

Two days ago as I was getting ready for bed, my roommate asked if we could chat, and then told me she had decided she was ready to move out on her own, and had even put in an application for an apartment she had seen that day - available Sept 1st. She assured me whatever she did, she would give 30 days notice. I immediately went into panic mode trying to figure out what I wanted to do.

On the one hand, the apartment is pretty well priced for what it offers, and the location is great for both my work and social life. I would likely have no issue finding someone else to take the other room, and moving can be very expensive and stressful - September is a very busy time of year at work and I wouldn't want to add to that with a move.

On the other hand, the mice issue has also become quite stressful and it's impossible to know if and when it will be resolved. I like my current roommate a lot and we live together fairly well - it's risky to roll the dice on a new person. I have also become a bit uncomfortable with the dynamic between myself and the landlord's agent (we do not have direct contact with the owner) - there was some tension over the end of our year long lease this where they wanted us to sign a new full year lease, but legislation stated that we were allowed to go month-to-month after the end of the lease. They got quite pushy about the lease and we were able to reach a compromise but it was very uncomfortable, and left me feeling less than good about their integrity.

A friend of mine is looking for a new roommate Oct 1st and has said if I let him know before he finds someone else, I could move in. His place is pretty nice, a bit cheaper in rent, and has most of the amenities my current place does (only one bathroom though), plus the common area is fully furnished (half of my place's stuff is my roommate's). It is, however, further away from my work, most of my friends, and other places I currently enjoy having easy access too. I'd be adding at least 20 minutes to my commute to work and more than doubling the trip to my boyfriend's.

The kicker is that I would have to decide today to put in my 30 days notice and avoid fees/overlapping rent, and that is a really big decision to make so quickly. There's a chance my roommate will not get the place she applied for and so she would stay for the time being, but continue to look for a place and move when she got one. But if I ultimately decide to move, my friend's place that's available now may be one of the better options out there, based on the current market.

So I feel stuck trying to make this very difficult decision about my whole life situation with very little time to weigh the pros and cons. Last night I was convinced I would move, but this morning I'm not so sure. If it weren't for the mice, I am confident I'd stay, no questions asked. But it's no fun dealing with dead mice every few weeks and starting at all the little noises and movement when I'm home and just want to relax. So /r/Advice, what do I do?",31Aug2018,1

Then a couple of days ago, I came home for lunch 40 minutes earlier than my usual lunch break and caught her blowing a guy on our couch. She finally let me take her to a detox facility the next day, because at this point, I didn't care if she had to sleep on the street.

On the phone last night, she said she's mostly only going to treatment to save our relationship. She said I'm the last person she has, and that if she loses me, she has no reason to live. So do I tell her we're done now, or let her reach a certain point in her recovery before I make it clear there is no us? 

If she checks herself out of detox, she's 3 hours away from home with no car, no cell phone, and no phone numbers, so it would be on me to go get her. So I can refuse, obviously. But then she'll bully me into letting her back into my home.",31Aug2018,1

224,"For context, the spicy part of my conversation was essentially ""X definately thinks her boyfriend is an idiot that needs to be mom-ed at all times"" and both X and the boyfriend are close friends of over 5 years and in said group chat. 

I have appologized to both of them, and while X has mostly stated that she is hurt but ultimately just needs some time, her boyfriend is a more introverted dude who is not especially open about his emotions etc. 
After phone appologies to both of them (he didnt answer, he was working), he simply replied ""its ok, dont worry about it"". 

Normally I'd just let the dust settle, but I am really worried that it isnt actually totally ok with the boyfriend. X has revealed that his being ""kind of"" upset made her more upset than she normally would have been, but didnt reveal if it is a case of him being upset at her or at me. 

I wish I could know what he really feels so I could give a more precise appology. I feel absolutely terrible.

225,"Okay, this is going to be a long one.

Basically, I’m unsure if my dad is treating me badly or not.
First off, I’m Male, 15, and white. I live in Britain if that’s required info too.
We’ve never really been that close, and I don’t really like him.
I know his father was not the nicest man, and he left the family partway through his childhood, so my dad never had a good father figure as far as I know. 
But he makes me feel really bad about myself, and it’s getting more frequent now.
He has never hurt or abused me physically as far as i can remember, besides a time when I was 7 and he picked me up by the collar of my shirt and yelled at me. I pissed myself, i was so scared.
He’s never swore at me or threatened me, and never calls me names that are that bad.
Sometimes it feels like I’m a wimp, and i need to grow up.
I’ll use a recent event as an example of how it goes. It’s what pushed me to write this.
We were on holiday in France, cycling around, pretty fun. We stopped for a few minutes to talk about the route. My dad suggests we take the route with a certified cycle route or something and I jokingly say to my Mum, “Seems like the best idea. Do you like it when your children are safe?” (Children as in me and my younger sister.) My Mum, I still don’t know now if she found it funny or not, wasn’t the best joke im sure, starts to reply.
Before she can, my dad turns to me and says, “What kind of nonsense question is that?” I don’t answer because I know it doesn’t matter what I say and I’m taken aback by the aggressiveness of his tone and reaction. He continues for a minute about how I am incessant and jabber on all the time. Thankfully nobody nearby couldn’t understand, i was embarrassed as it was.
He’s a nice man, fairly bad with social interaction but I’m sure we’d get on better if i was an adult. Possibly in the future we will. 
Anyway, sometimes it makes me feel so low, especially when it’s a fairly trivial thing compared to what others go through. I feel like a wimp and i don’t want to tell anyone about it.
He tends to get angry over little things frequently, and only what I do.
Which leads me on to my next thought, maybe im just an annoying child? I have tried to change the way i behave but I cant be formal with him all the time. Maybe he just doesn’t like me. Maybe I need to learn a lesson and my actions are warranted.
The only physical effect ive noticed throughout my life i can attribute to this is that i am very jumpy at loud sounds and they scare me for a long time.
In terms of emotional/mental things, there are a few I think are connected. 
1. I don’t want children when I grow up for fear of treating them the same way, as I have had no father figure to look up to or learn from.
2. I have noticed a lot of insecurities I have about myself, I am awkward also when it comes to social interaction.
3. I think I used to bully a close friend of mine when we were 13/14. It was never really physical, but I used to make fun of him and get really angry at him. I acted like a prick and when I realised I apologised to him, and we both moved on. We are still close.
I have noticed my mum standing up for me more the past few weeks. She and my dad never argue and she doesn’t actually stop him but it’s what has been making me feel like im not in the wrong recently. I tried to talk to her about it some months ago, but she told my dad and they both told me about how its only because they love me really and want me to be a good person. Still, didn’t change much. I still feel like shit sometimes.
Anyway, I need advice on how to sort this out. I really feel like I can’t tell anyone I know. 
Am I being treated badly? Or do I need to man up and grow a thicker skin? 
Please, if you want to know more then feel free to ask questions.
Thank you all for taking the time to reading this. It means a lot.

Frankly I hate his guts for how he was with my family when I was younger. I'd be happy if he wasn't the majority provider of the family. Plus my sister's didn't grow up with him when he was at his worst so they still love him. The house is entirely in my mother's name and he wants 100,000 from the house somehow before he leaves. Apparently it would increase our monthly payments by 150 if we do that. I don't know how we can pay the mortgage now since he and most of the money in the house. My mother is reassuring but I can't say I believe her since I never really kept up with the family finances.

Went out with friends, somehow rent/lease things come up.  I tell them how I don't plan on moving until after my business is up n running for at least 6 months. plus I am happy where i am living atm.  

Suddenly, my landlord calls me the other day, telling me he wants to sell the property and that he is moving across the country.  

another example
relating to the business i am opening, 

in early spring after signing the lease, the property management told me I would be in by June.  I excitedly told friends and family back then.  However, the previous tenants were evicted and are now being uncooperative with the management.  This has sparked a legal battle between the two... and has put me in limbo just waiting for them to sort it out... 

advice on what to do mentally ? it really messes me up because I don't want to jinx the things I work so hard on... but at the same time, what do i do in social situations when people ask what i am up to or doing ? i don't want to lie because that is not who i am, and i also don't want to make things awkward by saying ""i dont want to talk about it"".  how do i pend up my excitement without losing my mind ? Do i just say fuck it and get shit done and act like a silent bad ass lol ? am i just finding weird patterns to connect to my bad luck/let downs ?",31Aug2018,1
232,"As a female, it is no doubt that in a world where appearances set tones for your relationships/opportunities, things are stacked a little more against you for not being pretty. 

I know this is a universal rule, but it hurts a little more that, in addition to being viewed as prone to folly, weakness, inefficacy, etc. Not being physically beautiful makes these things even harder to overcome.

I've observed, time and again, that men with faces that have character are still valued and seen as competent, seen as having worthwhile feelings, opinions, etc. While pretty women have a higher likelihood of being smiled on by society, regardless of their actual competence or work ethic.

I am average looking, nothing super out of place or particularly offending, but average girls, especially my age, still tend to be pretty without trying. Growing up I had an androgynous face and my stronger features didn't begin rearing their heads until a lifetime of trauma and digestive disorders began really setting into my face. I look my age but have always had lines, bags under my eyes, a wide nose, and a very strong jaw, without much by way of feminine features to exotify or balance them out.

I have taken measures to be healthy, as I know health does a lot for someone's physical appearance, but for the most part it has just given me an, albeit, pretty nice body, but this brings me no relief.
No one falls in love with the way your body looks in shape while you sleep, they fall in love with angellic, feminine faces that have the correct amalgamation of genetics. They fall in love with thick, flowing hair and a face that smiles daintily, a voice that chirps and a delicate frame.

I look strong, and I am pretty strong for my size. I'm mentally strong, I am pretty brilliant, artistic, and good at making people laugh but I am not the girl next door. I was one of the guys until everyone started getting girlfriends or trying to fuck me because they figure I won't turn them down on account of my face, and want to try out my body but never commit to what's above my neck.

I want to be loved, and looked upon the way men look upon paragons of womanliness, with rounded cheeks and youthful eyes, but mine look haunted by all the things I've seen and I don't even have happy memories to comfort myself with.

My parents didn't love me because they thought I was ugly, men who are into my brain and personality try to turn me into projects to become a trophy wife but I am far too independent and my own alpha to be manipulated into the girl next store.

My girlfriends use me as a backboard for when they feel insecure, and often do not accept when I tell them how beautiful they are until I begin comparing them to myself and assuring them that they are well above average and perfect.

I just want to love myself I guess. How do I cope with this lifelong dysphoria? Sorry for the wall of text, I'm feeling pretty melodramatic today.",31Aug2018,0

He told me about how he doesnt know what hes doing with his life anymore, and that he feels like hes already done everything hes wanted to do in his life. He told me that if i wanted to break up with him over this, there would be ""no hard feelings"", although he would ""always somewhat care"" about me.. I asked him if he feels like he wants to break up and he said that he doesnt at all want to break up, but he feels bad for ""bringing nothing to the table except negativity"". Hes usually really fun and has an amazing sense of humor. He told me a few days ago about how if he wanted to kill himself, he would know exactly what to take in order to sleep and never wake up again and stated the exact measurements of substances ive never heard of that he would have to take in order to die..

In reality this couldn’t be farther from the truth. I have close friends and family members who are the best parents a child could ask for. I have zero objections to gay people raising children.

I'm a minor and i just wanna get it out of the way that i'm not in any way depressed or suicidal, just need help on what to do and i'm scared i will lose my sister (Not because of suicide or depression, but because my mom is getting out of hand and she might have to move out, which would mean i would hardly be able to see her)

My mom recently went through divorce and ever since she's been screaming at me and my sister every day, because of this and that, mostly stuff that can be talked out and there's no need to scream about. Yesterday my mom started screaming at me because i wasnt hungry enough to eat dinner and my sister couldnt take it anymore so she started screaming back at her and spurted out the whole truth, the both of them started crying and after a while my mom said we were ignorant toward her and her problems (She had breast cancer and we werent able to go see her because of work and school), and when she said that, my sister couldnt take it anymore so she went on a ""rampage"" towards my mom, went to my room crying, told me she'll be back in a while and just left the house. Afterwards my mom went to my room and hugged me and asked me to forgive her, i of course forgived her and she said she wouldnt scream at us anymore and would try her best to be a good mom again

&amp;#x200B;

The only contact i've had with my sister was once she left, i sent her a message asking when she'll be back and the answer i got was ""I'm not going back there for a while"", i know she's not gonna kill or hurt herself and i know where she is because i called her boyfriend and asked, i'm not scared of my mom doing anything as she wouldnt hurt me, and the 2 of us are ok, i'm mainly scared that my sister will have changed forever and she'll never start talking to my mom again.

&amp;#x200B;

i recently found out that prior to dating me he was sleeping with a 20 year old. i find the age gap gross for a few reasons (beyond the obvious - she couldn't even drink): it's part of a trend (most of her gfs were much younger) 2) we're both in a profession - university professors where we're around - young people and i know that young girls are always hitting on their male profs, even the ugly ones because of internalized misogyny/authority issues. she wasn't his student, it was legal, but just very gross, especially because i see the kind of harm my older male colleagues inflict on these women. 3) He weirdly lied about it when we first started dating. He was having difficulty getting it up and told me he hadn't had sex in a year; then it turned out he was fucking this 20 year old just months before. I understand he was embarrassed in the moment but it seems like a very weird - and unnecessary - lie to tell.

&amp;#x200B;

i honestly feel insecure too. i'm 31, i have no wrinkles, no gray hairs, and am a size 0 and yet many men my age won't date me because i'm too old. my bf is balding, has gray hair has a pot belly, and lots of wrinkles from smoking and somehow 20 year olds are going after him? 

&amp;#x200B;

but beyond insecurity, i just feel a little gross about the whole thing. and more importantly i feel like he's immature. he is broke, will not get tenure, has never had a relationship that lasts more than 2 years, and usually dates much younger woman and uneducated women (the girl he was dating before the 20 year old was a 25 year old sex worker).  i feel like, given his past, he is not capable of planning a future. i also feel like the fact that i have or am trying to have shit together (i have a good TT research job, will probably get tenure, am trying to save, etc.) will ultimately be a turnoff for him because he seems to go after young, less secure women. And I feel like the conversations we've had about adult things (kids, marriage, a house) now seem like they're on a shaky foundation. I love him very much but I can't help but feel panicked and trapped.

239,"I'm worried about my best friend in high school.  For some context, he's the kind of guy that always livens up the party with his jokes and his general loudness.  His sense of humor is quite dark and could even be offensive to some, but that's not what worries me.  What worries me is when he jokes about his own life.  He'll regularly comment on his mother hating him, yelling at him, refusing to drive him anywhere, punishing him for no reason (as in, no reason), and much more that I couldn't possibly all list here.  He's even joked about when his mother physically hurt him.  And not as in spanking, but as in having him kneel on hot rocks while having him apologize between tears.

It's hard to talk about this with him because he always frames it as a joke.  Some of the teachers and staff took notice and asked him if anything was wrong.  He responded by saying he was just exaggerating and it was all just normal discipline.  But I've been with him for long enough to know that it's not.  Parents yelling at their child for stopping a house fire is not normal.  Parents sending their high school child to school crying is not normal.  A child regularly joking about suicide is not normal.

I originally started writing this because I wanted advice on what to do, but I guess that part's pretty clear now that I've written it all down.  I know, I should have talked with him about this already but I've been too scared to do anything.  Everyone else has taken everything he's said as a joke so I guess I just thought I should too.  But I can't do that anymore.  I need advice on how to help him.  How do I start?  How can I help him?  How do I make sure he's getting the help he actually needs?  Is he also going through depression?  How can I help him there?  How do I make sure I'm not blowing this way out of proportion and everything is actually fine?

246,"Tldr at the bottom.   

I'm supposed to be going to college this September. I’ve been telling my parents and family members that I'm going to be taking psychology. Truth is I haven't signed up for any classes. The reason why is because I realized psychology isn't for me. At the time I thought it would be something I wouldn't mind learning. To an extent I am interested in it, but I don't want to force myself to learn something that I'm not necessarily passionate about. I do like psychology but as a long term thing I can't see myself doing it.   

I've always wanted to try out culinary school but I'm worried about how my parents are going to react. They know I've always liked to cook and bake. They've told me before that if I decide to go to a culinary school I'll be miserable working in a kitchen. They've told me that I can't make a proper living out of it. Their view on it makes me hesitant to tell them I want to go to a culinary school since they’re more likely to reject it. Which is why I've been lying to them. I've told them I've signed up for my classes. When In fact I haven't at all. The deadline to register and pay fees has already passed.  

I know they'll find out about it this eventually. It’s better to tell them about this soon rather than them finding out on their own.   

How should I tell my parents about it? I know I can't keep this up forever. Especially since it's nearly September. I know they'll be upset that I didn't sign up or pay for my classes yet. I want to tell them that I want to go to culinary school because that's what I'm interested in. I don't want to get emotional when I try to bring this up. I cry pretty easily and the moment that happens I can't seem to articulate my words properly and I don't get taken seriously. I don't know what their reaction will be. I also have no clue what I should do if they reject my idea of going to a culinary school.

Tl;dr: I realized I don't want to take psychology and would prefer to go to a culinary school. I want to tell my parent this but I'm scared of how they'll react. How should I tell them? What should I do if it doesn't work out?

247,"The question first arose a few months ago. I work in a fairly nice office building. All of our offices have glass windows, and since I sit facing towards the hall, I can see into the office room across from me. I generally try to avoid looking, but sometimes things happen in my peripheral vision that are hard to ignore. I saw two coworkers (a woman and her mother) talking, and the mother burst into tears.

I suppose at this point, I should mention that I'm a man. I don't know if that makes a difference or not, but I dunno, it might?

Later that day, I asked the daughter if everything was okay. The daughter said yes, they'd just gotten some news, but it was fine now.

It dawned on me immediately afterwards, though, that maybe that was completely inappropriate, and that it was none of my business? Not that the daughter seemed to think anything of it, but I also want to make sure I'm respecting peoples' boundaries.

Similar thing happened today; another woman and her mother (both coworkers) were in the office across, seemed to get into sort of a heated conversation (never loud enough to hear, though), and they both seemed super emotional afterward.

I wouldn't say I'm ""friends"" with anyone at the office -- very much by design, as I want things to be professional and respectful here -- but I have a hard time seeing people down, and I'm used to wanting to try and help.

Should I just mind my own business, pretend I didn't see anything, and act totally normal? Would it be inappropriate to just ask ""Everything okay""? I'm not really sure how to walk that line of ""being professional and respectful"", and ""watching out for and taking care of 'your team'"".

271,"I’ve been dating this girl for a year now and things have just gone to total shit lately. She has a bad family situation where, long story short, her parents are incapacitated and unable to help her do anything. Over the past year, I’ve spent many, many hours working in their house which is fallen apart because of natural disasters. I’ve done everything I physically can for this girl and she’s abused it to the point that I’m expected to single handedly work and not question it. I spend hours and hours a day working on things for her and her parents, but in spite of that her family hates me because I’m an ‘asshole’ for questioning what she wants me to do. If I dump her straight out then it’ll cause lots of issues for me socially, making friends choose between her and I and whatever else, although that should be fine and I’m relocating for school in less than a year anyway. We recently had an argument because she went through my phone and found me venting about her to our mutual friends and I was given ‘one last chance’ to prove I’m not an asshole. Her family seems to believe I’m the problem, but anyone else I ask tells me to get the fuck out of this situation and that I’m not an asshole. What do I do, guys? Am I warped or is this truly a bad situation for me? Sorry for this long winded ass post, I just don’t know where to turn. This post only scratches the surface of the number of literal sleepless nights I spent helping her with something like packing or doing yard work.

I’ll go in depth with this story because it just happened: At about 9:30 PM last night, she calls me and says she needs my help doing yard work. Fine, whatever. Her parents are both in their sixties and drugged out, so who the fuck else is gonna do it? They have (had) one of those Intex inflatable pools you buy at Target that they let rot, and now it’s just an uninflated mess of water, mud, and sludge. I am expected to single handedly use a five gallon bucket with a vacuum on top to drain out all the water and mud, dumping it a specific place in their backyard, and then drag the pool out to their curb at 9:30 PM. My girlfriend has the balls to tell me that I have to do it myself because the pool is gross and she refuses to touch it, even with work gloves. She refuses to be of any help whatsoever to me, whether that be finding me any kind of tools or holding the pool filter, or anything in between. There are so many examples like this and it’s hard to believe this isn’t fucking warped when everyone involved tells me I’m an asshole but everyone from my parents to my friends to literally anyone I ask.

tl;dr over the past year I’ve gotten to understand my girlfriends family life significantly better. Her parents are old and drugged out, leaving me to do a lot of the work. Any time I question anything about how I’m treated I’m called a liar and told completely in the wrong. Read the second paragraph for a story where my GF made me clean up a gross ass pool and wouldn’t do the smallest thing to help me bc she was grossed out. Lately, her and her parents have throwing around the notion that since my parents do not allow me to stay at her house all night long, i’m blantantly disrespecting her and her parents and that my girlfriend deserves someone who doesn’t have insanely strict parents (which I don’t.) They go as far as making up stories where hypothetical people call me a ‘pansy’ and disparage my parents and I by saying I might as well be a five year old. These are all tactics to get me to go against my parents, not to mention the ‘hypothetical people’ who she heavily intimates are my best friends. Should I dump her, or is this worth giving one more shot?",31Aug2018,1

I’ve always struggled with self confidence but it’s actually been getting better. A few months ago I met an amazing guy at a party. We were awkward together at first but quickly fell for each other. We’re still dating now but I don’t know what I should do. The problem is that I just never know how he feels about me. I’m not asking him to shower me with compliments. Just an occasional I love you maybe. He doesn’t know how to express emotion that well and I’m honestly wondering if he has alexithymia. There’s been times where I come to him upset, and he just watches me cry, he doesn’t know what else to say or do. Occasionally he’ll pull me closer to him. I feel like I’m writing sonnets of my love out for him, complimenting him not only on his appearance but on the little things that made me fall in love with him. Sometimes I feel like I’m the one putting in all the effort. I’ve always wondered how amazing it would be if he express his love for me like I do for him.

289," Long post, just hoping to get some advice because I'm hurt, anxious, and scared.

So,  I was engaged to marry this guy, I'm gonna call him Ex1. He had serious  addiction issues that didn't become apparent to me until after we had  been together for over a year, and I had accepted his proposal. About a  year into us dating, he got on a medical stimulant prescribed by his  psychiatrist. This stimulant made him very paranoid, and he started  abusing them. His brother and I got worried so we called his  psychiatrist and let her know, and she took him off them.

I've  been on a similar version of those stimulants, and after his doctor  stopped prescribing them, Ex1 started stealing them from me. After he  showed up to my place of work high off my pills, I decided to put them  in a lock box. One night, Ex1 decided to get drunk, and came into the  bedroom and asked me for some pills. I got nervous so I started  recording with my phone, and I packed a bag to go to a hotel. I caught  him on tape telling me if I don't give them to him, he'd take them by  force. Then when I tried to leave, he grabbed my bag and shook me (my  bag had the pills in them). I cried stop and screamed and ran out of the  house. I proceeded to call his mom and ask her to do something, because  I was afraid. She calmed him down, and I left. The next day I tried to  break up with him, asked him to leave the house (which we both shared  the lease on).

He agreed to leave, but  then kept coming back to the house. I asked him not to enter the home  without my permission because I was scared, and he refused to stop  showing up unannounced. So 4 days after the incident with the pills and  the bag, I went to the police station and filed a report. I showed them  the video of him threatening and attacking me, and let them know I was  scared. They said there wasn't enough evidence to charge him with  domestic violence, because I'd never reported him before, but they filed  the report and told me to let them know if anything happens. I had his  parents come pack up his things, and they gave me back his house keys.  He was still on the lease, but he sent a message to me and the landlord  saying he no longer intends to live there and he gives up the right to  the house.

A week later, I headed to the  store for 30 minutes, and when I came back to my house I realized things  were amiss. I live alone, but things were moved around, books were  missing from my shelf, a few decor items, the cash on top of my dresser,  and my medication were all gone. I called the police crying and  freaking out, they came by, I made a list of all the stuff that was  missing, and he said he would go talk to my ex. My ex admitted to the  police that he snuck in through the side door, and took the stuff. The  police arrested him and he spent the weekend in jail, and they recovered  some of my property, but not my medication. He's being charged with  felony trespassing and theft. Keep in mind, he's also on probation for a  DUI while this is all happening.

A  protection order was put in place against him for me. Ex1 got a really  nice lawyer (rich family), and the lawyer called me asking me a bunch of  questions about the case. I kept my answers very limited. He asked  things like ""if his stuff was in your house, is it justified for him to  come in"". I said no, and that it's not my job to determine that. He  asked me what was stolen, I said read the police report. Brief answers.

3  days before the disposition hearing, the district attorney created a  plea deal for Ex1, a pretty lax one at that. Him and his lawyer ask for  another disposition hearing 2 months out. They agree, and the date is  set. The victims impact agent assured me this is very normal for felony  cases. Then, a few hours after the first disposition hearing, my ex  fiance messages a childhood friend of mine asking the name of my other  ex boyfriend, we'll call him Ex2.

Now,  Ex2 happened 2 years ago. He was extremely abusive. And finally, after 4  years of dating, he locked me in the house and refused to let me out. I  called the police, and while being arrested he yelled and screamed at  the officer and refused to go with him. He was arrested for domestic  violence, false imprisonment, and resisting arrest. I got a restraining  order, moved states, and blocked him on every social media outlet. I had  to make everything private because this dude is stalker level crazy. I  was scared of him for many years and have been trying to keep my life  very secret so he can never find me again.

So,  Ex1 is asking for the name and contact info of Ex2. When my friend  asked why, Ex1 replied ""To talk to him about his mental health"". My  friend immediately blocked ex1 and sent me the messages. I contacted the  officer on my case asking if this was a violation of the protection  order, since he was contacting my friend about me. The officer said he  would talk to Ex1. Ex1 refused to speak to the police, and told them to  talk to his lawyer. The lawyer said that Ex1 is collecting evidence for  the case. Which seems odd because, wouldn't the lawyer be trying to get  that info, not ex1?

So, what could be  their angle on this? Why are they trying to get the name of my abusive  ex who was also arrested with me as the victim? I'm scared that if they  get in contact with him, this will give ex2 info about me, and the new  state I live in.  Could I  somehow request that the defense not let my other ex know what state I  live in, because I'm genuinely scared he might find me. Any advice is  appreciated.",31Aug2018,1

293," 

TL;DR My therapist has helped my PTSD, but now she thinks I’m being literally attacked by demons, and that I need to become a Christian to fully recover.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice. My therapist has begun pushing religion on me, and I’m not sure what to do.

First some context. I do not associate myself with any religion. I served in Iraq in 2009-10, and I struggle with PTSD. I only started dealing with it this past January when I started seeing a therapist that someone highly recommended to me. Also, I didn't hire her has my therapist knowing that she would eventually apply a religious slant to our sessions.

Up to now, my therapist has been great. She’s very good at listening to what I have to say and finding connections that I could never see on my own. (“Have you ever noticed you feel about *x* the same way you feel about *y*?” for example.) I’ve been sleeping better, I’m having way less nightmares, and I generally feel more energized. I even stopped taking my antidepressants a few months ago. In general, I’m way better off than before I began seeing this therapist.

But things are starting to get weird. Last week she told me her theory that she thinks I’m being physically attacked by demons, and my PTSD will never fully go away unless I deal with them. I asked her in no uncertain terms if she meant what she said in a literal sense, and she said yes. I am *literally* being attacked (she may have used the word *assaulted*) by actual demons. She says I need to find my faith in Jesus Christ, and only then can I be healed.

On a side note, she also went off on a bit of a tangent, and she explained how recently she was in a therapy session with a former devil worshiper. She was trying to “deal with” her client’s \[literal\] demons (not sure what exactly this means), and the air pressure in the room increased so high that she couldn’t breathe. She said she had to say a prayer to make the air pressure return to a normal level, and during the prayer her client’s eyes rolled into the back of her head.

I’m not sure how I should deal with this. I want to keep religion out of my therapy, and to me this is not negotiable. She has helped me a lot, but I don’t think it would be a good use of my time to go down this path. I also don’t want my therapy sessions to turn into religious debates, which I don’t have the time nor the inclination for. If I hire a new therapist, I'm taking the risk of hiring someone who won't help me as much as my current therapist has.

How should I deal with this?",31Aug2018,2

I’ve decided on a name for my little girl, Mairi, which is the Scottish form of Mary. It was in a book I was reading and I fell in love. The struggle I’m having is that the correct pronunciation is MAH-RI but I’ve found online other pronunciations; one being MAY-RI. I really love the way MAY-RI sounds but I’m torn because it’s not necessarily “correct”. I’d love advice on which approach I should take. My heart or what’s correct? Also, which do you prefer?

303,"My girlfriend went to 6-form in the UK, she boarded from Ukraine so she hasn’t got a EU or UK citizenship. Shes just finished her 6 form this year with pretty decent results, she applied for lots of unis hoping to get scholarships which she also applied for.

Sadly she didn’t get any scholarships but got into every uni she applied for. Due to her legal situation and everything she cannot apply for loans and so on which makes going to uni seemingly impossible at the current moment. This is because tuition fees are through the roof and her family is in a pretty rough spot as of late because of having to move from Ukraine to Israel. So shes currently living in Israel and were trying to figure out how she can work this out, she doesn’t want to go to uni in Ukraine or Israel, and I cant really see any way this can work, but she REALLY wants to go to uni.

She could find work in Israel but regardless i doubt it will be enough even for 1 year of uni not including accommodation. Just confused as for what her options are.

311,"Sorry this is long: I recently ran into a co-worker I hadn't seen in a while since I'd been transferred to another building and while catching up they mentioned off-hand that they started up a shop in town, kind of a corner store/gift shop type thing.  I hadn't really noticed it before but it turns out it's a couple doors down from the salon I go to. I got my hair done yesterday and mentioned to my stylist about learning that my co-worker owns the store and she got a funny look on her face and told me about all kinds of problems with that business and that they're obviously selling hard drugs out of there. She said there's people clearly strung out who frequent the place, that you can ring a doorbell late at night to be let in, and that once she saw a woman on the sidewalk pleading with the employees to take a bunch of random stuff she had with her, likely trying to barter for whatever she was trying to obtain from them. Not your average gift shop behavior. My stylist absolutely knows the difference between pot activities and meth/heroin seekers and she's sure these folks are after harder stuff (plus pot's legal here so there's no reason to be sketchy). I'm sure my co-worker had to be 100% aware of what's going on because they mentioned to me that they have cameras up and they're constantly monitoring the place from their phone, even when at their day job (my place of work). 


A couple things: I work for ""the man"". Obviously no one should be engaged in this type of activity, but this would be a zero tolerance, throw-the-book termination and prosecution for my co-worker. Also, my stylist is worried about retaliation due to some other problems they've had with my co-worker related to the store. I'm worried for her safety, but also concerned about this kind of thing in my community, especially since she's mentioned seeing VERY young people who look very much like drug-seekers frequenting the place. Should I call in an anonymous tip? Do I tell my stylist even though she begged me not to call?  If I call, will my co-worker put it together that they got raided a week after they told me about the shop? Do I just let them keep selling speed to 12 year olds?",31Aug2018,1
312,"Long post ahead warning; mostly just wanted to vent but if those of you have advice much appreciated! 

So lately I've been struggling with what I think is a big issue for my generation now a days, which is finding a career. Just for reference I am a 19M who lives in Canada to a (slightly upper) middle class family. After high-school ended I decided against going straight to college for many different reasons (not confident in my course choice, wanted to better myself mentally, I didn't have a mode of transport since all colleges are 3 hours away by transit and NO ONE can drive me, etc.) So against everyone telling me to go even though I know knowing myself it would have killed me. So far I've finished my year and have accomplished a lot! I've become much more mentally stable, basically cured my depression/social anxiety symptoms, my girlfriend is moving in with me from Ontario, I've gained more life skills and job skills thanks to my grocery clerk position, and because I haven't been in school I saved up a pretty good amount of money over this year from my hard work. 

But now I've reached a certain point where I'm trying to figure out the next path to take. I've noticed that my generation seems to have the ideal that you should chase your ""dream job"" such as;  ""don't let anyone discourage you! Follow your dreams! Be a dancer! actor! artist!"" Which is all fine and dandy but really not realistic. We have an abundance of actors, artists, etc., but we still need other jobs which in my opinion are just as needed. Such as plumbers, carpenters, firefighters.. which you can find just as fulfilling and entertaining. Work is work, and if you want money, it takes effort. 

I'm kind of in the middle. For me I've searched and looked at other careers such as plumbing, electric work, or being a manager at a store but non have really 'clicked' with me, but when I do art it just feels right. I would gladly work 60 hours a week doing commissions, making YouTube videos, etc. But I know it is not a very viable position. It's like I'm stuck in the middle and both sides have their pros and cons but it seems like such an impossible decision if that makes sense? 

Right now due to company issues my hours have been basically annihilated. Started working from around 35 - 40 hours a week, going down to 30, then 27, then 20, now currently all the way down to around 18. And no I'm not getting fired I've been told many times I am a good employee it's just the circumstance but still, I need money, so I want to quit. I've also found the job has become very unstimulating; it's basically the same boring tasks over and over again, and one employee drives me up the wall which I have told my manager but it didn't get resolved. Right now my options are quitting and getting a new entry level job at something like Starbucks, or quitting and trying to make my own career out of my artistic talents, or keep the job I have at it's bad hours (which I don't think I'd like to do lol). 

But yeah that's where I'm at. I like to think I am a simple man with simple desires. Working a 9 - 5 job as something out of art  would be okay, it wouldn't make me miserable or anything, but I know if I could even just scrape by with art I'd be extremely happy with my career. Anyway those are my thoughts. What do you think? Is art a bad career choice even if you put 110% effort into it? Or should I just learn to be happy/okay at something else and just throw art to the side? I'd love to see others opinions or even your experiences with careers. Thank you!",31Aug2018,1

But over time I have just been worrying WAY too much about these things. Now every time I download a file or put my email somewhere I have to do a full background check on the whole thing to make sure it’s not harmful. And when I uninstall a program I don’t want I waste SO much time going through registry and other files that I barley have enough time to do anything else. And sometimes I even risk damaging my computer to get these stupid files out. Even if they are gone I have thoughts for about 3 days or so about whether it damaged my computer and go ahead and check all my software to see if it’s okay, in which, yes was always the answer. And when I’m away from my computer I’m on my phone checking every single one of my passwords and accounts paranoid that something will happen. The most recent time this has happened was when I downloaded an anti virus which I realized I didn’t want and deleted. The thing is I found a TON of leftover files for it, paranoid it would harm my computer (stupid right?) so I’ve just spent the last 2 hours deleting every last remain of that thing instead of doing something actually useful. And there are even some files that I actually can’t delete (WinSxs files, basically harmless) and even though I keep telling my self that it’s fine I always find my self back looking through all my files again.

331,"TL;DR: 

At this point I have the option to chose between an allround IT job in non-IT company vs a job at an IT infrastructure focused company. Advice needed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Non-IT**

&amp;#x200B;

I would be the only IT guy there, with some external IT companies that I can call and contact that are providing the infrastructure of the company. The core business of the company itself is very niche. That means I would be on my own, no expertise around me, finding my own way to stay up to date with recent technologies.

The pay is really decent for a starter, with a car and some extras included.

&amp;#x200B;

*Opportunities:*

* Autonomy
* Self guidance
* Learning new, non-IT, skills
* Satisfaction from the achievements 
* Feeling of achieving something

*Fears:*

* Losing my touch with IT
* Limiting my options long term

&amp;#x200B;

**IT**

&amp;#x200B;

It's a pretty huge IT company, with as core business pure IT. I would have a lot of expertise around me, with all the opportunities for self-growth.  The workflow is streamlined and well documented. The company is like a smoothly running engine after all those years. As they deliver services to other businesses, you get in touch with a lot of different infrastructure situations, what makes you learn a lot in a short period.

The pay is way less than the non-IT company, also with a car and some extras included.

&amp;#x200B;

*Opportunities:*

* Self-growth
* A lot of expertise around me
* Learning a lot of IT
* Variation

*Fears:*

* Less stable
* No autonomy
* No self guidance
* Less big picture

&amp;#x200B;

Do you IT guys have some advice about what option is better for the long term?  I'm trying to get some advice so I can make a well-reasoned decision.

335,"A few weeks ago I decided to take my car to a ""mechanic"" to fix some minor issues. The first time I brought my car to C &amp; C Auto, I asked them to fix my catalytic converter, to pass emissions testing on my 2002 Chevy Cavalier. Not the best car, I know, However it ran just fine before I took it to ""the mechanic"". The other issue was my coolant system having a slow leak, from which I refilled every to 2 weeks. So, I wait about a week, go to pay the bill which was about $600 dollars after labor fees and such. They replaced the converter, radiator, and a hose and called it good.

337,My long-term girl friend (17) has been having aniexty issues since freshman year. We're now Juniors and it's gotten to the point where she's having panic attack's daily. There is no source to this she has no idea why she is like that. Her parents are no help they refuse to acknowledge it as a problem.

339,"I'm a 17 years old, with anxiety and OCD. I've been homeschooled since I was in eighth grade, and I'm now in my senior year. I feel like don't have any motivation for much of anything, especially anything school related. The only thing that excites me and has me motivated these days is music. I don't have much hope for my future; everyone agrees that the pressures of being an adult is much make it worse than being a kid or a teenager, college is going to kick my lazy ass and I might flame out, and if I do make it through then I'll probably be barely scraping by or working for so much of my waking hours that I won't have time to do anything fun or for myself so I'll just be existing for the sake of existing. The chances of being to support myself as a musician would be pretty slim. It feels like with every new day it's all down hill from there. In school I was one of those smart but lazy kids, I just had horrible time management. So I left school thinking that I could do a better job. Ultimately, little has changed. I'm procrastinate a ton, never really studied, lazy. I don't think I'm better than my peers though, I know a work ethic is an important and very admiral quality, and I just don't have one, which makes me so ashamed. I just don't have motivation to do anything for school. On top of all of this, my mind feels like a mess, it's just a constant swirl of thoughts, most of them negative. I'm really insecure and have a pretty low self esteem which makes me feel like shit. And I'm also always thinking about myself which makes me feel like a bad person. So I don't know to do. I have got to go to college because my life will be much harder without a degree, but I'm so unmotivated. I'd like to go to a music school if I have to go to college but I know my life wouldn't be much easier with a music school degree, and maybe I'll change and be less enthusiastic about music as I mature. I feel so lost and the future doesn't seem good to me. Can anyone offer any advice?",31Aug2018,1
340,"So just a little background, my mother is a hairdresser and has done my hair for the last 18 years. When I moved away for college I had to find a new barber. So I have been going to the guy for about 6 months and he’s just okay. My mother was supposed to fly in to visit, and I was going to have her cut my hair. She gets sick and misses her flight, but I still needed a haircut since I’d been putting it off. So I go to my normal barber which is a walk in. The dude who usually does it isn’t there so I asked one if the other guys to do it. He basically messed up my back hairline on purpose, and scratched the back of my neck with his trimmer pretty bad. I feel like this was total overkill, as I explained to him why I needed it cut right away. What should I do? Find a new barber?",31Aug2018,1

I haven't had a one on one conversation with him, but I texted him the other night. He was at an event and was being funny and I commented on it. He responded with the same kind of sarcasm and I thought that maybe he'd be interested in being kinda friends with me at the very least. I didn't push the conversation and he was the last one to talk. He didn't start any convo over the next day. I realize now that it was a nice way of brushing me off. I feel so stupid for thinking that he would ever like me and that I'm pretty enough to attract anyone. I feel like I'm nothing.

343,"So for some background, I’m in low level management (shift supervisor) at my part time retail job. It’s a small store so there’s only about 10-15 people working here at a time. We always have our store manager, an assistant and two shift supervisors. 

The other shift recently left abruptly, and the store manager needed to find a replacement. He contacted the previous assistant manager to see if she was interested in the position. She had originally left to go to school but is available to work again.  She’s a pretty nice person BUT I hate working with her. She lied, slept on the job, showed up hungover, had attitude with lower level employees, etc. The current assistant manager and I already voiced our concerns, but she is already hired. The other team members who had worked with her are unhappy as well. I’ve heard of 3 people who are starting to look for a new job and I’m considering it. 

I need advice (obviously). I don’t want to see the store fall apart when we lose a third of our staff because this girl is terrible to work with. I’m relatively close to the manager and I’m willing to talk to him, but it seems like it’s too late. It seems like my only choice is suck it up or quit. If everyone who didn’t like her quit though, we wouldn’t have enough employees. I want to give my boss a heads up, but it didn’t work the first time I tried. I know I should just worry about myself, but I don’t want to see the problems that we had before resurface while also being short staffed if employees start leaving. ",31Aug2018,0
344,"My obgyn has now done two blood tests to check my elevated prolactin levels, which are potentially caused by a benign tumor called a prolactinoma on the pineal gland in my brain. She's having me do one more blood test just to triple check, but if the levels are still elevated, she's going to have me get an MRI done, probably see an endocrinologist, the works. I'm still on my parent's insurance, but I've gone pretty low contact with my mom for ...reasons. I'm guessing I need to let my parents know about the impending medical stuff that's going to pop up, but because my mom has a history of using every chance she can to revoke my autonomy, I'd like to avoid wording it in a way that would be excessively alarming so it can't be used to justify her coming to invade my life to ""take care"" of me. If a prolactinoma is found, I would technically ""have a brain tumor"" but they're common and rarely cancerous so I am not overly concerned, but if my mom hears ""brain tumor"" it's going to become a whole thing and she's going to throw my life into chaos so she can feel needed, so I have to tread carefully here. How does one go about letting people in their lives know about a health issue that probably sounds more serious than it is? Who should I tell? Is this even relevant news to tell people? If I had my own health coverage my instinct would be to address it without telling anyone and only let people in on it once all risk was gone or if it became actually serious and life threatening.

349,"Backstory; I have been trying for a while to figure out what is causing me to feel so tired and causing my IBS problems, but nothing was ever found, even after a CT scan of my abdomen and a colonoscopy. My sleep never really feels refreshing, and I went to have a sleep study done, but no apnea's were found, although I do snore very loudly.

Current Situation - I started using Flonase every day after having some congestion problems, and after a while, my nose started bleeding, and I just ignored it and used it more. After a while, I got vertigo and balance problems out of the blue, and likely got anxiety from it, making it hard to sleep.
I went to Urgent Care after feeling off balance at work, and they said one of my ears was infected. They gave me an antibiotic and sent me home. I took it for the period I had to, and noticed no change. I went back to Urgent Care and asked for more stuff to fix the problem; I was given prednisone and another antibiotic, which after completing my use, did nothing to help my vertigo. I also noticed my smell and taste were almost non-existent.
I went to my ENT, and he looked into my sinuses with a metal rod, and looked into my ears, and saw nothing apart from me having too much earwax in one ear, which he vacuumed out. He gave fluticasone to me and sent me on my way.
The anxiety with the vertigo was getting bad, and around this time, I noticed a lot of pressure in my head and behind my nose, and I noticed I now had double vision and bad Starbursts aroind lights, which was odd because my vision had always been perfect. I decided to go to the ER, and they said my other ear was starting to get infected, and they did a CT scan of my head and said that they saw blood around my pituitary gland, and sent me via ambulance to another hospital.
That hospital did blood testing on me and noticed that my prolactin levels were pretty high, so they assumed I had a pituitary tumor. They did an MRI and I waited there in the hospital, uncomfortable and still unable to sleep for about two days.
Multiple doctors came in asking me questions about my situation, and finally, the endocrinologist who looked at my MRI said that they couldn't see anything on the scan, and sent me home.
I stayed at my uncle's house for a week while my parents left for vacation after the scare was over, and during that time, I barely ate, drank, slept, and still had bad vertigo. I genuinely thought my death was near. Finally, I was able to eat some and drink some and came home to my house, but still could not sleep well.
Now, my eating is yet again bad, because I just can't eat or don't want to, the mild vertigo never goes away, and I get woken up constantly by panic or can't sleep at all. The second image in my double vision is getting higher, and it seems the Starbursts are getting bigger. The eye doctor at the hospital saw nothing wrong with my eyes. My muscles, including my arms and legs have gotten very weak out of the blue (my legs were giving out on me a few days when I was trying to walk around) and my hands are now very uncoordinated (I have trouble just pushing a button properly). My heart seems to beat extremely hard, and it makes my whole head move back and forth visibly. I noticed I had a low grade fever (101 degrees F).
My parents have told me nothing is wrong, and if I keep complaining, I will be kicked off all of their life plans (insurance, phone, etc) and I can just be a penniless vegetable in my room for the rest of my life.
I do have a good job that I enjoy, and I get 40 hours a week and love everyone there, but is hard for me to do even a few hours there like this, especially considering that I can't even get comfortable at home or enjoy any leisure activities that I used to; I am mostly bedridden.
I have been given anti vertigo meds with anti anxiety meds, along with Paxil, but I am not sure depression or anxiety are the root cause of my problems, but I take them anyway. Friends notice I barely talk or really do anything these days.
What should I do? I feel like I can't live my life anymore if this vertigo and sleep problems don't go away. I don't know where to turn or what to do.",31Aug2018,1

353,"So I \[20F\] just found out that my roommate \[19F\] went behind my back and signed a vacancy slip, and then afterwards told me. She also convinced the leasing office to waive the 60 day notice, so they told her that we could leave as soon as September 13th (only 15 days!!) . The issue is that I'm pretty dead set on moving to a different city to transfer colleges in the spring, and so paying month to month is pretty crucial to me, I can't be stuck in a lease. Then I went to the leasing office to talk to them about it and they told me that they already signed someone to move into my unit, but the security check hasn't gone through yet. 

This roommate has been a pain in the ass. She is loud until early morning, doesn't lift a finger to clean, destroyed the property/ my things...ect. She also has a terrible track record for not paying things, such as getting a DWI and wrecking her new car, going to prison, ect. So now I'm stuck with this girl and I don't even know if she's fully aware about how much the damage is going to cost, or if she'll pay it because she's convinced that she can argue her way out of it and they'll shrug it off. Right now I'm afraid I'll have to go into a legal battle

356,"My half-sister and I were never really close because our Mom struggled with addiction causing her and a few other siblings to be adopted out before I was born. My Mom met my Dad and eventually had me and the siblings I grew up with.

I first met my sis back in 2009 and things were always pretty awkward between us. We never really spoke to each other with the exception of a few compliments here and there, and a previous time she reached out to me when I was struggling with a major depression, but it was peaceful between us, nonetheless.

However, my life went to hell in early April, when me, my half sis, our Mom, and my brother went to New Orleans for an event. During the event, I realized the major disconnect between me &amp; my sis, but on the ride home I discovered something much more dark within me. I’m gonna want you that the story gets a bit incestuous from here on. I struggled between choosing the “Relationships” or “Family” flair became of this. I know she had been off &amp; on with her current ex, so I took a good look at her on the ride back and noticed how attractive she was. Nothing major hit me, but it was something I took note of and wondered how any guy could struggle with her (I found out later on).

I, for some unknown reason, wanted her to pay attention to me and I started getting down because I felt she didn’t really care about me. Oddly, I was kinda expecting her to start talking to me out of the blue. It got to the point when I had a traumatizing nightmare about here dying and having to live with the fact that we were never really close. I’d often post about being depressed and it turns out the entire time, she was trying to find out what was wrong with me. I’d frequently talk to my Mom about it, and she finally told my sis what the problem was, so she was so quick to try and fix that problem. She immediately made efforts to talk to me whenever she could and she tried making plans to go out and spend time together.

She’d also very frequently tell me she loved me and send me all kinds of hearts and kissing emojis when often texting me. I guess she just tried to make me feel wanted and I guess I ended up misinterpreting it for a different desire. Nobody had ever given me that much attention before and I had already established I found her physically attractive. I ended up growing feelings for her because of all this and it really bothered me that we were related and I couldn’t actually be any closer to her. I got really depressed when we went to the movies because I wanted to cuddle with her and hold her hand so badly, but I didn’t have the audacity because we were always with someone and I didn’t wanna weird her out. We went to see a movie twice. The first time we brought her ex and she ended up cuddling and holding his hand and I got really jealous and felt like my life was over. The second time, I’d lean it a bit (not too noticeable, though) and she’d turn her body in the opposite direction.

Another problem was her own addiction. She’s addicted to pain meds and buys them from a specific place. I ended up talking to my other sis about having a goal to help her become sober and my other sis is known to create drama, so idk what happened, but the main sis started pulling herself away. She didn’t wanna make plans anymore and she didn’t approach me as much. I guess this is my narcissism showing, but I felt like she didn’t have time for me anymore, and I would often throw childish tantrums or be moody if something didn’t go the way I had planned. I made a dumb choice and decided to tell my other sis about my crush on her and it quickly got around despite her promising to keep it between us. My main sis ended up becoming very distant then despite promising she would always be there for me and she’d always have my back no matter what was going on.

She completely left her ex for good around my birthday and he called child services to her with the goal to get her 3 children taken from her. I ended up trying to talk to her about her addiction and she took major offense because she assumed I was judging her by saying it was hard to tell if she genuinely wanted to stop despite knowing the consequences. She shut me out after that and she started ignoring me. We were a bit off and on after that and she ended up admitting she wanted to stop talking to me period. She refused to have personal talks with me and she would act annoyed when I approached her (because she stopped approaching me long before). I admit I did get a bit personal when talking. I’d always ask if she was okay and talk about her problems so I could comfort her, but she didn’t seem to like that. However, later on, I overheard her talking about never having anyone to talk to about her struggles despite all the effort I put in to get her to enjoy having me around, but I was practically forcing her to talk to me. She ended up blocking me on all social media after a big family dispute.

I felt wronged and the vengeful side of me took control. I ended up calling child services to her twice (the first time early on, as legit concern for her to get clean, the second out of complete vengeance). We haven’t spoken since early July despite living in the same house for the time being, but she’s about to move out, and today she found out about me snitching. She’s always had the assumption but it was confirmed today. I doubt she’s gonna confront me about it, but I feel really guilty about all this, and now I worry that things will never be even positive between us. My Mom is trying to convince me that she’s a very forgiving person, but that’s not what I’ve seen from her. I’ve only seen carelessness these past few months. I’m still hurting over the fact that she doesn’t even show slight concern for me. I honestly don’t think she’s ever gonna speak to me again. I’m feeling extremely suicidal over this entire situation. 

It’s just been a complete struggle, and what’s worse is that I’m still crushing on her despite the barriers (I’m 17 while she’s 26, we’re related making it morally and legally wrong, she doesn’t have slight interest in me as a brother much less a lover, and I’m lazy with no job or car therefore unable to provide for her or her kids if we somehow broke through those other barriers), so if anyone could help me out it would be greatly appreciated.

359,"I recently got a job at a fast food place and I've been super surprised by how weird people are being about it! 

Context: I just graduated from a top ten university with distinction, and landed a full-time teaching gig at one of the most elite high schools in the nation. I plan on attending medical school, some form of grad school for sure, and am therefore saving money like there's no tomorrow. 

I walked into this fast food place and saw they were hiring. Asked for an application. After hearing about my background, the hiring manager seemed genuinely baffled, asking why I would want to work there. I was caught off guard, I blurted out the truth: I need money for grad school! This seemed to satisfy her, and I got the job :) 

After telling one of my friends, however, he seemed genuinely concerned, saying there are much ""better"" ways for me to make the money that ""make more sense."" 

That hurt my feelings-I wanted to share what I felt like was a huge success with my friends. I had found a place that was willing to let me work part-time, around my full-time schedule, with weekends off. What more could I ask for? Sure, the uniforms are tacky, but what fast-food place's uniforms aren't? 

He made the point that my second job is literally two minutes walking distance from my first one (which is why I picked it) and wouldn't I be embarrassed if my coworkers saw me working there? 

Now I'm second-thinking things and more than a little confused. My parents are immigrants, my dad is now a respected physician, but things weren't always that way. He had to work fast food jobs himself to make ends meet, and didn't have a car, so his boss would have to pick him up for shifts sometimes. We used to make a game over who could pick up the most change off the floor at the grocery store. 

Basically, I've never, ever seen an honest dollar as something to be ashamed of. But now I'm worried. Are my coworkers going to think differently of me? Am I jeopardizing my first really, really great job that I'm passionate about and SO lucky to have landed? Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal?? Should I look for a different second job like tutoring or something? ",31Aug2018,638

371,"I didn't know where to post, but maybe someone here can help me. I feel like I'm in a major pickle.

I am an independent adult, who recently went back to school.  I decided to apply for and stay in the graduate student housing during my first year of my program. My permanent address was a place I was renting, and I tried to change my license to that address shortly before the rental term was up because I was required to renew my license (it was expiring, and the only ""proof of residency"" items I had were addressed to that location). 

&amp;#x200B;

In my state due to the whole real ID thing, they don't give you your license then and there, instead it is mailed to you several weeks later and you are given a temporary ID.  My temporary license will expire September 30.  


I moved out of that address a couple weeks after renewing my license and moved into the university housing, but did not receive my drivers license (it was returned to sender since I had initiated mail forwarding).  As I understand it, I can't use my college address as my permanent address for driver's license purposes.  I really need to update everything (student loans, drivers license, etc etc. with a valid permanent address).  


Ideally, I would switch back to my parents in state address (even though I just turned 30), but I don't know how I could provide proof of residency so that I can actually get a license / ID. Does anyone have advice for what I should do in this situation? ",31Aug2018,1
372,"Hey guys,

Small problem that's been bothering me for a while now.

I believe I have developed something akin to a strong fear of hurting othters' feelings during any kind of discussion, argument, or confrontation. 

I think it's because during my last relationship, especially close to its end (more than a year ago), my ex girlfriend usually got very irrational and personal during any kind of discussion, even small ones. She also often misunderstood what I said, twisted my words, and accused me of hurting her, while at the same time guilting or insulting me (after the relationship she was diagnosed with bpd, and I believe that explains a lot of her behavior). It was emotionally very exhausting and I often found myself questionning whether or not I said/did something wrong.

Know I can hardly find words if something bothers me of if I'm in an argument with another person, especially if that person starts getting loud, angry, or condescending. It's like my chest clenches in and I start seeing black before my eyes. I think the other person usually interprets this as me either giving in or being aloof/disinterestedin the discussion (I usually stay around, shrug, and don't say much, if at all in a deep, monotone voice while avoiding eye contact - basically freezing while internally panicking and hoping the situation stops as soon as possible), which doesn't help in resolving the issue.

What I'm trying to say is the fear is less about being sensitive/empathetic of the other person's feelings but rather being afraid of being hurt as a reaction of saying something accidentally insulting. I know it's irrational and most people aren't as sensitive (or/and aggressive at the same time) but the fear is still there and I can hardly cope with it. 

Note that I'm perfectly fine with having calm and rational arguments over the phone - I even prefer this compared to face to face.

Does anyone had similar experience and/or may have any suggestions on how to overcome it? I'm open for any advice.

Thanks!",31Aug2018,1
374,"This will require some background information. Here is the quick version: 

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago my Step Father abandoned his family (he had two kids with my mom, aged 6 and 9 at the time) and moved away to live with his own mother in NY state, leaving me as the only own who was working in the household out of 8 total people. Neither of my two adult brothers were working, but I was in my 3rd year of college and worked part time. A few months in, I couldn't afford to re enroll for my final year of school, so I dropped out and picked up a full time job which eventually turned into two full time jobs.  Out of 7 people, I was the only one working and paying the bills. My mom is more-or-less disabled and hasn't worked in about 5 years, one of my adult brothers had the same exact job as one of mine and refused to help pay bills because he was wanting to move out with his girlfriend (who also lived with us and had the exact same job as us, too), and my other brother was just lazy. Anyway, I gave every penny I earned to them for a whole year and only just barely scrapped by. My stepdad came back a year later. I quit one of my full time jobs and replaced it with a part-time one, and moved out within the week. It was the worst year of my life so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Present Situation**

&amp;#x200B;

My stepdad ran off again last month. Since last time I've saved up $11,000 and am looking to buy a house next year. My mother has been texting me, calling me, and visiting me unannounced to say that my stepdad ran off again and she needs money. I haven't answered her calls or texts, and I wasn't very welcoming when she came over with my brother (lazy one, who now is apparently a transexual now). I don't want to become tied to her again and lose everything I've saved up the last couple years that I've worked night and day for... but it's family. My mom says they're about to lose the electricity, need gas money, need grocery money. The works.

&amp;#x200B;

Dunno if I'm depressed or something, but I'm having a hard time giving a damn, yet it's all that's been on my mind lately. After my stepdad returned I never brought up the past for fear of him leaving again and sticking me with the burden of his family. I texted him just now saying that I'm not going to give my mom a nickel if he decides to ditch his kids again. In my mind, it's his and her problem, and I don't want a part of it ever again. But, it's family.

Needless to say, my very short and to-the-point text has stirred up more trouble. According to my stepdad he's still in town, my mother said previously he ""took off"" but also said earlier today that he's watching the kids while she herself spends the weekend at her friend's house. He's mad at her for telling me, She's mad at him for being mad at her... Just glad I'm not pretending to study in my room listening to everyone screaming while contemplating to kill everyone anymore.

I believe that if he apologizes it will be coming from a sincere place and I want to acknowledge that I accept his apology, but forgiving doesn’t seem genuine at the moment. I get tongue tied a lot so I like having an outline of what I might say in certain situations. Here’s one I came up with, but I feel like it’s too wordy. any modification or advice are greatly appreciated.

“I appreciate your apology. I was really hurt and humiliated by a lot of the things that happened during our relationship and by the fact that you weren’t upfront with me leading up to our break up.

390,"Cross post from r/depression I'm desperate for advice. Sorry if it's shitty of me to post the same thing on two different subs. 

 

(Sorry for the novel)

​

3  months ago, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. I was started on  5mg daily of the generic of Lexapro (Escitalopram). After no side  affects were observed, I was bumped up to 20mg daily. I've been on it  for over 2 months now, and very little has changed. I'm still having  very vivid, real thoughts of suicide everyday throughout the day, and  I'm totally apathetic to everything.

​

I  went to my doctor today, and he explained that I probably fall into the  category of people who don't see a marked improvement after taking  anti-depressants. I'm starting cognitive behavioral therapy on Tuesday,  and my doctor has also prescribed 5mg of an anti-psychotic (I forget the  name, it'll be arriving by mail in a few days) as a ""booster,"" which is  to be taken daily along with my 20mg of Escitalopram.

​

Here's  my problem. My condition is completely debilitating. I can't function.  My social anxiety is through the roof. I can't leave home alone, which  means my wife has to be with me. I can't mow the lawn, I can't go to the  store, I can't do anything. If I'm not actively occupying myself with  an arbitrary activity, reading; writing; watching videos; etc, that I  don't even get any joy or pleasure from anymore, then I want to do one  of two things; sleep, or die.  This poses a problem, because I can't  work.

​

It's been like this for a while.

​

Straight  out of the military, I was a full time student while working a full  time job since July of 2016. I coped for a year, but November through  December 2017 was a real low point, and as a result I flunked that  entire semester. I thought it was because I was overworked from work and  school, so I decided to quit my job in January and focus solely on  school. I was able to do this as I was using the Post 9/11 GI bill to go  to school, which meant that I was receiving BAH (basic allowance for  housing). My plan was to live off of the BAH to support my wife and  myself while she would also be working. We had more than enough money to  get by.

​

Fast  forward two weeks into the spring semester of 2018, half way through  January, and I find myself in the exact same situation I found myself in  two months prior only I had no job this time, and I was still unable to  function. I stumbled through that semester and just scraped by.

​

I  started looking at getting help immediately after that semester had  ended as I realized something was severely wrong, but I had no health  insurance and neither did my wife. I kind of moped about for a while,  sleeping anywhere from 14 to 16 hours a day, and then finally I found  out about Veteran's healthcare.

​

My  hope was that treatment would get me back to a good frame of mind, and  that I'd be able to start school up again this Fall. This was especially  important, because with just my wife working, we don't have enough  money to get by, so we need the BAH. Throughout the summer, we live off  of savings and her income, and then I'll be back in school for Fall. We  did this the year prior in 2017 with no issue.

​

Unfortunately,  I'm no where near ready to go back to school. It simply isn't feasible,  and I can't work. This means I wont be receiving ANY income whatsoever  from now until January (if I'm able to go back to school then). Our  savings are all but gone, and we can only afford to get by until the end  of September. We have no family or friends who can help, because I've  alienated myself completely from all of my former friends and family due  to my illness.

​

As  far as I understand, I'm not eligible for unemployment as I left my job  of my own accord. Are there any other options to get by here? Are there  any programs ran by the government (I live in the U.S in Pennsylvania)  that help in a situation like this?

​

Any advice would be massively helpful.

​

TL;DR: Savings gone, credit cards maxed, can't work due to illness, can't afford to get by. What are my options?

Went to second appointment (over 6 weeks later) and was told AFTER the appointment that the insurer did not cover chiropractic services under my plan.

 Called the insurer and they confirmed that chiropractic services are not covered under my plan (all they could tell me is I was likely given incorrect information the first time I called). Insurer will do nothing for me. 

Chiropractor is now telling me I owe $100 ($75 for first appointment $25 for second appointment) besides the $25 co-pay per appointment I have already paid. If they will offer a discount I will pay a reduced amount and be done with it, but I doubt they will agree to that.

Is there anything I can do to avoid paying them more at all? Frankly I feel like the chiropractor has been extremely unprofessional - they should have let me know prior to the first appointment (or at least prior to the second) that my care would not be covered.

Then, in about April of 2018, I decided to text her again. we met up a few days later at my place for a cuddle. When I met her in person for the first time, I asked what she's been up to, and she said that she has another cuddle date that same week and was going to show one of her friends how to give a good blowjob. This doesn't really bother me all that much, as I don't judge people for having as much sex as they want to.

So, anyway, we go to my place and cuddle. Our clothes start coming off, and it ends with me fingering her and her giving me a blowjob. Pretty fun, but the next morning she starts referring to me as ""babe"", saying, ""I miss you babe"", etc. Some time between our first and second meetup, she wonders if I am just not interested in her.

She tried to initiate a second time two weeks later. I got very apprehensive about meeting up for the second time. *Maybe it was because I was afraid of how she'd judge me for ghosting her, a mentally ill girl, for several months? Because I always get afraid when a girl shows interest in me? (Yes, this happens and it's bad.) Because I didn't find her very physically attractive?*

When I called her, we were talking, and she mentioned about how she had gone on a date with another guy and had sex with him. I said something that suggested that I had had good success with women since she last spoke, to which she was happy for me.

This prompted me to ask her if she was polyamorous, to which she said no, that she's just okay with having first-date sex all the time.

I eventually caved in and she met up with me again at my place (it's a 30-75 minute drive depending on traffic), although less action happened that time. After I finished my semester at school, we met up for a third time and saw Deadpool. I stayed over at her place but she was too tired for any action. **Now, I will admit - I do not find her that interesting, and I'm only somewhat attracted to her; she doesn't have any hobbies or interests, and she just works at a bar 30 hours per week. However, I would be cool with being an FWB with her.**

The third time she texted me, 1-2 months later, was in June. I was in Nebraska on a road trip. She asks, ""hey babe, what are you up to?"" I reply with ""just taking a road trip through the midwest, haha. What about you?"" to which she did not reply.

Yesterday, she texts me, ""hey babe, how've you been?"" To which a short conversation started and she mentions that she tried having a long-distance relationship and failed.

I want to meet up with her for a cuddle again, but I know that she's probably not my soulmate (I'm not very successful with women), but I have a few problems:

* I feel like I would be using her, unless we were able to agree to be FWBs or something.
* I have a hard time committing to her, because I have more and very different interests than her.
* I feel like I could be doing better.
* And, most of all, I live on my own right next to my college campus (with 44k students), and I feel like pursuing her would preclude me pursuing happier relationships with other women on my campus.

**So, I have a few questions:**

* How does she see me? A side guy? A second option? A boyfriend?
* Would it be okay to ask me if she could see me as a FWB/cuddle buddy?
* Why do I feel so afraid/nervous every time she texts me?",31Aug2018,1
406,"So i'm 16 years old, Turkish, which is known for being hairy (lol)

Since I was young I already started getting a mustache which I didn't shave, after I was like 12/13 I shaved it off and kept shaving since then, Started having beard aswell so shaved all of that too.

Now i'm 16, usually don't care but the problem is I have some patches on my chin and it looks so ugly I literally have to shave there EVERYDAY, but it hurts so much to shave when you got such short hair, is there anything I can do to let some hair grow on there?

I recently stopped shaving my mustache and started trimming it to 0.1 always because it does look decent for the minimal effort, but I can' do the same with my beard because of the 2/3 ugly patches...

Any help?

407,"I'm a university student (19M) and I'm taking Vietnamese for my language credit for my BA program. My professor instructed the class to go to some graphics/printing place in another part of town in order to buy our textbook due to some copyright or distribution issues with the authors of the book that didn't allow us to buy the book directly or even pay for a e-book or PDF version. 

So anyways, today I drove down to the place and the door was locked, so I called the phone number on the front door and asked to see if anyone was there. The guy came a minute later and let me into the store. It was a small space and he and I were the only ones there. As I walked in, he started making conversation with me, but he was asking really personal questions. Stuff like how many girlfriends I've had and if I took after my mom or my dad. I was definitely weirded out but didn't think too much of it because I was just there to get my textbook and leave. So he continues talking to me while I'm there, and as I'm paying for my book, he goes to my side, almost behind me, and hugs me from around the waist. He then proceeds to start rubbing my stomach while he's talking to me, and in my mind I was just thinking, ""What the actual fuck?"" I felt his hand go a bit lower toward my waistband area so that was when I was like hell naw and I jerked out of his grasp. After that happened, he went to go get the receipt and handed it to me so I just said thank you and got the fuck out of there as quickly as I could.

I think I'm set on telling my professor about what happened, and I already warned my classmates in our group chat about getting their book from the store, but I don't really know what to think or do about the situation. I'm just completely mind-fucked right now and I can't really process what had happened at the moment. 

Any help or advice would be appreciated, thanks.",31Aug2018,38

409,"So I just found out my sister is still purging. And has been for awhile. I know she went through bulimia as an early teen but know she went through counselling and help and though we found a way forward.  We’re now in our mid twenties.

But I stayed round hers for dinner and a)she said she still did an b) I heard her purging in he toilet at the end of the evening.

I am at a loss of what to do. I am the only one of the family to know. She lives with her boyfriend who does not know, and I don’t know what the right thing to do is.

She’s started developing more OCD traits I’ve the last year as well. Taking pictures of all the appliances before she leaves the house to make sure they’re not on and won’t burn it down.

I’ve tried to gently talk to her about the OCD thing but haven’t gotten through. And now learning about the purging I am just at a loss. I love her very much and want to help. But I do not want to alienate her from her boyfriend or myself or our family as whole.

What can I do? How can I help?",31Aug2018,1

So I saw a conversation on my husbands phone between him and his brother. I was using my husbands phone to call my own phone (lost it in the couch) and he got a text from his brother and it opened the convo- and my eye caught some words that stood out about women's names and how hot they were so I read it...
Basically: 
My brother in law just had a tough breakup, so my husbands advice was to not sleep with his ex cause that would complicate things. That seemed normal enough.. but then my husband started talking about all these girls he knows and works with that he could message to come hook up with my brother in law at any time, day or night. That they'd even blow him if he wanted. And then started telling my brother in law how hot one of them in particular is. These are all women my husband works with on a weekly basis- he's a DJ and they are bar tenders at the bars he works at... 
should I be concerned?? It's not sitting right with me.. I need advice ",31Aug2018,1
