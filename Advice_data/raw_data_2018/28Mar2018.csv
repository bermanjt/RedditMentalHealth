0,"This has bothered me for most of my time in high school and now that I'm closer to 18 it's becoming more of an issue. All my friends call me boring for not going outside and hanging out with them but whenever I do interact with them they're always toxic. They always insult me if I fail at something and make racist remarks bc I'm Hispanic. I know this is the real world and I should ignore stuff like this but it kind of feels bad coming from my friends. I like being alone, but I think eventually I'm going to need friends in the future. I feel like I'm in a no win situation and I need some advice. I'm sorry for venting and thank you for reading. ",28Mar2018,3
2,"I am a 22 y/o male who last May graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in BME. It took awhile but I found a job at the very bottom of a pharma company doing non-engineering work. 
When I first entered college I wanted to go medical, but dropped pre-med after I took my first couple engineering classes as I enjoyed them immensely. Now I find myself wondering if I will regret that decision.
I had a recent talk with my father and he encouraged me to pursue what had been my life-long dream of becoming a doctor while I am still young, even told me he and my mother would help with the finances of going back to school as much as they could. 
After some research I found I would need to take a year of post-bacc to get my classes straightened out, and I only graduated with a 3.1 GPA, so I would need to crush the MCAT to get into med school (right?).

I am sure I am not the only one to ave ever had this problem, and honestly it isn't a bad one to have, but ultimately my conundrum is, do I risk attempting to bring my childhood dream back from the dead, risking the progression of my career as an engineer should I fail? This decision would no doubt change my life as I would be able to move back home (I am in the north my family is in the south) and would be changing my career path. 

Obviously I will be discussing this with friends and family and have been for a few days now. But I am with a company I can move up in. I could be an engineer in maybe a year if that. Is it worth risking that? I enjoy engineering but ultimately wonder if I will end up regretting not pursuing my dream for the rest of my life. 

Sorry for the long post, hope you enjoyed my life story. ",28Mar2018,1

5,So there's my loving boyfriend whose a big giant sweetheart to me but I'm afraid he might be cheating. He seems off to me recently. He doesn't really talk to me much kinda ignores me making me repeat myself and it made hella depressed. It didn't think much til I say him with a girl I didn't know within our friend circle which he would never do since he isn't all that social. I've been having thoughts of him not feeling the same since I'm usually giving all my love. And pouring all I can.

6,"There’s this girl i’ve had a crush on but have no clue how to get talking to her. I have absolutely no experience talking to girls and I’m very nervous to. She’s younger than me (she’s a freshman, i’m a junior) She is on the track team although i’m on the long distance side and she’s a sprinter so I never really see her much. The only times I do see her is when she’s with a group of her girl friends. I feel that I could talk to her but I don’t think I can do it infront of a group of people I don’t know. I don’t really even know if I like this girl but I do think she is cute and I’d like to get to know her without seeming like a weirdo. I plan on maybe taking her to prom if I can muster the courage to do so.

I have her instagram and was considering talking to her that way. I’m worried she might find it weird if I do that though instead of in person. Not sure what to do.

10,"Face it right? Expose yourself to situations that make you face these.

The problem in particular can arise in different scenarios say bantering between male coworkers/insulting each other just messing around. I don't think that's a big deal.

It's the being wrong part that gets me. Like think of someone saying everything you're saying is wrong. WRONG! WRONG! I feel this mental block and it shortcuts to violence but I lost right?

For example(this is not meant to be political my bad) but the whole taking a knee during the anthem. I saw it on the surface about ""military, show respect, don't kneel, bringing attention to themselves"" but they were peacefully bringing attention to racial injustice. I didn't see this part. The person I was talking to wasn't yelling or anything, just saying it. I couldn't accept that I was wrong. I felt that mental block/rage arise.

It's ego right?

I find in these situations I avoid the conflict. I appease, and walk way/leave. That's weak. I'm not saying force yourself even if you are knowingly wrong but be able to handle the shit from others/being wrong.

I had a chance to be mentored by a pretty successful person in the engineering industry. Not just working salary but this guy designed his own fabrication techniques/products and lived largely on royalties from car companies. I couldn't handle this guy screaming/yelling at me when I was making mistakes. I did feel dumb/incompetent like my hands were fumbling, brain wasn't sharp. But this was good, this was the ""father figure"" possibly that I lacked in my life. But I didn't want to deal with it and essentially ran though caused by a different problem.

So the question is how do you get over this. I mean one thing is to automatically assume other people can/probably know more than you in some way or another. But I also wish I had that irrational self-confidence. But I usually assume/resort to feeling incompetent.",28Mar2018,1

I’m a college sophomore majoring in Neuroscience. It’s a difficult major so time management and self motivation are very important but I’ve yet to master this mostly due to a lack of motivation.

12,"I really don’t know where else to post this. This friend is 17, a high school senior, and gearing up for college. The problem is that his parents are overbearing, controlling, and narcissistic. Between the borderline verbal abuse and not being allowed to leave their 2 bedroom apartment (homeschooled, has 2 sibling). His older sister, who attends a nearby community college is explicitly told by their parents to talk to as few people as possible. They’re planning to send him to college next year for a program he wants nothing to do with, with the specific reason being they think it’ll get him a job so that he can start paying their bills. He’s never had a job in his life, has few social skills offline, and suffers from depression (untreated) and a seizure disorder (treated).

13,"My relationship with my mom has been rocky for years and she's honestly come a long way when I think about how she was in my earliest years. Still I have a lot of issues communicating with her because she can't break a kind of ""network"" of bad habits. She loves to dictate my feelings which diverts attention from actually solving any issues we have. i.e. ""you don't feel upset, you're just cranky"" When I finally get her to listen to my real feelings, she offers a barrage of ""solutions"" that never address why or how our feelings affect behaviors. i.e. ""just ignore that and be happy"" This, then, leads to shaming to a great degree when I make mistakes. It feels like all she cares about is that I know what I did wrong instead of seeking the underlying discussions I want to have about these mistakes. Hence the title of ""beating a dead horse"". 
To clarify, a great example is when I neglect certain chores. I have told her countless times, that I am aware that what I've done is wrong and can determine what should be done to fix the problem. But my issue runs deeper than not knowing what my responsibilities are. I tell her that I avoid things because I'm overwhelmed. I say that I have bad habits that are hard to break. I tell her that no one checks up on me until its too late. I explain that having others doing chores with me would make me feel less lonely. Still, like a broken record she recites the procedure as if I'd never heard it before. 
To make matters worse, when I am in the process of improving on my behaviors, she finds every opportunity to bring up the initial mistake. For example, I admitted to her that I was in a weak place and did not clean my house for a long time. She claimed that she understood and would not judge me no matter how bad it was. She then promised that she would help me clean and we discussed the feelings I was having. Only days later, she forgets all that we talked about and reverts to the same shrewd dictations which I just explained were not helpful. When I tried to remind her, she became very defensive.All of this was a major distraction to my action plan to build better habits.
I can tell that we keep talking past each other. What she wants is good results and what I want is emotional support to help me do that. Ultimately our goals are the same, but she seems to think that helping means saying the same thing over and over until it works. ""its not healthy to... You shouldn't worry about... make sure you... you hurt me when you..."" It gets old! While I understand that my reasoning isn't foolproof and I may not know the right solutions either, I am frustrated because I've been trying to progress. I want my mom to take some initiative too. How do I get these things to sink in with her? All I want is the ability to have a discussion where she doesn't placate me in the moment only to keep up the same tactics later. ",28Mar2018,3

16,"I went snowboarding this weekend and injured myself. What I initially thought was just soreness, and felt like minor pain on Monday morning has turned into a burning pain in my trapezius. I'm trying not to take too much medication for it, I've been taking ibuprofen and intend to go out and get acetaminophen.

I've been icing it and heating it and have been trying to rest it today after getting back from school. I think me working out yesterday aggravated it more, that's when it got really painful. (I stayed away from heavy lifting and any lifting with my shoulders but I did do some stretching).

Right now though it's so uncomfortable and it burns so bad, I can't even do my homework without being distracted by it. I was thinking I may need to go to the doctor to get some treatment but I don't know if it's even qualified as a good reason to call out sick from work.

19,"So I want to do nursing and i've done some research on nursing university courses. There are currently two universities I want to go to, but each have different atar score (the score that determines what course you want to go into) and are at different location. The universities being one is very close to me about 10 minutes away from me, but requires a low atar score (55, meaning im in the top 45%). While the other option is about an 1 hour away from me, but requires a above average atar score (70, meaning im in the top 30%). This university is regarded as one of the best university in my state, while the other is regarded as one of the worst in the nation of Australia.

Mind you these are times via by car, not public transport which take substantially longer. Despite me being 18, my grandparents wouldnt like me to live in dorms as they require my assistance at home and will worry about me if i do live in a dorm. 


So far, i've more leaning towards the closer one, but it has a low atar score which im anxious that the degree from that status will make my resume less appealing when applying for an Registered Nurse. But I really do love my grandparents and they are old and require my assistance, they also refuse to go into retirement homes. I also really dont want to travel that far, just thinking about the amount of petrol i have to buy too. Furthermore, ive got no idea how public transport works or to travel by it.

What would be the difference in studying a course at a particular university?
Would the degrees just be the same or does one represent a higher status than one, which could it heavily dictate my abillity to get a job of becoming an Registered Nurse? I heard theres high demand for RN, so im just scared that a degree from a lesser university will impact the chances of becoming an RN.

20,"For those of you who don't know Isotretinoin/Accutane is a vitamin A based medication that's prescribed to treat severe acne. I'm 20 years old now I've had acne since I started highschool, at first it was debilitating (I'm sure alot of you already know how shitty it can be) but now I've mostly accepted that it's just how my skin is, and I can lessen it a little by taking good care of my skin with monthly chemical peels and general good hygiene. 

But no topical treatment will ever give me clear skin. That's a fact. My body will still produce too much oil. A medication like Accutane is the only way I'll ever get rid of my acne, HOWEVER, and here's the kicker, this stuff has really bad sideffects, I'm talking yo baby gonna come out with half a head side effects. 
You're skin gets flakey and dry, it can dry out your eyes (this can continue even after you've stoped the medication) headaches of ranging severity, joint pain, bleeding from various orifices, suicidal thoughts (probably not helped by the fact you'll look like a fallout 4 ghoul for a while) ect. 

So my question is: Am I over reacting to the scary words on the side of the bottle? Has anyone here had experience with this or a similar drug? (I think Accutane is banned in the US but the generic brand is still available)

It's senior year and I've caught a bad case of senioritis (in case you didn't know, it's a term for being lazy as graduation nears), and it's a bit of a problem since I'm taking several AP classes and I want to ensure that no college rescinds my application because of my grades lowering. 
I just finished a major homework assignment in an AP class of mine but it's not over yet. While my other AP classes have just started reviewing, my AP Art History class still has more topics to get through (the most useless class yet it is the most demanding of all.)

She was always an extremely loyal, trustworthy, not a broad type girl...which is why I always was attracted to her. 
It troubled me that she had a thing with her boss. When we got back together I tried to give her an ultimatum to transfer to different district but took it back cause it seemed harsh. Her boss ended up getting transferred a couple months later and it seemed to be in the rear. This week however he has reached out to her to give her a job promotion offer.

28,"  Listen, I'm all for teachers bonding with their students and messing around. But that's not the kind of ""unprofessional"" I'm talking about. My PE teacher is the kind of unprofessional that makes me and others uncomfortable and awkward. He's very sexist. For example, he has said that women can't drive and that all of them cry irrationally and expect you to read their minds. Those are three harmful stereotypes that I'm disgusted he would perpetuate, especially around 6th graders. He also enjoys insulting students. One of my friends, ""John"", is usually the victim. My teacher usually comments on how dumb, fat, or useless he is, through passive aggressive comments disguised as jokes. Most of which, the kids in my class feel compelled to laugh at. Though ""John"" acts like it doesn't bother him, we all know it does. Those insults have caused other students to join in on harassing him. Another comment that really got under my skin was about one of my long-time (male) childhood friends. He isn't in my class, thankfully, because he's very emotionally vulnerable (school has made him feel depressed). The teacher claimed my friend talks like, and is just about as smart as, Forrest Gump. And I'm pretty sure Forrest Gump wasn't written to sound or act like any genius. This teacher also acts like we're just there to vent, he's like those teachers from TV that never speak about the actual subject and are fairy inappropriate. All of which my teacher does. He spent and entire class (that was cut to 30 minutes from and assembly, but whatever.) talking about romance or whatever. He explained that 1) Cheating is okay as long as you're not engaged/married to them 2) That all women will friendzone you at some point (he's a real r/niceguys) and 3) You should be emotionally abusive and manipulative to your S.O. by not allowing them to have friends of the opposite gender if they're anything near attractive. Because insecurity is SO charming and there's no such thing as a platonic relationship between a boy and girl. He also likes to poke fun at two boys in my class that are close friends by implying that they're gay ALL THE TIME. He also likes to make fun of an overweight girl in my class. Whenever she says she's excited for a game, he usually gives her a face like, ""Really?"" Get it?? Because she's fat? Haha, he's soooo funny. She usually looks a little unsettled after he does that. Not only is he very rude, he also doesn't even do his job. Some days he will keep us in, when we're supposed to be out, because we were too loud or he's talking about the stuff above. He also laughs at kids that get injured, or boys that are outdone by girls.

So now, I'm at a bit of a loss. I really want to report him! Even though there's a promise of confidentiality from the principal, I know that my PE teacher would know because all the stuff he says is specific to my class. I know that much because my friends in his Tues. &amp; Thurs. classes don't get any of this. Also, I have a bit of a reputation of debating him on his sexist comments and peers can usually catch me talking about how unbelievable he is. Transferring out of his class is out of the question for me. As much as I hate him, I love PE and it's the only class I have with my friends that I can interact with them freely. And I can't transfer this late in the year without a reason, which I'm too scared to give. I really don't want to be persecuted by my fellow classmates, because I know some of them kinda like him and I'd just look like a wittle baby to them.

So please, I ask of you guys to give me some idea of what to do, or give me a reason/confidence to report him.

However she almost never does it in return, even though she knows I'm more into it than she is, as I'm the one who introduced her to this. Before being with me she said she is used to being the submissive one, and it was only ever vanilla sex. I also know she tends to be a bit selfish during sex. She's halfway admitted to this.

However, I do not wish to have to ask for these things. To me if I have to ask, it feels very ingenuine. I want the rush of being ""surprised"" by her desire to do these things with me. Spontaneity. But because she doesn't, I've been growing increasingly bored, and would honestly just rather masturbate. I like the connection we share during sex, but the lack of lust during it kinda turns me off.

I have had this fetish my whole life since I was in primary school, I have a pregnant belly/bloated belly, round belly in general fetish. To me there is nothing more sexy than a round belly.

I also have a girlfriend I've been with now for 2 years and haven't told her about this before, I told her I like listening to her belly so when it's upset she tells me sometimes to listen as she plays with my hair, she doesn't know it turns me on quite a lot.

Is there something wrong with me?

How/Should I tell my girlfriend about this fetish?

38,"Background: I am a female in my late 30s, recently married and purchased a home with my partner. My partner and I do not have children, he has a teenager he has full custody of who lives with us full time.

I have acquired a “friend”at work who gets angry at me because I don’t want to go out with her. She is around my age but does not have a boyfriend but is she actively looking. She wants to get drinks or food or go on vacations or see movies every weekend and I just *don’t.* She texts me nonstop but her dating life which I have sympathy for but little input on since I have been with my (now) husband for quite some time now.

Under normal circumstances, if this was any other acquaintance, I would tell her I was working but since we work together she knows my schedule. Sometimes I say I have plans with my husband but she tells me I have my whole life to spend with him now that we’re married. Sometimes she goes as far as to ask what those plans are and will text me that day making sure I’m doing what I said I was. I can’t use the child as an excuse since she’s getting older and needs me home less. It’s wearing me out. I don’t want to go out. I don’t want to spend the money. I definitely don’t want to go on a vacation with her- I couldn’t even afford a real honeymoon with my husband. After a long week at work (with her!!!) I want to be alone and just decompress. The few times I have gone out with her we just talk about work anyway- by the time I get home I’m stressed all over again.

TL;DR- How do I tell my coworker I don’t want to hang out with her outside of work but also don’t make my workplace a living hell?",28Mar2018,3

42,"Hi all,

(also a longtime Reddit lurker but finally decided to get an account to ask this)

Something fairly basic here - there's a girl that I have a bit of a crush on, on my floor and while we know each other by name (after having spoken due to the use of shared equipment; we work in laboratories) we don't really interact much other than smiles when we pass each other by. Maybe she's just being polite, maybe not (I mean she does smile first sometimes if that counts for anything....). Either way, I think it may at least be worth a shot.

I understand some might advise against trying to date someone in the same place you work, which I wholly understand, but at the same time in a regular work day we would never interact on any basis anyways as we are all relegated to our own areas. However, that is also the problem - I never really have any real reason to try and strike up a conversation with her than if we both need to use something from the common lab equipment (which is sparingly).

I have tried a very direct approach in the past, where I pretty much asked a girl out despite limited interaction. That didn't really work out at all, so I'm thinking maybe I should try and take a bit more time here.

So - how do you guys think I can try and build up from this small connection into something potentially more (i.e. eventually ask her out on a date)?

Thanks!",28Mar2018,1
44,"Hi. A little background information: I'm approaching my junior year of college and will be turning 20 in two months. I have a 3.8 GPA, pay for my own apartment, and work nearly 30 hours a week (along with being a full-time student at University). 

Three weeks ago, I discovered that I was pregnant. I'm now nearly eight weeks along. My boyfriend and I have only been together a few months and were using protection. 

Initially, I was terrified. However, he convinced me that we could raise the child. Each of our friends and families know about the pregnancy and are extremely excited.

But I can't help but feel off. 

Lately, when I can't sleep at night, I find myself researching the abortion process. Statistically, I know my boyfriend and I have a small chance of ""making it"" as a couple. Additionally, what if this affects my ability to finish college? Am I setting both myself and this child up for generational poverty? 

Where I live in the U.S., an abortion is easily accessible until about 12 weeks of gestation. However, I'm not sure how I would feel afterwards. Would I regret that decision? Would such an option even be available now that our families know?

I'm lost and afraid. Any amount of advice or ""similar situation"" stories regarding any option would be much appreciated. It feels like I have no one to come to about these emotions, so I've resorted to the internet.",28Mar2018,9
45,"When I was a teenager, I had a very high sex drive (read: normal), so I choked the devil's noodle every day basically. Over the last few years I've cut back a decent bit since my sex drive isn't nearly as high (around once every 2/3 days). But I find that my sex drive fluctuates so radically in that time period.

If I go more than a couple days I'll be a huge horn dog, thinking about sexual stuff more than is healthy. And then if when I jerk off, bang, 110% interest lost in sexual stuff AND romance/girls in general.

I'm not a virgin, but this big fluctuation is causing problems with my motivation in getting to know a girl. I mean I hadn't done it in a few days so I was starting to get into a mood and I've got a date tomorrow that I don't want to be a horn dog for so I did it and now I barely feel like bothering going tomorrow.

Is this normal? I know it is to an extent but like... This feels like an unhealthy fluctuation. When I'm off I couldn't give less of a shit and when I'm on... Yeah. And the flip of the switch is so abrupt, I feel like I'd feel cold towards a gf after sex. Do other guys deal with this?",28Mar2018,2

Like 16 is too old to be going through the emo phase most of us went through. Anyway, while I half agree with my parents, I don’t want her to stop hanging out with her lgbt friends, as long as they keep their sexuality to themselves and talk positive things.

54,"As of May this year I will have failed my 3rd consecutive try at college. After going through 3 different college course within the past 3 years I have decided to give in all together. The thoughts of study and assignments just make me sick and to be honest I can’t wait to get out, the only thing is what do i do next. Since I was about 16/17 when I was in secondary school i always imagined myself going through college and coming out the other end with a degree and go on to live a successful life, however that hasn’t gone to plan, instead I feel like I have done nothing more than waste 3 years of my life trying to find something I would enjoy and could see myself happily doing.  I started off my first year in college studying software development as like many others saw great opportunities in that field, the only thing was I hated programming and well that’s a big part of it. After 2 months I saw myself back home and working back to square one to see where I could go next. From a young age I always enjoyed games and playing them and decided games development would be perfect for me, of course in the back of my head I always did know it would be very similar to that if software development but convinced my self I would like it because it would focus on games. Oh how wrong was I. I again found myself hating the course but I stuck out the year and finished my exams with not great results. 

Yet again I found myself back to square one this time looking at engineering, mechanical to be exact as I felt maybe sitting at a computer wasn’t for me and a more hands on job would suit more. So for a third time I reapplied for college and found myself enjoying the course more than the previous ones, however I always had the thought in the back of my mind saying do I really want to be here, I couldn’t help but feel college was holding me back as I watched everyone else progress and seem to get on with their lives while I was stuck. I slowly began to hate college, the constant pressure of deadlines and 9am lectures just didn’t appeal to me anymore and despite liking some aspects of my course I just began to hate college in general. Of course this took its toll and i failed semester 1. I continued on as a promise to my parents and since it was already payed for thought maybe i might get something out of it, but tbh I’m just floating by and I hate it, the only real good thing i got out of this year is that I met my girlfriend and I can honestly say she is the only good thing I have gotten out of these 3 years. 

So with college out the window I started looking at apprenticeship but tbh I don’t really like the sound of many the only real appealing thing is it’s not as expensive as college and you earn while you learn, however I still don’t know if I should go for one, I suppose I’m just afraid of failing again and that I might not like whatever i choose.  I’m struggling real hard to decide what I want to do with my life all I know is that I want to be able to take my girlfriend away and just travel with her but how do i do that without a qualification as it seems like the main thing you must have if you want to be able to do that. 

The one thing I know and have always known is that I wanted to be creative and do something that involves creativity and that’s what drew me to my course choices despite not working out. I also know I wouldn’t be happy in a regular job like working in a shop cause I would go mad. I just feel really lost and don’t know what to do with myself and I’m afraid that I might hold my girlfriend back and lose her. 

Going back to the creative thing I don’t know why but I have always been drawn to film and even production, maybe it would be something that would really suit me but again I’m afraid of failing and just don’t know what to do with my life!

We dated again then she went after my other friend) even after that she said she still loved me and I knew that was bull shit.

63,"Backstory: My father is fighting his second battle with non-hodgkin's lymphoma within a year and his support system is very small. Essentially just a few friends he has locally, his elderly and equally ill sister (~45 minutes away) and myself (~90 minutes away). 
His prognosis is not very good this time around, however we are still proceeding with aggressive treatment (possibly bone marrow transplant). While I am extremely thankful, the downside of this is the sheer number of short notice appointments, tests, chemotherapy and subsequent need for my father to have someone around full time.  I feel like I'm drowning in all of this and I have already exhausted most of my vacation time. I work full time and my management have been very understanding. They have accommodated multiple days off with short notice and have offered me compassion leave time if needed, however it is unpaid. 
Financially this is not feasible at all as already the increased costs of constant travel, parking etc is it's own burden of this mess. 
I also understand that since I am in a unionized position, there are contributions I think I am still expected to pay during a leave period (I will be clarifying this further with HR this week hopefully).
Financially for compassionate LOA's I know there is compassionate EI, which is a start but is only ~55% of wages. It is a start, but I don't think I could keep my head above water like that. 

My Question: Does anyone have any advice/experience with compassionate LOA's to offer? Were there other federal or provincial avenues to pursue to help with financial support?

65,"There was this guy in my tech theater class; I talked to him first, he asked for my Snapchat, things went from there. Our first conversation, he texted first, it was a long convo and then ended. He switched into Acting Theater and we didn't text on Snapchat for two weeks. I sent the first text and since then, I've had to be the first one to text. I keep the convo from dying, I usually ask the questions...

Now I'm wondering if I should even bother with him because he doesn't seem interested. 

He'll respond to all my texts and questions, even if it's 10-30mins later, and he sounds interested in the convo and me. He'll say stuff like 'if we went on a date, we would definitely go  do mini golf or a lunch date at the mall' so I have no idea why he would totally ignore me after the conversation is over. 

The other day, I was hanging out with my guy friend who asked to go to the park with me. We had a cute picnic and I posted it on Snapchat about how sweet he was being and the other dude, let's call him Terry, texted me and asked if I was done with him. This pissed me off cuz I haven't committed to either guys AT ALL.

68,"Let me give you some info so everything will make sense. (If you don’t want to read this part I’ll post the beginning of the issue down below, I just figured a little backstory may help). I am currently 25 and my cousin is 26. Growing up we were pretty close. Both female and having a small family we really only had each other. Sadly, she was difficult child. She was whiny and very selfish and that never changed even as she got older. She would always make everything between her and I competition. EVERYTHING. 

Any thing I liked as a child she started liking and collecting. She always had to make sure she had more friends than me or nicer clothes and the list goes on. She was always like this. Honestly, it was a little annoying growing up but it was easy to shrug off. Once we both became teenagers though she became crazy about it. Even though we didn’t go to the same school, she would figure out who all my friends were and message them to try and be her friend and even say bad things about me to make them dislike me. I have a bunch of stories like that but moving on. Eventually, we just grew apart. She was hard to be around. She was still bratty and selfish. Always caused drama. 

When I was 18 and she was 19 we went to the same school. She had dropped out so our family thought if we went to school together we could help each other out. We sorta became close again, but we had the same issues. Everyone knew we were cousins and her behavior again caused issues with teachers at the school (her arguing about not wanting to do certain assignments) but I just dealt with it because in June we were both going to graduate. She dropped out because she didn’t like doing the work and I finished. 
Of course because of this she became bitter and always made comments about me. 

ISSUE STARTS HERE 
She is constantly making comments about me every chance she gets. It’s not just the fact that I graduated and didn’t. She does everything she can to tear me down by making comment and remarks about me. She married really young so she could drop out of school and not have to work so she gets to stay home all day and do nothing and just shop and go travel places and because of this she is always showing off. 
I don’t know why it gets to me so much because if anyone else did it I feel like I wouldn’t be bothered. 
However, as soon as she makes comments I find myself feeling slightly envious and worthless which is ridiculous. 

It’s so petty. Example, she told me she couldn’t come to my birthday dinner because she couldn’t afford it. My whole family has there so I offered to pay because I didn’t want her feeling left out. She agrees to come and then proceeds to talk about this expensive trip she is going on and how that same day she was going out to dinner again and a movie! I was so irritated. She even makes comments about how much more expensive her clothes out to our other cousin who is 12 years old. She’s a grown woman who is actually comparing how expensive her clothes are to a kids. 
Mind you his dad had just died so they had to get rid of most of his stuff when they moved. I mean how can I let someone like this get to me so easily!? 

I know it’s childish, but it’s hard being around her. Being slightly jealous of all her nice things is one thing, but feeling like completely crap because she wants to bring me down is so stupid to me. Thankfully, I don’t see her that often. She’s married so she spends more time with his side of the family, but when I do have to see her (probably once or twice a month for events) it’s difficult.

Anyways, fast forward 3 months after that and L is my second best friend, like honestly we relate on a ton of shit and we just got along really really well. L and M were crushing hard on each other, so I kind of set them up. I guess that was my first mistake, but yeah, I set them up. Things were going great between everyone, L is 2 years younger than me without a dad so I kind of became a father figure to her. She would come to me for guidance and tell me stuff she didnt even tell her real life friends. We'd talk for hours every night and it was just a great friendship, honestly. Id say I was definitely a mentor/role model to her, but also a really great friend. Anyways, 2 months into M and L's relationship they both start to kind of distance from each other, ending with M dumping L. M told me I had to block L completely off of everything since they had broken up, and kind of gave me an ultimatum/threat. I had no choice but to block L, but thats not where it ends. M decided he never wanted me to be friends with her ever again so he told her a bunch of secrets/lies that got her to absolutely hate me. And thats where I am now. The reason I post here is because im not exactly sure what to do. L was basically family to me, and honestly im really sad that it ended the way it did. I gave her a lot of guidance, she was hanging around the wrong people and I was kind of helping her find some real friends (irl). Im worried now because not only do I miss her, but I feel like she'll end up back where she was, going down a very dangerous road. So yeah, im pretty sad about that. Honestly really sad. But now im pretty angry at M for doing what he did, my relationship with L is completely over with no chance of a comeback, but I dont even like M anymore after what he did. And im not sure what to do. I feel like im stuck. If i get rid of M I wouldnt really have a friend anymore (homeschooled) so its like I cant get rid of him.

I want to say again, this friend means so, so much to me. He's been there for me a lot and he's an amazing friend. One of the best I've ever had, if not the best. He's become a brother to me and someone I can count on no matter what. We have an incredibly strong friendship.

Recently, though, I learned some things about him that would mean the end of a friendship with just about anyone. The first thing I learned was that he hit his SO that he recently broke up with. Mostly shoving, but some slapping too. I'm thinking that's really, really bad, because I recently got my divorce because my ex husband was abusing me. Apart from my better judgement, we continued to be friends. 

Then, only about a month later he starts talking to some guy on Tinder. His tinder says he's 18, my friend is 23, already kinda pushing it, but eventually it's revealed that this tinder guy has just turned 17 and is a Junior in high school. Any rational adult would end all communication there, right? We all told him to, that it wasn't okay, etc., but they ended up meeting up after my friend said to him they would just be friends, almost having sex and then my friend sent his tinder date home saying it felt creepy and they couldn't even be friends. It's creepy that they hooked up and all I can think about is how gross it is. I'm not directly involved but I don't know if I can look at him the same.

He's such a good friend, amazing, really, but he has no self control in relationships. I don't know if it's even rational to let this go and continue to be friends with this person. I really don't know what to do. 

What would you do in this situation? ",28Mar2018,2
85,"I'm sure it's expected of me..
But..
My mom a long while back had an episode of where she was talking in complete gibberish to me and my siblings. It was terrifying. To just be talking to you mom and her stsrt talking gibberish to you and get angry wondering why you're looking at her the way you are. It's awful. When she was told that nothing she was saying made sense or was English, she just sat there in a daze in shock. Long story short, she found out she has a brain tumor. They monitored it for a while and said that they didn't see it growing so that was the good news. Bad news: if it does start, its inoperable.... with hearing its not growing and not having any more episodes or anything after that, we could relax some.
Until now. Recently she's had some other odd episodes and just two days ago she had a really bad one of the talking gibberish kind. I'm losing my mind worrying that it is growing.. It's causing me to not be able to fully give myself to studying in college this week. I'm overwhelmed. ",28Mar2018,2
87,"Okay so this might be a long one, I went for a night out last weekend and I believe I may have had my drink spiked, however I know I overdosed. Just wanting some help figuring out what happened. I am a 50kg, Caucasian female with (most likely) relatively low tolerance. It would also help to note the caps I was on where the same as about up to 50% of people there (dealer has monopolised that club) but I was the only person to overdose on the same amount - less that everyone else, hence my ruling out poorly cut drugs. 

On the way out to the club I had only one drink and a joint, also bought three caps (MDMA) done it before, probably won’t again. I get there, order a vodka red bull to wash down the first cap, but then decided to take a second cap before the first had even kicked in 🤦‍♀️ (please note that although I’m usually careful I was careless with watching my drink) I remember having turned my back on my drink and upon drinking the rest of it I noticed it tasted excessively watered down despite not leaving it for more than maybe a minute (probably should have been a red flag). Within the next thirty minutes I felt sick enough to have a minor public vomit before running to the toilets for another minor vomit. Locked myself in a cubicle thinking ‘you fucking idiot you took the caps too quickly, give it a minute, sit down and you’ll be right’. This was wrong, I collapsed and began the head lulling, eye rolling and mouth chomping - at this point I hadn’t realised I had even passed out until my friend climbed under the cubicle door because I wouldn’t answer their calls (I literally could not move). It was not until I saw how concerned their expression was that I realised what had happened and what was happening. Having a bit of experience with drugs I told them I was sure I was on ketamine as I could tell what I was doing and have seen many a k-hole in my day (I had never taken ket before though). This friend had NO IDEA how to care for someone on drugs so I talked them through how to take care of me (told them to contact my housemate, tell the sober bartender we knew what was going on and to leave me in the cubicle to hide from security as getting kicked out would leave me vulnerable and to constantly bring me water but only ever let me sip it - how I gave good advice in this state is beyond me). I began to panic and they couldn’t calm me down so I instructed them to have me reel of the 54321 (things you can see, feel, hear, smell and taste). I was on the ball considering my situation. I was stuck in this cubicle for up to three hours at which point security had lined up outside to kick me out. Security hadn’t actually seen me so when I got to a state where I could be seen in public without being removed some kind of distraction was organised and I was able to leave and blend back in (somewhat) with the crowd. I was still on caps so I continued dancing (and sweating actual litres of fucking sweat) until the place closed down and I went home. It wasn’t until I completely came down (ugh, the pain) that I realised what a scary situation I was in and that an ambulance probably should have been called. 

I have been suffering so bad since with depressive symptoms, anxiety, paranoia, flashbacks, nightmares, fevers (you name it) since. I had had a drug test and am still waiting on the results but I wanted the opinion of others who have used similar drugs, mixed drugs or overdosed to be able to piece it together in my head cause I have been an absolute mess since and can not get over what happened (despite knowing I wasn’t interfered with as this friend took amazing care of me considering their lack of knowledge). 

I can’t help but think I got my drink spiked due to being noticeably careless and remembering drinking the watered down remains of my drink that I had turned my back to briefly (also knowing what a k-hole looks like plus knowing that ketamine tastes pretty much like water). Please don’t call me dumb (I already know this, I’m usually much more attentive) but I appreciate any input. 

TL;DR I overdosed on drugs and hid in a cubicle until I was.. ‘presentable to the public’ again. Not sure if the overdose was my fault (mixing substances) or another’s fault (drink spiking - also mixing substances) but I have been traumatised since. ",28Mar2018,2

I was raised by women only, had girl friends my whole life, never really cliqued with dudes. I have a bunch of gay friends, like a lot of considered-gay stuff, but I am definitely not gay. Not even 1%.

Not because I think being gay is something negative, but mostly because I feel like that could be in the way of me meeting new people, girls approaching me or something.

97,"I have a self sabotaging mechanism.

I deeply want to change It.

I am asking for your support, experience and insights.

My self sabotaging mechanism is money related. I am self employed in the internet marketing business and also work part time.

I'm a 42M married for 12 years +2, I own an apartment in a good part of town with a big mortcage, married to a very beautiful and very smart wife, and have 2 smart and healthy boys.

I don't make enough money to hold my share of the household and business expenses (we split them by half).

It starts when I neglect my cashflow balance and than i'm exceeding my credit, leading to my need to lie or hide it from my wife.

This cycle happened maybe 20 times in our relationship and each time it hurts our trust and friendship she distance herself from me and becomes angry and cold.

She asks me to let her know in advance if there is going to be a money problem so we can address it together but somehow i can't.

I think its my father force inside me, his inner voice that says you don't need to worry about money, let the woman manage it and take care of it, you don't have to hustle just relaxe watch your TV show, you are entiteled to rest.

My wife and I hold separate bank accounts each for his own business although I am a man I'm the dominant parent and i'm very involved in my kids upbringing and spend a lot of time with them. some excuses for my failure are that I don't have enough time and because of that i cant succeed.

My carreer and money field is not solved but other than that, I am very close of being happy and content with my life, but there is the self sabotaging mechanism in my personality that ruins everything.

I proved that i can change, before this last fallback we had the best year of our relationship, filled with passion, intimacy and friendship. I stopped porn to increase my sex drive and quit smoking weed and getting drunk with my friends instead I started swimming playing basketball and working out in the gym.

 This thursday i am meeting a finiacial coach to start a process, although he is not the first. 

I'll be glad to hear your insights or maybe simmilar stories.

100,"

My school is incredibly liberal and competitive. A boy in my grade recently caused extreme controversy when he made fun of a sign that stated women wished they had as many rights as guns. He received many threats and debated back and forth with the people who were upset with him. He expressed his opinion of fun and was trolling them.

Today the mood at school was more stressful than ever. I noticed when a girl yelled at me for asking my math teacher if we were going to have another project (They are worth test grades and extremely easy, I wasn't meaning to be obnoxious) The popular girls were accusing the boy of being a rapist who brags about getting women drunk and then using them for sex. It seemed as if one of the girls had it happen to her and said that his ex girlfriends had told her their stories. 

His car windows were broken and apparently he claimed there was nothing wrong with his actions. The girls have refused to report it out of embarrassment and when asked they stated that it should be something that they should be able to keep to themselves.  When told that their names would be kept anonymous and their parents wouldn't need to be told, they stated that the guy and his friends would still know who they were and target them. 

I know the guy and know that he's a heavy drinker so I can see that it is possible. He's been nothing but kind to me, but it could just be manipulation. 

I respect a woman's right to take the time to heal and accept what has happened after such incidents occur. I just find it strange that they are so unwilling to tell an adult (we have female officers at our school who are trained to deal with this) if he is such a violent rapist who regularly drugs women.  According to what I heard from multiple conversations, around 10-15 women are accusing him of being a rapist .

I'm considering anonymously telling my school's officer about this. I believe that if he is a violent  rapist he needs to face repercussions. If it is not true then so be it, but to me it is more important that a few uncomfortable conversations happen than another women getting drugged and raped. 

Do you guys think this is the appropriate course of action? ",28Mar2018,2
101,"To make a long story short, I like a guy who is basically geographically unavailable. 

Anyhow, contact has lessened a bit so you know obviously it should be easier to get over him but I’ve liked him for a year+. Even though I was in a relationship with someone else this past year, I still thought about him. 

What hurts more is that I missed my chance and he missed his chance as well (he feels the same supposedly). Furthermore, he’s so kind to me so it makes it even more difficult to get over him.

He sometimes flirts with me. Even told me in the beginning he would drive out to see me. (I was an employee somewhere and he was a good distance away yet came to see me) However, he could just be saying this etc. I keep trying to convince myself he’s probably douche or some guy that dates 4-5 women at once. Yet I can’t.

I’ve tried talking to other guys to get over him. I have a date later next week. I don’t plan to jump into a relationship but if I like him somewhat I’ll see where it goes. 

Either way, this guy there’s just something about him. Maybe, it’s the fact he never acted on his feelings for me? Maybe, it’s because we both felt the same way? I don’t know what really. I’ve never really felt this way about anyone. I think a part of me wants to believe that he is serious about me but that’s a bunch of crap. I know it’s not meant to be, I mean he’s across the country. Also, he’s probably dating multiple women lol. I am just a mess right now.

EDIT: to clarify, he told me he felt the same. He told me that he even tried to find me on social media. Wanted to ask me out, wanted to ask for my number. Regretted it deeply. So obviously him feeling the same has taken a toll on my path to try to move on. 

A part of me doesn’t even want to move on because me moving to his area isn’t entirely impossible but I know I have to cause he could easily meet someone else or it may blow up in my face. Anyways I need someone to slap me. ",28Mar2018,2
102,"First of all, I’m a freshman college student. I’ve been in a committed relationship with my girlfriend from high school which she still attends (about 1:30 away - still see her every other weekend) And I’ve set my moral boundaries in terms of never cheating on her (so save me the trouble of explaining why cheating is bad)

To the story, a couple weeks ago I got drunk with some friends and fell asleep in this girl’s room (live on the same floor) with two other people. This girl (say her name was Emily)  kissed me and I kissed back but after a brief exchange (5 seconds worth) I told her I couldn’t do this because I’m in a relationship which she knew. She agreed and I ended up falling asleep. Simple as that. 

Next day, I didn’t tell anyone. Not even my roommate. Except I told one person (John) at the end of the day and it was probably the worst person I could have told. I expressed that I didn’t need any news of that getting out because I have a girlfriend who I love very much (I plan to explain the whole situation to her once i see her in person, and surely could have done sooner but i thought it blew off) I texted John and convinced him that we didn’t and he was convinced he heard me wrong when I explained the situation, but he was still skeptical. 

About a week later, everyone on my floor is wondering if we kissed. No one ever confronted me or asked me, they only asked Emily if it happened. We decided that she’d just deny the accusations. So there was only one person that could’ve started it. John acted innocent when I confronted him and seemed worried but I knew he said something. Couple weeks pass and it dies down. Emily and I are still friends. 

After I returned from spring break it blows up again. Emily is is still denying it happened but John keeps bringing it up. She became upset with me but I listened to her saying I wouldn’t open my mouth and she settled down. 

That weekend I got really depressed with a lot of other stuff happening in my life and my roommate needed an explanation because he was upset with me leaving and not telling him where I went. I explained a lot of stuff and I said you probably know what happened with Emily and I so told him the story (nothing that deep happened) I felt I needed to get it off my chest and I assumed he already knew because everyone on my floor knew (I told him not to say anything) Well John came and asked if he knew and my roommate said yeah because I told him. John took that as me confirming we did. Turns out my roommate didn’t know yet and was the last person to hear about it. 

Turns out that me telling my roommate got to Emily and she’s very upset with me and will absolutely not talk to me because I made a promise to not say it happened (surely it was more damaging to my image than hers because she was single and I have a girlfriend) TURNS OUT, she was trying to date Dante, Johns roommate. Dante had never had a relationship before and they decided to start slow. Since Dante heard about the rumors he asked her for the truth (his major concern was that she couldn’t trust her and she couldn’t be honest). Emily still followed the script and told him it didn’t happen. I told Dante the truth that it happened while saying I told Emily to say it didn’t happen so it wouldnt get to my gf and her lying to him doesn’t reflect her character. All in all he’s not mad with Emily (but he could still view that as a failure of honesty) but he said he already had reservations about starting the relationship . But Emily sees that as me having ruined what they had. She won’t talk to me and neither will John the source of everything. Johns smirking all the time and talking behind my back with my friends on the floor and refusing to talk to me. He has a huge ego and is trying to get after me for something. Odd thing is I have done nothing to him and I’ve apologized for whatever I did a couple days ago and he refuses to text back. Johns this type of way, he always wants to be the center of attention and he’s spread drama like this many times before with other people on the floor.

I feel the need to emotionally support somebody (let's call her Sally.) and compensate my happiness so that individual isn't devistated / crushed.

Been with her for 1.5 years.

She cherishes me so much and her mom is schizophrenic bipolar and her family abandoned her so she holds onto me and i feel like it's just way too much of a commitment and its tearing me apart. 

Also, a mention which makes me feel so selfish, so shallow. Is that she can't have sex without it being painful. A condition called vaginmus, we've never had regular sex and i feel like a bag of shit for this bothering me.

105,"Recently I have been remembering a few things from when I must have been about 3 or 4 years old, one of the more notable ones is having sexual interactions with my babysitter. It's all a haze and I don't remember how it started, the events before or after, whether she talked me into it, but I do remember very clearly now how I fingered and performed oral on her.

For some reason throughout my childhood and teenage years I did not remember this but I do now, and although the I only remember little pieces of it, I remember those pieces very clearly to the point where I recall my innocent mind wondering what was that thing between her legs and why it was so wet.

I consider myself to be 'normal', and by normal I mean not displaying any signs of mental trauma, or at least I believe so. I go to college, I have friend, I go out and socialize, pretty much normal teenage stuff. However, this recent revelation has got me thinking whether I am actually not normal, whether the experience has taken something away from me or has caused me to develop certain behaviours. 

Was I sexually abused? Although this bothers me right now I do not feel any malice or negative feelings from these memories.

How are victims of sexual abuse usually changed?

How could this have changed me in any way? Was I even affected by this in any way?

I am afraid that if I come out as bi, then my guys friends will ditch me and the girls I'm interested in will lose any interest in me because they will think I'm in a transition period to being gay. Now it's possible that I am not really bi because while I might find men attractive, I feel as if I'd only go as far as receive a blowjob. No kissing. No anal. No giving head. No relationships. Also I don't know if I really find men attractive or if I just feel that people expect me to be gay, so I've been thinking about it too much. (People assume that I'm gay a lot, to the point that it really hurts to be called faggot etc.) Has anyone else had experience with similar feelings? How did you deal with it?

119,"I received a series of texts from a wrong number. They were looking for someone with the same first name as me. When I told this person they had the wrong number, they didn't believe me.

His texts are vaguely threatening and it seems like the person he's looking for owes him money-$1500. He mentions a strip club (I think that's what new century is). The part I blurred out at the end is an address--I'm guessing it's the place he wants this person he's looking for to meet him.

I looked up the phone number and I think it's a brother or cousin to someone I used to know about 7 or so years ago, so maybe that's how this person got the number in the first place and why he won't believe me when I say he's got it wrong. I don't want to contact the person I used to know because I want to keep a low profile about this and I have no idea what is involved.

The criteria for this song does not require it to be about the class itself but more to show creativity (that kinda of prof).  I had already partially written a song about a classmate of mine (19 f) who I have some feelings for but never finished because college is hard.  So I used this assignment as a kick in the butt to finish the song.  I am currently in the process of making a polished recording of said song and am realizing I didn’t think this far ahead...

122,"So this might get a little long so thank you to anyone who reads the whole thing. At this point I just am not sure what I should do.

My brother is 4 years older than me. I have a sister that's 2 years older than me and I'm the baby of the family.

My brother physically and mentally abused me as a child. He has serious anger issues which he always took out on me and my sister. However my sister was bigger and was able to fight him off to the point where he mostly left her alone but then that put all of his focus on me. 

My parents had no control over him. My mom was depressed and just couldn't deal and my dad worked away from home. Eventually it got to the point where social services were called bit since my sister and i were to scared to talk they couldn't do anything. At that point my parents decided to send my brother across the country to live with my grandparents. He was gone for about a year before he guilted my mom into letting him come home.

He was a little better after he got home. He hasn't physically hurt me since but continues to be the biggest a**hole ever. As soon as I turned 18 I moved into my own place. I only saw him when I went to my parents.(he's lived with them his whole life) At first that was ok...I barely saw him or talked to him but NOW he has moved into a trailer on my parents property with his wife and baby and for some reason he think that my parents farm belongs to him. He constantly complains about me bringing my dog out there, he thinks that I should be going out to the farm to help with chores, he just being a complete arse.  

My hubby got his truck stuck out at the farm the other night. It was 3 am before he finally got out and he just drove home. I guess he forgot to move the sheet of metal he had put under the tires to use for traction. The next day my brother phoned me and had a fit because the metal was left outside. He swore at me and swore at my husband etc.  It's basically the straw that broke the camel's back.

I'm so done with him and I don't want anything to do with him. I honestly never want to see or talk to him again. The problem is A) he lives on the same farm as my parents and B) I like his wife and Love my nephew. I don't want to lose them but I don't want to be around him.

123,"I can't get over it. I don't love her anymore. I don't want to go back with her. I just want to be fucking over it.

Why can't I stop checking on her social media. Why can't I stop worrying about her. Why can't I just get fucking over it. It hurts so fucking much.

124,"Something just happened  (I do not want to explain details) that triggered memories of my childhood, and now I'm reliving all the pain, self-hatred, depression, and isolation that characterized my childhood and adolescence. I want to get help but here's the kicker - I am afraid that I deserved to be treated like I did, and I think most people wouldn't consider what happened to me to be that bad, so I don't know if I have a right to complain.

Regarding family, my mom was always emotionally abusive and would say I wasn't her daughter whenever I cried or couldn't control my emotions. It just made me more ashamed of myself, which made me cry more, which made her hate me more. I have always been close with my dad, but he was arrested for domestic violence when I was a teenager and although he was only violent against me a couple times, that changed how safe I could see him as. (I remember begging the police to take my mom away instead, as I viewed her as the real danger to my health and safety. Of course, they refused.) My sister has always been jealous of me and tried to undermine me at every turn.

Regarding school, I was bullied from first grade all through high school. It was mostly verbal insults and taunts, although in middle and high school it escalated to unwanted touching and comments about my body. A few of the girls in my class vandalized my house twice, and my classmates stole my things sometimes. My teachers also hated me for being a know-it-all and talking too much in class. The thing is that there is a possibility I did something to deserve it. That's what really haunts me. Why else would everyone stand by and not lift a finger while these things happened?

I could go on and on (especially with relationships/sex), but you get the gist. I have seen many therapists, but they have never helped. I tried smoking legal marijuana during a panic attack once, and I think it helped. In my state, it is a legal treatment for PTSD, but again, I don't know if my experiences are severe enough to warrant that kind of attention. I feel like I shouldn't act like a victim because maybe it was actually my fault and I am the one to blame for my own suffering.

How can I know if I am to blame for the treatment I received at the hands of others? If I am, how can I change? If I'm not, what can I do besides get more meaningless platitudes from a therapist?

I'm 24 years old and circumcised.

So I've posted about this before but I never seem to get any responses.

I haven't been able to orgasm with my sex partner, even though I have full erections with her (and am attracted to her) We have been dating for 7 months.

I have talked about this to my family Dr, he inspected my circumcised penis and told me not to masturbate; he also said circumcised men usually take longer to reach orgasm but it should still be possible and that it may just take a bit longer. Its been like 4 weeks of not masturbating (and like more than 3 months of not watching porn) and I still haven't orgasm-ed with my partner. I've tried oral, vaginal (tons of positions) and face fucking. Pretty much never get to the point where I can cum or orgasm.

I am 24 years old. Not really sure what to do :( And yeah, it fucking sucks... I'm like horny all the time. Seems like no one has a solution to this problem.

144,"This is probably the strangest thing that's ever happened to me in my life but I officially have no idea where else to turn and wanted to ask you redditors for some advice. I have an online cyberstalker/bully - who has been spreading what I have learned is legally termed as a ""hate campaign"" on the defamation of my Character. It has been happening for well over a year now and I am not sure what to do, where to go, how to stop it? It has resulted in the loss of my last 2 jobs, both employers letting me go over 'the hateful messages regarding my untrustworthiness'. In my industry, trust is everything and your reputation is everything. I work in the cannabis space and have attracted this hater who also, works in the same cannabis space. The most obvious answer is just deleting my social media. However I own a small business and in a nut shell, I need my instagram account for the advertising because I directly get orders from girls who like my products and find me via Instagram. I started selling my own homemade CBD products via Instagram and my website because this troll messaged my last two bosses and told them to get rid of me. I found 8 account this same person was using, spreading words like ""sofuckingstrange"" is a parasite, thief, liar, racist and the worst hire ever on pages all over the entire industry. He called me a parasite on the cannabis industry and said I stole from my own boyfriend's store (which can easily be debunked by asking said boyfriend)... He labeled me on every retailers shop in town as an untrustworthy racist bitch and it devastated me. I have never been any of those things and whoever I pissed off, really wants to see me jump off a cliff by ensuring that I never work again. I cannot for the life of me determine why someone would say such terrible things about someone, following everyone they talk to and engage with and send them public and private messages telling them to stay away from me. It's gotten scary. I collected enough data on the troll over the course of the year that I eventually got a confession from the troll, leaving his last few comments as ""got you bitch, fired again"" to make sure I knew it was his work. Everyone in the industry in my state and all of my local friends have told me it was this specific person, no one is suprised because I am not the first victim he has done this too. I am being asked by several girls to come forward and expose him, as he cost them jobs too by saying the same thing about them. People have read these things and wanted to fire the individual being attacked without ever looking into the circumstance- that there is a live and active hate campaigning troll ruining lives for entertainment purposes in Oregon. I deleted my personal Instagram page after losing my first job over this this year, which had nearly 3k followers and over 10 years of my personal photography on it, in an effort to stop being tagged 15 times a day from 8 different accounts from this troll. I wrote the state for legal help, I have written online organizations, I have reported his accounts daily on instagram for a really long time with a lot friends helping and they refuse to remove his abusive accounts (8 total so far over the last few months)... It appears that because he is not threatening my safety, just my income and ability to get a job by defaming me for a lack of integrity, that I don't have any recourse in the state of Oregon with a criminal prosecutor. I will be trying for a Civil Suit, something - anything needs to happen about this. I cannot afford an attorney due to my job letting me go over this. I don't know what to do anymore, I know his address and email and full name and have written my story so many times, I have serious ptsd issues now concerning the entire matter. I just more than anything want this guy to stop and any offense action I take results in more and more bullying, more defamation - over a whole fucking year of it. How do I get this adult man with serious psychological problems off of my social media accounts, ruining my income - to find someone or something else to torture? Word is both of his parents died and that's why he's pretending to be 8 people online all the time, denying that is involved. If I could grab an IP from the accounts he uses, it would be a really easy lawsuit to file away and help future girls like me - not go through what this man has been doing to me over an extended period of time. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Thanks in advance reddit, I feel super upset and cornered without a lot of options being this more an internet crime.

146,"About me: I've been doing software development for about 17 years now, used to be a consultant and was part of about 35 software projects. Even worked for HPE until they sold their software department off to Microfocus and terminated as many contractors as possible. As I could check ""work for a well known Fortune 500"" off my bucket list, I went for smaller companies again.

Last January I started my current job. It's a rather special software development/administration job in a medium sized company. I basically have to look after a bunch of custom programs and a handful of servers. This was at first done in a team of two, were the other colleague was the former main developer of the software.

The first 6 months were really amazing, then it went into every-day-normal-job-mode.

At the end of last year, my colleague left the company and everything was on me, which means I have to dig through the source and get information about how things should work. Finding someone new was hard. In April, a new colleague will start in my team, but with skills mainly in another area than me or my former colleague. And my manager already made clear that our new hire will do mostly stuff in other areas of our IT.

My normal day consists of answering first level support questions (trying to train people to send e-mail, but they still like calling or just walking into my office), fixing problems, updating software.

The thing is: Each first-level-support-task robs my of my flow for coding. It takes up to 30 minutes until I can concentrate on my task again. Many interruptions are things that I can postpone, but some are urgent, so I just have to take care of it. This means that rather simple but tedious coding tasks take weeks instead of days, so my manager isn't happy and I am neither.

I talked to my manager about this problem, but there isn't much he can do.

The result is that I barely drag myself into the office, can't get out of bed (not an early bird, anyway) and already talked to my manager that I think about leaving the company.

My manager doesn't want me to leave and although he can't really stop me from leaving, I don't want to just quit, especially as I know that if I leave, things WILL be on fire.

What could I do to improve my situation, my mindset, my overall job satisfaction? I do have hobbies, but rarely have enough motivation to pursue them as much as I would like to after work.

Edit: The situation causes me sleeping problems, which makes coming in early nearly impossible and kills my concentration and motivation even more.",28Mar2018,3
148,"Hey reddit! 

This is going to be my first post here, and probably the last one, but if I need to make something clear in this post I'll make edits and reply. Without further ado, let's go straight to the point:

I like someone. I didn't like her from the first time we met, but as time passes by and I get to know her more, I grew fond of her. That's the basic gist of what I'm going to ask, but in order to get an insightful advice for this, I would have to start from the beginning first and explain this complicated issue that I have.

She and I met from a mutual friend, I wanted to give a compliment to someone and my mutual friend misunderstood that for liking that someone, so he asked her to help me hook up with this someone.  We met by accident, I was looking at a book from a chair and it intrigued me, so I started to read it. She was looking at me and asked ""Why are you reading that book?"" and I replied ""Well, I was interested by the cover so I wanted to read some of the pages of it."" At this point, I still didn't knew it was actually *her* book, and I realized that after she explained what the book was all about. By the time she was done explaining, my friend told her that I was the one that needed help with that someone. She was shocked, and her attitude changed. She gave me lots of details about that someone, as she thought I liked that someone. But the more she tells me about it, the more I was getting interested, but not *like* that someone. I let her help me get to know that someone more. The thing is, I was starting to get to know *her* more than that someone. I was not attracted to her at this point, the book was very interesting though.

A couple of days after we met, we were already starting to hangout, go to restaurants, talk about this and that, and watched the movie version of the book that she had, it was pretty great.  After only a week, I realized how are we so comfortable to each other? We would talk hours on the phone, she would watch me play video games, we watched several movies already, heck we even started to talk about stuff probably only couples would do. We had such a great chemistry that it could potentially be made into the philosopher's stone! Jokes aside, we got along very well that it felt like we met each other already. I told her about it, but she didn't want to talk about it for some reason. This was the time she told me that she hangs out with a lot of guys (she never had a boyfriend, she even rejected multiple guy friends), and this was also the point where I thought that every thing she does to me, she already did it to others. Her words, her actions, I started to think that everything she does is completely platonic. Yet, I still felt that something can start from this.

About 2 weeks had passed, I began to enjoy her company more, I wanted to hangout with her more, and I was certain she did as well. I also got to know her *very* difficult life, as well as her *very* complicated love life. I won't be able to explain those specific details here, but I can explain them more in the comments as those two are major contributors to how she is. When I got to know her more on a personal level, a spark already started. I was interested in her as a person, I wanted to talk to her as someone that I may have a chance with, I was falling for her. I didn't expect this, nor did I thought about it until about 5 months from this. But I knew that deep inside, there was a flame that was burning.

As time passes, she realized it. She knew from my actions that I was starting to like her. I never explicitly stated that I liked her at all, but my actions says so otherwise. She didn't take it lightly. As we were hanging out, she brought it up and asked ""Do you like me?"", me, still having to deal with the fallout from my previous LDR, not emotionally ready and still being immature and indecisive, replied ""No."" With that said she made an ultimatum: if I liked her, then she doesn't want me to talk to her until my feelings are gone and the other is that if I didn't like her, I would have to make a promise and if I break it, the friendship would be over. At first, I thought it was a joke, but looking on her eyes and expression, this was serious. I made the promise and left without saying anything.

I was kind of hurt, but nothing too major, and I was expecting to definitely move on in a matter of a few weeks. After that serious talk, everything was normal right after. It felt like nothing happened. But from this point on I was getting a few mixed signals, but I dismissed it as something she would do to someone else. She's the type of person to not touch someone unless she likes them or she's comfortable around them. Mixed signals kept firing up but I immediately extinguish all of it. Yet, the only thing I couldn't really extinguish was the little fire that kept burning inside of me.

After a few problems rose up unrelated to this, we didn't talk for months. No contact whatsoever. I used this time to work on myself, my confidence, new hobbies, everything that interests me and will help me grow as a person, better than I was before. I also had the time to look back to my previous relationship and see what I did wrong, what to work on, and what to not do again. I had a lot of personal goals that I accomplished during those months, but in the back of my mind I was wondering about her. I didn't let it invade my mind, but the feeling was still there no matter what. I just let my feelings be, I didn't force myself to dislike her or like her or anything. I just *really* let it be.

Months passed, the feelings were still there, but it grew much more than before. I know that this feeling is not infatuation, as I've experienced infatuation plenty of times. This feeling shines very bright, yet feels so subtle. It feels very comfortable, yet it burns with passion. The connection we had, I felt, is very strong. I feel like this feeling is so unique in its way that I won't be able to explain it in full detail here. This feeling I have is just something else.

Skipping to the present day, after nearly about 8 months, she contacted me again. As usual, we talked about an unrelated problem as to why she didn't talk to me, yada-yada, and bunch of other stuff. But now, she has a boyfriend. I don't want to explain in full detail, but from the conversations we had, she got a boyfriend just because she didn't care. I know this is confusing but like I said previously, she had a difficult childhood and quite a destructive love life. It was shocking to me at first, but I didn't let my feelings took the better of me, so I helped her by just talking and giving some insight to her. From the way she sounds, she doesn't feel too content in her current relationship which is only a few months. Skipping some stuff, now that I've told the huuuuuuge story, it's about time I tell about the problem.

I feel like I'm being unfair to her and to myself. I told her I didn't like her explicitly before but my actions didn't add up. I feel like I made her think that this is what I am as a friend. My actions had a double meaning to it. Both from my morals, and from my heart. Now, she asks for help about her relationship and personal problems but I'm afraid that some of the things I do comes from my heart. What I wanted to do was talk about the promise we made, and taking the responsibility of losing our friendship by finally saying my true feelings for her. The other would be to keep it as it is, but feel guilty that she never knew my feelings and not realizing my feelings is affecting my actions. I do understand that she has a boyfriend, and I truly respect her decision, but I do **not** expect anything at all. I do not expect her to be with me, I do not expect her to change her feelings for me, I do not expect her to be someone that I can look forward to a future with. The last thing I don't want is for her to be influenced by telling her how I feel... Because that would tell a lot of who she really is. And I don't think she's a bad person, but still. What should I do in this situation?

It's in the middle of the night, and that is what I wanted to ask advice/opinion on. I feel like I'm missing some things here and there to the question but that is the question that I wanted to ask. Feel free to ask any questions because there are a lot of stuff I skipped and just put the essentials first. If you read this whole thing, I really appreciate it for taking the time to read it. This issue doesn't take up my whole life, but I really needed to get this out somewhere, even to internet strangers! (Not in a bad way type!)

149,"My sister has been dating a dude for like 3 years. She has owned a house for a year and he has been staying there. He still has not gotten a job and doesn't give her anything to stay there. At some point a few months ago she decided enough was enough and dumped his ass. She told him they are done and he needed to leave. He told her that it is his home too and he doesn't have to leave. She told him she will call the cops and he threatened suicide. I found all of this out recently so I am going (later today now) to throw him out. What can I get away with? Can I assault him if he doesn't leave? Can he be arrested?


Here is some info I think is important.

-USA - Pennsylvania

-He has a key. She took it a while ago, but he got it back somehow (my sister is hard as fuck to. I am still wondering how this happened)

- He refuses to leave. Claims it is his home too. He is not on the title and pays nothing.


- He has been there for a year.


- His mail is NOT delivered there. I think it goes to his mothers still.

150,"My friend came bout half an hour ago to talk to me and two of my other friends. He was crying and started opening to us when I asked what's wrong.

He was saying that he want's to end it all. We sat down and started to talk. He said to me that he feels worthless in life. He also said that all this time he was studying was just lost time, because he did come to school just occasionally and was out of school most of the time. He also said to me and the two other friends who were listening that he hasn't been able to do anything resently and that just adds to the feeling that he is completelly worthless.

I totally locked up and couldn't say anything reasonably other than say that he is worth a lot he is an amazing person and so on. I also ofcourse hugged him and listened very coselly. I also assured that everyone of us is here to support and that he can talk to us when ever.

I am shaking even now. I need help on what to say to him. This could be the day he would do something that I would never forgive myself. Pardon my bad english like I said I am shaking and just not thinking clearly.

I am thinking talking to our schools psychologist to see if they can give me some tips. I would love if you guys would also give me help as to what to do and say. Never have I ever experienced something like this.",28Mar2018,6

156,"I’m at a crossroads here to be quite frank. I’m stuck between two very difficult situations. 

I’m currently a high-school senior and Its time to start picking colleges. I got accepted to the majority of the schools I applied too, however I am stuck between two major colleges that will each lead me down different paths. (So to remove any bias I’m not going to name each college.)

College #1 is a Small local College and is 15min drive from my house, I wouldn’t have to live on campus, everything will be paid for. However, I live in a town where it’s not very nice and frankly I’m not very happy here. It’s just not what I like or see myself doing.

College #2 is an Ivy League school that is 6 hours away, I’m going to have to find someplace to live, get a new job and my tuition isn’t fully covered . Which means I’m only going to have to pay a couple thousand a year and live over there. However, it’s one of the best schools in the nation...

I thought I had this all sorted out to be honest, but I got home from work and I overheard my parents talking about my college situation, and it really opened my eyes. 

My father and my mother came to the USA as immigrants so it’s been hard for both of them. Now that I am going to college there is going to be a bit of a struggle because I won’t be able to help out my father finically. I work two jobs and both go to the bills and if I have any left over I stick it right in the bank to try and have some money incase I do decide to leave. My other siblings are too young to work which means it’s going to be tough on them as well.

Leaving would mean I would get to experience a whole different world and maybe get somewhere far in life. 

Staying would mean I would be able to help out my parents and be able to help out my siblings as well.

163,"Let me give you guys some background. I dated a girl in senior year of high school for about 8 months. The relationship was strong for the first few months, but eventually things kind of went to shit. I started suffering from anxiety and depression because I turned 18 and was paranoid about growing up and having to be responsible for my own life. I sought support from anyone who was close to me, including my girlfriend. She was not very supportive, eventually got tired of my being anxious, and started being very mean to me. I realized how toxic of a person she was and decided that I had to break up with her if I was ever going to get out of the deep dark hole I'd fallen into. I tried to do it peacefully, but she did NOT take it well. The rest of senior year was shitty because I had to be around her so much, as she was in my classes and would hang around a lot of my good friends. I ended up not going to prom because of her. At graduation she gave me an apology, which I did accept.

Fast forward a year, I've gotten through most of my first year of college. I haven't quite been satisfied with it, as I didn't really make friends or be a part of the social scene there. I am home for spring break, and I went to go hang out with two of my closest friends. Well it turns out that one of them invited my ex over to the same hangout. He thought that we got along well, which isn't exactly the case. Despite her apology, she really isn't a person I would like much to do with. I didn't interact with her much and played nice throughout the hangout, but once I left those old memories started coming back. I've had nightmares about her for the past two nights. I also have had self-estesm issues, as I feel annoyed that she seems to be having a better college life than me. 

I would really like to let go of these feelings and just move on with my life, but I'm not sure how.

164,"Me and my now ex wife had been going out for 2 years before we got married. The relationship had it's up and downs but when does one not. We bought our own place and were having the time of our life. Young love and all that. We got married last year in August and it the best day of my life. Until I found out what she had done 2 weeks later. She told me she was having doubts about our marriage and relationship (even though we had only been married for 2weeks). 

She told me that was going to stay round a friend's for a couple of days to think things over. Baring in mind I loved her and was still in the honeymoon faze, I didn't want to lose her, so I let her stay round her friends. A couple of days past, we spoke over text, and she was still not sure on what to do.

She then decided to stay for the rest of the week, which I acknowledged and gave her the space. Thinking she would come back and everything was okay. I then received a text from ""the friend"" who she said she was round, saying that there is more going on that what you know. 

It turns out that instead of her going round one her friends, she was actually round one of her work colleagues who she had been having an affair with for the whole week. She denied it many times until she gave me and told me everything. I asked her to come back to our home to try and talk but she didn't have any of it. Deciding that until I left the flat she would come back back for clothes then go back to his again! (Kick a man while he's down).

We are now split up and waiting for this August to get divorced. The whole experience of this has left me with massive trust issues and not knowing I can trust again. Baring in mind this wasn't the only time I have been cheated on. 

Any advice on how to help with trust after what has happened? ",28Mar2018,0
165,"Let me just start by saying that I don’t feel this is really a sexual assault, as it was just a singular incident, but this is the language the legal folks at my office are using. I’m a pretty big guy, and I don’t think many people in my office could overpower me and truly assault me. The incidents involving ladies are much worse, and I feel calling groping sexual assault cheapens the term. So let’s begin...

I’m a male in my 30’s. Happily married, with an amazingly beautiful little girl. I’ve been in this current role for a few years. I enjoy my job, and it’s with a very very respected institution. A couple months back, my boss... who likes to drink a little too much... kinda grabbed my junk after hours at a pub down the street. I was a little taken aback by the whole thing, and not the least bit interested. I told her that it wasn’t cool and I left. So months pass, and I’m not about to say anything, as this lady has a reputation for retaliation against anyone who does her wrong... and let’s be real... I need a job. So randomly a month ago I get a call from our legal folks. They want to talk to me about an incident. I’m told I am “obligated to cooperate as a term of my employment.” So naturally I go talk to them. They ask about the incident, and I tell them... one time thing, blah blah. I express that I don’t wish to be involved, that I just want to do my job and go home. If she found out I said anything, I’d be done... the guy informs me that I’m not the only one this has happened to. That I can be kept anonymous. That made me feel a little better, and I assumed that with apparently multiple individuals with similar situations, that this would likely be resolved soon. 

Here’s where I get really concerned. It’s been over a month now. I’ve had multiple meetings with internal and external attorneys, and nothing has been done. She’s still my direct supervisor. Everyone I’ve spoken to about this, outside of the office of course, have said this is really strange, and at the very least, I should be removed from her chain of command. I’m not sure what I should do, and I am now getting treated like shit by her on the daily. It’s awkward enough as it is, but now she threatens disciplinary actions because she wasn’t cc’d on an email about a situation I had already informed her about. Really petty stuff. Any chance to discipline me, she attempts. As of yet, she hasn’t actually followed through, but it’s been threatened. She also comes up with projects last minute to keep me at work. She knows that I like to try to leave no later that 5:30 so I can make it home to tuck my daughter into bed. I’m in by 7:30 most days, and never past 8:00. She shows up around 10:00 - 10:30, and is choosing to keep everyone until 7:00 or 8:00. Basically when she decides to go home. I don’t know how to handle this whole thing. I’m thinking about quitting, and finding something else, but I really don’t want to leave my job, as it’s a really good job, and will be hard to find anything as good right now. Any help is appreciated. Thanks everyone!

174,"hi reddit, I really need help.
My art teacher is convinced that I'm some kind of artistic genius. I disagree. However, this means that whenever I ask for any feedback and critique, he always tells me ""it's perfect, don't change it"" or ""it's perfect, I trust you"". 
This is really stressing me out because I end up hating most of the work I work on and but he always praises it to the heavens. I'm starting to think he only praises me because I told him I want to go to art school. 

Anyways, my school has its upcoming art show on April 2. My teacher is super enthusiastic about showing my work. I'm not.
He has this really horrible painting that I made at the beginning of the year that my sister and friends make endless fun of because of how terrible it looks. The anatomy and hair are really weird and it was one of my first acrylic paintings. I absolutely despise it, but my art teacher LOVES it. I don't know why.

Anyways, there's also this GIGANTIC painting that I'm doing. I was really proud of it until a week ago (I'm still working on it) when I realized that it looks kind of boring and plain. He says he would present it at the show even if it's unfinished, so I guess I'll be lugging a huge board of wood home for the weekend.

I don't know what to do. I'm panicking and anxious because my art is going to be displayed at the show. I don't want it to be displayed. It's ugly and weird looking but my art teacher has never, ever critqued it. 

What makes this whole situation worse is that I'm taking two art classes this year; Studio Art and 3D art. In 3D, we are working on plaster masks. 
I made a concept for my mask that was bee-themed. My art teacher though it would be amazing if we used actual beeswax, so I ordered some online. The problem? The mask is due TOMORROW and the wax is stuck at the post office, which is closed until like 10am tomorrow. The mask, which is due for a photo shoot, will have to be turned in at approx. 9am. I'm freaking out.

Here is a link to the big painting. 
https://imgur.com/a/Q9cGy
I think it's okay, but my art teacher INSISTS that it would be worthy of a 5 in AP Studio Art. I don't really think so. It's wonky and ugly and DEFINITELY not ap worthy.

So...
I don't know what to do. I hate all the pieces I've made this year and messed up the chance to submit one last work that might look nice. I'll have to show up empty handed tomorrow morning and then try as hard as I can to spruce up the painting that I can't get any critique on.

So... please critique the one painting I can still change. Maybe I'll even attend the art exhibition if it turns out nice, but I'll probably just stay home and wallow. I don't want this to be my artistic imprint on my school ... :(
Please critique the art, I really need some guidance for this piece and I haven't had any all year. I'm just unbearably sad, discouraged, and embarrassed and I wish I had the time and ability to burn all of my own work and start over. ",28Mar2018,16

176,"For some brief background: I’m a university student who currently lives with another student. We are both taking a year out to work abroad before coming back to our studies. We are best friends and are very similar so it makes sense that we would live together. The plan has always been to live with the third person in our little friendship group when we return. My other best friend (who I’ve also lived with before) moved away but is now planning on returning to our city in the same year that we will be coming back from our work abroad. She’s very close to the other two and again, we have very similar interests and personalities. We all mutually agreed to live together as a group of four as we are all incredibly similar people who have spent a huge amount of time together. Essentially, we are all equally close and we know that we work well together and that there would be no bickering or problems. 

The dilemma however is that a friend of the person I’m currently living with has essentially invited herself in on this arrangement. I wouldn’t mind this but it’s ridiculously hard to find a flat for five in our city and I feel this isn’t fair on me and the other three people who had all agreed to live together. I’ve met her a number of times and she is nice enough but I can tell that she is very different from us. We’re all very extroverted people who enjoy having people round to visit, travelling and just enjoying life. She is much quieter and is very much an introvert. We are by no means crazy party animals but we do enjoy going out on occasion and we all have pretty big groups of friends. I was an introvert too at one point in my life and quite frankly I think I would’ve found an arrangement like ours hell. I’m just not sure how this quiet girl would fit into our mad little group, who’ve been known to randomly book flights and leave the next day and throw last minute parties. I’m a bit concerned as we’ve had a bit of a disaster with a flatmate this year who wasn’t happy with living with me and my best friend. I really don’t want a repeat of this. The girl who wants to live with us will be living alone this year (she doesn’t seem to have many friends at all which is another factor which makes me a little unsure) and honestly I think the shock of suddenly moving into a flat with four other people will just be a bit much for her. I know I may come across as rude and bitchy but I just don’t think she’d be very happy in such a large group. 

I’ve spoken to two of my friends and both agree that she will probably struggle. We don’t want to upset our other friend though and make it sound as if we are ganging up on him and his friend. How do we make our friend and the other girl see this arrangement might not be the best idea without sounding bitchy and condescending?

178,"I’m feeling resentful towards my closest friend, which is so sad because we’ve been so close for so long. I just feel like she creates so much negativity - she always judges people and talks about them behind their back in a mean way, which means I’ve started keeping things from her because she has such high standards for other people. 

She barely looks after herself - she won’t sleep or eat properly. And then I have to look out for her and be there for her, I have to drop everything I’m doing because she feels bad but she keeps creating these situations over and over.

When I got my place at university I invited her around to celebrate with me but, she didn’t care to talk about my achievement and instead started talking about herself and what she was feeling negative about. She always seems to be bored when I talk about the things that are important to me, like she’s waiting for me to finish so we can get back to her.

Everything is always about her and I’m always in her shadow.  People have even made friends with me just so they can make friends with her - because she’s this super popular girl that everyone wants to know.

I’m not sure what do to about it. I’m afraid of talking to her about it because, she considers me the only person who truly cares about her and I don’t want to break her heart. I also worry about her being angry at me because she can be very cold sometimes. And I rely on her a lot.. we do everything together. If I lost her there would be a massive void in my life.

Now I am an admin at a cemetery making 30k a year with benefits, PTO, etc.

Some background:
- Come from dirt poor family. Living with them is not an option and they cannot provide any financial assistance.
- Went to college for 1 year when I was 18 for mechanical engineering but flunked out. Lost financial aid due to not meeting satisfactory academic progress.
- Have about 7.5K saved, 1800 in CC debt. About 3k in student loan debt. Owe 400 for my phone. 751 credit score.
- Ride a motorcycle as my only form of transportation because it is dirt cheap.
- Currently paying out of pocket for 2 classes at University to try and regain financial aid. Still not sure if I should continue at community college. I likely have to take remdial math courses since I have forgotten so much. Unless I take out private loans that can pay for my living expenses and allow me to go full time, graduating will be many, many years away.
- Was considering CS or Business marketing. I am still not sure which should I do. I would like to pursue CS because I enjoy programming but seeing as how I would have to take out significant private loans, I want to make sure I choose something i can finish (CS mathematics are intimidating) . Maybe 50k-80k in loans. Not even sure how to get approved for private loans that high.
 - Thought about being a cop or joining the military but I am colorblind, was diagnosed with ADHD and depression so those prevent me from either of those paths.
- My other plan is paying 13k for an electrician school that apparently has an 85% apprenticeship placement rate. I am worried my colorblindness will prevent me from pursuing this job, but I have also read that there are in fact colorblind electricians.
- Not sure if this helps gage what should I do but I have an IQ of 130.

184,"Hey guys,

currently, I'm the first year student of programming and to be honest I hate it. Since childhood, I was into many things: My passion was drawing, then football, dances and in the final - basketball. However, all these activities became boring and usually, I switched lines every time. But in 10th grade, I realized that I'll need a real plan so I could get a degree, earn money by myself and become independent from parents at some point in my life. So I decided where I want to continue my path after graduation because since childhood I was into computer stuff and by that time I learned programming by myself a bit. Also, I loved every piece of graphic design and the web development is still in my heart now.
I finished school with great exam results and I was able to study for free in one of the best university in our country (As they claim lol). At that point, I was proud of myself because I convinced parents, who always said that I don't study enough to get free education, that I can do it and of course, I loved the idea that finally, I was going to be a real programmer. Unfortunately, the first month was not even close as I thought. Classes were completely unrelated to the programming, being in classes was boring as hell and the thing is that they were useless was really getting to my head every time. Even lecturers mentioned that you won't need in your life, but oh well... That's what is university about? Talking about making friends, I was that one who always been sociable and had many friends in high school, but in university, I didn't make a shit. I couldn't find any like-minded people and I've started avoiding each of my classmates, what is really not my type of behavior. Good thing, that I had few homies, who lived with me, and a girl who came in my life since first days of studying. Those people are the only positive aspect of the whole university thing. Except that, every day in university was like a suffer to me and I was more into skipping classes, and I was happy to do something else instead. Despite I hated it, I was determined and my goal was to finish it no matter what. I've finished the first semester with good grades and didn't fail any exam without huge effort. At that time, I thought 'oh great, I can put not so much effort and get the degree'. To get off the routine, I found a job in an IT company and I earn great money and even get a better experience. Even so, this week I realized that I skip more than 70% classes, avoiding any activity related to the university and I'm totally wasting my time because I'm not in my shoes. As a consequence, I thought why I'm still into that and I must be happy what I do due to the reason that life is to short to waste it. So now I'm considering dropping out, but I'm really lost at this point and I honestly ain't sure if it is the right thing to do. I afraid that this decision could be reckless and I'll regret it in the future. Don't get me wrong, I still want to be a programmer and I know education isn't useless, but learning things about something you don't need to know and you honestly don't know what even is about seems to be waste of time. Maybe if I'll drop-out, I would be able to concentrate on learning things, which I really love about, and be more happier than I'm now. Also, I know that is degree not must, but still is useful, so I would search another course which maybe fit my needs. 
What is your opinion about it, guys? Maybe I'm over-reacting or searching easier way? Any opinion or personal experience would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!


tl;dr first year at university is a hell: no friends, boring classes, which aren’t even related to the programming. Want to drop-out, but ain't sure if it's the right thing to do. I love programming, but this seems wasting of time.",28Mar2018,2

I had feelings for a girl and we started dating. Not even two months later we break up. What I didn't realize was that I was falling in love. During that period she went and dated my best friend which tore me apart. One day I couldn't hold that feeling in I was cutting crying and just an all out wreck. I told her how I felt and that ruined their relationship. Then she came back with me we made plans and everything for our future. A couple months pass and we had to stop because we were stressing out. She then decides to go date my other friend which surprise surprise made me feel like shit. And her excuse was "" I still love you I'm just dating him to get my mind off of the future."" At this point I'm still in love with her. Whenever she needed help emotionally or physically I was always there. Lately we haven't been talking. She may be dating someone else I have no idea. But I'm so unsure on what I should do. 

I don't know if I should just let her go and move on. There is another girl that makes me laugh whenever I'm in a shitty mood and is just perfect.

189,"TL;DR at bottom. Long post.

So, its not exactly a friend, he's a cousin of a friend. I met my friend Mike (not real names in this post) in a class in college and we studied together 4 or 5 times, never met outside of a school setting but we have some similar interests that we kept in touch about. The last time I talked to him was a year and a half ago.

2 weeks ago, Mike and his father called me out of the blue needing some help with his cousin (without his cousin on the line). His cousin Yuri plays a video game that I also play and it's consuming a big part of his life. He's failing high school and considering dropping out and spends all day playing. 

Now, before I go on, I want to express this same scenario happened to me except for in college instead of high school, and since then I have gotten my mental being well under control and have a stable job and relationship. So this was a relatable struggle for me, and I actually was pretty eager to try and help out.

Mike told me Yuri doesn't want to do anything with his life right now and that the threat of his family taking the game away will just make him turn to drugs or to hurting himself. In return I talked to Mike about what I went through and how the most likely situation is that there's something or someone at school that's making it so that he doesn't want to go, and maybe therapy or a more productive activity to distract himself with could be temporary answers. It took half an hour of maneuvering around the conversation to get out that he's getting teased or bullied at school. I asked Mike if I could have Yuri's number and talk to him about it and try to help him or at the very least give him a friend he can share some hardship with, and he gave it to me.

I started with a text and this is how it went (these are summaries):

* **Me**: Hi Yuri I'm a friend of Mike's, he told me a little about what's going on, I play (game) too and can relate to you a little bit. If you want to talk about anything you can come to me.

* **Yuri**: They think (game) is the source of my depression when it's not, it's my escape from it.

* **Yuri**: I ultimately don't have anything to say about it.

* **Me**: I feel you, I used it the same way.

* **Me**: I went to a small college in (location) and didn't have much to be proud of and I used (game) to forget about it.

He never replied. That was 2 weeks ago, I was wondering if I should text him back again? If putting this pressure on him won't be helping? Should I get back with Mike to tell him I at least talked to him?

Any recommendations or hypothetical solutions would be much appreciated. &lt;3

190,"So long story short: my father got hooked on drugs when my sister and I were little (she was 3, and I was 4). He tried to kill my mom at his worst—he strangled her but he stopped when I bursted into the room and yelled at him to stop. After that my mom packed everything she could and we left the state. He tried to find us for a while, but eventually gave up.

12 years later, when I was 16, I got a message from him on facebook on my birthday. He seemed like he was trying to reconnect after all these years, and asked me for an address to send me a present (which I didn’t give him obviously). He then messaged me a couple of weeks later angry that we had a restraining order on him (that he had supposedly found out about after getting pulled over). And I went off on him about it, and we haven’t talked since.

My mom died a year ago, and despite everything he did, she never talked badly about him. We lived in poverty growing up (he never paid child support) because my mom got very sick and became unable to work. We were homeless several times. Growing up I used to put my dad on this pedestal, but looking back, I kind of blame him for the lives we were forced to  live.

I don’t know if he’s still on drugs. I don’t know if I want a relationship with him, especially after what he did to my mom. But I have half of my DNA from this person, and I don’t even know him. I’m not sure if I’ll regret not connecting with him in the future.

193,"I'm 17 and take full time college courses. 15 credit hours. This semester is extremely rough. I've missed probably half my classes. Some of this is my severe sleeping problems where I find it incredibly difficult to actually go to sleep, not feeling naturally tired until about 3-4 a.m. most nights and my body constantly wanting to sleep 10-11 hours and if I don't sleep for that long I feel constantly tired and not 100%. One thing I truly believe in is go for a career that you will enjoy rather than one that will bring the money in. For the classes I don't show up to not because of sleep are either from minor depression or some other issues. This issue I don't know if it is a lack of motivation, boredom or what. I don't like school, I like learning. I can learn far better from self teaching myself and real world experience. I am taking a networking class right now and I hate it. Not because I don't understand the subject, it is just extremely boring and at such a slow pace. I rather spend 12 hours learning how to code a simple program then spending 4 hours in lectures going over 4 different functions for that language. I've forgotten most of it now but I taught myself some basic Chinese. I could NEVER take a course to learn Chinese or any language but I'll teach myself it. For the field that I want to go into, this isn't a completely bad thing. Some very successful people in tech have dropped out of college to pursue their dream or even just minor things. I'd never take a cooking class but I taught myself and slowly learning how to make some, at least in my view pretty good food. Yet I find 0 motivation to show up for these classes...  
I guess the question kind of is, I have to finish the classes I need for High School, but do I abandon my degree to work part time in the tech business where I can take my ability and passion to self teach myself things in at a fairly quick pace and my ability to utilize the resources I have to get work experience and work up through a job that way? I don't care if I'm not making $500,000 a year being a CPU architect, I'd find it much more fun to work for a lower end tech company even for marketing for someone like NZXT, Corsair, EVGA ect. I'm not saying I'll become a master at something. Through my spare time I can self teach my self things. I've read in many areas where someone with 0 education were hired over other people solely through contacts, previous work experience and showing what they know rather then just flashing around their Masters. I've already gotten a few certificates to help get a basic job in tech. I just don't know. ",28Mar2018,19

I have been bestfriends with a girl that initiated our first convo together. We both are studying in the same school now. She is really smart and really touchy with me. 

A little bit about me: introvet , 1.9m and really muscullar (rugby lock)

Brief description on what we do:

She has invited me over to sleep and suggested to ""cuddle"" (i put my leg over her leg because she asked for it while we were napping). We study, eat together all the time. There were times where she would hold my hand and drag me to places. There was a period of time where i was depressed and she bought me $10 worth of goodies to cheer me up, even spending an evening after school with me just to check up on me.she was even angry with me once for not bringing her to my mum's restaurant ( that was like 6hrs ago after posting this) after finding out about it. She and I game, watch movies and do really nasty stuff (not sexual, like putting a booger on each other face or plucking my facial hair). I met her friends and family and they have been shipping me with her all the time even when she was around, but she wouldnt mind.

But here comes the problem. 

She been saying that she is lesbian or bi. i grown too attached to her to the point where i cannot tell whether it is a joke. There were even times where she hang out with other guys that got me really jealous ( she is really open and charasmatic and talks to many people). I developed really strong feelings for her and tbvh she is my motivation to work hard and gym. A text from her or a snap always get my heart pumping. Its been a year and i really want to confess my love to her but i m afraid i might destroy and hurt both of our feelings. What should I do i really cannot handle the feeling of not expressing my emotions!",28Mar2018,3
196,"Sorry this is really long...

I (19F) am in an ICT class and our next project is to make a presentation about a specific topic that must include a drag and drop game and a 2-3 minute video. This is being done in groups of three (the other two in my group are around 17-18, both male).

It started okay. We were talking a little and choosing what each person has to do. The two boys chose to do the presentation itself and offered to gather footage for the video while I offered to do most of the filming and editing of the video because I have the most knowledge on editing, plus three of the presentation slides (out of 14) because by the teacher’s request, everyone had to do some of the slides. We agreed to do the game together.

A week later I asked my ICT teacher could I use her class that day to gather footage for the video. She said yes and I left. A few second later the rest of my group comes out and I’m thinking “cool! More people to gather footage”. Nope! They spent the whole time somewhere messing around while I went around school with my phone getting what I needed like a weirdo (I had to film students and that looked strange). I know that I offered but it would have been nice if they helped record as well.

The next day I spent 5 hours almost straight editing the footage, editing the audio and making sure that everything ran smoothly. I even got the music and some footage from home to use and brought in a tripod for recording (which broke but unrelated to my upcoming frustration). 

At this point it was near the end of the day and I was wrecked. I was in my Drama class asking my friend (who is also in my ICT class) about their group’s project and he told me that my group complained the whole time I wasn’t in when I couldn’t make it in because of snow. All they had to do was put some text and images on some slides and they are complaining that I wasn’t in for a day or two. I had a play in two days and wouldn’t be in class so I had to get it done by the next day. But SURPRISE SURPRISE! The full video wouldn’t work at home, only in school. I spent half an hour panicking that I lost 5 hours of work and sure enough it was in school the next day.

So the next day I told my group about the panic and what happened. Then one of them said “so is it done then?”. Gaaaah! I just said “pretty much” politely and did the bits that I couldn’t do at home. I showed them the music and they said “I don’t like the music”, “Yeah it’s too slow”. I would have accepted their constructive criticism if we split the work equally but they didn’t do not to be rude but, they have little to no say in this video. One of them DID offer me some footage for the video but I had to decline it because it was too far finished to add. 

Ten minutes later one of them asks if I would do the game, even though we all agreed to do it together! In my slightly pissed off state I said yes for some weird reason. That was my fault but the fact that I’m doing the two most technical parts of the project is crazy. Then the other one asked if I would take minutes for that day (we had to take minutes for each time we meet as evidence). At that point I said no. They both got really annoyed at me and one of them muttered “I’ll do it then...”.

So three weeks into the project I’ve done three slides, programmed the game, did pretty much all of the video (which included voiceovers, music, footage, photos and text) and took 80% of the minutes (I declined once but I still took 4 sets of minutes in three weeks since no one else bothered, we meet three times a week and one boy did two while the other did none). I can’t go to my teacher about it because the project is based 30% on teamwork, 30% on individual work (which is separate and 40% on the project itself. If I don’t do all this, no one will and I really need this grade because I’m rubbish at exam and already failed the first one out of two. What can I do about this situation?

198,"Okay, to start off, we communicate on Facebook because that's the main way we can communicate. We can't communicate in person because of where she lives.

Now onto the problem:

I feel as if the relationship dynamic we have is unfair. She takes over two weeks to respond to my messages 99.9% of the time, all the while being active on Facebook fairly often. I've tried talking to her about it twice. I only brought it up a second time because she didn't change, yet she got angry at me for doing so (I don't really get that).

The second time I brought it up to her, she claimed that she has issues with communication and that isn't just me-- she has problems talking with her boyfriend and mother, too.

It's very confusing. My heart is telling me that my friend is right about her just not caring, but I'm not sure if that's the correct assumption to make. My friend also said that he thinks her claim of having communication issues is just an excuse. 

I mean, if she truly cared, wouldn't she have tried to change? The fact that she didn't seems to signify that she doesn't give a damn about my feelings.

She replied two days ago after not replying since the 9th of this month. I haven't opened her message yet. I was thinking of doing so and just ignoring her or just blocking her. Blocking her seems too extreme, if I'm being honest.

Both of my parents have been addicted to crack for 20 years. DYFS has been in and out of our lives. When I was 8-10, my siblings and I all lived in foster homes while my mom went to rehab and my dad ran away to Washington state because he was not willing to get help. 

My mom just barely got us back, but she did, and things were okay for a year or two while we all adjusted to living at home again. Then my drug-addicted dad came back into the picture and dragged my mom down with him. Things have gotten worse and worse since then. My youngest sibling is in elementary school, and he is being so badly affected by all of this. He's so angry all the time--we all are--and I don't want to see him go down the wrong path in life. My siblings and I are stuck because we want to call DYFS (for the 4th time now) but my parents do not react well to them. 

We are completely financially dependent on our mother (breadwinner), under her insurance, drive her cars, etc. My other two siblings and I are in college, and I am about to start law school next year, so financially we will be even more reliant on her. 

Both parents are so far deep into their addictions that they cannot see the damage they are doing to their family. Neither are willing to get help, and even at the mention of dyfs, my mom threatens to completely cut me off. I don't know where to turn next. Please help.

My mother is a lawyer and makes a lot of money, which is how my siblings and I can afford to go to college. She is a very high-functioning addict and she has amazed her therapists, doctors, etc. She also has amazing insurance and makes sure to see doctors regularly. My father, on the other hand, has been deteriorating for some time now. He can't hold a job, sleeps all day, spends any money he makes on crack immediately, and has lost a ton of weight.

214,"I'm a male and I've been with my girlfriend for since we were 18. We recently both just turned 20. We're still very young and we both are extremely busy with college and jobs. About 3 months ago, we found out she was pregnant. We don't know how it happened but it did. She went of birth control briefly to find a new one that would work better for her, so I'm assuming that's why. Anyways, we found out and had a serious discussion about what to do. We both agreed that we weren't in any place to care for a child right now. Both of us aren't in favour for abortions so we came to the conclusion that she would birth the baby and give it to parents who can't have a child on their own. I never forced her into this decision. I was very respectful and understanding of the situation and I want what's best for her. If she decided she wanted to have an abortion, I would support her. We came to this conclusion together and we both were happy with it. 

OK, so fast forward three months. She's now around three and a half months pregnant. It's been going really well. Our parents were supportive of our decision. We've started looking for parents and have narrowed it down to a few that we like. It's looking really great. But, she recently expressed to me that she's having second thoughts. She said that she doesn't want the baby to end up in the wrong hands and that maybe we were meant to care for this child. I tried to tell her that we don't have the money to have a child right now but she wouldn't listen. I didn't push it and thought she would change her mind after we looked more into potential parents. But, she's gotten even more attached to the baby. She's started brainstorming names for it and she's getting really excited to find out the gender even though we didn't want to know. She keeps telling me that she thinks we should keep the baby and she won't listen to anything I'm saying. She really wants this baby. I'm trying to be supportive but i know we aren't in the position to care for a child. I don't want her to get attached. I live in a dorm room and she lives in a small, cramped apartment. We're both struggling with money and have jobs that we are at when we're not in school. There's no way this baby would have a good life. What can I do??? ",28Mar2018,2
216,"I am not terribly close to my sister. I'm a 23 year old male and she is 14. We both live under the same roof though. She has always been a good kid, in all honors classes, a few friends, but nobody she hung out with all the time. She's always been kind of awkward and next year her freshman year was going to be a sort of fresh start for her.

I guess she got in trouble with my parents so they took her phone and my mom snooped around (I know) and saw and was sexting a guy, sending nudes, talking about drinking with friends and saying she was going to try smoking weed. She even apparently was begging this guy to sneak in through the basement window and come over when our parents were out of town this past weekend. Luckily he was out of town as well. This is totally out of character for her and I was pretty shocked to hear it. My mom confided in me because I've had a similar past. I didn't start at her age but, I used to smoke weed, and I have a 3 year old child, although I never had sex until I was 18.

I'm not sure what I can/should do. My mom is distraught and doesn't know how to handle it either. I thought I might talk to her about how some of those things have negatively affected my life or made it harder, but my mom doesn't want me to say anything until she figures out what she's going to do.

Any advice?",28Mar2018,1

219,"I got married a couple of months back. We only had a month and half to prepare and get everything booked etc. Even though I wanted to have a really fancy wedding I couldn’t really afford too much. So I had an average kinda wedding, my dress wasn’t what I wanted for myself because I didn’t have enough time to look for a perfect one. Not many family members attended the wedding because my mum didn’t want some people to come. So all in all it was nothing like how I imagined it. 



Now I see my friends who got married after me and had a year or more to prepare had their dream weddings...
I’m not really a person who gets jealous but I can’t stop thinking about my wedding day and wishing I could do things in a better way. My husband doesn’t care about such stuff but I overthink about this stuff so much, sometimes I can’t even sleep properly. Seeing their beautiful photos on Instagram I just feel so bad for myself. Is there any way/advice which can make me think differently?? Any books anything. I deactivated my Facebook 3 years ago and I kinda think that I should delete my Instagram too...

221,"Hi all,

I need advice on what digital recorder is the best but also cheap.

I have a brother who’s mentally disabled and blind. He loves the digital recorder cause it can plays the music I put on there for him, Lion King soundtrack and the Cuphead soundtrack as well.

He constantly listens to it hours at a time. 

My problem is not very simple. He always seems to break them. The power button always breaks off or he breaks the play button, it’s getting very hard to find a digital recorder that actually works for him, and he’s very aggressive with it.

I need a digital recorder that can take a pounding and can accept MP3 files from the computer to the recorder. Preferably with a power button instead of a slider. I need it to at least survive more than a month lol. Unfortunately I need something not crazy expensive as well.

I’m at the end of my ropes, I can’t find a good enough recorder for him and I want him to enjoy himself but it is seriously hard to find something that can last a while.

No friends or anything else. But she says she’s not in love with him either, just putting on a show to get by too get by until the summer  when she graduates. During this time I was talking to another girl because I wasn’t with her. This girl lets call Grace (not real name) is sweet and all and I started to talk to her and she likes me. I’m at a point where I’m getting stressed and can’t handle this because I never meant for it to happen. I thought I was going to be with Alex eventually and I love her so much. I really do. She’s all I can think about. I love her. We hang out everyone once and awhile and she does kiss me and we do talk about all of that, I just love her..

What should I do at this point. I really want Alex but I also hate being sad because I hear her talking about him and that she wants to leave but has to wait till the summer.

Anyway, I'm not a kid anymore and I've been working for the past 2 years in another province until recently I got laid off and went back home. I know now that I was unhappy in my area of work and I'm trying to become a self taught front-end web developer (which is going good). Also I want to travel so bad. I havn't had a vacation in the last 3 years and have only been to back home once before and recently to a funeral for my grandfather. Lately alot of people in my family, friends and my half sisters family have been passing away. I really want to go see my grandfather and step-grandmother on my other side of my family two provinces away, since I have not seen them since I was 15 and I'm scared I may not see them again if I do not go sometime soon. My mom would prefer I stay home and work. I told her I wanted to drive cus I do want to go on a road trip anyway since I haven't been on a vacation in so long. She's totally against it and would rather I fly back and forth if I'm adamant I want to go. I think she's both scared for my safety and scared I might not come back home if I leave with my car.
She's trying to be so controlling since I got back home, trying to make me set down roots here at home and work here and live here. 
 i know it because she has joked about me staying here forever a few times. when ever I try to talk about my plans for the future and living in a bigger city and coding she gets mad and doesn't want to hear it.

233,"A quick back story: My best friend liked a girl and tried to make a move, and she frienzoned him(not openly but we all understood). One night we went a bar as a group that includes me,the girl and my best friend.  That night girl hugged and danced with me, i danced only one song and  got away from her (thinking about my bestfriend). After night, girl said she is hungry, evetbody left and we were alone (girl and me), we chatted ,i thought , i would drink a coffee and go home, but ending was watching the rise of the sun together, i was feeling very weird.

At the morning, all i was thinking i should tell to my friend what happened and i did. And i said i like her.

It did not go well.

He said, he does not trust me, because i should have avoided her and yes, i did not run from her openly. He is thinking , if i did this, i would do worse things.

 My friend in a bad situation right now, he broke up recently and he is very insecure about girls, so another rejection was not good for him and i know , i should be with my bestfriend but instead of, i flirted with the girl who rejected my friend.

In a normal situation, i would avoid her, but this time what happened, i dont know. I am 26 years old, so i am not a child, i am sure about my feelings and i dont like girls very often, it is hard for me.

But, also, a friend for 8 years is very important too. I did not make a open move to girl but i know, as soon as i do, we will be together.

My friend's last words were be happy with her, but i know he does not mean that in reality. I said, if you were in the same situation, i would let you go for her, because, i would think, if he comes and says these to me even in this time, he really feels something and i would understand that.  He said , in same situation, he would not let her come close to him at first.

235,"About 2 months ago, I kept seeing the same guy at the gym that I was interested in on campus. Wed see each other in passing in the hallways and we'd always look but never acknowledged one another. We would also end up working out at the same times and there was this odd tension in the air.

Eventually, we broke the ice because we had a mutual friend and he started talking to me. For a few days after that we talked a lot, made conversation etc. I developed a crush on him and hoped he'd ask me out. All the signs pointed towards it coming into I stalked him on Facebook and found out he has a girlfriend, which he never mentioned.

I stopped talking to him as much and stopped flirting. He definitely did not know I knew he had a girlfriend but hes started flirting even more. according to one of the other regulars in the gym, I'm the only one he talks to and he's usually really into his workouts. From the outside, If you saw him interact with me, you'd definitely think we were either seeing each other or heavily flirting.

What threw me off is that he added me on Facebook. So now he knows for sure that I know he has a girlfriend. He added me right after telling me he was going on a work term and wouldn't be in school for 8 months.

Now yeah, he could want to be friends but this guy is obvious with his flirting and staying in really close proximity. He literally only talks to me and tries being in my area in the gym all the time. He also leans in to talk to me. Ive really tried toning it down but he's kicked it up a notch.

I don't know what his intentions are and I'm not sure how to proceed with this. Part of me thinks I should slowly cut off contact and part of me thinks maybe he just wants to be friends but my gut thinks there's something else going on and so does everyone else who sees us interact.",28Mar2018,1

240,"I am the leader of a team at my workplace, and recently applied for a different role which would be a promotion.  The only person I disclosed this to was my LM as I am required to do so.

After a while, people began coming up to me and asking whether I was applying for the job.  I tried to put them off, but after a bit I decided to just tell the very minimum truth and confirm that I had applied, but that I expected the existing post-holder (who is having to re-apply for the role) to retain the job - which I 100% believed.  Important point - no-one in my team asked me about this, and I only responded to people who would ask me directly.

The process for the job went ahead, and today I was informed privately that out of the X candidates for the job, I have tied with the existing post-holder and therefore there will be another stage to assess us.  

Shortly before I left work, our very senior manager sent out an email naming myself and the existing post-holder as the remaining candidates for the job!  I am completely shocked as to why this has been done.

Anyway, the point of this post is that once this email had been sent, I stood up and said immediately to the members of my team that it was clear I had applied for the role.  One of the team then said that they had been aware of this for a while and they were ""disappointed I had not told them myself"".

I will of course now be speaking to them all ASAP en masse to clarify from my own stance, but my question is:

- I don't engage in office gossip, nor would I expect anyone in the office to disclose to me if they were in the process of APPLYING for a job.  Am I being crazy to think I did nothing wrong here?  Of course, if I were to be successful, I would inform my team straight away, but I think to tell them what jobs I am applying for is just ludicrous!

248,"EDIT: Thank you everyone who took their time to come write a meaningful response. I'll try to answer some of the questions brought up.

The religion I'm afillliated with is Spiritualism, and the classes are once a week, about the religion itself and how to improve myself and understand the doctrine behind the religion. We also believe that everything happens for a reason and that our paths are laid out for us long before we were born. So I can see why God has put us in the same room again, and why it happened in this moment of my life that I'm trying to find spiritual solace for other things in my life. I guess it's just something else that I'll learn to deal with and find comfort.

I do not think he either remembers my daughter, as it was so long ago (he's been happily married to the woman he dated a little after my daughter) or knows that he actually raped her. The way that it happened (them dating for a while, they were at his house, she was astonished while it was happening that wasn't able to react or stop it), and the way my daughter supressed it for such a long time afterwards, makes me believe that it would be impossible for me to report him. I don't want to cause a rift in the family. I don't want to be seen as the bad guy who is ""making things up"" and as my daughter cut contact with our family for other reasons, I don't think she'd like to be the talk of the town again, especially regarding such a heavy topic.

I would like to know though, why he did it. And why he never apologized to her. Even if he didn't know at the time what he had done. She felt pretty heartbroken when he dumped her, but that's the way I remember it. When she finally told me that the last time they saw each other was the day it happened, I was able to understand why she was so gloomy, even though it had been a short affair.

___________

I have a 27 year old daughter. When she was 18, she was raped by a family friend. She didn't tell anyone at the time, as she felt guilty as well for it happening. They had been dating for a couple weeks (he was 24 at the time) and she went to his house to watch a movie, when he assaulted her.

She told me everything when she was 23, and I felt livid. I didn't want to tell me husband as I knew he would go after the guy. So I kept this secret, hoping I wouldn't have to think about it anymore. The guy had stopped hanging out with the family a couple months after the rape had happened, so I didn't have to deal with him anymore.

Cue to the present. I'm doing a church class that lasts 4 years, to help me become more spiritualized and all. On Monday, the guy walked in my class. I'm taking the class with my two nieces and their husbands, and the guy is one of the husband's best friend. They stayed together during the group activities and at the end of the class I asked one of my nieces if he was the guy who used to go to the family gatherings 10 years ago, and she said yes.

I don't know how to act on this. I have to spend 4 years looking at his face. I called my daughter today to inform her, as I felt keeping this information from her was a betrayal. She didn't seem upset about it, as she told me she's  gotten over it. She goes to therapy and has been doing it on and off since the time the rape happened. She said she has come to peace with the assault and that she moved on. She deals with depression and anxiety, and I can't stop thinking that the rape had something to do with it. 

I also don't know if I'll be comfortable sharing the class' space with him. I started taking the class to make myself a better person, and now whenever I'm there I'm flooded with violent feelings and thoughts. I wish I could kill the man. I don't know what to do Reddit, and I really want to support my daughter and let her know I'm here for her.

I don't know if you understood what I just said. Hopefully you did.
So, my question is: can I go straight to college/uni in Finland without having ended high school there? I mean, can I end high school in Greece and then go to Finland?

Even if I couldn't give two shits about what their talking about, I'll still try my hardest to be engaged and listen to them. 

My bf uses this to her advantage and almost everything we talk about is either about her, her interests or her love life. As interesting as she is, theres only so much I can take! In the past two years I can't think of a single time where she's asked about my interests, and only 4 times where she hasn't changed the conversation topic to herself within a few seconds when I talk about my own interests. As well as this, I've been there for her during all her mental breakdowns, lows, or whenever she's just feeling sad whilst she hasn't comforted me once. I know she's suspected to have bpd and this probably affects her ability to be a good listener but I feel so used.

Something that pisses me off to no end is the fact she gets perfect grades and never tries. Never. No revision,  no homework, she's just naturally a fucking genius. Hell, she got scouted by the fricking MOD! Meanwhile, I try so so hard, put all my effort in in class and everyone around me still thinks I'm a dumbass that's only useful for venting to or telling jokes.

I know she can't really help being a genius or a bad listener or having a mental illness and I feel like such a prick for thinking this but I know that I can't last much longer in this friendship or I'm going to end up lashing out at everyone around me or  become more miserable than I already am. But I can't stop being friends with her, she's mentally unstable and quite dependant on me despite the fact I'm never her first choice. I feel terrible and don't know what to do, please someone give me some advice.",28Mar2018,2
258,"I was never good at asking other people for help. I have struggled with this my entire life. If I had a problem with a math question in grade school, I would be too afraid to ask my teacher for help. It's led to my depression, but I am not entirely depressed. I am getting help from a therapist and psychiatrist. I do have a part time job and a support system (family). 

It's just something that I have come to notice about myself. I feel anxious about asking my friends or coworkers for help. Whether it be advice on my career path to simple things like being assertive enough at my part time job at a retail store.

It's just, I'm struggling so much with a problem and the easiest and simplest thing to do is ask another person for help, and I just can't do it. I guess that means that I don't believe in myself. Trusting myself. It feels so easy for everyone I know, but where do I begin?",28Mar2018,1
260,"Hello, everybody, I am looking for a little advice from anybody who has had a similar situation. My boyfriend's late mother's birthday is in a few days and I want to do something to honor her. She passed away ten years ago, but J (my boyfriend) has a difficult time dealing with it. For Christmas, I finally found some pictures of her, lots of family drama has left him with nothing except his own memories of her. Her pictures and ashes are with her father who has cut all ties to the rest of the family. J now has 5 pictures of terrible quality, but he really enjoyed getting them, although it was emotional for him to look at the pictures he told me repeatedly he was very thankful. Like I mentioned her birthday is in a few days and I don't wanna make it harder than it needs to be, but I don't want it to just be another day on the calendar. I want him to feel supported, and I just am looking for ideas that are simple, but still show him he is supported and its okay to remember his mom. I was going to make one of her favorite meals, but that is all I have really come up so far. Any ideas would be appreciated thank you.

262,"There's this girl who is probably into me, and I'm pretty much in love with her. So far nothing has been going on because I have  issues with myself. 


The problem is multifold. 


* I have a student debt loan of 17.000 usd that I should pay over the next 10 years (1% interest rate). Check the point below to see why this matters. 


I do have a family that can support me in need, fx my brother is currently making 11.000 usd a month and said that I should just ask him if I need money, but I'm not the type of guy who takes money from others except if I'm in dire need. 



* the job I end up with is only going to make me about 2500 usd a month with a house rent of 750 usd. We are both studying the same thing so she's going to make the same amount.


* I am traumatized from my teenage years due to hanging out with gang members who stabbed and fought each other with knives and threw axes and shit around even against me (I was never badly physically hurt nor did I ever do anything illegal)


* this has left me socially crushed and made me have a hard time trusting people initially. I do have 9 friends who I occasionally hang out with. Everyone says that I am the nicest and most pleasent person to be around. However, because of the trauma I usually end staying home alone and read/train. I've never been with a girl for that reason. Sometimes in the afternoon all of my muscles tenses up and I freak out a bit. 



If i think about why she might be interested in me then it could be my nice, humble character, intellect, honesty, height and how muscular I am. But she certainly can't be interested in me because of my social status nor the fact that I act super weird around her. 



So let's say that take a hypothetical situation:  we begin dating. **How am I supposed to address these issues with her?** I don't want to hide or trick her. **And when is the appropriate time?** Part of me want to be with her yet another part wishes her the best. If I think rational, then there's just no way she couldn't score someone better than me. ",28Mar2018,3

266,"Location: Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Seems important because of regional differences in education, potentially.

My friend is an undergraduate Math major applying for grad schools to Biostatistics programs. His [target program](http://www.bu.edu/sph/admissions/applying/programs/master-of-arts-and-doctor-of-philosophy-degrees-in-biostatistics/) has a requirement of 4 credit hours in Linear Algebra. However, his university has never offered the Linear Algebra course as a 4-credit course. Instead, he has already taken the Linear Algebra 3-credit course required for his undergraduate degree at his university.

To meet this requirement, he needs to take the course at another university at a significant cost to add it to his transcript and effectively making the Linear Algebra course he did take useless and a waste of money.

Below are a list of universities taken from this list which I could determine taught the course and at what credit count:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_metropolitan_Boston

I skipped over the Associated and Special Focus colleges because I don't expect to find the course in their listings.

Universities that offer the course at 4 credits
---

Boston University offers the course at 4 credits.

Eastern Nazarene College offers the course at 4 credits.

Emmanuel College offers the course at 4 credits.

Simmons College offers the course at 4 credits.

Suffolk University offers the course at 4 credits.

Boston University offers the course at 4 credits.

Brandeis University offers the course, but it's not clear how many credit hours the course counts towards.

Harvard University offers the course through Harvard Extension for 4 credits (though only 2 hours a week) at $1,550 for undergraduate credit.

MIT offers the course at 4 credits with an expected 8 hours spent outside of class.

Northeastern offers the course at 4 credit hours.



Universities that offer the course at 3 credits.

Lasell College offers the course at 3 credits.

Bentley University offers the course at 3 credits.

Boston College offers the course at 3 credits.

Brandeis University offers the course, but it's not clear how many credit hours the course counts towards.

Tufts University offers the course at 3 credit.

University of Massachusetts Boston offers the course at 3 credits.

---

I've also spent the last hour or two trying to find out if there were some standards for his degree that the university needed to meet to be accredited but I couldn't find any specific details on and of the accreditation websites in relation to topics or specific hours. Continuing to look seemed fruitless as no matter how I structured my search, all I received was the internal requirements of various universities and historic enrollment statistics about mathematics majors as a whole.

I have at least one figure for cost of taking a course as a non-degree student listed with Harvard. That's $1,550.

My friend is considering taking another semester at his current university and including a 4-credit independent study in Linear Algebra, which he's hoping the department will allow as an option. However, as a degree student who needs to maintain at least a 12-credit course load, the price of a semester at his university was $13,435 last year tuition has gone up. That 4 credit course would be taking 4 credits out of the 12 per semester required to maintain full-time status, so I'd estimate it would effectively cost 1/6 of that at roughly $2,717.

These are significant financial setbacks that a college undergrad can't take lightly.

What options does my friend have for handling this situation? His goal is obviously to get into his target program with as few speed bumps as possible. 

Are universities that offer the course at fewer than 4 credits doing something unethical? It seems like that should conflict with accreditation if they're not meeting a standard, but I couldn't find any information on that. Should he do anything about this?

Is the graduate program he's applying to being discriminatory in some way? By specifying a credit minimum, they can indirectly select colleges from which applicants can come from and disallow applicants from the other colleges. Is there something he should do about this?",28Mar2018,1

270,"20F. I have always been very close with my grandmother and have loved visiting her since I was a child. She lives alone in a very rural area with limited money and her health isn’t too great. A couple months ago, I decided to pack my things and try living with her and helping her out. I work in the area and help around the house with dishes, cleaning, and taking recycling to the dump. (We don’t have a garbage truck.) I also run errands and pick up groceries, contributing to paying for them when I can. (I’m still struggling financially from a car accident.) I thought moving to the idyllic countryside would help me escape ghosts of traumatic times back home and perhaps fix the restlessness and the nagging feeling of emptiness I have.

But recently I did some careful thinking and realized that I am very lonely. I visited my hometown not long ago and was not as anxious and sad—I saw many loved ones and felt fantastic all week. The emptiness went away, almost miraculously, when my schedule was so full and I was reunited with friends and family. Returning to the countryside was an awakening. I realized that for some time, I didn’t even know I was lonely! Because up until recently, I haven’t really felt anything but. Even as a kid I didn’t have many to confide in and go out with. I don’t have friends to hang out with here (most of the locals consist of elderly citizens). And though I love my grandma very dearly, living with her has given me new perspectives—she can be emotionally manipulative at times. I recently decided that I want to return to school and work on my career, and she became upset and tearful when I told her I unfortunately couldn’t do it online. (The school I’ve been dreaming of attending is very hands-on.)

I have recently come to a difficult decision: I think it’s time for me to come back home and socialize as much as I can before I’m off to school and away from my friends and family again. I am very excited about school and making new friends there, but I am still quite homesick and want to see people who make me feel loved and happy. I definitely plan to visit my grandmother every month and help her while I’m there. 

I know it’s unrealistic for my grandmother to expect me to stay with her forever, but I don’t want to hurt her. I want to be there for her, even if it’s in the form of visits, but I also want to work up to my dream job and get out while I’m still young. I’m trying to find a good time to tell her about wanting to come back home—I feel so guilty. Thoughts?",28Mar2018,1

Leaving this study woud leave my mother in ruins, I cannot even imagine how she would react. In her eyes, everything she invested in me, she did with the goal of me becoming succesful: By dropping out I am failing her in the worst possible way.

My grandparents have been married for 20-30 years but my grandmother isn't treated very well. My grandmother doesn't work (as she is to old and has major back/leg/feet pain) and lives off of $1200 a month. She drives in an old 1970s Volkswagen that is on its last breath but doesn't have enough money to get a new one. My grandfather on the other hand, makes $3000 a month + what ever he makes when he works. He owns 2 houses 6 motorcycles, a Mercedes car, and a truck but my grandma rarely is allowed to drive any of them yet refuses to do anything about my grandmothers situation (yet he pays $10,000 for a new roof to a house no one live in). My grandmother has to pay for all groceries every week(literally all), the Spectrum bill, the phone bill, and medical bills (including medication, and insurance + she has cancer) on $1200 a month. My grandfather pays the electric and water bills. Also, my grandmothers Heath insurance will no longer cover her medications so while she is trying to find a new health insurance provider she has to pay on full for her medication that she needs. My grandma cannot afford that and my grandfather refuses to help pay for them, he said, ""It's a bad business decision."" He also verbally abuses her telling her often she does nothing around the house when in reality she does everything (cook, clean, wash clothes, etc.) Also when he gets mad at her, he has said ""I will cop you up into a thousand tiny pieces and throw them in a river so no one will find you."" He also will lock her out of the house so she can't get in (she does not have a key for the weather door), and once even pissed on her clothes (literally open her drawers and piss on her clothes (I only know of this happening once)), He also recently shit himself in bed, got up and left it there for my grandma to clean it off the sheets/bed. My grandma has also told me he has raped her... forced her to have sex when she repeatedly said no... he is also constantly paranoid that she will leave him for someone else or leave him in general so she must tell him where she is going at all times and he will call and check on her. She wants to leave but she is way too afraid, she cannot afford a lawyer. In fact no one has told authorities because we are afraid he will do something to her. The family want to help by getting her out but she refuses to leave. We have talked to a lawyer but again the price is too high.

301,"So I met my husband in 2013. I was 17 and he was 21. When I moved in, he was living with his brother and mother in a small apartment. The 3 of them came here from Peru in 2011. His Mom has always cooked daily and she enjoys cooking. We got married in 2016. We're best friends, we've traveled back to his home country to meet his family and we do everything together. 

Let's fast-forward to the current year of 2018. My husband and I each have pretty good full time jobs. I work for a bank and he works with a construction company that does projects for the government. We're still living with mommy and his now 18 year old brother in a little bit bigger apartment. There are several reasons why I do not like living with them. First, I'm 22 year old married woman. I should be living with my husband in our own place. Second, I'm a complete neat/clean freak and his mom and brother are not. I'm tired of being the only one cleaning and cleaning up after them daily. I cannot decorate the apartment or buy nice furniture like I dream of one day doing. Third, his mom frequently calls her 9 siblings and has loud phone calls in the early hours of the morning waking me up, she'll also blast loud music no matter what time of day it is, among other annoying and rude things that she does. I could make a whole list but i'm not going to bother.

His Mom went to Spain to visit for 2 months in December. When she was gone, I did all of the cooking for him and his brother. I started following a lady on youtube, and everyday I was cooking delicious peruvian meals and several of them were meals that his Mom had never cooked before. He'd only ate them when he lived in Peru, or when he went to a peruvian restaurant. He absolutely loved my cooking, him and his brother each said I cooked better than his Mom. They even told her that. I do enjoy cooking and I know that I'm an amazing cook. I didn't get bored of it, and I loved doing it every night. 

When his Mom came back, I barely went back to cooking. Just the first week I did and that was because I already had meals planned out and had bought the ingredients for them. But she started using the ingredients that I bought, cooking chicken that I had put in the fridge to thaw, leaving the stove/dishes a mess for me to clean up. So I gave up. A couple times here and there I will cook a certain meal if my husband is craving it. But I do not like cooking while we're living with them, especially his mom. 
1. She's very nosy. When I'm cooking she is always in the kitchen for whatever reason, and she's constantly finding excuses to come over to the stove and (clearly) it's too see what I'm doing or what I'm using. I can't stand it. 
2. She leaves the kitchen dirty and smelly.

4. I feel like if he wants to live with mommy, then mommy will do the cooking. He's lucky that I clean and wash/fold/sort his clothes, because to be honest his mom should do that too. 

My husband and I had an argument the other day. His mom cooked Lentils for like the 5th time in the past 2 weeks and he was sick of it. So he demanded that I cook his meals because I'm his wife. I told him no. If you love my cooking, and you want me to cook, then give me my own apartment and I promise I'll cook for you every night like I did when your mom was in Spain. Cause I'm tired of it. I don't care if his mom is in the apartment across from ours. I just want my own kitchen, my own bathroom, my own living room, and my own front door. Am I wrong?? We can't even have kids because I refuse to get pregnant while living in an apartment with his family. Any opinions or disagreements? I'm open to anything. Thanks. ",28Mar2018,5

317,"TL/DR: Have lucid dreams, they stop and I am fully conscious but can't open my eyes. 


This might seem ridiculous to you. Most people actually want to know how to get into lucid dreams, but i'm not one of them. 

It all began about 2 years ago. I don't know what happened or how it did, but i started lucid dreaming right after i fell asleep. At first it was every 2 weeks, then more regular and now it has come to almost everyday, but it only happens in the first hour of my sleep. 

It's not that I can exactly fly through a fantasy world, it's based on my real life mostly but I am able to imagine things which will come up and i do eventually get to do things, which wouldnt happen in reality or atleast not that easily. 

After probably a few seconds of every dream, I realize I am dreaming. Then it gets really foggy, everything kind of vanishes and I try to wake up. But it won't let me. Dreams get messy and i don't want to say monsters, demons or something thrilling and horror related comes for me in my dream, but yeah that's kinda it.

Then I am fully conscious, I can hear things and all that. But I can't wake up. I try to, but my body won't let me open my eyes. Related to the nightmare part, I always get the feeling someone enters my room. I try to look at my door but it isn't possible. 

Right after that I can open my eyes, am fully stressed out and sweaty. I don't want this anymore and I am kinda scared of falling asleep. I am writing this because yesterday it happened five times in a row, complete differents dreams but with a terrifying end. 

Can anyone actually give me advice on this? ",28Mar2018,1

327,"So just a quick backstory...

I live in a fourplex and our neighbor in the front apt has been causing problems ever since she moved in. She seems to hate my husband and I for no reason, and gives us attitude, even though we’ve tried to be nothing but pleasant (honestly). 

She’s just a loud, obnoxious woman in her 50s (I’m guessing) who seems to have nothing better to do than complain. 

So, she has this dog, which her daughter also takes care of, I guess. But I’ve rarely, if ever seen them walk him. I know I can’t know what they’re doing all the time (but you’ll see why I’m assuming he’s not walked and I have a dog myself, so I tend to see the dogs of the neighborhood when I’m out)

My problem is that this woman sends her dog out to the grassy area in the front a few times a day (which has no fences or anything), without a leash (which is illegal) and then if anyone walks by, she screams at this poor dog, who must be confused out of his mind, and sends him inside.

She can’t even be bothered to stand near him, but stays on the steps of her apartment. 

So I ask you, wise people of Reddit, how can I help this dog without overstepping my bounds?

I know it’s not my business, but since I work from home, I hear her screaming at the dog constantly. I feel terrible for him. He needs to be walked. She had complained about him to me at one point (he’s a chihuahua mix), and I know now that most of his behavior problems would be alleviated if he actually got decent walks and exercise. 

When they’re not home, I hear the dog scratching at the front door constantly. 

I feel so bad for him. If you can’t walk your dog, or don’t have a yard for it to run around and explore, then you need to figure something else out. 

Sorry for the long-winded post...I’m just frustrated...Any advice? Thanks!!",28Mar2018,1

329,"I'll try to keep this as short and simple as possible. So here we go. Few weeks ago I obtained an item, I won't go into detail how just because its irrelevant (I didn't do anything illegal to get it) and I won't say what it is other than an electronic worth up to $250 brand new in the box. I got it second hand from a person and it was still in the box itself. Flash forward to earlier this week. The item was cool, but it wasn't gonna serve me any purpose so I decided to get rid of it and place it online. I placed it on both OfferUp and LetGo, and my friend placed on the same apps in agreement that I would give him a little money if he helped me sold it. Yesterday my friend was texting someone from the app and they were being shady AF. Trying to meet at 11pm at night, wanting to avoid a public place, low balling and offering only $100 when it was placed online for $200, and she kept changing the location where she wants to meet. Anyway the deal didn't go through obviously, flash forward again to this morning around 6am, the lady is texting my friend saying that the item was stolen from her I'm guessing, along with other items. But honestly I'm not believing her story that much. Because 1) she has an area code that's about 45 mins away, I think me obtaining stolen property from there is a little unlikely and 2) she refuses to send the serial number that she claims she kept to prove its hers. She's saying I should just GIVE it to her since she had to buy some of her own stuff out of the pawn shop... I also think she used the number she was texting my friend from and found his Facebook aand now claims she knows ""who"" he is and his gf, where he works, where his niece goes to school etc. 

Anyway, what I'm asking is two things. 1) do you think this lady is bull shitting? She refuses to send the serial number she claims she kept and 2)  what can the police do? Does she have a case at all? If the property is actually stolen then I have no problem giving it back, but I can't help but to feel like she's just bullshitting tbh. ",28Mar2018,1

341,"Hi all. 
I'll summarize the situation first, and then elaborate further below for those of you who feel like reading. 

My former best friend is asking me to testify in court against another friend, because she is claiming he raped her when she was drunk. I was at her house that night and witnessed them walk upstairs together, and then later saw them return. All three of us were drinking. We are all 18.  I don't know what happened but she later told me he had sex with her while she was too drunk to speak. She later joked about it, yelling casually, ""well you raped me!"" They had had sex previously, so it wasn't much of a shock to me and it didn't seem to bother her much later. They have since broken up, and my friends parents somehow find out and are threatening to take it to court. I don't want to be involved because:
1) I don't have any valuable information, i don't know what really happened
2) this is a stressful situation and I don't want to cause myself stress as I already have a challenging life. 
3) the ""rapist"" is a close friend of mine
4) I was drunk that night

I ended the friendship with this girl, let's call her sally, because the friendship was starting to deteriorate my mental health. Sally is a good person, but she has a lot of problems that I couldnt help her with. I still care about her. 
 The other person (who I am still friends with), let's call him Mac, was extremely close with sally and I. 
The three of us together were a hot mess. Drinking, drugs, and bad decisions were our norm. I made some bad decisions and have since cut all drugs except weed out of my life. 
I'm afraid that this court appearance would drag me into a lot of sticky situations because we often did very illegal drugs (prescription pills, cocaine, psychedelics) Im afraid to go under oath and discuss these matters. 
Also I care about mac and I don't think he maliciously intended to rape her, obviously it wasn't the right thing to do but she never said no, she was just acting drunk. I also think there's a possibility sally is just saying this because she was upset that he ended their relationship.

I kept putting him off until finally I just gave in and said yes. So on Sunday I picked him up and we drove around, smoked cigarettes, listened to music, and talked. He told me from the start that I need to be more confident and that he wasn't looking for a relationship which I'm fine with. He asked me if I could pull into a parking lot so we could chill. We talked for a little bit and he grabbed my hand and we held hands for a while. Then he wanted me to touch his dick through the outside of his pants. I kind of got freaked out and he told me relax and that it was just a penis. I told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. He said he could but said he didn't want to because he thought I should get it from someone I was going to be with. I asked him again and he said ""if u really want me to give u your first kiss I can."" He gave me a peck on the lips and then gave me another peck. I ended up giving him a hand job. Then we drove around and listened to music for a little while longer and then dropped him off where I met him. He hugged me and said our goodbyes. He ended texting me ""it was really nice meeting you! Don't tell people they probably won't like you when they see you. You're a great person and deserve a great person!""

Yesterday I was bored and asked him if he wanted to hang. We ended up hanging and just drove around for a little bit and went into a parking lot again. I asked him if he wanted to hold hands and he said not really. I could tell he was starting to pull back from me. I asked him if I could just have him kiss me one more time. He didn't want to and was like, ""see I don't want you to get too attached to me because the more attached you get the sadder you will be when I move away or get a girlfriend."" We did end up giving each other a peck on the lips and I gave him another hand job. He kept asking me why I'm so hard on myself and to stop belittling myself. He told me that I'm beautiful and a great person. I dropped him off and I kept asking him if he really wanted to hang out again and he said if u want to and I told him yes.

I understand he doesn't want to date me or have me get attached to him but I just feel down about it. I'm just fearing my insecurities will drive (if they haven't already) yet another guy away.

First of all i do have emotions, and it hurts me every time i talk to her, since i know the truth. Not only is he lying to her, but i became a partner in crime by telling her how much he loves her etc, etc. (I'm a very good wingman).

The second part is the more i get to know her, the more we have in common and this is making me develop a crush on her. She is a  keeper.

As you can see i'm doing several wrong things at the same time. It is eating me from inside. Every day i imagine what will i do, what will i say to that girl. Which apart from losing the love of her life, (she stated it to me), she will also lose her ""best"" friend (something i don't deserve to be called). 

The irony is that; I've been in relationships before, but never felt as i do for her. I feel like a time bomb, but i am pretty confident in my self to hold up and not F it up. More than it already is.

There's one proverb in my country Others we love, others love us, and with others we end up.

From you who have shared this experience or know anything related to my subject... I would be very, very grateful for any advice. 

Thank you!

348,"Hi everyone I need some advice on what to do about a random person who keeps trying to open my front door late at night around 2-3am. 

A little background, I had my front window popped open by an intruder and they took my wife’s purse and only her purse. The purse had her keys and some other valuables. We had our locks changed so the keys that were stolen wouldn’t work on our lock, however once or twice a week around 2-3am someone comes to my front door and forcefully tried to open it. Obviously I make sure everything is locked at night but I am very worried that whoever it is could come back with some form of tool/weapon and force their way into my house. I bought a security camera which I will be putting up to face my front door. I also bought one of those “smile you’re on camera” signs in hopes that it will deter whoever it is from trying my front door again. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions that would be beneficial in this situation? Thanks in advance for the advice! ",28Mar2018,2
350,"Though I would like to create a YouTube channel, my parents are pretty vigorously saying no and telling me my friends are “corrupting me” by making me want a YouTube channel.  I don’t really know what they mean by that, as they seem to approve of my friends.  Their only reason why is that “any job you apply for will google your name and see the channel, you don’t want them knowing that.”  First off, I don’t plan to reveal my name.  All the information I’ve given out over 9 months on Reddit is that I’m a teenager who lives in Maryland, which is probably generic enough that no one could come up to me one day and say “hey, you’re ArcOfRuin!  I know you from Reddit!”  I don’t think anyone, even a corporation, could put that together without some outside help.

TL;DR = want to convince parents to let me make a YouTube channel.  Despite years of presence on the Internet (if you know where to look, most of my accounts got abandoned when my old email was hacked), they refuse.  Any help?",28Mar2018,1
351,"Yeah, so i work a full time job and with the long commute (over thirty minutes each way) I have little time to do anything. I get home at 7 and only have an hour at my apartment to do anything loud (quiet hours start at 8). Honestly I sometimes proceed anyway because singing is really the center of my life. And everything else: guitar, bass, keyboards, writing, home recording.

For most of my life I've thought of myself as some kind of genius, to be honest. So it is terrible to not only have very little time to produce anything, but also not being allowed due to quiet hours, as well as the inhospitable nature of my apartment to recording. I live in the ghetto off of a busy street, with tons of traffic noise, sirens, shouting homeless people, helicopters at all hours. Unfortunately because I am a musician I am a terrible roommate and have been kicked out of two places because I usually just isolate myself and play music when I have free time. I can either live in a shitty place like this, or make potential roommates angry. I don't have any friends I could move in with.

I guess my only solution is to either quit or try to make singer-songwriter music with an acoustic guitar but I find it really hard to get excited about music that is so sparse. I can play really well but I always preferred making music like paint on canvas. I like layering myself and making recordings.  

I also wonder if I should move to a cheap, suburban city somewhere but I don't have a lot of job skills (and honestly don't care to get any, as I'm too focused on music) which might make it easier to live in a solitude and focus on creating nonstop.

Your thoughts?",28Mar2018,1
352,"I am currently a Mechanical Engineering Student. I study A LOT to try to pass my classes. My parents don't support me financially; besides letting me live at home rent free, and food. I am sure if they could afford they would. We've had a bad year, and both my younger and older sister have gotten in car accidents. Because I save money during the summer, and winter breaks, I am able to have money through the school year to pay for gas, and that is usually enough to get me through the year. Well this morning I got in a car accident. Tonight I am going to have to confront my mother. I know that this will be more money that we have to worry about. And I know that there is a high possibility my mother might have to force me to work. However, I do not see myself being able to pass my classes with having work cut into my study time. I know that if my rate does go higher I know it would mean that I would have to work for long term, knowing that my rate isn't going to lower anytime soon. I really don't want to have to switch majors, for something like this. If I do end up working somewhere, I would have to work over 10 hours to make ends meet and pay for my mothers needs. I do not know what to do. I am ALWAYS in a constant ball of stress, and this is just more to have to worry about. Some professional and motherly advice is needed. Thanks",28Mar2018,1
353,"Two weeks ago my parents found out that I smoke weed and they got really disappointed at me. I tried to explain them that weed isn't that big of a deal (I read and studied a lot about weed so that i could have ways to rationally argue with them in case this happened, which happened LOL), but they cried a lot and i've got really emotioned as well. I ended up giving them all my wee  (I didn't spend lots of money on it btw, and I saved some of my money so as to buy it, I never robbed it or anything like that as well) and they are afraid that i got addicted in it (which im not, pretty sure) and they also keep saying that it is a gateway drug, etc. 
 I don't want to stop smoking it and im still trying to convince them to be more ""legalize"" about that, but things just seem to keep getting worse (they keep saying that i'm crazy, that Im completely drugged which pisses me off a lot because im not), so im hardly considering to stop trying to convince them abou that.
 Weed brought me lots of happy moments and it also made me enjoy music in a completely different way and also made me more curious and critical.
Extra: 
- It didn't effect my studies, and my parents know that because i showed them my grades.
- It helped myself to have great night of sleeps, with my anxiety and also some muscle spams that i have 
- I also bought a vape to have less lung harm when smoking it
- I had been smoking it for 7 months, but I stopped because of this.
- I'm only 17

356,"I'm 20 years old, a Computer Science student, and a fairly hard working one.
I met this girl in college and I literally fell head over heels in love with her...We've known each other for 2 years now and she's the closest I've ever been to a human being.
She knows almost everything about me and vice versa(I think). I can't stop thinking about her and I'm always looking for ways to talk to her/meet her/ impress her etc...
Sadly, she doesn't feel the same and has alternated through several relationships during the span of our friendship...She insists on us staying friends, and I've partly succeeded in pushing thoughts of her to the back of my head(a fairly impossible task considering we see each other almost daily)

However, with the mounting stress of midterms and projects, this has all crumbled down somehow and I can't deal with myself anymore...I can't bear to end our friendship in fear of what that'd do to her but it's also really difficult to look her in the eyes and/or speak to her without my feelings gushing out from their hiding place.

Does anyone have a similar past or present experience or just know how I can deal with this before it gets to be crippling???",28Mar2018,1

361,"I recently had to take custody of my two younger siblings and find a house rather quickly. The houses are all very close together in the  neighborhood I live in. Well the neighbors called the HOA because my yard wasn't to their liking. 

Problem is that I'm renting and the yard had been neglected for months before I moved in and now I'm suddenly responsible for cleaning up the previous tenants mess? Ok no biggie took a couple hours and fixed the yard. 

Well today I get a letter in the mail that one of my neighbors had called the city and the HOA because my dog barks occasionally and it bothers them. Now I have a few days to train my dog not to bark or be fined by the city. I'm beginning to feel harassed. How can I retaliate or at least stop these assholes from giving me a hard time?

I just had to take custody of two kids and my life is stressful enough as it is without all of this extra bull shit. What, if anything can i do?

362,"My best friend of 6 years and I are going to the same college together (different majors). It’s a rather large university, so I suggested to her that we try to dorm together. She initially liked the idea, but then heard the story of her sister’s friend where he and his best friend were really close but then ended up hating each other when they moved in. I don’t think this will happen to us, but she is worried.
1) i am a neat person, she is generally neat but a bit messier than i am
2) she’s totally okay w/ me being a lesbian (I’m worried if i get a roomate i dont know bc of this)
3) both of us are super straight edge so no drugs/alcohol/sex in the room (shes religious and I’m not into that stuff)
4) when we have gotten into arguments in the past, i haven’t stayed mad at her for more than a day.
5) i have yelled at her before in public. i think this may be what she’s worried about.

364,"Probably a year or so ago my mom would watch my daughter 2 days a week and wanted $30 a day. Since she wasn’t in daycare or anything else my husband and I were fine with it. Now my daughter is in daycare 4 days a week but my mom still watches her 1 weekend day every other weekend because I have to help my husband with our farm. She told me that she felt weird getting paid to watch her granddaughter and didn’t want paid anymore. Then she texts me today and said she wants paid $20 every time she watches her. Trust me, it’s not about the money. I just feel kind of odd about it. If she only sees her once every other week I feel like she should watch her for me because she wants to not just because she needs the money. And my daughter is obsessed with her btw. She’s 22 months and is obsessed with her “Nonni”. I also feel weird about it because I know she needs the money. She drives about 20 minutes to our house and watches her for about 8 hours and I know if she went to an actual babysitter that a babysitter would get paid. My family has always guilted me into giving them money which is part of the reason why I feel uncomfortable with it.

Now I'm a 24 year old guy riddled with anxiety, but I've got decent people skills and I'm very good at keeping poeple from losing their shit. The downside here is that in doing so, I'm putting an immense amount of pressure on myself. It was manageable in my previous jobs, as I was more of a retail store clerk and didn't need to do that much for people, but this current job is KILLING ME.... Its basically tip toeing around conversations and trying to resolve people's issues, and I completely hate it.

Everytime i get someone on the line, i get a pit in my stomach and I feel like my body goes to full fight or flight mode, so for pretty much my entire shift I'm in high stress mode and i feel completely empty of everything at the end.

I feel completely defeated and devoid of any kind of motivation to do this job. I haven't wven been doing this for a month and I'm already looking for any reason to not work, or praying that i get a tech issue that would stop me from working.

Well three weeks ago she went to visit her sister, and ended up  joining this church   https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=618263374853303&amp;ref=content_filter and became a born again Christian. Suddenly she is backing out of our yearly craft fair because she prayed about it and the answer was no. She has to pray before she can do anything.

I just kind of snapped and told her I’ve stopped talking to people over comments like that and I love her but I am not having that conversation with her.

370,"I'm going through some of the stuff I've held onto for the longest time and I realize that to let go of some of them, I need to confront some of the people of my past.  And deal with them directly.  The problem is I'm trying to be as non-confrontational as possible while still being direct.  Usually it's either one or the other with me,so that's one problem.  Another is that one of these people is someone that I have to talk to in person, but I'm a bit nervous of talking with them face to face.  According to my mother, who has talked this over with me, I still turn sheet white whenever she comes around and I know for certain that I tend to avoid her whenever possible.

The long and short of it is she had to fire me after someone said that I did something terrible.  I did nothing of the sort and literally anyone who knew me *knew* that I'd never do something so horrible.  The woman who fired me had to, her hand was forced and I know that, and I've known that ever since it happened.  When someone says a person has done something as terrible as what I was accused of, of course that person is going to be fired.  I've always been grateful that such a stern policy was in place to protect those who needed to be protected, but was in agony that the system persecuted me in the process.

So the knowledge that her hand was forced and that it wasn't my fault or hers kept me from talking to her because I felt there wasn't really anything to be discussed, but the pain was still there.  It's left a rotting thorn in my side and kept me from growing as a person because I'm stubborn.  But I've had enough and I need to talk to this person, I know that.  The problem is that I'm still a little terrified.  There are times where I'm determined to do it, and then there are times where I feel I'll throw up at the very thought.  I just don't know how to gather the courage, keep the courage, and stick to my guns about what I need to discuss with her:  namely how it felt on my end and why.

tl;dr:  To be a better person, I'm confronting my past.  But talking to this one lady face-to-face?  Terrifying.  Help???",28Mar2018,1
372,"Okay, I last month I moved into an apartment complex so I am new to the neighborhood. I'm a huge dog lover and I love every single pup in this neighborhood. They're all friends. 

My neighbor recently got their daughter, appears to be about 8, a German Shepherd puppy. It's the cutest pup ever and I'm absolutely jealous. Beautiful dog. 

But putting aside the fact a German Shepherd is probably the worst possible dog to get for an eight year old, she treats the dog horribly. She's always hitting it, and she gets her friends in on it to hit it too. They just sit outside slapping the dog sometimes and telling the dog it's stupid and bad. I was walking my dog today and they were just sitting in the grass with the dog. There's German Shepherd sees my dog and barks twice.

They then proceed to tell it it's a ""Stupid, stupid bad dog,"" and then proceed to slap it over and over. The dog just rolls over on it's belly with it's tongue out because it doesn't know what it's doing that's so bad and they keep slapping it. 

I tried talking to the girl once and give her some tips on training a dog, how hitting should only be for very serious infractions, like biting or growling, and you only have to give a soft pop once or twice for them to understand. I told her most behaviors can be corrected by sternly scolding the dog, a firm ""NO"" is usually the best correction technique. And good behaviors should get lots of praise and affection. 

It didn't do shit. She still sits outside slapping this baby puppy. 

I want to say something to her parents. I really WANT to tell them German Shepherds are not good dogs to gift to such small children, but obviously I won't do that. I just want them to know she's awful to the dog, but I don't even know how to do that without coming off as telling them their child is a shithole to her puppy. Maybe they don't even care. Maybe they know. Lots of people don't give a shit. Maybe that's where the girl learned it from. 

I don't know what to do. I just want to help this poor dog. 

TL;DR - Eight year old girl in my neighborhood is abusive to her new German Shepherd puppy. I want to help the dog but I don't know how. Talking to the girl hasn't helped. Unsure if I should confront the parents. ",28Mar2018,31
