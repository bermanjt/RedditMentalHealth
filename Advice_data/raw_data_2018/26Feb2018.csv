0,"Let's start basic. 

I'm Asian, and my parents have been working the past 20 years in a Chinese restaurant every day of the week where many days, they work up till 12 or 1 in the morning to support me and my brother and it's killing me. My dad barely eats when it’s busy, and we still barley make more than 30k a year.

I love my parents, but the idea that I have to go to a top tier college and do well is soul crushing because I know how much they had to go through to give me this opportunity yet I can't bring myself to appreciate it. I get good grades, a 3.6 to 3.7 unweighted GPA but it's a lot of work, I hate it, and it hasn't helped me figure out what I want to do after High School. In fact half the time, it depresses the hell out of me when I get a bad grade as a result.

 Because of the language barrier I was never able to do any extracurricular's and due to the fact that I grew up in the U.S. learning English, I also barely speak enough Chinese to communicate with my parents. All of this has led me to dread the questions adults always give, ""What are you gonna do after High School?"", or ""What are you thinking of doing?"" To be honest, I have no idea and it terrifies me. My brother's gone to college, but it wasn't a great one, and I could tell my parent's weren't mad, but they were disappointed. When they see my grades, they're excited but I dread it.

 I don't know what I want to do after High School, and I envy the hell out of the people who've grown up doing what they love. Last year, it got to the point where I would think of suicide half jokingly, but also half seriously considering it to escape the situation. I’m not thinking of doing anything that drastic anymore, but I also realize my grades, and what not probably isn’t good enough to get into an Ivy league like my parents want and I have no aspirations or dreams. I enjoy watching anime, Netflix, YouTube, and playing games, but it's almost like I'm doing all that because I have nothing better to do. I don't think I can make anything out of those interests either. It’s a common situation, but I really need help. What the hell am I supposed to do after High School. Spend the next 4 years of my life at a sub-par college, and get a job in something I have no idea I’ll like? I would love to pick up something new, but I don’t have the money to spend, and I can’t drive anywhere. More than anything, I would love for someone to just tell me, here you go, do this and you’ll be successful and happy, but I’m well aware that isn’t how it works. I don’t mind working hard, but I don’t want to waste my life doing something that’ll make me miserable. Frankly I’ve always considered College the backup plan, and I’m still trying to figure out the real plan, but I’m running out of time and fast. Please help.

3,"I have made a new reddit account in order to ask for this advice as it is truly embarrassing.

I'm a late teen and have never lost my virginity. I've had a number of small relationships with girls over the past 4 years and attracting girls is not an issue. I am currently in a exclusive relationship with someone I care about deeply, but there is one great problem with this and a large part of my life in general:

When I was around the age of 15 I came up with an extensive, childish lie that I had lost my virginity. Since then it has grown out of control and I have lied about having sexual relationships with x number of girls, while actually having such with much less.

The exact reasons I begun this lie and the logic behind it I cannot justify, nor rationalise. I have no idea, in retrospect, why I would even feel the need to fabricate such information.

I feel it is a great weight on my shoulders and thus I want to come clear, especially with my significant other. But, I'm worried that people will lose a great deal in trust in me - I mean, why shouldn't they? If I've lied about this every time I've been questioned about it why should they trust me with anything else?

I'm really not sure what to do. Part of me wants to tell people I lied and another part wants to hide away and hope that I meet individuals with whom I can start afresh and be truthful with.

Would truly appreciate any advice.

Thank you.",26Feb2018,3

9,"I am one out of the four people in our house. Three of us get along, but the remaining one has been taking our things and lying about it since August. They don't take anything serious, but things like utensils, the occasional food, and refuses to clean up after themselves. It didn't seem like too much of a deal at first but they never seem to put anything back. Now we have 2 out of the 16 utensils that we had in August, and we're sick of constantly cleaning up after them. It doesn't help trying to confront them because they straight up deny everything, even when all fingers point to them. We even tried being more passive (since direct confrontation made them extremely defensive) by placing polite notes on appliances saying something along the lines of 'please clean if dirty, thanks!' Now they're extremely annoyed that we're being passive aggressive and basically told us to grow up. We live on our college campus so kicking them out isn't an option, since that isn't really up to us. 

Any ideas on how to confront someone like this? ",26Feb2018,3

Hey guys, hoping for some good advice on what to do. Sorry about the long post, its a doozy. I appreciate any opinions you can share

I'm 25 years old and just graduated with a bachelor's less than a year ago. I'm working an extremely tough job at the moment. Its VERY physically demanding (I wake up sore everyday, and by the end of my work week I can barely stand and lift the things I need to. My two off days are barely enough to recuperate.) I wake up at 4am every morning for work, and have a required ten hour work day. However, mandatory breaks are not built into this 10 hour day, so if i need to eat or take a break, that time is just added on. I get paid a daily rate, with no overtime over 40 hours, because the company claims its built into our paychecks. This is a job as a beer merchandiser, and I have 6 stores i am required to visit daily. However the expectations of my managers do not mesh with the expectations of the store managers quality wise. So nearly everyday of the week I'm working 11 to 12 hour days with no overtime, no breaks, and a lengthy commute. I feel like a 50 year old because my body is constantly sore and in pain, even though before this job ive always been physically fit.

The grocery store managers I work with are the epitome of stereotypical retail managers. They are rude, uncaring, and fly off the handle at the slightest problem. I'm basically a grunt to them, and they dont have any respect for me as a person. Every single one of them complains daily about my company. They demean me in tones that make want to walk out of a store. The other night one noticed that I missed filling a product fully (3 in the case instead of 4) and the store manager called all three of my managers to say i never came in (there's a sign in sheet I sign every day)and for the rest of the night I got calls and texts from my managers disciplining me. And when I convey my concerns to my managers ( I have 3 different ones ) they all say, yeah we'll look into it, but nothing ever gets done. Ive been working this job almost a year and the same problems I noticed and reported my first week are still going on. Basically, there are no good selling points to this job, besides a paycheck. Its a toxic environment.

So obviously I need to find a new job. I'm starting grad school in August, so ive already informed the conpany I'll be leaving by then. Ive tried to apply to a few jobs but no luck so far. My biggest inner battle (which is where you guys come in) is the state I'm in right now. Ive struggled with major depressive disorder in the past (no therapy anymore but still on meds). I was at a place when i started this job where i was happily improving myself and felt good about where I was at.

Because of this job I no longer do.

I barely sleep because of the stress, I've been drinking more than I probably should, because having a beer or two each night is quick and effective at releasing the stress i carry in my body. I have no time to practice my hobbies or honing my more ""Zen habits"" to help with depression (meditation, tai chi) and exercise is impossible because of how physically drained I am. I leave for work at 415, get home past five, and by the time I shower, make and eat dinner, and take care of random chores, I get about an hour of free time before I have to try to sleep (which is around 8, but i can never fall asleep until 9 or 10). Because i have so little time, and no motivation to do anything that can actually help me, I'm definitely not pursuing my job search as seriously as I should. I feel pretty hopeless right now. I dont believe ill be able to find a job more compatible with school if this pattern continues.

My heart is saying quit the job and take some time to work on yourself again and find a new one. I'm currently been living at home since I left college, and pay a small rent to my parents(300 per month). But ive saved up over 12 grand from working the past year, plus savings from jobs before that, so finances arent a problem for a few months here. But it was drilled into me by my parents to never, ever quit a job without another one lined up. I dont want to be irresponsible, but I feel like I'm literally breaking down at this job and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be helpful. Ill be prompt with any questions in the responses. Thank you.",26Feb2018,3
12,"I’m moving out of state for my current job. I’m a little invested in the process at this point, so I’m not necessarily going to back out. My motivations are, move to a place with much better job prospects for future employment, much better life opportunities for my 3 yr old daughter, myself and my wife, and by moving I’ll net enough money to pay off all my debts. As it gets closer to reality I’m feeling pretty nervous as most I think would expect. Any advice from people who have done the same?

Some back story if you want to know...

I’ve been doing what I do for five years, and I still enjoy it immensely. I have a boss who constantly challenges me to grow, and provides me ample opportunities to grow and mature my skills. I have been heaped praise all the way to our VP and I actually feel good. Unfortunately being that I work for a corporation they have made changes that require I either move to this new office location or take a severance. I have been given a very generous move package by my company and so I sense they see value in me. My wife and I feel we should move because of the opportunity to pay all debt by moving, and also being able to be in a healthier place with opportunity for my daughter, my wife and myself. If I stay and I take the severance, then unfortunately where I’m at currently never truly recovered from the recession of the 80’s and doubly so in the most recent recession so it would be a while before going back to work, and it likely wouldn’t be doing anything close to what I’m currently doing. The area I’m moving to is a long standing hotbed for what I do and it’s growing. My point being that I’m not concerned if making the change for the company is the right thing because I’m really making the change for my family and myself as we see value in the what we gain personally as a result of taking advantage of what my company is offering. Even if I were to part ways with them, I’m then in a hotbed job market for my particular skills.

That long windedness was just to provide context to my question. For those who have moved away from family and friends to pursue opportunities in another geo, what advice, if any, would you provide?",26Feb2018,3

14,"Hello,

In August of last year, I started a first year teaching position at a good school out in the country. Not knowing the area, I decided to move to a larger city about 38 miles out. It didn't sound too bad, in theory.

However, what I quickly found out is that my commute ends up being just under an hour each way--winding country (one lane) roads with literally no alternate routes. I want you to know that I don't -&gt;hate&lt;- the commute. I'm not in anguish over it. The time is just substantial, that's all. I get up earlier, and I wake up later. It takes away from my life somewhat. It also makes it difficult to work in my classroom outside of school hours/days. I basically just have to stay longer after school only to get home later and have to start thinking about bed.

I like the job. I'm a band director, and the program is in a really great position for me to grow it into something fantastic. It's this rare gem where the community really values band. We're not some small country school band..I have almost 100 in my high school group alone. It's just really set up in a great way compared to how a lot of school systems value band.

The obvious answer is that I move closer. However, I'll be 28 soon. I haven't married, yet. I've had plenty of relationships, and it's definitely something I want. I have met literally no one my age out there near the school. Everyone is middle 30s or older or literally in high school. I worry moving out there for the 3-5 years I plan to be there will take me into my early 30s without any romantic prospects. In general, there's nothing substantial to do. It's certainly a far cry from the college town I live in now. I go out to bars and festivals and go see shows.

There is no halfway point. There is the hour I live away now or 15 minutes away in another small town with similar social prospects. It's this Bermuda Triangle where there is only something the exact same distance in 3 directions of the school.

I know I would be able to save money if I moved, where now I mostly break even. That's another thing that is weighing on me.

I think that's everything. What should I do/consider? Any advice you can supply would be greatly appreciated.",26Feb2018,3
15,"So just about 1 week ago I managed to gather enough courage to add this one girl I might be interested in on Facebook and to my surprise I woke up the next day to see that she had messaged me. We have been talking everyday since then, she even wanted to talk through the phone once, but today I've gotten 1-2 messages and snaps in total.

I keep trying to tell myself that she hasn't become bored or tired with me already, but I'm honestly not sure anymore. I barely talk to anyone daily anymore, except for customers, and her messages has been something to look forward to. It has almost been all I can think about and I'm tearing myself up over that she's seen the messages but isn't answering. 

I don't want to keep messaging her, because I don't want to be clingy or become a bother. So I'm not sure what to do here, if I should just wait and try again tomorrow or some other day or maybe just face the fact that I'm a boring person that she doesn't want to talk to.

19,"[I stress ramble a lot through this. There are questions in the last paragraph if you'd like to skip to them.] 

Reddit has been an enjoyment for me for recreation and guidance, figured it would be a good place to ask for help. I've always felt nervous about posting but figured now would be a time to push through it.

Some context. I'm 19 years old and have been working as a graphic designer for exactly 1 year when the company I worked at foreclosed. I was working there part time at first while going to community college, but after a while of feeling burned out at school and having grades that reflect it I decided to drop out and work full time. 1 year isn't really that long in retrospect but it's left an impact on my life now that it's over none the less. Right now I'm doing my best to think of what I want to do now, but I'm making no effort to try. Mainly, because I feel like I can't.

One of my issues is that soon after the business closed, I was diagnosed with A.D.D. and was put on Automoxetine. This is what I was thinking was holding me back in college and that it would be the answer to almost all my problems. So far it's turned out to be a mental disaster riddled with side-effects. My personality has become a foggy rendition of itself while my brain has made no progress towards being productive. It couldn't have come at a worse time. Every time I try and make plans of what to do I can't wrap my head around the process. Tonight, that's caught up with me as the ever growing blankness that is my future draws closer and closer. 

I have so many things that I want to do with my life, as I've heard is common for my age. I wanted to be a graphic designer at first, but now I really don't feel satisfied with it, possibly because of a bad work experience, but it just doesn't feel fulfilling. My main goal in life is to have my name on projects that people love. I don't need my name in lights or fame, but I just want to be a part of the creation of something people love. Whether it be video games, books, cars, clothing, or even furniture. I've dreamed of making each of those things listed and more but feel so completely stuck on how to become a part of them. I'm guessing that the designing process would be the best for me as I like daydreaming (or can't help doing it) about how things look. I have a notebook next to my bed where I write deep into the night about games or books that I thought about or sketch out an extremely rough visual of apparel or a character. By the time I wake up, I've completely lost in these ideas purely for the fact I don't know what to do with them. I'll try and draw the sketches in more detail but I feel like I can't do anything more with them than the sketch, or I'll attempt to expand on the game/book idea but I'm hit with the feeling of, ""What's the point. What will I ever do with it.""

I feel there are a lot of factors to this. One of them being where I live. I live in a very small town in Virginia, USA. The only thing we are known for is our Nascar track and how nice we USED to be. All we have is factories and low paying corporation traps. What I would really love to have is a mentor but there are none here. I've wanted to move for a long time but have no idea where to go. I don't know if it would even help. I just know that I want something more with every aspect of my life.

I'm sorry for rambling. I did this as a way to calm myself down and it's worked really well for that. I feel a lot better putting what I felt for such a long time into words. To turn this into actual questions that can be answered and cause discussion; What is the best thing for me to do to bring ideas to life?; If you have conquered a project that was daunting to you how did you do it?; Would college/schooling be the best thing for me or is it better for me to better myself first?; If you are successfully designing things, what steps did you take to get where you are and what advice do you have?

Thanks all.",26Feb2018,31

After this, Jamie took her statement back clearly because she was guilted into it by her mom. I am sickened by Carol’s behavior as she is a very close relative of mine.

One thing I do need to mention is Carol &amp; John are not the most mentally stable. They love guns and parading them around and acting like they’re tough. They are angry, paranoid people. Problem number one with one of us going to CPS or Jamie’s school is that I fear aggressive and dangerous retaliation from Carol and John on my family that is back home. On the other hand, if I were in Jamie’s position, I would want someone fighting for me. I feel that because I am so far, I could perhaps help in some way that wouldn’t be a risk to my family’s well- being. 

I am torn. Jamie needs a voice because she clearly doesn’t have one at home. Anyone else who has been in a similar situation, please tell me what the safest and best plan of action is. We are in the US.",26Feb2018,12
23,"Hey everyone. 

I'll try to keep this short. Family drama. Hope it's OK to post here. Could really use some advice. 

**FIL and MIL**: 60s, FIL is a Christian zealot with fanatical tendencies; MIL is still devout but subdued. 90% of the time the religious beliefs and opinions are kept to themselves around close family. Live in the same town we do. 

**BIL**: Late 30s, married, with a kid. Moved to east coast in 2016. Works remotely for a company based in our town. Makes semiannual, weeklong visits back home for on-site work and meetings. Aggressive, confrontational, know-it-all, insufferable personality type he is somehow completely oblivious to.

**Husband and I**: Late 20s, I am pregnant with our first child due in July. Homeowners. 

So, BIL was back for one of his work visits last week and asked if he could stay with us. I reluctantly agreed. (BTW, his workplace offers a suite at a local apartment, free of charge to employees, for work-related business and visits. He's stayed there before. I didn't want to be 'that person' and ask why he wasn't staying there this time; in hindsight, I should have.) 

Saturday BIL, husband, and I went to the inlaws for an afternoon of board games. FIL won a round, shot up excitedly, yelled and started gloating. BIL told him to quiet down and stop being an asshole while we deliberate and see if he actually won. Evening continued as usual. 

Thursday, hubby thought it would be nice to have the inlaws over for pizza so they could see BIL one last time before he left. I was taking a nap until supper (migraine - bummer pregnancy symptom). Hubby wakes me up when the inlaws get here and pizza is ready. Inlaws ask how I'm doing, FIL said ""maybe you wanted to keep sleeping? Sorry we didn't know"" I say no prob I wanted to see you guys, we sit down, get our plates ready, pray (FIL and MIL's tradition so we do it when they're around). 

Not 3 seconds after the prayer, FIL announces he has a story to tell us, and raises his voice and launches into some bullshit about David and Solomon directed at BIL, and how Solomon never repented for his sins and God punished him. And the Bible says to ""honor thy mother and thy father"", and ""by calling me an asshole, you disrespect God and you must repent!"" ""You are no longer welcome in our home. Don't talk to us, don't send us pictures, until you apologize"". I look up and MIL is sobbing. BIL and FIL exchange some heated words and BIL eventually says ""Fine. I'll leave"" and storms out. At that time I place my hands on the table, smile, and say ""Excuse me"" and leave back to our bedroom, now with an even worse migraine. 

In bed I overhear more opinionated fanaticism, and I text hubby to get them the hell out of the house. He eventually succeeds about 30 minutes later, and here we are, stuck with 3 pizzas we paid for out of pocket.

I am so fed up with this bullshit that I told my husband to talk to my BIL and say he's no longer welcome to stay here (a short visit over here is fine next time but that's it, and no overnight stays ever again). So he did. Even more so, I am absolutely disgusted and appalled by my FIL's handling of the situation. He chose to ruin a family dinner when this should have been handled privately, screamed through my migraine, and saddled us with $30 of uneaten pizza with no offer to pay. Disrespectful x3. I told my husband they aren't welcome over here until I get an apology from him. FIL apparently apologized to my husband at the table after the rant, but I didn't hear it - then again I was in the other room. 

I guess I have a tendency to be a patient person. I second-guess myself a lot. I don't want to cause family drama, but I need both BIL and FIL to realize I'm not going to put up with this inane behavior from two grown men. I just needed to get this out there and get someone else's take on it. Am I handling this appropriately? Do you have any other suggestions or considerations? 

I'm honestly so disgusted that I don't even want FIL over here anymore, but that's not fair to MIL. Even though she just took a back seat and let him carry on with the rant. I realize it's their conservative values and they chose a lifestyle in which the woman is to take a subdued role in the home and is to stay in the background when it comes to family ""decisions"" (like FIL's choice to embark on this rant). Neither my husband nor I get it, nor do we accept it, but we respect it the best we can. 

Anyway, thank you for reading and I really appreciate it!

But ive saved up over 12 grand from working the past year, plus savings from jobs before that, so finances arent a problem for a few months here. But it was drilled into me by my parents to never, ever quit a job without another one lined up. I dont want to be irresponsible, but I feel like I'm literally breaking down at this job and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be helpful. Ill be prompt with any questions in the responses.

26,"Please excuse anything being written oddly, I’m kind of in a state of panic. I’m 26, but currently am unemployed. I’ve been looking for work (I don’t have a degree but I did graduate high school) in something full time but can’t seem to get anywhere. 

I have a shitty time handling finances and my mother as of today has gone through a sudden mood swing because I went out for a day. Because I didn’t bring her something for dinner, she took the car keys away, shut off my cell phone and has been threatening me that I’ll be sleeping outside if I make a wrong move. 

She’s done this before, but now it’s on a level where I’m scared. I don’t have anywhere to go, I don’t have money to buy a place to stay, I have very bad anxiety/depression that I am taking medication for. 

I don’t know what to do right now. I’m between feeling like I can’t breathe to suddenly having thoughts of ending it (I’ve had these before, and I know how to cope against it but it happens when I’m under large amounts of stress...)

I don’t even know what this will do for me but I’m posting anyway... I can’t focus I’m just a mess and she’s making me feel like I need to get on my knees and beg her to forgive me. I know this happens once or twice a year with her but this time feels so much worse than before... 

EDIT: I’m calmer now, and am going to wait until tomorrow when she isn’t home to get things sorted. I didn’t put a lot of detail about what I go through at home because I was already pretty shaken up. 

I get it. 26 living at home is bad. Okay. 

This isn’t the first time she’s done this to me. It’s just the first time it’s happened in such a fast pace over me being gone for ONE day. I don’t go out. I took one day to be out. 

Not coming home or calling her to make sure she ate didn’t exactly come to mind. I guess she’s right. Im a little bitch for not putting her above everything. ",26Feb2018,3

But, she has a boyfriend [M16] currently. He treats her like she's a piece of shit, like an object. He bails on her at least once a week, forcing our mutual friends and I to pick her back up. I love her so much and seeing him treat her like this makes me feel awful. He also still drinks and still does drugs even though she asked him to stop. It seems no matter what he does, she hasn't seen that he is using her in every way possible.

30,"I'm a junior guy in college with anxiety, who's never had a girlfriend and has recently been trying to get into dating. I've actually managed to land several dates, but nothing ever comes of them. It seems that every time I meet someone it always fizzles out after one or two dates. Now before this point I very rarely went on any dates, largely because of the anxiety, but I've been forcing myself out there lately. I figured that by facing my fears I'd be able to overcome them and I'd have found someone, but it seems every time I do I always fail.

Now, I've been complimented enough to I know I must not be bad looking or anything. I have several friends of both genders so when I'm not stressing out I'm alright in a conversation. My friends tell me these people are probably just not right for me, but part of me think that my anxiety might be making me act different on a date and that turns people away. I know that some of these people I've dated at least weren't right for me, but I also don't want to be using that as an excuse when I could just be doing something wrong (though this is probably just the anxiety talking).

I guess, what I'd like some advice on would be how to deal with the repeated failure. I've been fighting an uphill battle with anxiety to put myself out there, and the constant failure is really starting to get to me.",26Feb2018,6

Now before you say somethin' along the lines of ""Oh you're so mean, be sympathetic"" ""Oh she probably has a hard job""...

Eh, sadly no. Every night I get my ear blown off with her saying she needs to go to bed early because of how early she wakes up. Well, one, she doesn't even need to wake up (I've came home countless times where she's still just snuggled up warmly in bed and it's 1 pm), and two, I wake up at god damn 6 while she, earliest, will wake up at like 730 not even. And not only that, she can do literally her entire job at home on the computer. Everyday I get a text ""omg i'm so tired I just want to go home, but I can't blah blah blah"" And then the next days she's just like I'm gonna come home because I'm just too stressed out etc, I'm gonna work from home. I'm like aight.

It's just I honestly don't understand. Like why make a fuss, why say anything at all? People out there work two to three jobs and some aren't even lucky enough to have one. Please be grateful.

I never say anything because she's the type to fly off the handle at anything, even when I'm trying to help her, so I'm just aloof with her now.

She's definitely nice on her down time of not being over-exaggerating and blatantly pushy, but I feel like it's slowly getting worse and worse.

The reason I say this is because every single day I'm asked at least like 5 favors, most things she could just do herself. Like one time she got upset with me because the lightbulb in her room is always buggin' out and it's been like a year she's been complaining about it and instead of just going up there and literally screwin' a new one in, she asks me and I tell her why not just go up there yourself, and then she gets mad, so I left.

But real quick talkin bout the generosity thing. She is/was the type to give gifts and stuff a lot because sure people like giving gifts, but she also just likes to spend a fuck ton. But yea this is her go-to excuse or argument when I say Nah, ""oh my god I buy you guys so much stuff can't you do this one thing.""

One, she hasn't bought me shit for like years because we've gotten in the habit of not giving each other gifts for like christmas and shit, and two, why does buying stuff for me constitute me giving away my time that is apparently not as precious as hers.

I started typing this post earlier today and she actually got pissed off halfway through because I wouldn't go to Sephora with her (When I would never go in any other case so why would I go now?). But not only that. I've been working on a shit ton of assignments the entire weekend and I got her asking me about 10 times before she does her 'being sad' thing and complaining that she buys us so much shit and we don't do anything for her.

This is longgggg, but I wanna add one more thing... 

Every time I ask her for a small favor or just to help me on something, like washing the dishes, I get some extremely lame excuse every single fucking time.
An example is yesterday, I was washing the dishes for the entire family because no one does shit and it doesn't take me all too long cause I occasionally am on dishes alone at my shit restaurant. ** I've asked her a few times and never was helped so I usually just get the shit done and dip, but this time I thought why not try, she actually doesn't have anything to do, she's just sitting alone at the table. I ask, she takes a few seconds to reply, and says she hasn't finished her meds (I looked at the table at that moment, she had 2 pills left). I was like bruh you wanna do some shit and she says I can't blah blah, and then hands me her dirty plate with a fuck ton of unfinished food on it of course. I was kinda done at that point because it's just deja vu x1,000 at this point so I just finished up and left that shit lookin' spotless my boysss.

**(I just realized I'm hella complaining in this post, but c'mon I shut my mouth throughout my weeks and months, lemme have my time)

I understand that this is just me complaining and talking straight shit to my sister, but I genuinely need help dealing with this. Like I don't really care personally almost at this point, but every time she gets petty angry like that she just makes me out to be the bad guy when I haven't done shit. 

Also one more thing to point out is that we're/we were pretty close as siblings, but like I said I feel like its been getting worse and worse and I'm almost too tired to deal with it anymore.

43,"This is so lame but I need some help...

I'm in a ladies golf league and one of my teammates constantly replays their ball, several times per hole. For example, if she makes a poor shot off the tee she retakes the shot, if she doesn't like her putt she drops a ball and plays again. We end up playing longer than we should (2 hours on a  90 minute 9), it affects the teams behind us, and I'm not enjoying myself as there isn't a real flow to our game. It was mentioned last season but she just brushed it off and kept on doing it, while the rest of us were too nice.

This should be easy; we adults, we should talk it over and be done with it, but of course it's not.  We don't see each other in the off season as we're just golf friends and this individual is ""sensitive"" to any type of criticism.  Ideally I don't want to change teams as I like this league and our time slot, as well as my teammates.

So, literally just now (it is just past 2AM), I called it a night. I turned off my Xbox and went to bed. As I tried to sleep, and when I was almost out, I was suddenly alerted by this weird vibration in my ear, and a loud buzz (it sounded like a mobile phone vibrating when it's being called, but it was actually in my ear). It was extremely intense, lasted for about a second. It stopped abrupbtly when I lifted my head up from the pillow and I just assumed it was a hallucination because I was half-asleep and you know, the mind can play tricks on you.

But around twenty seconds of trying to sleep again, it happened for the second time and it actually freaked me out and I had to shoot up from my bed. It never happened again and I'm too scared to lie down again. It's the ear that's not on my pillow.

I was so hurt, but at the same time it was true. Couple months before that my longtime best friend and girlfriend broke up with me. She was the only girl throughout high school that I ever pursued, and it was crazy. I loved her and when it was time for her to leave for college we knew distance would be a challenge but I thought for sure we could defeat it. It'd be rough the first year, maybe I'll actually follow my dream and go into ministry and or computer science and move closer to her. We fell apart, the replies became shorter, the Facetimes stale and when I came back from a 4 day retreat she called it off early morning.

This year I got pretty close with a different friend group and I started developing feelings for one of them. She's funny, laughs at a lot of my jokes, loves memes, plays the guitar, and this awesome passion for her future &amp; Christ. 

I'm taking the semester off from college, heading to a mission program in April and won't return until August. It's my escape from life here and just trying to get things right. I couldn't muster up to tell her in person so I messaged her after I left my plans and I thanked her for being my friend etc etc. It was super cheesy and she actually replied (I couldn't function after that lol). 

Her best friend and I were close and she always sent picture of her and I'd send the basic ""oh say hello for me"". That was pretty much most of our communicate until she added/followed me facebook, snapchat and instagram. We Snap throughout the day but I don't know what to say after ""how's it going"", ""good, how about you"". To be honest I usually wait about 15-30 mins to reply because I don't want her to catch on. I'm trying to shove the feelings away but she sends some great selfies and my heart just blows up. 

I'm so split because I want to get to know her, but I want to push her away. I don't know if she's interested (I don't care either she's a great friend) and I'm struggling with communicating and with myself on how to get out of this loop.

55,"I feel kind of stupid turning to reddit for relationship advice but I’m really lost here. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. The first year of our relationship was long distance. I can honestly say that I’ve been in love with him since the very beginning. I think for both of us our relationship has felt like true love. We purchased a home together three years ago and have created a life here. We had a serious talk before moving in together about what that meant to both of us. It was a very honest and mature conversation and we agreed that we both understood how big of a step this was going to be and that we were very serious about each other. We in our late twenties/early thirties for context. Neither of us are in a rush to get married and really it doesn’t add any stress to our relationship. 

The way my boyfriend shows emotion and expresses his feelings is not typical. He’s not overly loving and doesn’t talk about his feelings very often. I’ve learned how he shows affection and I know exactly how to read him. I’m also not overly affectionate either. He’s always been very honest and doesn’t hold back his opinions. It’s something that I’ve always loved about him because I value honesty above anything else. 

To the point, we’ve been distant from each other in an intimate way. We used to hug, kiss, cuddle, etc. but we haven’t kissed since November.. before that it had been four months. We used to have amazing sex that was passionate and definitely an expression of our love. We’ve had sex maybe four times within the last eight months. We still talk and have fun together but the love feels like it’s gone. We both still talk about our future plans and they’re positive. Last week I found out that he’s been on a dating app.. and he knows that I know because he asked me to bring him his phone and a notification popped up. I couldn’t not see it. I didnt say anything because I couldn’t even process what I saw at the time. My heart just crumbled and I handed him his phone and walked away. This week he’s been showing more affection towards me but I’m still shocked and confused. I know I need to be talking about this with him instead of writing this on reddit. Maybe it’s just a way to sort my thoughts and feelings.. I’m not sure. 

I’m curious if anyone has experienced a similar situation? Did you do the same thing in a relationship with someone? I’m pretty sure he still loves me and I think he feels bad for what he’s done. I just don’t even know what to say to him.. I don’t know if I can bare to hear what he has to say. Did he go on the dating app because he’s lonely? Why wouldn’t he just come to me?

62,"My brother (Max) has a fox terrier jack Russell (Paws) who is a cute little fella. My brother has severe PTSD and Paws is pretty much his life. He takes him for long walks every day, they go camping and fishing and hunting together every weekend, they go to the beach regularly, he gets fed only the best, gets his vet checks etc. My brother is very doting on him. Which is why this is all such a shock. 

Recently I moved in with Max temporarily after becoming unemployed due to the organisation losing funding constructs. One night Paws was being disobedient and Max lost it and whacked him - hard - once in the face and twice on the back. Paws yelped when he was hit and then ran to the corner of the room and crouched there. Max left the room and then came back five minutes later and went and picked Paws up and gave him a cuddle. Paws seemed fine and licked his face and snuggled into him. 

The whole time Max left the room after whacking Paws I will admit I was in complete shock and just froze instead of comforting poor Paws whilst Max was gone. I regret having this kind of reaction. It was like I just couldn’t move and froze up. 

When Max returned I regained my composure and asked him what the f**k just happened. He said he just “loses it” when Paws disobeys him sometimes and he feels terrible afterwards. I told him he needs to seek help if he gets angry enough to hurt an animal and he said he’s worried he will get reported and end up having a record and losing his job if he seeks help. 

He said he’s been researching anger management online and that he’s considered giving Paws up but that they have a really close bond and he’s worried about the effect it will have on Paws. Paws needs a lot of attention/affection and gets upset if he’s left alone during the day and he also needs a lot of exercise, both of which my brother provides. He also is not good with children and has bitten them before (he did this before he came in to Max’s care) and Max is worried this would result in him being put down. 

I asked him how often it happens and he said on average about once a month when he is disobedient. 

I don’t know what to do. On the one hand Paws doesn’t deserve to get hit, but on the other hand I don’t want him to get put down or placed with another owner who may not give him the time/care he needs... what would you do? I feel so horrible for Paws. ",26Feb2018,47

Second:

     I am very excited to be given the opportunity to study in Hong 
     Kong at your University! The tuition waiver provided is a very 
     enticing offer and I must admit that I was nearly compelled to 
     accepting the offer on the spot. Nevertheless, there are some 
     concerns that I believe should be addressed just to solidify my 
     desire to study at  University. Firstly, the tuition waiver 
     applied to my account does not include living expenses nor 
     living situations to my understanding, however, after 
     researching it, it has come to my attention that the tuition for 
     an international student such as myself is roughly HK$120,000 
     per year. The tuition waiver applied to my account is 
     HK$152,000, therefore, I am not sure if this tuition waiver also 
     covers the cost of dorm and living expenses. If it does not, is it 
     possible for me to request additional assistance in this form to 
     cover these expenses? Lastly, if there is no other assistance 
     available to me, where can I apply for a dorm/hostel to ensure 
     that I do not have to rent an apartment? The additional 
     assistance would definitely alleviate the financial stress 
     associated with studying abroad, and I look forward to your 
     response!

68,"(A little lengthy, bear with me!)

So I'm currently in my first year of university, nearly rounding final exams just before the summer break. The year started off great, went to an amazing school with a lot of familiar faces from highschool. 

I then met a guy at a neighbouring school and we ended up being together for three months. It ended on his terms - he was too busy for a relationship and did not want to have to end it down the road and risk more hurt (he's in the military). 

It was a very upsetting experience for me, as is any ""first love"" sort of scenario, and I let it get the best of me. I failed most of my first term exams and academically I haven't recovered since. 

Currently, my depression and anxiety are at an all time high. I'm dwelling a lot on the past and how I've treated close friends and I feel in my heart that in order for me to be a better person I need to move into a new environment with new people, as honestly and openly as possible. I basically told very serious lies to several close friends about being very ill (cancer), including faking surgery, tests, etc for what I assume was for sympathy and attention. I'm currently waiting to get in contact with a therapist to figure out the whys and hows. This is so out of character for me and I am very remorseful. The disgust and contempt I feel towards myself drives me to the point of suicidal thoughts. 

Because of this, I essentially want to drop out of uni, cut off all of my past friends and remain only in contact with my family, take a year off for work, and then reapply into a college for a quick education so that I can get a job and move the fuck out of my home country. I know this is selfish as I am running away from telling the truth, but I almost feel the pain of me leaving is less than that of knowing I lied.

Am I a bad person for doing this?",26Feb2018,2
69,"Long story short, I am in my late 20's and have a crush on a shy, nerdy guy of the same age.

I've been taking everyone advice and have been very active in making all the ""moves"" so far. The problem, is that he's not doing any of the things a ""typical"" guys does, and I'm getting disheartened by what appear to me as mixed signals. Are these just introverted guy actions? Can you help me understand them?

--always really engaged in conversation in person (questions, talked for hours) but otherwise very passive (won't initiate things, doesn't add or interact with me on social media)
--takes a long time to respond to messages (when he does, they are long and include questions, etc)
--has not flirted explicitly  (I sent a message and he completely ignored the flirty part, only addressed the rest)
--not interested in getting together right away (literally said he's going away so suggested we hang out weeks from the last time)
--gave me a hug last few times he saw me (could just me friendly, but he's a generally nervous guy, so i was surprised) 

Can anyone make sense of this? To me, these things look like mixed signals and tell me he isn't interested. To be honest, I've been burned by guys giving me mixed signal before (though, those men were very confident and outgoing). But, I'm willing to give it one last push if these things can somehow be explained as shyness. Enlighten me!",26Feb2018,3

71,hi guys I'm 16 year old male dud Ive been feeling unsafe at school. at first I said to my self 'ha ain't scared of no body I ain't no pussy' but then as time passes by lots of school shooting have been passing by. the school has been sending me cards saying I need to be on time and be there everyday I think I missed out almost 30 days of school I think total of this semester or total of this year. each day I miss out I actually take for granted now because anything can happen during school and out of all places schools are being targeted. whenever I ditch I no longer feel like going back into the school I feel much safer outside the school rather than being inside the school. I wake up at 4:45am but now these school shootings are happening idk if I want to wake up at that time anymore I also go to school at 7:00am and I am there usually by that time and thinking of someone shooting me is does not sound pleasant  at all. me and my brother were discussing how the shoot out happened in Las Vegas bay area how just one guy was able to kill 50 people by having a illigal weapon. it really does scare me a bit because now no where is safe the only time I feel safe is being at home. being at school feels a little intense. someone knocks on the door everyone kinda freaks out or someone walks in an open door I feel like that person is going to jump in the class room and shoot. every time someone walks in the room i kinda put my arm on top of my head and put it down against the table. not for everyone obviously but for some people it really does scare me because it's a big thing right now. I don't want to die even though school sucks ass and I hate being there and even if I hate being there it would suck to die there because now I don't even feel safe being there.

The only positive is that its made life incredibly easy and afforded me the opportunity to do a lot of things and travel a bit. The cons are I resent myself for being a child in a lot of ways. 

 On the one hand it has severely dampened my drive to compete with others. Its robbed me of the experience of ""surviving"" your early twenties. Its also given me a bit of a peter pan complex that I'm noticing more and more the older I get. Right now I am halfway through an engineering degree and im getting a lot of support from my parents.

87,"My wife and I are sick of renting, and we're looking to buy a house. We have two realtors in mind.

The first is very experienced and has an excellent reputation. She has already shown us one house, but this was months ago. When she showed us the house, she was very polite and professional, but didn't seem too invested in us or offer up any information beyond simply answering the questions that we had. I think, because our budget is somewhat small, we would be small potatoes compared to some of her other clients. We really liked her, but don't feel a strong connection.


The second realtor has only had his real estate license for about 3 years, but he's a personal friend. He's an extremely hard worker, very smart, and brutally honest. He's a funny, flamboyant, gay guy who, I feel, would talk us out of buying a shitty house, and go the extra mile to make sure we are doing things right. However, since he's relatively new to the business, he may not know the ins and outs as well as the other lady.

 Please read this first or this post won’t make sense. 

I’m shaking I’m so angry. 

Starting from the beginning, this roommate has never had a key to my place. She wasn’t allowed to stay there so we can’t it very quiet that she was living there. No one knew. 

Again, she didn’t pay for rent. She didn’t help me clean, but she would shit talk to people about how bad my cleaning/cooking is when she wouldn’t even HELP. Ever. 

She complained about how much of a brat I was. She complained that I only got her a seventy dollar bracelet for her birthday. She didn’t get me anything for my birthday. She told my friend to get me a thirty dollar gift card from Sophora (which she did) and said she’d pay her back but never did that. Not only did she not get me anything, she didn’t go to the surprise party at midnight and she had the cake. She said she was tired after work, but we all had just gotten off of work. All my other friends did, but they went. She didn’t even apologize. I stay up until 4am (once an allnighter) to help her with her homework, but she couldn’t stay up for one night in the whole year. 

I did everything for her. I bought her stuff, I helped with her homework. I cooked and cleaned. She didn’t even pay me the rent she insisted on. On top of that all, she was freeloading off me and shit talking me at the same time. I had it. 

Despite reddit telling me I should kick her out, I told her that if she paid me rent money for that month that she could continue living here. Even if I was mad at her for what she said about me. In return, no response. She had gone home for the weekend. When she came back yesterday at midnight, she tried the locks. She didn’t knock. She didn’t text me. She was just hoping I wasn’t home (or had left the door unlocked) so she could crash there. After, she even tried to open up the window. Didn’t work. I had locked it, thinking she might try that. 

She stayed with a friend and today I got a text telling me she was going to call the police on me for the drugs I have in my apartment and stealing. The hilarious part is, the drugs are hers. The things that were stolen were things she STOLE. She messaged my mom and told them I was doing drugs, not going to class, and that I was spending all my time with boys, whatever. 

She told them a bunch of bullshit. The best part is that she was describing herself. I swear on my life, I have no drugs of my own. They’re all hers. 

She told me that if I didn’t let her stay at my place again, she would call the police about these things and get me put in jail. She said, “I’ve been to jail and girls like you don’t last there. Trust me on that.” 

She also said she’d tell the police I stole her property and was keeping it from her. 

The funny part is, if she had asked nicely, I would have given her her stuff back. I’m a nice person, too nice. If she had paid $200 of the $1000 rent, I would have let her stay. No bullshit. 

But now. Now, I’m pissed. I’ve never been more mad in my life. After everything I’ve done for her, this is how she treats me. I have so much shit on her. I know all her information for her classes, I did all her homework. I made her a hundred in every class, and I could take that all away with one click. I have all her stuff. I gave her a place to live and in return she threatens to call the cops on me. I’m done. 

I’m planning on taking all of her stuff and throwing it in the ocean. Selling it. I don’t give a fuck. 

I’m so upset. I can’t believe she would fuck me over like this. If she had said she was sorry for what she said about me, I would have let her stay. Instead, she threats jail time on me. 

I know I shouldn’t do it. If this makes me a terrible person, I don’t care. But I’m taking all her stuff and throwing it in the trash. I’m done. I’m so beyond done. She can call the cops on me and I’ll deny that she ever lived here. I know this is evil, but I’ve had it with being used and fucked over. She could have had this the nice way, but she decided to play dirty. I don’t care what anyone says. I won’t let her stay under my roof for another day. She isn’t on the lease, she isn’t even allowed to stay there. She has no proof she stayed there. If she takes me to court, so be it. But I’ve loaded all her stuff into my friends car and he promised he’d get rid of it. 

I’ve never done something this evil before. But I’m so angry I can’t see straight. I can’t believe I spent all this time on this person just for her to ruin my relationship with my parents and try to get me chucked in jail. 

At this point, if she wants to take this to court, I’ll do it. Fuck it. 

She said a cop is coming to search my house for drugs. I threw all her drugs away so we’ll see what happens. I live in Texas, is it even possible for the cops to just show up and search your house? I’m pretty sure there are laws against this thing. Whatever. I don’t care. 

If she wants to play dirty, we can play dirty. She tries to slash my tires and I’ll log into her school account and drop her out of all her classes. I swear to god. I know I’m sinking down to her level, but I won’t let her get away with trying to ruin my life. I won’t. 


Edit: The cops didn’t come tonight. They still might, and if they do I’ve cleaned the entire house and gotten rid of all of her drugs. Honestly, I think she’s all bark and no bite. She always says she’ll do something, but never goes through with it. Either way, I’m prepared. I doubt she would be stupid enough to go to the police though because I have so much shit on her. I know way to much for her to possibly think that would be a good idea.",26Feb2018,35

I'm afraid of driving, so I take the bus instead. I have major problems being social. People probably think I'm semi deaf and have memory loss to be honest.

What do I need to do to apply for a job? How do I know if they don't want me? How do I know if they do? What do I do if I get multiple job offers? Do they care about the grades you got? Do they care if you flunked any courses or didn't get any kind of certificate? Resumes? What do I wear? Do I need to shave? Do I need a hair cut? Is there always a job interview? What do they ask? What do they expect for answers? Does the colour of my skin affect their decision of hiring me person over someone who has a different skin tone? Do they care about how much you weigh? Do they call you? Do they email you? Is there such things as online jobs? How does the payment work? Do I need a bank account? Well a bank give me an account even though I don't have a job or money? Is there anything taken away from paychecks? Does every job have benefits? Do some jobs give benefits for being there for X days/months/years? What happens if I get fired?

91,"Hi everyone.
This is my first post but I really need some biast/objective advice to help get my head straightened out. My girlfriend and I are both 26 and recently moved in together, after dating for 3+ years. We've been having a few arguments but nothing super heated.

About a week ago her grandfather passed away, we've been spending a lot of time with her family mourning their loss. The burial was Saturday, and we celebrated his life in the evening. 

Today (Sunday) I had my grandmothers 90th birthday brunch with about 50+ family members. My girlfriend asked if she could stay home because she didn't feel like socializing. (I thought that was fair).

During the event, I was invited to my aunts house for cake and coffee around 6 to celebrate her anniversary. She was recently diagnosed with cancer, and was giving about 2 years to live. I attended because I want to spend as much time as possible with my aunt Becuase she could take a turn for the worse at any time.

What I am wondering is, did I make the wrong decision, should I have stayed home with my girlfriend to show my support? We are in a fight about it. She feels like I chose my family over her, in a time of need. She told me to go to the brunch but not my aunts anniversary. 

She is the love of my life and I want nothing more then to marry her, but I am also very close with my family. I feel like whoever I ask will take my side so I'm turning to reddit for more opinions and advice.

93,"As cliche as it sounds, I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. 

In the past few months Ive rarely felt here, I don't feel present. Life itself sort of feels fake, like I'm observing a movie or something rather than living. 

This is incredibly hard to explain...

Often I have to actively put myself in the moment by touching something around me or taking notice of every little detail, but sometimes even then it doesn't work. It's sort of like just floating my way from moment to moment with no real connection to anything, so much so that I sometimes completely forget what I'm doing. It's as if life itself is impossible, I can't comprehend that things that have happened actually happened, and that in this very moment I exist. I really can't put this feeling into well throughout words, but it's kind of unsettling. 

I don't think it's anything severe, I'm of no danger to myself in the slightest, nor to anyone else. I haven't had it alter my mood to be anything but just sort of spacey, or really subdued, and I still am getting school work done and doing a decent job while at work.

Nights:11:15-7:00

So I've been working here since September and the job is easy. Too easy. Every 40 seconds I put a rubber band on a part..thats it. I do that over and over and over and over again for 8 hours a day. I make 300 pound a week roughly and if you offered me this 6 months ago I would of bit your hand off but now I feel like I'm just wasting my life. I'm 20 and feel like I'm giving my life to Nissan. I'm slumped into this kinda weird depression where mon-fri I'm a robot unable to enjoy myself knowing I have work the next day. Struggle to spend time with  my friends etc and Saturdays I love but Sundays I just dredd the day because I've got work the next day.   I don't have time for anything....i wanna go to the gym, wanna pick up a hobby, play video games and watch movies. Spend time with my friends and family.  Is this it? 40 hours a week of my life at 20 for an agency which doesn't have a career ladder or anything? What should I do? I still live with my parents so I'm not exactly paying bills other than board.

98,So new neighbors moved in. I think we share an air vent. Recently I had to ask him to turn down his music because the base was shaking things off the shelf/wall. He was incredibly nice about it and gave me his number for if he is ever too loud again. Super nice guy. But maybe about once or twice a week he smokes weed. I honestly don't care that he's smoking I just don't like that it's so strong inside my whole apartment. I'm currently interviewing and am also nervous that my clothes will smell. I hate to be that person that has a problem with something constantly but I just don't like that my house smells strongly of weed. How do I handle this? ,26Feb2018,1

101,"(Throwaway account for obvious reasons) 

I just remembered this incident, and I need some advice on what you guys think. 


I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, and I was supposed to be sleeping in the same bed as my older brother that night. He’s 4 years older than me, so he had to have been in 6th or 7th grade. I remember him touching me, but I know I didn’t say stop. He then let me touch him, and I distinctly remember him saying that It was so I could learn about it. Then that was the end of it. He was never inappropriate with me before the incidents , or even after it. Even so, he was in 6th or 7th grade, so he must’ve known better. I’m just confused, I forgot this happened and even now that I remember it, it’s a really faint memory. I just need your thoughts and advice on what I should do. ",26Feb2018,2
102,"Edit: typo in the title, should be ""not""

I'm 19 years old, I've never felt particularly depressed in my life, nor have I suffered any sort of episode or psychiatric issue. I've never really understood why one would commit suicide and I've never considered self harm in any way. I've never been in any situation, as far as I can remember, which would indicate to myself or others that I have any kind of mental problem.

Recently however I've been thinking, even planning, to stab myself. It would be a non-lethal stab in a muscle of the arm with a rather small knife in an attempt to do as little lasting damage as possible. Why?

Honestly it's kind of just out of boredom. I plan to do it outside when it's rather dark and blame it on some drugged up stranger. I want to see what people will say, what it's like to go to hospital and have a wound treated etc...

I understand it might be a little bit cruel to my mother to put her through the shock of hearing about her son getting stabbed, but it's not like I'll be screaming in pain for hours or anything as I've mentally prepared myself for the worst.

I'm not a mental case, at least I don't think so, I've never done anything particularly crazy before. It's not like my life is particularly boring or that I feel I need to do this to get attention or anything, I'm just curious to see what the whole experience would be like and I expect to pretty much forget about it save to bring up for an anecdote here and there (I definitely don't plan to ever do this again, or anything like it).

I know, sounds mental right? I just want to hear your thoughts on this. I'm totally confident that I'm not depressed nor mentally unstable, though maybe I'm not the one to judge that...

I'm not asking for medical advice obviously because the only answer is ""don't do it"". But I'm kind of a little undecided. This might blow up into something huge with a legal investigation, it might put me in hospital for longer than I'd like, it might worry my parents a bit too much... But if I don't I'm sure I'll regret not doing it.

Any advice would be nice, as until now this has remained entirely in my head.",26Feb2018,2
103,"Hello all,

My girlfriend and I are new to the sexual side of a relationship. First and foremost, we understand the responsibilities and risks that a sexual relationship can have. As we have just started, she gave me a handjob for the first time. She was kneeling on a cushion-type thing, so when I came some ended on her chest and most ended up falling onto the crotch-area of the leggings she was wearing. They were pretty thin and some got through and onto her underwear. There was no way that it made contact directly to her vagina, so I was curious of what the chances of pregnancy could be after hitting the first layer, and then the second layer? She cleaned that up well and even used an extra pad she had in her purse to create a barrier from the underwear and her vagina as a precaution. I don't believe there's a problem and neither does she, but I was genuinely curious!",26Feb2018,2

106,"Hello, I’m 19 (20 later this year) and I have a fear of driving. I’ve read a post similar to this but (I guess?) I have one different question to ask. Every time I practice driving with my SO (which is not as often anymore), my palms get super sweaty and my heart feels like it’s going to jump out of my chest. Even if I’m doing okay, it still feels this way. If I do something wrong, I’ll pull into a lot and immediately start bawling because it’s too much for me. 

I’m also realizing that I’m sort of spacing out while driving and it’s usually when I feel really “focused”. For example if I’m just driving straight, I’ll stare at the road ahead of me, kinda unaware of anything. It’s only until my SO yells and snaps me out of it (which I’m thankful for). My brain goes haywire when trying to focus and I guess that’s what’s causing me to go blank.

I’m trying to get my license in this state since it seems easier to (no parallel parking on the test, but I’d obviously still need to learn how lol) than our home state. I want to focus but it’s really hard to when there’s so much to focus on.

What can help me reduce the anxiety? What can help me keep focus? What can I do to snap me out of it without him yelling?

107,"Anyone ever just left? I'm finishing up my senior year in college and it's been hell. The course load is overwhelming. The assignments take days. I go to school five days a week, 7am-6pm.

I'm trying to finish a lab report right now that's due tomorrow. I'm running on fucking fumes. I've probably had over 300mg of caffeine today, probably 2g over the week.

108,"I currently go to college about 14 hours away from my family (parents, brother, grandparents, aunts/uncles, etc.- NOT wife and kids, I am not married nor in a relationship). Although I am really close with my family, the distance has not bothered me too much, because I knew that at the end of 4 years, I was going to go back home.

This changed recently. I just interviewed with a company that is equally far away from my family as I am right now, and there is a possibility I will receive an offer. Even if I don't, the other companies that are also interested in me are all just as far away. To compound the problem, no matter how many companies I apply to close to home, I never get a response.

If I go home, I will likely be working the same dead-end job that I worked during the summers in college. I enjoy that job, but doing this would increase the chance that I would never be able to get a job in my degree-related field. Every day that passes since your graduation date that you don't have a relevant job, you become less attractive to companies. 

I think it is worth saying that I am not the type to take a job just for experience and then leave after a few years. I would stay as long as the company would have me and feel guilty if I didn't. Additionally, it is very important to take note of the fact that my parents are already older. My dad is 66. Without trying to be morbid, it's obvious that I have less time left to spend with him than someone with parents in their 40s, who could afford to be away for a while and could still expect to have a lot of time left with their parents when they came back home.


Has anyone had to make this decision? And if so, what did you choose how did it work out for you? 

Even If you haven't been in this situation yourself, what do you think?

109,"The newspaper I work for killed my investigation on bullying in one of our schools. Mostly, it was the publisher.

He did this for two reasons: one, because the school is a major advertiser and two, because he's been friends with the superintendent for years.

I handed in my notice because of it. But resigning in protest is not good enough. I wasn't able to investigate much, the publisher killed the investigation after one day. But the allegations from just that one day are very serious (my one day of investigating resulted in two police investigations) and everyone I talked to says the school doesn't do anything about bullying.

111,"Hi. This is the first time I’m posting and hoping people can point me in the right direction. 

I’m 32F and an adult survivor of child sexual abuse. For the most part I think I’ve worked through a little of it, but sometimes it comes back and it’s too much. I more than likely have some PTSD but too scared to seek help. 

I’ve been abused by multiple members of my family. My dad started probably when I was 7 to approximately until I was 13 years old. When I finally worked up the nerve to tell someone, I told my mother. Her only reaction was to tell me, “not to call the cops”. I can’t tell you how devastating that was for me. He also physically beat me and screamed at me constantly and I had really bad anxiety as a result. 

I have dreams about my grandfather and I can’t tell if they were just fucked up dreams or if they were real. And my brother did some things too. He was only a few years older than me but he did thing subsequently when he was 16-18 to other people when they were unconscious. 

The only person who ever wept for me about this was my grandmother. I will never forget the look on her face when I told her and it was a look of horror. When she died, my family just kept telling me what a giant piece of shit I was that I left.

I *was* married to a guy who I thought would help me heal but I think he made things worse. On the low end of the spectrum, he was dismissive of the pain they caused me “why don’t you make nice with your family so they’ll leave you an inheritance?” And on the other end of the spectrum he loaned me out to friends. It’s exactly how it sounds. I wasn’t raped and I participated, but after, I just felt empty and cheap. 

I don’t want to seek counseling through official means because of the potential of losing my job. I don’t want to get into what I do, but if I seek help, I’m afraid of my judgement called into question because of my past trauma. I want help but I don’t know what to do. ",26Feb2018,2

I love this girl, she’s sweet and has been with her boyfriend for over four years. I honestly don’t understand how they could say such a thing about their friend’s girl.. but maybe I’m old fashioned. They keep saying “oh, it’s joke, lighten up. We’d never do that!” but some of them actively flirt with her and crack little sexual jokes. They say the boyfriend doesn’t mind it.. but he’s jealous in nature and will bitch anyone out for going out of line.

114,"Need some advice here. Here's the full story:

My roommate and I are both military. I am currently deployed, but still pay him half of the rent. 

Rewind to about 2 months ago, he randomly tells me that he has moved his homeless cousin into my room *without* asking me. Obviously I'm pissed at this point because I'm paying the rent for that room and he just moved someone into my room. I get that he wants to help his family out, however I feel extremely disrespected that he moved someone into my room without asking me.

We go back and forth and come to the conclusion that I'll pay half of my rent while he lives there and that he will be out ""well before"" the time I get back home.

Fast forward to now. I return home in a month and his cousin is still living in my room. I express to my roommate that I'm beginning to get nervous that his cousin will still be there when I get home, and the last thing I want to do after being deployed is living on top of someone. He says that his cousin said he's ""still looking for a place"". Obviously there's no sense of urgency with him or his cousin.

What are my options? I'm not on the lease, and I'm also moving in about three months so I'd rather not sign a lease on a new apartment. Should I threaten to leave if it's not fixed? I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any advice/thoughts are appreciated.",26Feb2018,2

It won't be from the same state, and I won't be working there at the time of signing papers of course... do they check that?  Will that be a problem?  Will they even care considering how many people work out of home for companies all over?

119,"On mobile at work, excuse any typos

I want to avoid too many details as some of my friends check my posts/comments.

Somebody very close to me is about 6 months into doing hard drugs. Despite all of my efforts, talking, promising confidentiality, they refuse to even try to stop. Their friends and even some family members are the ones supporting her habit, as they've been unemployed for almost a year.

Something happened that really scared me, and I broke my promise to keep it a secret. I felt extremely shitty doing this but I've recently lost a couple friends to the same drugs they've been doing. I cracked and told a close family member of theirs. Where I work, I get to speak with police officers occasionally, and sadly they told me there's nothing that they can do other than direct me to rehab centers.

138,"So, to start off with, I'm living with two others in a very lovely apartment complex that's affordable.  Myself and one roommate, (called Chris in this post) who I've been living with for a year now, are both good friends and even though we both generally keep to ourselves, we make it a point to be friends/try to be friendly with each other because, well, this is our home and we wanna keep the ""vibe"" of the apartment as ""home-y"" as possible.  

Now, Jane moved in about a month ago, and when we interviewed her, she seemed perfect for the house.  Chris and I are both pretty clean people, and we were also looking for someone who would also be (personality-wise) a good fit for us.  We were specifically looking for someone who was okay with Chris and I being relatively nerdy, bringing people over VERY occasionally, and being okay with the cats in our apartment.  Last but not least: we wanted to maintain that friendly household we've been keeping up with.  

Now, I've had roommates come and go due to job promotions, moving in with SOs, etc., and I've never had a problem with any of them aside from a few kerfuffles about, say, dishes or shoes.  Nothing major at all, and for the most part, we didn't even fuss about the small stuff and just kinda moved on with our lives.  We all got along well, and Chris and I maintain that ""tradition"" of just having a really friendly, well-bonded household.  So when we interviewed Jane, we asked all the typical questions you'd ask about roommates.  Then, we made it pretty clear that we wanted friendships with our roommates, too, because that's just how we are and from what we've seen, that's how we prefer to keep our home comfortable.  At the time, Jane agreed to all of this and even expressed excitement and interest in being our friend, and seemed absolutely perfect for our living situation, so we had her move in.  

We had no issues with her moving in, no issues with any adjustment, just made sure she was comfortable and went about our business.  Only times even Chris and I would interact with Jane was in passing in shared living spaces (we are both very busy and so is Jane).  This is our norm pre-Jane-moving-in.  We never thought much of it.  Then, out of the blue, Jane sent us this message over our roommate group chat on FB (copied and pasted, but without all the emojis she used in between):  

""[sparkle sparkle upside-down-smiley rainbow sparkle sparkle]
Hey you twooo. I have some things I feel I need to speak with y'all about. Boundaries I need to set n such.  

So it's pretty clear that you two are lovely more outgoing extrovert friendly types while I'm more of an introvert- hermit type to 110%   

And so while I have and do really appreciate your checking in when you see me and asking about me. It's been very nice and welcoming of you- but I'm going to need to ask you to stop.  [upside-down-smiley]

I'd prefer not having to interact every time we see each other. I don't really want you to ask me about my day and I don't want to have to feel obligated to then have to ask you about your day. Especially when you catch me with a headphone in and/or I'm trying to clean. I'm really not wanting to be engaged. I'm not wanting to be active friends and involved in each other's lives like that. 

If you wanna chat about something nerdy or need to check in about toilet paper or something roommate related that's totes cool but I don't really want to be all up to date on each others lives.  

I like being a hermit and operating on my own and being in my own headspace.  

I am suuuper sorry if this seems mean or bitchy-- I'm not angry or upset. I just want to set these boundaries because the amount of interaction we've been having it draining for me given how introverted I am. I just need to be left alone to my own devices.  

None of this is a reflection on you. [sparkle sparkle rainbow]

It's just me trying to do what is best for me-- setting the boundaries I need to be comfortable.  

I hope you two are chill with this-- if you need more of an explanation or your unclear about something let me know. 

Buuut yeah. That.""

At first, Chris and I were a bit weirded out by this message because he and I both were just going about with our business.  So, Chris and I talked about it.  He said that he had just been friendly with her just as he was with our last roommate(s), except for when she initially moved in and they smoked together just for fun before he went out with his friends.  I, on the other hand, have been way more distant because I'm juggling a full-time job and school, and I've been maybe asking her ""hi, how are you?"" and doing small talk in passing.  I think there were a few times where I asked Jane how she's been settling and if she had any questions/needed anything.  She said no, and that she was really happy with our living situation and (I kid you not) told me she was super happy living with people she could consider friends.  

Now, after Jane's message, Chris and I made a point to let her know we acknowledged how she felt and her boundaries, and that we will tone it down with the interactions.  We don't even speak to her in passing, we don't even say ""hi"" in passing because after a brief discussion, Jane said that she didn't even want us to greet her.  So we don't.  Now, anytime Jane has anything to say to us, she sends us a facebook message or a text, and generally starts speaking in very accusatory language.  For instance, last she and Chris spoke, she accused Chris of using her buzzer to shave (even though he does not need to shave his beard or hair, and has had the same amount since she's moved in).  She aggressively asked him to stop (quote: ""You need to stop using my stuff.  It's on my side, and not yours, so don't touch it.  Even if you're saying you don't use it, I don't appreciate you not asking before using."")  even though, again, Chris obviously did not use her buzzer.  

When I talked to Chris about it, apparently, when he asked her (nicely), it turns out her buzzer somehow got onto his ""side"" in the bathroom--which could have happened due to a number of reasons.  I told him it sounded like my cats may have been messing around in the bathroom, so I said it might help if he closed the door to their bathroom from now on so my cats stopped messing with their stuff.  Jane has also had very little interaction with me aside from moving my stuff in the washing machine before the machine was done washing onto the top of the machine so she could wash her own clothes.  She also uses the washing machine and dryer on a daily basis, so anytime Chris or I need to use the washer/dryer, she does something where she moves our stuff and doesn't let us know (although she DOES put it back once she's done...but doesn't restart the washer/dryer if it was interrupted).  On top of this, she's also been extremely rude to guests.  My best friend occasionally comes over to watch movies with me or do homework together, and anytime she's interacted with Jane, she's met with a lot of hostility (snapping, short responses, grunts, etc.), and my best friend is now resorting to just pretending that Jane isn't there when she's over and has begun trying to advise that Jane should be asked to move out.  

In response to these things, I've made a point to be very ""mom-like"" about things (as Chris calls it, because I work with kids).  I've spoken to her a few times over messenger about the W/D situation and the bathroom situation.  She acknowledged and has made a point to be more mindful about the W/D and our stuff.  Chris also spoke to her about the bathroom situation, and she did apologize.  However, when we brought up the bit about the guests, she said to refer to her message about interaction, and we left it at that.  I approached her (via messenger) privately about the social interactions, wherein I told her that Chris and I (and guests) needed to maintain the friendly atmosphere that makes our home feel like home, and it requires a lot of friendliness and mindfulness when it comes to how we speak to each other (as roommates) and guests.  I asked her to please think of us, because we also live in this household, because her behavior has been getting more and more aggressive towards us, and it was starting to stress us out. 

At first, she got angry towards me and accused me of not following her boundaries.  She said that she was abused, so of course she doesn't want anything to do with people.  ""Me telling you that I'm not interested in being friends and or knowing the details of your life is about as direct and non passive as I can be about it.""  I replied to her with how, to us, it's not about being blunt or direct, or not advocating for yourself.  It's about being able to live with other people and being kind to them in shared spaces.  I told her we understood and were expressly DOING as she asked, but told her she has been making it a point to abuse our respect for her.  She back-tracked and apologized for jumping down my throat, and sent me multiple messages apologizing (with many emojis) and told me she ""has a problem with empathy"" in that she ""doesn't have it"" and that she ""doesn't really have feelings or care about anything"", but she'll try.  

So, reddit, I'm not sure what to do about this situation.  On one hand, I understand that Jane has boundaries.  But on the other, Chris and I are now feeling anxious at home. Anytime she's out in the shared spaces, we do not feel comfortable even stepping out of our room because she's made us feel extremely uncomfortable in our own home.  Anytime we so much as look at her, she glares at us.  We're not sure what to do aside from comply with her wishes or message her if we have issues (to which her responses are overly saturated with emojis).  However, this is starting to feel extremely immature and awkward.  Jane is home more often than we are (no fault of her own, and we wouldn't have an issue with this otherwise), so she tends to be in shared spaces more than we are.  When we are home, Chris and I feel like we HAVE to stay out of her way because we don't want to upset her.

  **tl;dr**: Roommate (21F) does not want to get to know us/be friendly in our home.  Myself and my other roommate have begun to feel very awkward because of her in our own home.  What do we do?  Should she move out?  Do we sit down and talk to her, and if we do, what do we say?",26Feb2018,2
139,"My partner has this friend. She is beautiful inside and out, so if I am reading this right I need to try to convey to her that nothing will happen.
She calls over for drinks, one time after a few it was just her and I in the kitchen. I'm a tall bloke and she was trying to convince me to do a shot of tequila and in doing so stepped in so close her boobs were touching my stomach, went on her tip toes and whispered in my ear if I do one she will do one. She then moved her face directly in front of mine and looked like she was going to kiss me until we heard someone coming down the stairs. 
Another time my partner and I got in a bit of a fight and she came over to help my partner, but ended up consoling me more than her. Not only that but she was very touchy feely.
The most outlandish time was one night we were in town. All night I found us in situations alone with her pulling me onto the dance floor, touching me, buying me drinks and at one point we were sitting together and she started stroking my inner thigh.
Every time we see one another there's alcohol or drugs.
She has a boyfriend she lives with.
Now I'm just curious, is it possible that she doesn't mean anything by this and it's just how she Is? Are there just people like that out there? My partner hasn't noticed anything and I haven't mentioned anything in case it's all in my head",26Feb2018,2
140,"The social media policy at my job is pretty strict. I work at a CPA firm, so it makes sense. Since I'm on the firm's website, if a client were to Google my name and saw any of my social media accounts pop up, I could see people thinking differently of me than a CPA. (namely, I really cool CPA! Amirite?!)

So here are the firms restrictions:
1. You must state that you work for XYZ firm.
2. Your profile picture must match the one on the company website.
3. Don't blog anonymously, using pseudonyms or false screen names.

There's more, but the above points were the most restrictive parts. Oh, and ""Violation of the policy is subject to disciplinary action, including termination for cause.""

Soooo...with that being said, I don't want to put my job at risk but at the same time I want to have the opportunity to be creative. I've been on YouTube on and off over the past decade or so but I want to try again.

It wouldn't be anything crazy. Maybe book reviews, vlogs, making music/lyric videos or art projects. I guess I just really want the freedom to be creative (there are so many YouTubers I love who make awesome content, I want to have in on the fun too...but not at the expense of my job.)

141,"I’m probably making this a bigger deal than it actually is but here we go. 
I’ll try to keep it brief

A little about me: I’m 20 F and a semi-out of the closet lesbian. I have a girlfriend that I would like to move out with sooner rather later so she can get away from her emotionally abusive, homophobic parents. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression and have severe avoidance issues. I am not currently going to school but I will be attending classes later this year in August. I enjoy creative activities such as sewing, embroidery, and drawing.

I’ve been working at a zoo gift shop for 2 years now and I’m frankly tired of being here. I will admit last year I wasn’t that great of an employee mostly due to apathy from depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently I’ve been trying to up my game and help keep everything running smoothly because throughout all of winter there were only 4 people (including myself) working in the shop due to low attendance. Now that I’ve shown improvement my manager has decided to promote me to a supervisor position.

At one point in time I wanted this but now it just doesn’t feel worth it. The pay is terrible, I hate having to talk to people all day due to all my social anxiety BS, and I’m starting to have stress dreams about being late and stuff (all along with the fact that I’m not really a leader type to begin with). I took the promotion for the “raise” and so I could put it on a resume. I’ve been wanting to quit for months now but I don’t know where I would go, and the only reason I’m staying is because of guilt. Spring break starts next month and I don’t want to leave them in that dire time (as well as the fact that I will be getting a lot of hours to work). All of my friends and especially my girlfriend have been urging me to quit but I just stay out of guilt. I know I need to if I want to move out any time soon because the money from this job is absolutely terrible. 

I’m mostly considering waiting until spring break is over to put in my two weeks and look for different jobs in the meantime. My deadline is August because the class times will overlap with the hours of the zoo.

I guess what I’m asking is 
	1.	Should I follow my gut and leave once spring break is over?
	2.	What sort of job should I pursue?
	3.	Should I get a second job in addition to this one just for extra cash?
	4.	Has anybody else been in this situation and can offer advice?
	5.	How should I get past the soul crushing guilt when it is time for me to leave?

My mind is a mess right now and if someone could nudge me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

I get dragged away by the screen for a very long time and my procrastination gets worse and worse,
I’m super tired of googling ways to cure it and i talked to a counselor and that didn’t help, as they repeat the same thing over and over even if you ask for something more effective. However, some days i’m on my good side and some days on my bad side. I get things done but lost of the time i simply get dragged away by everything around me. At school, I barely talk to other people as I feel distanced from them, no matter if I have a good or bad day. Also i dont have any social media, i only have facebook where i login sometimes but that sometimes wastes some of ly time. I always wish I could do more. For school though, when i get to do something, i do my best. I’m also a perfectionist. But it doesnt get me nowhere. If i put all of my effort and attention and knowledge to do something at the end i often get normal marks. All of these though hang in there in my mind and they come haunt me from time to time. If you read the whole thing you might have noticed that I cant organize my thoughts. Being aware of all this, I sometimes think about suicide but I’m too pussy to do it, and also too pussy to stop thinking about it.

I find myself having anxiety attacks provoked by unecessary worrying about this person and about the future etc.

While i understand there's no easy solution, i was wondering which of these two options is better:

1) Let myself worry - Alot of the time, the thought is making me so anxious that i will just keep thinking about it until 5-10 mins later, i'm desensitised to it. I don't know if this is a good solution but in the short-term it always seems to get me out of a slump, however it isn't the right approach because i'm trying to get over the person.

2) Don't think about them at all - This one is so much harder to do but seems like the right solution. However, i don't want to just completely brush off any thought i have of it because i fear it will all bottle up inside until one day, they all explode. I don't want this more than anything.

You see he’d rather love someone other than my mother and leave me at 2 years old. I spent my whole childhood wishing I could become something other than his plump, quiet daughter. I was only quiet because I was so unsure of my world. Nothing was consistent and everything was chaotic. So I didn’t know consistency. I lived in constant fear of the unknown. My father would see me every other weekend at his new family’s house. He was different from how he was with my mother. What was wrong with me at 2 year old? What made it so easy to leave? I spent my whole childhood figuring that out. And guess what? It was in the beds of many men who treated me like shit. It took me a decade to figure out that I liked to get treated like shit because that was all I knew. Between my father abandoning me and getting raped at 16. I never knew what it was like to be loved. Because love was just a power struggle. It wasn’t a real concept. It was something you fought for, fought against. I’ve studied psychology, have my masters, and appear quite put together. But I will always be broken and damaged. Too damaged or broken for anyone to ever love me. I’ve been on dates and felt it.

Also insinuated he would slap me if I tried him again He was so mad, I was honestly so scared. He then let’s go of me, tells me to leave and collects my stuff haphazardly and tells me to gtfo.

I would love to say it’s as simple as going around and helping people get boyfriends or deal with breakups. But, it’s not. I’ve gotten to the point where I am the go-to person to talk to about things like mental illness, identity crisis, or in general trauma. I have a protocol that I go trough when people tell me about things like suicidal thoughts, I’ve had more than my fair share of conversations about abuse, and I’ve comforted more of my friends while they cry than I can count on my fingers and toes. 

I’m honored that they trust me this much, and I’m happy that they can confide in me enough to show me the dark side of their lives, but it’s starting to be too much. I tried taking a break from it, as in I literally told my friends that I was “on vacation,” but no matter what I do it just never stops. I don’t know how to tell the people who are confiding in me that I need even more of a break than I already asked for. I realized I need to balance being there for my friends with taking care of myself, but where is the line between “taking care of myself” and “being a bad friend?” 

I’m a troubled teen just like they are.  We all have our own demons, but I haven’t found a “me” to help me yet. I just keep fixing other people and waiting for someone to come along that can fix me. I set up a life for myself in which every time I hang out with one of my friends someone ends up asking for advice, or crying. But when I need to talk, or I have my own stuff going on, I just feel wrong asking for help with it. 

Everyone tells me to just wait for college. I’ve spent months, years, even, waiting for high school to come to an end so I can escape what has become my own personal hell. I’m not perfect. I need help too, but, as much as I hate to say it, I feel like that “help” starts with time to myself. Time that I’m afraid to give myself because I feel like if something happens to these people I care about so much, all because I wanted to take a “break,” I’ll never forgive myself. 

Is this even fixable? ",26Feb2018,8
168,"So my fiancé and I are getting married right? And the part that should be the part where we both go on a honey moon or somewhere together isn’t happening because my fiancé’s friends from church planned a group trip to Mexico. And my fiancé really wanted me to come but I can’t because 
1.its a room with all guys so I have to get my own room(fiancé’s friends are paying for him because he is poor too) so me and my fiancé can not afford a room alone together

2.the rooms are SUPER expensive so I’d have to find people to go with me in order to afford it plus the expenses for my flight 

3.im trying to find a job and get 3,000$ before July which isn’t going to happen. 
So now my fiancé was like no that’s not fair I’m not leaving you behind so he backed out of the trip but he can’t because his friends already paid for him. 

I’m laying here crying my eyes out because I’m going to be a newly wed alone (especially during the honeymoon phase) and will never be able to experience traveling and being in a plane for the first time together.

 However this new apartment is only a mile and a half from his parents house and I know I will have to meet them soon and be regularly in contact with them. 

What is a basic story he and I can tell them without telling them that I'm going to jail? I'll only be in for 3 or less months. Coming up within the next couple of months.

I'm going away for school? Visit family? 

What is something basic that would explain my absence while my boyfriend stays in our apartment without me and watches my cats???

How to prevent them from suspecting he has secretly offed me?? Lol

She’s depressed, severely overweight and taking way too much medication. Mixing anti-depressants with a shit ton of Advil/Tylenol, as well, a dangerous drug called clonazepam. She constantly complains about her arthritis, and hip pain which is her excuse for taking all of the medication. I’ve tried on many different occasions trying to get her to workout but she insists that she needs to lose some weight before going to the gym. I’m at ends meet, I’ve tried everything. I’m starting to get extremely worried about the future as she just got a heart monitor for irregular heart beats too.

We used condoms every time but thrice we got worried(even after using condoms) and used emergency contraceptive pills after sex( approx 2-4 days gap between each) the first pill was consumed on the second day of her period as that’s when we first had sex. However, the last time we had sex, we did anal without any condoms but I didn’t finish inside her. While trying to put it in i might have touched her vagina with my tip(none of us remember exactly)

Her periods were due on the 22nd of Feb and she hasn’t begun yet.  She had vaginal discharge in the morning continuously for 4 days beginning from 21-22nd, last night her body heated up for a couple of minutes without any reason, she said she felt nauseous for a couple of minutes today and a couple of days ago she also felt giddy.

177,"
I started my 2nd undergraduate studies few years ago, so my university friends are about 5 years younger than myself. One of them, whom I consider to be the best among my friends is a fine young gentleman, funny personality, likes keeping abreast on many things etc... but also since the day we met I noticed one of the not-so-good traits of his character: he likes talking about others usually when they're not around, i.e he likes engaging himself in gossiping.


This has been going on for years and I didn't like it from the very start, but truth to be told I never said anything to him because I believe he wouldn't take it the right way due to not being mature enough. So I just kind of went along with it, hoping it would pass with time...


Few days ago we had a double date (my new gf&amp;me, hi and his new gf). His gf and I ""clicked"" (in a friendly way) and talked a lot. Next morning she added me on facebook.


Last night he dropped by my place to pick up some study material, we hang out a little bit, he went home, but forgot to log out from his facebook account on my laptop. I know this is rude, unforgivable and lame and in normal circumstances I would never invade anyone's privacy because I was raised in that way, but with everything going on I just couldn't resist, so I typed my name to check for messages. He and his girlfriend have been together for 4 months, and I got 85 hits on my name. The majority of them were just normal things such as he's meeting with {myName}, {myname} was there, etc... but over the course of the last couple of days (since we had a double date) and to my great surprise, he constantly kept bringing up my name in the most negative contexts:
{myname} cheated on his ex girlfiend couple of times, I just can't bare those cheating people..
{myname}'s present girlfriend instagramed me long before she met him, I am sure she wanted something from me... I thing she might even had the thing for me...
yeah whatever, it's {myname}'s life, I don't really care about that babe...
etc...


I logged out instantly and wanted to forget about this entire situation but I simply can't. He is not an evil person  he just likes talking too much. It this particular case I thing what contributed to his behavior is the fact that he is insecure about his new gf so our witty conversation came off as a threat (I don't vouch I am right, just saying it might be the case...)

178,"Hello all, 
English isn't my native, sorry for any mistakes.

I'll try to keep a long story short. I'm a Dutch BA Communications student. Did a semester abroad at Ewha Womans University, Seoul average grade A. No idea what my average grade is on my Dutch university since we don't have such a system and grades don't matter as much as participation does. I do try to get the best grades possible due to my desire to leave the country and being aware that other countries find high grades desirable.

I'm in a long term LDR with someone in the USAF, whom I will join stateside after I graduate. I've always expressed to him that I aim to do a Master's after my BA but where I would do that is open for discussion, be it The Netherlands or elsewhere. However, recently I've been thinking that maybe my BA would be sufficient since I'm not looking forward to another two years of dating long distance and the financial drawback of another study.

TL;DR: Will my BA Communication be sufficient to land me a (decent) job on the US job market?

You don't currently have a project to support or anything. I have been stuck in ""bench"" for more than 4 months doing absolutely nothing. I've contemplated about transferring companies but my fear of rejection was very strong. 

Now in my company, to be hired for a project, you sometimes need to be interviewed. During my 3rd or 4th month I was interviewed by several managers looking for resources. I always fail the technical interview because I don't have the experience they were looking for, which strengthened my fear (if I can't get a project within my company, I can't get another job in another company).

Last month I kind of made up my mind to try my luck abroad. I told my parents my plan and they we're all for it. So I went to a visa assistance agency and they told me all of the requirements.  Unfortunately we didn't have the money needed for ""show money"". My mother asked me if this is what I really wanted because if it is, she'll can borrow money just for that purpose. At the time I was kind of sure I want it. 

Fast forward to now, we do have the money, all that's left for me to do is process documents and take English proficiency examinations.

I'll be 27 when I'm done, I'll be old. What if no company will hire me because I'm old and I just graduated college.

184,"Hi there, sorry about formatting I’m on mobile.

so I need some advice about dealing with a friend (Let’s call her C) and C’s boyfriend K.  Basically for months now C has been complaining about K to me, and while I’ve only known K for almost three months, C knew him for a few years. We’re all online friends, and C and K are trying to make it so they no longer have to be in a long distance relationship.

Anyways, K is obsessed with having C’s attention, even going so far as to use his depression and anxiety as an excuse and using it to guilt her until she gives him attention every second of the day.  

Lately it’s gotten worse since C was promoted to being a manager at her job and going through training, meaning she doesn’t have that much time for herself. K messages her every two minutes wanting attention and when he doesn’t get it starts talking about depression and how he would kill himself someday because he doesn’t feel like he’s being a good boyfriend, effectively guilting her. He won’t even stop while she’s trying to sleep. Basically he’s emotionally manipulating her and it’s getting worse that now another one one my friends is starting to get worried for her.

I’ve tried everything I could to convince her what he’s doing to her is toxic and bad, but she’s the type that doesn’t like conflict and won’t do very much in being firm about her boundaries because then K will just start whining and bugging her all over again, and I don’t want to outright say that she needs to break up with him because I don’t know the full story, but it’s still worrying.

Do any of you have any advice on what I can say to her that will get her to see reason? Should I confront K myself and tell him that what he’s doing isn’t right even if it means it’ll upset C? 

To;dr: C and K are dating, K emotionally manipulates and uses guilt and talk of self harm to guilt C into getting her attention every second of the day even while she’s supposed to be working and later trying to sleep. C won’t do much about it because she doesn’t like conflict and is always giving him more chances than she should.

187,"Hello!
I'm asking for your point of view on this one.
So, I'm staying with the friends in a flat. I moved here with a friend in August. Then we got another friend and we were 3 guys in a flat in December. In January the first guy left a brought a girl into the flat to fill his place.
Keep in mind that I rented this flat with my first friend and I was the only one one the contract and I was cool with it.
Now I'm feeling odd because the first guy that left was also my best friend and now I was stuck with these two.
I like to think about myself that I'm at least well educated and I also like to thing that I have the concept of living togheter and the concept of living into a ""block of flats"".
Sadly I had enough and I decided that I will leave them all by themselves and I move to my hometown and commute to university. Keep in mind that I'm the one paying bills and keep everything all right, I feel like a maid.
I had some disagreement with them in terms of alcohol and I agree with them that my expectations were way off. I was naive in thinking that they will respect my decision or any of my basic rules.
Today I spoke with the landlord and I told her everything that I'm sorry for my lack of respect in screwing the contract up that was supposed to last until August. I was ready to accept the consequences from it.
Surprisingly she told me that she trust me very much and If I leave she understands this,but this means that these 2 must also leave. At this moment I was shocked because I was expecting to be shamed for my decision.
Instead I'm in the situation of choosing between me leaving and making these 2 looking for rent in the middle of the winter. However I don't making enemies but they are very pissed because I was a ""snitch"" telling the landlord my problems.
TLDR : 
My questions is: Do I keep hurting myself staying with them and feeling shitty about myself and making them feeling like I'm doing them a favor by choosing to stay or do I screw them over and make them leave.
Also, the landlord has so much trust in me that she says she will not charge me for the rest of the rooms until I find other flatmates because she liked me until now.

202,"So at my job we were working 12 hour shifts 6-6AM/PM. One week we would work 3 days, 36 hours and the next week we would work 4 days, 48 hours in order to have a 24/7 coverage (we were busy af) and give us 8 hours overtime on that long week. This is in Pennsylvania if it is pertinent.

Due to recent business changes they decided that they needed to cut costs and make us work only 11 hours per day, 6-5AM/PM. Overall we would lose 7 hours of regular pay time but get to keep 4 hours of overtime pay.

We use an ADP clock-in system with a badge reader. At one point we used to have to log in to the computer but they have removed access to the time card. You have to go there to see your pay stub but there are no modifications available to us. The only way to see your time card now is on the terminal, you have to type in your badge ID to see it but you can't make any changes at all either. 

Up until recently they had a 7 minute grace period. You could come in up to 7 minutes early and it would only count as being there on the hour or you could come in up to 7 minutes late and still get credit for being there on the hour. Of course they always threatened to write us up if we were constantly late but most of the supervisors were okay with it if you didn't do it too often. 

Also if you came in 8 minutes or more before or stayed until 8 minutes or more after the hour it would bump you up to 15 minutes. They did crack down slightly harder on that but I had found myself a few times accidentally staying until maybe 10 after and my work was pretty well valued and we were busy so no one ever said anything to me. I had the numbers so to speak and they went after people who were obviously milking the clock.

Now they have removed the 7 minute grace period and as you may guess, if you are 1 minute late you will get written up and miss out on 1 minute of pay if you don't stay an extra minute. There are only 3 times you can do that and then they can fire you. We were talked to individually about this.

Now here comes my concern; if you are early any amount of minutes or stay late any amount of minutes the supervisors are going into our time cards and changing the time to be right on the hour. When we were talked to individually my take on it was that I don't want to sit around waiting until 6 on the dot to clock in then possibly get roped into a conversation and miss the 1 minute window we now have, so I'm going to clock in when I get there (usually 5:57 or later). But they are taking that away and I can't see if it had even been changed. 

Am I being stupid for thinking I have a right to those 3 minutes of pay? I looked up the FLSA and it seems like our case is not really egregious but I've been annoyed about it ever since the change. Honestly don't want to draw attention to myself because one of the other things they did to cut costs were 2 rounds of layoffs in the last 6 months but I am wanting to know if some injustice is actually occurring.

She had no friends and I was her only confidant. I decided to break it off with her and remain friends until she could make some friends of her own. I then dated someone else for a month. When she found out about this she nearly snapped but she acknowledged that it was her own damn fault for treating me so horribly. This was 4 months ago.] background

It’s been pretty fun but obviously a little weird if I or Pam enter into another relationship. Well Pam just started dating a guy last week (we’ll call him Kent) and Bobby and I (mostly me) are a little puzzled as to how to proceed. 
For context Kent and Pam have been hanging out as friends for a while now. On one of our movie nights Bobby, a friend, and I actually pulled up to pick her up from one of these friend dates she was having with Kent. Bobby suggested “hey you know it’d be really funny if all of us just go in there (they were in a comic book store) and picked her up from Kent directly.” So for the meme we all went in and picked up Pam, I shook hands with Kent. Looking back on it, Kent liked this girl and saw her ex and 2 of his friends walking in on them and I guess I accidentally made a total power move on this guy. Well not accidentally but we were doing it for the meme. 

When I first heard they were dating I admit  I was a bit peeved as taking on another relationship is the easiest thing Pam could do. She only made one new friend back home and even then that’s not someone she sees often. She’s a mess in a relationship without friends, so her dating someone is the last thing she should do IMO. Then it hit me. Bobby and I are her friends. It was a weird realization but Bobby and I are legitimately her good friends now. She did make friends, just not in the way that I was expecting. So I felt a bit better about that.
So now they’re dating and we’re going to keep hanging out with Pam and I guess I’m just wondering how the hell this guy Kent is allowing it? I guess they just started dating buuut I mean on paper it sounds horrible. Like what does she tell him “hey Kent remember my ex who pulled up on us in the comic store with 2 of his friends? Yeah I’m going over to my ex’s best friends house to watch a movie with my ex and his best friend tonight sooooo seeeya.” We are her friends at this point. I still care about her. How does this end up? Do we just keep doing the same thing we’ve been doing? Is something going to happen? Is Kent going to be invited to these movie nights? There was a night a few years ago where Kent and I got along really well and there’s an alternate universe where him and I are good friends. Should I try to be friends with Kent? It’s a little weird for me I won’t lie. What do we do?

TL;DR: broke up with gf of 3 years (Pam) 4 months ago because she had no friends and used me as an emotional dumping ground. We agreed to stay friends. Without friends she’s a mess in a relationship. Me and my best friend (Bobby) now hangout once a week for a movie with her. She got a new boyfriend (Kent). Was peeved as I thought she should make friends on her own. Obviously still care about her. Then it hit me that bobby and I ARE her friends. How does this work now? Do I make friends with Kent eventually? Does Kent come to movie night ever? What’s right and what’s wrong? If I have any residual feelings for Pam should I cut this off or just not invite Kent? I still want her in my life. It’s weird.",26Feb2018,2

212,"So let me explain how I broke my arm the 1st time. This happened on the 6th October. I'm a wagon driver and while out delivering I climbed out of the wagon I stepped onto a wobbly cobble. This made me fall backwards and I put my arm out to break the fall which resulted in me breaking my wrist. So the hospital put a cast on and told me to come back in 6 weeks. Fast forward 4 weeks and I have organised a big birthday party at my house. I live alone so had to rope in friends and family to help prepare it. Cook shop and put the Gazebo general party prep. I started the party at 1pm and it got off to a swinging start. There was loud music good snacks and plenty of food to follow but best of all lots of alcohol. It was a big birthday for me(the big *0, a lady shouldn't tell ;-) so lots of lovely gifts mainly procecco to open and share. So it's in full swing and we are all quite drunk and a little weed was being passed around. This is where I make the bad decision to start loading the dishwasher. Remember I have a cast on my left arm. So as I am bent over the dishwasher with the door open and a plate in my right hand my good mate who is hammered falls into me knocking me forward into the wall. Because I have a cast on I Can't put my left had out flat to the wall so I put my forearm out to stop me face planting the wall. Obviously with the cast being hard and smooth it slides down the wall and lands in the radiator getting trapped there. My feet are trapped under their dishwasher door so my body twists around and I end up on my arse on the floor with my back to the radiator and my arm still stuck in the radiator. For what seemed like minutes everyone just looked at me with a look of horror on there faces. I am told that my arm was the wrong way round behind my head. My brother was the 1st one to move and he took my arm out of the radiator and it dropped behind me. I think I looked down and said ""where is my arm"". He picked it back up and it did a 360° flip before landing on my lap. It was only 15 mins before the ambulance arrived. The loaded me in and before they shut the door my brother told them I had copious amounts of alcohol and some weed. When I got to the hospital they really didn't know what to do with me after the xray. They said my humerus bone was broken in 3 places (turned out to be a 5'' spiral fracture). Had to wait for a trauma doctor to deal with it. 15 hours I was there in total. I have never experienced pain like it when they were potting it up.

216,"So I'm currently in university in the Netherlands, and a good foreign friend whom I live with has been saying some troubling things of late. We've always had philosophical conversations, but the subject of death, foresight and the matter of free will came up surprisingly often recently. He also suddenly gave me his dad's phone number and today asked for some paper to write a note, which I found disturbing enough to ask what all this death- and ""does life have meaning""-stuff was about. 

He then proceeded to tell me that ever since he was little, he's had dreams that predict the future. The dreams consist of small snippets of future events, some of which he remembers, some of which he forgets. These events have been mundane things, but also quite extreme at times.

Upon first hearing this, I tried to convince him these were just things his mind conjured up based on what he'd experienced during the day. But while he seemed reasonably okay with that explanation, just talking about these visions was apparently so tough that he burst into tears several times.

I should at this point also mention he's told me that he finds it very easy to lose track of what day it is, and feels some days take forever while others fly by in an instant. He also isn't doing too great in uni and his parents (who support him financially) are not supportive at all.  

I am very worried and quite confused by everything he's told me, but I really want to help. I've already offered to help him with his grades, but of course I can't really provide psychological help. Therefore, although I know this is a long shot, I hope some of you may be able to offer some advice on what we could do.

I am 17 years old and I live in Bloomington Indiana. I dont quite have the best personality, in fact... I could work on being more loud with my voice and more confident with myself. My mother is almost 50 years old and is living in an apartment practically living off of the money she gets from child support and welfare combined, and is currently suffering from some kind of hip pain from her hip bone getting worn down, I'm not going to go more into details about that, but I want to talk about something else.
*****
**Main Topic**
******        
I am about to turn 18, here in 4 months, and I want to join the Army. The other day I was watching a motivational video on YouTube and it ws a girl talking about how it takes our brains 5 seconds every once in a while to make decisions that will either not be good for us, or will be good for us. The second option is better for you, but it is more uncomfortable and can take little to no time, or it can take a long time. in which both instances will have a positive impact on your life in the future... I love my mother, but I do not want to be living on thin Ice when I turn 50 years old, stuck under a ceiling that will promote laziness and wont promote something like a business I would want to create in the future or something. I can go join the Army, or I can continue to sit in this house and wait for something to happen when I turn 18. 


But here is where I'm stuck and need advice at... Yes i want to join the Army, I want to go to college, I want to be successful in general, But I don't really care about the money, Yeah money is what you need to have a nice house and other nice things, but its not my want in life. I'm just trying to figure out what I want to do with my life to get to the point where I want to be. I think my idol right now would be [Michael Stevens]

from Vsauce, not because he is a popular scientific YouTubeer, but because I have a feeling he is doing what he wants to do in life. And at least on camera, He doesn't seem depressed or have second thoughts about anything he does, He has an amazing personality and i want to have that type of personality later in life. I honestly don't even know how to ask my question with out saying other stuff to try to say what i want to say....
***
**Right to the Point**
***
How do I know what I want to do with my life with out having second thoughts about what I'm doing? And how can I make those decisions right now? Or should I even make any of those decisions right now?
Is it just because I'm 17 that is why I'm possibly over thinking everything right now?

***
**EDIT/Extra thoughts**
***

I like playing guitar, I have been playing for 1 year.
I am Interested in  Coding, Was studying C#.
I am Interested in Photoshop, not for the ""Photoshop"" reason, but for the drawling art reason.
I am not interested in joining the Army for the money, I just hope the Army can give me more personal traits.
For example speaking with confidence, Giving important people in life the respect they deserve, Speaking my mind ""which i stuggle to do"", I want to join in hopes I make friends, yeah im 17, but I dont really have alot of friends, FB friends dont count for me. I want to go out and be more active, and take part in more activities in life.

Since I was young I have always been fascinated with science, and space. In third grade when someone told me what i wanted to do when i grow up, I always told them ""I want to go inside of a black hole"". They always said that im dumb and or that's cute, and then always told me how even if i did, i would die. TO THIS DAY, i still would like to have that experience. What if you don't die? yeah it will be lonely, but when if something spectacular happens?

Some of my recent thoughts have been, I want to make a type of playground jungle gym, But i don't even know how i would go about doing that. Or this post. or how i would go about creating music and if it would even be worth it in the end.

One last thing, Is there some kind of website that i can like put a GIGANTIC biography of my and my life? and just put articles on stuff that i am thinking? is that even a thing?

222,"Now and then I will experience an emotional trigger that leaves me feeling physical pain. It feels painful to breathe and there is an uncomfortable discomfort in my upper chest. It doesn't last too long - perhaps 10 to 15 minutes. What can trigger it can range from songs, movies, text etc. 

I do have a hard time letting go of people I care about. My last relationship ended in 2015. I still love her and wish her the best. And to the best of my ability, I have let go of her. Totally removed her from my life and don't look at anything that'd remind me. She has moved on and I know she's happy. I am fine with that. 

Also, I don't wish to imply that all these triggers resolve around my past relationship. It has happened watching a long running drama series where I've gotten to know the characters over the years. Sounds silly I know. To put it simply, you could say empathy perhaps?

What can I do to stop feeling this way when it happens? How do I stop suffering? Because when it happens, it feels awful.

223,"Three weeks ago, a friend of mine unilaterally talked to me about leaving our D&amp;D group so he could bring in someone else. He didn't ask anyone else their opinions and decided it on his own before approaching me. I, thinking he had talked it over with everyone else, sighed and said alright, leaving the group. I only found out later he decided this on his own.

From that point on, I was curious about how much of friends we really were. Every instance I could find in the past three weeks, he has actively and passively ignored, mocked, slighted, and been rude to me. It's nothing major like the previous example but, for instance, he sets up controllers to play a game. I know he has four controllers. He takes out three, passes the two of them to the other guys in the room (there are only four of us there) and proceeds to play himself.

232,"I graduated from college 4 years ago with a bachelor's in psychology.  Since then, I've been primarily working with kids and currently work a very stressful job that is relatively close to my area of study.  I've been at this job 3 years and my experience there would definitely get me any other job working with kids, so long as I don't need a license or masters.  However, I'm kinda burnt out from the whole thing, and when trying to think about an actual career I want to do, it's hard to think about anything related to psychology or working with kids that I would want to do for my whole life. 

After giving it some thought and doing some research, getting a degree in IT sounds like it wouldn't be too bad.  I could get an associates degree at a community college nearby and based on what I've read, an associates degree in IT + a couple years experience is just as good as a bachelors degree. 

The only problem is that I'd be starting over completely from scratch.  I like computers, and generally can figure out computer things relatively quickly (built my own computer with help from my roommate, can generally troubleshoot my own computer problems without needing much help) but as far as actual experience in the field, I have none.  I'm worried that even after getting the degree, I'll be so inexperienced in the field that getting a job will be impossible, and it kinda sucks that the 3 years of extreme stress I've put myself through with my current job will in no way help me get an IT job.  

I don't want to wait around too long to figure out what I want to do; I'm 27 and want to get married to my girlfriend some day, adopt a child, and we can't do those things and live comfortably with me making ~$17.50/hr.  My girlfriend is currently in school getting her second degree, and I want us to both have decent paying jobs so that we can do things in life without feeling excessive stress on our finances.  

I plan on meeting with an adviser at the community college to discuss my options and figure out which path I want to take, assuming I do decide to go back to school.  Game programming sounds the most interesting to me, but I wonder whether other specializations would allow me more job opportunities.  The school I'm looking at offers a number of different paths, and aside from game programming I think I would also enjoy computer programming or software testing. 

 My main concern is the ability for me to get a job with this degree; I would not mind staying at my current job while I'm in school and maybe even finding an internship first to build some experience if I need to. This is all just completely unknown territory for me and I feel kind of lost.

I've posted on this subreddit before and I'm relating back to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7thyo9/friend_repeatedly_mentions_suicide_what_do_i_do/
Basically, I talked about how this friend I have from college regularly sends me suicidal messages. I've considered calling the cops a few times, but I've found a pattern that when I tell him I don't want to date him, I don't reciprocate his feelings, I can't be with him, etc. is when he tells me he is going to kill himself. I know that shouldn't mean I take him less serious, but it's when he's drunk and for a while I didn't know where he lived so I wasn't sure how calling the cops would help if I didn't know where to send them. I finally found his address, and I do like that I have it if I ever feel the need to call the cops. 
I have talked to him and tried to set boundaries like someone suggested, and he got extremely defensive and doesn't talk to me anymore unless he's drunk. Now, I will call the cops if I feel like he's really going to do it. But I also wrote a letter to his parents basically stating that I am worried, I don't want to call the cops and put them under more financial stress, I think he needs help and gave them some low cost suggestions. I've already told him the same thing, but he just doesn't want them. My question is, is it completely fucked up and wrong to send this letter? Does anyone think it's going to push him over the edge if he somehow finds out? Theres a chance his parents might not even do anything. I just don't know what to do.",26Feb2018,1

And then she found this book I had on my bag that had Buddhist themes in it and took it away to ""save me from hell"".  The other day a friend from Chruch was over at my house and while I went to the washroom she looked through my phone I guess. She called me a slut then she actually phoned my mother and told the youth pastor about what she found on my phone. ",26Feb2018,1
244,"Hi all! 

I'm currently a senior in high school and trying to decide what path I should take in my life/major I should select in college. I know that I want to work in virtual reality as a career. I see so much potential in this field and find all the work being done in it to be incredibly interesting. I am also on the robotics team at my school and have started a coding club there as well. I love both so far.

I am unsure of what path I could take to work in VR. I want to work more on the engineering and hardware side of things, and I also think I would love to help envision software (I'm not sure if I love coding enough to do that). The meshing of the physical side of VR (headsets and controllers), and whatever new technology that will make the simulation feel more realistic appeals to me strongly. I also like the graphical side of VR. I don't want to work on the electrical/computer hardware side of things, such as in designing batteries, screens, chips, etc.

I don't know what major I should pursue. I was thinking of double majoring in Computer Science and something else. What should I do? Mechanical engineering, computer engineering, game design, graphical design, and others similar have all been recommended to me. Thank you!",26Feb2018,0
245,"I bought something off dhgate.com back in November. The item took 25 days to get to me but it was wrong size.

I sent back the item which took another 15 days and then they issued a refund (apparently) on the 2nd of Feb. I got a message saying that because the money is going international etc etc that it normally takes 10-15 days for it to get back to my account and to contact my bank for more details on refund process. 15 days and nothing. I contact my bank who says they'd have nothing to do with me getting a refund, and that if I or the seller tried to wire money, then they'd step in. So this tells me it's back to the seller.

246,"Longtime friend has a degree and an office job, but no car, lives at home, and terrible hygiene.  He chews noisily with his mouth open, licks his fingers when eating, stinks up the room when he removes his shoes, and wears tattered and stained clothes, even to his job, where he has a supervisory role in a call center that is happy to give him extra work and responsibility without any pay increase or title change.


I'm going to get him some new walking shoes and socks for his birthday, but I'd also like to get him a book on etiquette so he can learn how to take care of himself better.  It's unlikely he is going to advance or find a better job wearing stained, torn, and smelly clothes.


Since he doesn't drive, he spends a lot on uber and lift rides (since he's become apprehensive about asking friends for rides, even when convenient, since he's been doing it for so long), particularly to go see his girlfriend -- whom he also blows his money on indiscriminately.  Since they are poly and he is the only one with remotely steady employment, he's the one footing the bill for them plus her other boyfriend, or anyone else she's dating at the time.  He always has a nice shave and haircut, but otherwise looks and smells like he rolled out of a garbage pile.

247,"So my roommate has cat toys that are about 5 years old and very dirty and disgusting. She no longer has a cat but I still have one in our apartment and I told her that I don’t want my cat playing with those toys unless they are cleaned first. I cleaned some of them myself and I bought a few new ones and told her that I would like to replace all of the others if she’d let me.

She refuses to get rid of any of them and she also won’t clean them. I understand they might have sentimental value and that she’s planning to get another cat soon, but these toys are covered in years of hair and dust and dirt because she’s never cleaned them and she won’t do it after I’ve asked. Also there’s like 30 cat toys that neither of our cats ever played with but she wants to keep every single one of them (she’s a packrat in general).

So now what? I was thinking of finding exact replicas of some of them and replacing them with new ones without telling her, but that sounds kind of scummy when I say it (it’s also not possible for all of the toys). How do I get these disgusting toys away from my cat? Even if I tell her to put them away she’ll just bring them out again when she gets a new cat.",26Feb2018,0
248,"So, if you didn’t know, when applying to colleges in the US you need (among other things) two letters of recommendation written by teachers. I was planning on having them written by two english teachers I’ve had, as I plan to attend college for something in the english field (yes, I know, majoring in english is bad, that’s not what this post is about). I had one of the teachers in sophomore year, and the second in freshman year and again this year in an AP class, which is Junior year. Up until maybe a week ago, the latter loved me. However, within that week, I managed to fail a quiz, miss the deadline for taking a different quiz I missed, forget a homework, and not come in to get work I missed. I learned today that she changed my recommendation for english class for next year from AP Lit (the highest possible class) to taking two english based extracurriculars. This isn’t too big of a problem, as I can waive into the higher class. However, this goes to show that I fallen rather immensely out of her good graces, and at this point I don’t think she would write me a letter of recommendation. The problem is, I don’t have any other teachers who I think would. I had a science teacher in freshman year who liked me, and an art teacher in sophomore year, but neither of these are related to English so I don’t know if that would be good. I also have a social studies teacher this year who may, but again I am not sure. The deadline for asking a teacher to write your letter of recommendation is March 16. I can either attempt to get back into my teachers good graces by then and hope for the best, or ask another teacher, or do some third thing that I have not yet thought of. Please advise.",26Feb2018,0

252,"I am a 17 year old male from the US. This situation is not exactly how you think it is. My mom has a bestfriend that has 4 daughters. They all range from different ages but the one I mostly get along with is the one that is 18 she is a year older. 

My mom introduced us to her friend’s family when we were about 5 years old so I have known them for about 12 years in total. My friendship with Amy, which is the daughter who is 18 has changed throughout the years. At first when we were young we had a bad relationship we always fought. As we grew we got closer and closer. My mom is and has always been haning out woth her mom.

Now that we are older, she seemed to show interest, she has been a lot more flirty and she now hugs me a lot, keep in mind we never use to touch each other before. She likes to give me back rumbs out of nowhere and I noticed she rubs all up on me now.

Alright now to the conflict I want to resolve, since it is almost summer we are planning a camping trip that will last about 4 or 5 days so basically a week. We are outlining the whole trip and we are planning who is sleeping with who and in my head I thought I would pair up with Amy but I didn’t say anything. Alright Amy approached me and asked if I want to share a tent with her and her other sisters and my little sister could all share another tent.

Obviously I accepted and she was happy about it. Now making the arrangements; my parents seem to not really want me to tent up with her. Amy’s mom is pretty honest and blunt and she said some cringey things in front of us. She said “You better fucking cover your dick and be respectful to my daughter you already know I will always love you guys just don’t do anything stupid that will mae me mad with you”.

I kinda laughed it off so we got passed her mom and she is letting us tent togwther. Now it is just my parents that seem to be against the idea of all this.

253,"I have been working for this organization for quite some time now. I am currently at around 8 months since being hired. Relatively new, but relatively old when comparing how I am treated here by coworkers and overlooked by from management.

For starters, my coworkers are extremely toxic and have created a toxic environment. It's a very small group of us. They formed a pack of favorites, isolating others, and make it very noticeable by making others feel down given the opportunity without any regard of their feelings.

Secondly, I have had a terrible desk since the start. We moved offices and despite everyone arguing who got what, I stayed shut and ended up getting the desk of my harasser, I considered that an upgrade.

The chair I was sitting on since day one was extremely old, bent, and killed my back as there isn't any way to lean back without it leaning backwards causing you to sit and lean forward for extensive parts of the day. I ended up bringing this to my bosses attention after 6 months. He agreed. He said he will consider looking for a new chair. While keep in mind, everyone else has great office chairs, I decided to use a normal chair without wheels for back support.

A month has gone by without any follow up. I feel excluded because my coworkers oftenly joke around about my chair, making it even worst. I felt like I should have gotten a decent chair as everyone else did from the start, but since I never brought that to anyone's attention I don't think I can hold that against anyone other than feeling neglected. Now that a month has passed with it being brought to his attention, if he takes no action, what should I do? Can I even do anything? 

Am I wrong for feeling some kind of way? Is this normal?",26Feb2018,1

I started to read things like paul joseph watson on twitter and my views on things started to change.

I've taken in a lot of what he says and I don't know what to believe anymore. I'm quite easily influence tbh.

I'm now worrying a lot about muslim immigration to Europe  and what the effects of that will be. 

I fear islam and I believe that doesn't make me far right or anything, it makes me sensible. 

I'm very worried that the future of Europe will be islamic/under islamic rule. Due to low birth rates of europeans and mass migration/high birth rates of muslims. 

I now hope the far right win in both Italy and Sweden due to things like the above. 

I don't like being this way. I'm just sick of islamic terrorism. I don't like their way of life and I don't want it here. Why would I when things like sharia law exist. 

I'm sick of all this tbh. All this leftie/right wing shit. Both of them have their own agendas and propagandas. 

I don't hate all muslims, I don't think,  but I do hate their religion. 

I admit I don't understand everything going on though. 

I've sort of become obsessed with all this. Thinking about it all the time. 

Honestly I just want to get on with life but all this sht gets to me. I should mention I'm quite depressed and I don't have much of a life. I left uni  so don't really have much to do.
 The only thing that kept me going was travel. Now even Europe isn't as safe as it used to be because of things like terrorism etc. 
 

Is there any advice?  How can I just get on with life ? I get depressed about things like terrorism happening. 

I know there are worse things than this happening in the world.  It still gets to me though.

 I don't believe the future is bright. I think the world is going backwards. I think islam is slowly taking over Europe  and it terrifies me.

After I moved from that neighborhood in 2002, we stopped talking. We were young, we didn't realize what a true friendship really meant. We saw each other maybe once after I moved; had some sort of sleepover, I can't remember. After that get-together, we never spoke again. He's 24 now and I'm 25. 

In 2011, his Dad died from cancer. He was extremely close with him, and his only sibling was maybe 7 or eight years younger than him--so they weren't close at the time. My parents were VERY close with his parents. Anyways, I have been going through old photographs, over 10,000, and starting scanning them into a digital format. I have found so many good pictures of my old friend and his dad. Every picture I have of his family, they don't have a camera in their hands, even on vacations or holidays.

1) I used to watch pornography too often, but as of 6-7months ago I stopped completely, as it ran the risk of negatively impacting my relationship with my girlfriend.

Here is the problem though

2) I seem to be the dominant one in the relationship as she is the submissive one. We are trying to have a religiously acceptable relationship and lifestyle. (Waiting until marriage to have sex) 

My problem:
We still kiss and allow it to get more passionate, but as it does sometimes I tend to escalate the situation. It is definitely lustful, and I do not know the best way to stop this. I want to still have fun, kissing and making out, but I tend to want to take it further (too far for us is grinding or groping) she is a lot better at controlling the situation than I am, telling me to slow down, and I do, but I want to just not get that far in the first place. Like I want to be able to feel 100% respectful and it becomes seemingly more difficult in these situations.

I rebutted with he wasn’t my main source of happiness. A day later and I’m still thinking about it. I began to look up Co-dependency and honestly I do most of those things. I don’t really get jealous or needy, I give him plenty of space. 

However, I find that I do put his needs before mine, I let things go because I try not to cause arguments, have a hard time saying no, etc. I always chalked this up because I was just involved in my relationships, and I love love. But I think I have a problem.

265,"Hello all. I am graduating in May from college and moving to Texas from WA right after. The 3-bed apartment I rent has typically had a month-to-month agreement, but this month they are changing it to a 9 month minimum agreement.

One of my roommates is leaving. The other roommate is new and already late on paying his share of rent.

The new roommate works 10-15 hours a week at a restaraunt and the rest of his time he's either getting high or drinking. He's very social, funny guy, but his irresponsibility is getting on my nerves. He also asked if his friend, a drug dealer, could move in and I said hell nah.

I work 40 hours a week, go to school and study 25 hours a week. Scheduling finding a roommate is terribly hard right now for me. I am not sure what to do. I need to move this May. But this lease, needing to find a roommate, and the roommate staying being a low-life is giving me a gut feeling that these next few months are going to be a nightmare. My roommates in the past have typically been nerdy guys that were always on time with rent.

Any suggestions on what I should do? I'm at a loss and am very stressed when trying to think up a solution. So much is going on right now and the last thing I want to deal with is a roommate who is late on rent and too high to find a decent roommate while I am working 5 times more than him.

I can either put up with this roommate, sign the 9 month lease, hope he finds someone soon, hope he can get back on track with paying his share, and hope that my roommates in May will let me off the lease in May which is allowed as long as the roommates sign off on it too.

Or I can move out now, deal with the stress of finding a temp place to live, moving all my stuff, and moving again in May, but safe guard myself to be able to actually move in May. I'd need to find a place in less than a week though.

I was at the stage where I'm pretty sure my presence was welcome or at least tolerated by all of them, but I still hadn't been invited to join their group chat or to hang out any time other the weekend.

Last saturday, with a couple of them, I did a drug (phenibut) that I had never done before, and drank copious amounts of alcohol. Basically the effect was this, I was hella drunk but also pretty alert. so, I was really feeling myself.
long story short, i talked to just about every girl that made eye contact with me. being things the way that they are, a few of them were into it, so i got a couple of numbers, made out with a few chicks, danced (grinded) with a few different girls.

later that night, we left the basement show to go to a house party where i got more drunk and talked to another girl who in retrospect was not interested at all. one of the guys i was out with was trying to talk to one of this girls friends, and he basically told me to buzz off because my presence was cock blocking him.

I told him that I'd call the Austin Police myself because I've done absolutely nothing wrong. I'm not stupid enough to threaten someone, period.

After doing some research I decided to not waste the time of the police. If they were building a case I'm sure I'd be contacted.

I tell him that I used to like his commentary on a game we play. But that this other person had made him onto an asshole. I make a batman and joker analogy, how the joker made batman but instead of of becoming good like batman he turned into a dbag.

He replies with more arrest threats.

I tell him he's crazy, and I'm blocking him. And I do block him. But I was curious as to what the crazy sob was up to and see that he's twisted my analogy and that he's telling people he's trying to get my name and address to that i can be arrested.

I'm clueless about how the law works. I do feel worried for my safety after hearing about people getting killed from being doxed. I have a wife and kid. I haven't told my wife yet because i don't want to upset her.

She found diapers, dresses, panties, fleshlights, rope, and a giant plastic baby suit from Ebay that costed over a hundred bucks.

I have a little office in the basement. There is a little sign that says that but there is no door. Guess I should put a curtain or something.

I don't know what to do. It's weird with them knowing this sissy baby side to me.

Anybody else with parents who know your darkest secret?

My parents are fine with it and don't really care. Honestly, I've never have had a good relationship with my sister. We always fight. She used to tell me to kill myself and would always flick me off.

It sucks she knows this side of me. No one is supposed to know. And it hurts she knows this and thinks of me as a freak. She is very conservative and vanilla.

How do I cope with my family knowing? Should I act like it's no big deal and forget about it. I have fears that my sister might tell my friends and it will slowly leak out. Honestly, I'm so sick of how invasive and negative and toxic she is in my life. I don't even talk to her.

I've been smoking a lot of marijuana to forget about it. Marijuana is my only happy place that takes me away from that toxicity.

I'm constantly angry and depressed, but luckily I've learned to control this because I've felt this way my whole life. I can't do anything without feeling like having a mental breakdown though. I've accepted responsibility for my emotions and repeated a mantra of forgiveness but it's not working! I'm trying my best to let go, what am I doing wrong?

I've narrowed down the cause of my complete failure in life to rumination. My depression, angry-resentful feelings, social and general anxiety (I constantly feel like I'm hiding my true feelings, which I am), ugliness (ugly feelings make ugly self expression I suppose), lack of motivation, self-hatred, low self-esteem, shame, and loneliness. It's torture. 

Any tips on forgiveness would be much appreciated as I'd honestly rather kill myself than live like this any longer. Is there some trick I'm missing? I'd just love for my emotions not to feel like a war-ground anymore, no more constant pain or anger, then I can get on with my life.",26Feb2018,10

285,"I really don't know how to deal with this, but lately being more social led me to experience that fat shaming still is in full effect. 

My last job led to the first experience of this phenomenon. I'm 6,4"" and been managing myself. My last visit with my doctor nurse and they were surprised how much weight I lossed and it didn't phase me(no any other illnesses related either). Because later that day I had to work with coworkers with a different perspective. They oppressed me by recognizing me first by my size, then criticized me with the general labels that were never true. The quick arrogant statements pushes me away from approaching people really.

The more I expose myself publicity, it becomes more of an issue. My new job it still exists as well. But the worst part is not being called out fat itself, but being in the presence of other people who are a 50"" waistline,  but I somehow get targeted when I just made it to pants waistline in the 30's. Looking in the mirror never helped much, just left me in confusion if I was shallow halling myself.

That's frustrating that my only positive feedback is my doc seeing progress every checkup. 

Also, I don't carry bad habits reason why I am in my situation today. People believe all I do is drink beer and eat Doritos but it's an easy believable concept. My work effort at my current job is improving significantly, leaving me at the top tier with the power equipment handlers. It's a laborious job, but only then is when the heckling dies down... just a bit.

289,"I have been trying to be friends with my roommate for months, but recently noticed she uses me. I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She's never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can't force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn't want her to go through, and she proceeded to ""Steal"" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn't try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I'm just so angry and can't talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn't make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what's wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn't anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn't have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven't talked to her in two weeks, I just can't hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I'm the bad guy. I myself don't know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point?

On a Thursday afternoon since neither of us had obligations for the rest of the day I offered to go out for a bite to eat and a drink. Trying to take advantage of having an off day and knowing there was a movie theater right next to where we went, further suggesting we should see the new Black Panther movie. He said he really wanted to go see it, but his girlfriend wanted him to go out with all of her friends that consisted of being only girls (none of which that were attractive or i would've went), So after sometime he said he was up for the movie after-all. We finish the movie go get some more drinks, make our way back home to call it a night since we had a normal day tomorrow. 
Two days later he strolls in pretty late to the house catching me during some folding in the laundry room, and i could tell something was off. 
Long story short, she broke things off with him and i cant but feel at least somewhat to blame for what had happened.

306,"So in about 2 weeks my routine will turn upside down, leaving me no time to have lunch. Bear in mind I'm not the in US so eating out is expensive and we don't have as many to-go foods available. 

I'll be waking up at 6am to go to uni. It's a 1 and a half hour commute by bus, and then I'll have classes until noon. Then I'll catch the bus to have an almost 2-hour commute back home, but the thing is I have to be at work by 2:30pm. I live close to my job but not as close to go to work on foot. I finish work by 9pm, meaning I can't just not have lunch. The bus to go to work and my house is the same, divided by 5 stops. I have to catch 2 busses, and the waiting time between them is what makes the commute so long. 
At work I have access to a stove and fridge. 

I'm torn between my choices: 
1) I'll eat at uni ($3 a day per meal) after class and then catch the bus to go straight to work. The problem with this is the line to eat at the cafeteria is huge, meaning there's a chance I'll arrive late at work. And the food isn't the healthiest. 

2) I'll pack lunch every morning to take to uni with me and then eat it on the bus or as soon as I arrive at work. It would have to be something simple that won't go bad throughout the morning, as I wouldn't have access to a fridge. 

3) Eat at the restaurant in front of my work, which can be expensive. 

4) Instead of going straight to work, stay on the bus and get off of it at home, eat lunch there (I'd have meal prep during the weekend) and go to work by uber. 

5) Leave my meals at work on Saturday, the meals I'll be eating the following week. Then I'd arrive at work and heat them up on the stove every day. 

With that in mind, my other meal times would be: breakfast in the morning. I'll either meal prep so I can have boiled eggs ready every morning, and then drink coffee at uni on break ($2 per cup). Then around 5pm I have a break from work and I usually eat out (around $10 every day) and then dinner when I arrive home (I cook when I arrive and there's usually leftovers for the next day). But I couldn't take the leftover and I reckon they'd go bad being in my bag all morning (very hot country I live in) ",26Feb2018,0

She will literally walk right past me &amp; not say a word. And when we did speak it’d predominantly be her telling me about her problems &amp; never asking anything about me at all. EVER. When I did give her input into my world she wasn’t really there. I often had to repeat myself. Our relationship was not give and take. 

After telling her how I felt, so that I wasn’t keeping it bottled &amp; then it turning into resentment, she said that it wasn’t me, it was her &amp; how her relationship affected many of her friendships (she dated this guy she smothered &amp; who really didn’t give a fuck about her - &amp; that’s all she used to talk about).

 I got what I wanted out of the conversation - which was to tell her how I felt &amp; to understand her. I believe I do now. I’ve already come to the conclusion that I don’t want to be her friend anymore but I still have to live with her lol ... and work with her. 

Her voice irritates me, her presence irritates me. I think it’s because I’m a little salty about how undervalued I was.

325,"Hi, 

Basically, a few months ago my friend was going to order some fake IDs. He asked if he could get them delivered to my house, and I said sure for some reason (I later realized that I shouldn't have let him, as I don't want this stuff sent to my address). He was ordering the IDs for himself, his girlfriend, her sister, and their cousin. 

The IDs got to my house a couple weeks later, and I didn't recognize this package addressed to me as it was from China, so I cut it open and lo and behold, it was the IDs and I had accidentally cut the cousin's ID, making it worthless. I felt bad so I told my friend that I would pay to reorder it if he wanted and if the vendor wouldn't send out a replacement for free. 

My friend never got back to me asking me to send him any money for a replacement, and I later found out that he had contacted the vendor, who had agreed to send out a replacement for free. This replacement has not arrived (ordered about a month or two ago). 

Now, my friend's girlfriend's cousin, whose ID got cut, texted me saying he was told I offered to ""reimburse him for the cut ID"" and that ""it'd be much appreciated"". 

At this point, I don't think I have any responsibility to send this person, who I've never had any contact with or even met, money. I don't think it was really on me in the first place as my friend should have just had them sent to his address, but I offered to pay since I did agree to have them sent to me and it was an accident that made the ID worthless. Now, however, months after the fact, I don't feel I should feel obligated to have anything to do with this, let alone send this guy money. Especially since the vendor did agree to send a replacement out and it just never arrived. Does this mean if I had paid for a replacement in the first place, and it never showed up, then the cousin would expect me to pay for another? I honestly want to tell this guy to get out of here. 

What do you think, should I pay for yet another shipment? Advice would be great, this is a weird situation for me. ",26Feb2018,1

Often the one to mention that ""the meeting is not taking place as we are going to have some time together"" is said partner.

This suggests to me that either the partner keeps them under control and is possessive, though it would be understandable to spend time with partner as well - just not when it's the time to meet too often.

Now I don't want to meet too often (i could even meet every few days) as to not push too much or make my friends too busy. I've made this clear from the start and I've been told that it's been balanced so far.

I had a concern about canceled meetings earlier because they happened too often and then at one point way too suddenly. i could picture whole scenario in my head based on how the same had happened earlier with the partner involved. we talked about my worry and i thought i wouldn't have to worry about it after that.

it's been hard for me to be a very good friend when I haven't had much time with ONLY them. I would like to include their partner at times as well, but I can't when I feel like they are making my friend choose between them or me. 

but so now the same worry is coming back to me. 

just some time ago i was on a trip with some people including the partner and my friend. we all got to spend a good amount of time together so i was happy, but we also had planned a meeting of sorts during that trip.. for at least a week if not two. I reminded my friend about the meeting a few times before it happened, but just around 10 minutes before it was to take place, my friend said that they would like to spend some time with their partner instead 
 and go for a walk while the partner seemed to not care about our promise (the partner looked as if they hid this thought well on their face). I got extremely puzzled and disappointed. I asked if my friend really means this as this kind of meeting doesn't take place often... which to my friend answered that they would definitely have the meeting later on.

so i say alright, not thinking of it too much but trusting my friend less as a result even though they've been a good friend so far.

so i have the meeting anyway and some time later the person i wanted my friend to meet was disappointed as well. i said to them that it's hard to be a friend when these kind of things happen. as we were on a walk to our rooms after some talking, we come across my friend and their partner. in other words, they did not go out for a walk.

i ask if we can come in and my friend says yes. we have the ""meeting"" anyway. after the meet we go out to walk somewhere with a group of 5 people, but i ""apologize"" to my friend in person saying that i didn't mean to barge in but it was cold outside. my friend says i have nothing to apologize for and then says that they should apologize. i say ""it's okay"" quickly as i didn't want to start talking or asking why exactly when we were walking somewhere with the group.

later on i ask my friend why they apologized... and they respond that ""they don't remember""... exactly as i thought they would.

i asked if it was because they said no earlier, but they said that they were going for a walk to have some time together, that they can't remember why and that it might have been automatic.

so because i thought about how hard it can be for them to even admit that someone else's behaviour has caused doubts in our friendship, I said that ""you are forgiven anyways"".

----

but now I feel like I should say that ""I will have to hear why next time"". Should I do that or say something else?

I'm obviously concerned of getting disappointed in a similar way in the future and not getting to spend enough of time close together (so not with their partner, even though I would like to include them as well after all this is cleared up). I'm concerned that my friend would choose to ""spend time"" with their partner even if I had something important to say or if we were about to have a meeting in the future.. things like that.",26Feb2018,2
331,"So I'm graduating University this year and a lot of my friends are moving away for jobs or back to their home city.

332,"I'll keep this short because, imo, it's not super complicated.

My ex and I shared an apartment. When we broke up I moved out, paid off my half of the lease through the end, and we both signed off on me not being on the lease anymore.

This is months before she moved out herself, and note real quick that she's a slob like none youve ever seen. Now she's out and got the bill for damages to the apartment (which literally wasn't damaged when I left). She wants me to pay half. Hell no. I already did confirmed with the complex that I have no legal obligations, and yet the ex is literally threatening me with a lawsuit! 

So first I just want to make sure I'm all good because I'm paranoid even though the complex straight said I have no legal obligation. And second, I want to know if this is an appropriate time to have my lawyer send a cease and desist letter for harassment?

334,"Hi all! Im currently being torn apart by a decision I need to make and Im asking for advice on what to do.

Backstory:

So, I have this goal... this dream, of being a iOS app developer. I left my job with Apple to do a coding bootcamp and start down this path. I was hired out of school as a developer for a start up and was with them for just over a year or so. During my time there I didn't get to code everyday as there wasn't always work and the CEO used my presentation skills and other talents after my first three months there. 

The funding eventually ran out and while I did learn some new things i'm still a pretty new developer. I've been actively looking for work and pursing personal projects for since mid December 2017. During that time I've been interviewed countless times, completed many take home projects, and been invited back to a few final interviews but ultimately I choke in the last interview. I get flustered, forget what a variable is or something and just drown. 

So, i'm currently really discouraged. I've just received so many no's and its hard to keep moving forward... With that My wife's and mine savings is getting pretty low. I could continue without work for maybe three or so more months...

The Issue:
With me being out of work for so long and with my savings getting low I started to approach friends and family for potential opportunities. I was able to land a interview and receive an offer of employment from my really good friends father. This position would be a real basic gig for a pretty low wage... but here is the catch. The father, will only let me work for him If I commit to at least 9 months of work. Which, in his defense, makes perfect sense. He's the product line manager for a really big company and needs to spend the training and resources wisely. So I support him in this. The problem is that it will completely prevent me from looking for full time developer gigs and also make it hard to even keep learning and coding everyday. 

I want to take this job to be a provider for my wife and to get some semblance of stability. But, I also don't want to give up on my goal and dream. 

But, Also, maybe I should just accept that i'm not a good enough developer and just start moving forward in a different way? I'm just so lost... I want to be a developer and I know I can do it. I have two apps in the app store currently and I have a third one i'm pushing this week... Im just.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Shit. 

My wife wants me to continue to pursue being a developer but I feel like im letting her down not being able to find work. You know?

The question:
Do I take this job and accept that i'm not good enough and try to continue to learn and grow during my time there? Or, do I keep trying for this goal and potentially be worse off, broke, and even more useless?

TLDR:
Shity developer doesn't know wether to accept that he's just shit or if he should keep pushing forward.

335,"Me (20) moved across the america from the east coast to the west coast for a ""woman"" (52) that i had met online. Long story short i'm not into older women. Her age was not clear from the start until later on.

 Anyway, We were together in person from August up until January. I broke the news to her telling her that i did not want something like this and she is too old for me. I felt uncomfortable in public with her and the age difference was too much for me. I have felt this way for the majority of my relationship with her. Shortly after breaking the news she broke out into rage.

She kicked me out leaving me homeless for 2 weeks in a place i've never been before 2,500 miles away from my family. I never said a word to her after that praying that it was over and she would leave me alone. This is not the case. She continues to text me daily saying how i lied and how i use to want to be with her and now i don't and how im such a shitty person etc. I give her short and simple responses saying leave me alone or that i don't care and i want to be left alone.

 After some time passes i find a room to rent in a nearby town for the next month so i can fly back on good terms with my work. After blocking her on my cellphone, facebook, and twitter she continues to email me all the time about how evil i am and my family. I simply ignore it and wish she would leave me alone. 

Yesterday as i was heading towards the train station she is waiting outside across from my work waiting for me to go towards the train. This is at 11:00 at night where nobody is around. She starts chasing me as i am on my bike yelling at me and threatening me trying to push me off my bike. Physically putting her hands on me and trying to shove me off my bike. I do not say a word or touch her. I ride my bike up to the train platform and she has followed me up the stairs. I use my bike as a barrier to keep her away from me. As she is yelling and screaming at me i call the police. She runs away and the police tell me to get a restraining order. I am leaving in 1 week at this time and i don't want to go to court just for a week of her nonsense. When i get home i call the local police and try to file a police report. We go through all the information together and after 15 minutes he said he will call her and get back to me after he is done talking to her. He never called me back that night or this morning. This morning i blocked her email and now she is signing up for all different kinds of sites using my email. I tried calling the officer back this morning and no response.

 At this point i am scared of what she can do with my name. I do not want any contact with her and i feel so frustrated with all these. I want to be left alone and i dont want anything to do with her. I am at a lose on what to do. ",26Feb2018,54
336,"I've been at my new job for 5 months now. In fact it is my first ever full time permanent job. I knew that the first few weeks/months would be hard as it was a whole work area that was unfamiliar to me, getting used to 9 to 5 office life and learning many new names/faces/terminology/IT systems and programming languages. I now feel like I'm over the hump of this initial wash of information, but I feel like every time I feel comfortable with my role and responsibilities, my boss throws in another level of difficulty and it just keeps levelling up month on month, faster than I can cope with. She has often signed me up for added responsibilities, without fully understanding the knowledge or time requirements needed for the work. Of course, I cannot protest as I am still new, and this does not become obvious to me either later down the line. The latest layer of difficulty is being partnered to work with a man I find very difficult, who has taken to checking up on my work every few hours, which as a very independent person I am finding very draining. I have tried to speak with my boss about these issues. As a result of this stress I have not been sleeping well, I have started to turn to alcohol and casual sex in my free time. My social life has taken a hit. I have found myself doing additional learning out of work hours in order to catch up. I have not yet failed to deliver on anything, however I do feel I am seen as only doing just enough to get by and not excelling. How do I know if it will pass, and eventually the difficulty will plateau and work out for me? Or how do I know if maybe I'm just in an environment that isn't right for me? I am drawn to job applications on the weekends, however I don't really know what it is that I would prefer to do, just that I don't know how much longer I can cope in this role. ",26Feb2018,23

339,"This situation is complicated and I'll try to make it short. Sorry if it isn't.

We adopted an almost 2 years old dog from craigslist. We've had him for almost 2 years ourselves now. he's a german shepherd/lab/beagle. He's wild and crazy and acts like a cartoon dog. My sister calls him ""retarded"".

He has a problem with resource guarding. He gets very mad if he thinks you're going to try and take away his food/toy. Last year, he was in bed with my parents and in the middle of the night my mom woke up and went to pet/hug him. He flipped out and bit her face. Not extreme damage but lots of little dot-wounds. My mom thinks she scared him.

He has grabbed my shirt and tugged it back and forth aggressively while growling, but that hasn't happened in over a year. He bit my father on the arm last week (I was not there when it happened, so I don't know the details) and twice today. Once in the morning and once just now, both times when my father tried to take his leash off after a walk. My father was not seriously injured but is very very mad.

When the dog bit my mom, my father was very upset and threatened to either give him away or shoot him. (He grew up on a farm where it was normal to shoot misbehaving animals.) It was my mom's begging and maybe my crying into my damn spaghetti that saved him.

My father is very very upset now. He said multiple times in the last few minutes that he's going to shoot the dog. He said if the dog does anything at all he's going to ""drive an hour away to [his mother's house], get the gun, drive back and shoot him with a clear head"". He gave my mom a very clear ultimatum of ""find him a home. find him a home or I'm going to kill him."" I know that if someone else adopts him, there's a very good chance they're going to kill him anyway.

What I'm asking for advice on is how to mentally deal with losing my dog. I have emotional problems and I'm very sensitive. it's already hurting me a lot and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I lost my baby cat who I raised, to illness a few months ago and I still cry about her sometimes. I don't know how to handle losing another pet, and seeing our other dog be sad without her best friend.

Sorry for making this so long, and sorry if this isn't the right place to ask for this kind of advice. any help at all will be greatly appreciated. thank you.

edit: I thought I should mention that I know what my dog is doing is bad and that he has a problem. Unfortunately my father is not the type to ""waste"" his time or money on training the dog or fixing the problem. I have no say over the situation. I'm  just looking for advice on how to deal with the loss.",26Feb2018,1

My uncle and aunt came down to figure out the situation and my uncle has decided to stay which shocked me because when I was about 10 he snuck in the outside shower with me nude and touched me. I never told anyone about it, but after that he was a complete asshole to me so to be honest I never really told anyone, I just figured I would see him at a few funerals and maybe a wedding and other than that he would die a miserable fuck. So the last thing I expected was for him to become a roommate, and needless to say He's been a complete insufferable dick since the day he walked in, wanting to change everything about the rules of the house (I smoke outside at a picnic area, he doesn't want it on the property at all, He sent pictures of my room to my aunt and told me to get a bin of my clothes off the floor or he'd throw them out, constantly putting me down every chance he gets etc etc the list goes on.) I pay rent here, and can't really afford to move, and I've been contemplating telling my grandmother and perhaps some other family members I'm uncomfortable living with him. However, without real concrete proof, it seems like I'm just making up bullshit because he's being a dick.

I hardly ride in her car anymore, so the issue hasn't bothered me again until now.

345,"Currently, I feel the urge to move out and have been looking for something affordable for months but it's nearly impossible on my income and the rent prices in Los Angeles. I've only found shared rooms, living rooms, or areas more than an hour drive for work for 50% of my monthly income.

I've been desperately looking for something that would be 30% of my income, but have found nothing. 

The situation at home is getting more and more awkward. I feel my parents' judgment when I come home late at night, don't come home, or if I leave the house. It's become awkward, and I almost dread coming home looking for ways to avoid being home. My parents tell me I have it good there with my own room, and people would kill to be in my place. They think I am being fiscally irresponsible for wanting to move out with an unstable job. 

I am 26 years old, and have a job at a university working 30 hours a week making $1,800 a month with benefits. I don't think I'm doing the best I can, but I don't think I am horrible. The job is extended till September, but I am confident in getting another job just as good with more hours in the university. I know many employees on campus and have connections, so it's not an issue. I am just not rushing into anything. 

Anyway, a friend offered me a room at her place for under my budget (under 30% of monthly income). The room is only a mile from my parent's home, but it is spacious and such a steal of a deal. She mentioned she just hadn't found anyone to rent it out too, and could afford to cover the rent. I would be living with her and another female friend.

My worry is that she will bring people I am not comfortable with over the house for get togethers. She was known to run with the wrong crowd. I wouldn't want to let her borrow anything, or vice versa. She mentioned her roommate is messy (I'd share bathrooms with her). Finally, we share different views on relationships and life in general, and I fear that she might be a bad influence.

Another problem is my parents don't approve of this girl because she was known to be some trouble when we were younger. My family doesn't approve of her. My boyfriend is saying he's not sure he'd be comfortable with me living there. 

I feel this huge urge just to get away from my parent's home, but I also have them on the back of my mind. Their disapproval gets to me. I just don't know if I am making the right decision anymore.",26Feb2018,2

For as long as I can remember I cover them with makeup. I have gone through many attempts and beauty products. I believe I have slightly become a little more ‘accepting’ of them. But sometimes I just wish I had clear skin. I truly do. Laser removal surgery has been something I have looked into, but my parents and doctor have talked me out of the thought due to possible (expensive!) damage it could cause, leaving me with something worse to deal with. I remember a point in time, I would keep a bottle of lemon juice in my room and soak it on my skin, it would burn and sting, so much so! I was told by a ‘Natural/Home Remedy website). I have and continue to use and test out skincare products that come under the category with ingredients to help lighten things such as hyper-pigmentation and I wear suncream too!

I by no means believe/find people with freckles to be ‘visually’ flawed. As I often watch videos and look up freckles on other girls to perhaps teach myself into accepting them in an ‘they look pretty on her’ mindset. I just hate my own.

Throwaway for a number of reasons. I graduated college last semester. Over the course of the past several months, I applied to 11 graduate schools that have funded MFA Creative Writing programs. Thus far, I have received 4 rejections, and things are not looking well for the rest. I'm going to be working a part time job starting next Saturday, and I volunteer at a couple of different places a few days a week. So, I at least am occupying my time for now. I live at home currently.

I guess I would need advice for the next step- I'm likely to take L's on the other seven applications, and I don't want to make the same mistake twice, so I'm scrubbing the MFA in Writing plan. I've been told by a few of my advisors and mentors the past couple of weeks that I'm a good fit for Journalism or Business leadership programmes, but I don't know where to start with those. I've always had fun looking at markets, for example, and debating with my friends in college about what the trends meant. Money's tight in my family, so I need to seek out funded degrees. If it helps, I live in the northeastern US. 

This would be my 2019 plan. I'm banking on accepting a year-long position abroad (knock on wood) that I would start in August of this year, that ends in June of 2019. So, I've got time, I just need a plan.

Any advice would help me right now. Thank you",26Feb2018,2
377,"I have some good friends, but if I can recall correctly, never in my mature life has someone reached out to me to hang out. I've always asked other people to hang out. We get together and have fun, but I still feel weird always being the one that asks everyone else if they're free or want to do something. It makes me think that they don't want to hang out with me, but they're scared to say no. What do you think this means? ",26Feb2018,2

The elective is digital video editing, it’s not anywhere near being an important class, but it’ll still mess up my gpa

379,"I bought this dinky little safe online and I have been using it to hold photos, birth certificates and my marriage paperwork. A few weeks ago the numerical pad (which is battery powered) gave out. 
I went on Amazon where I bought it and I found it a bunch of people were complaining about it and were having similar problems to the point where they are no longer making the safe. 
I contacted the company three months ago for the first time and have tried to contact them six times again. I have tried using the other tools people commented on the safe to try and nothing works. 
Could I take it to a locksmith? Is there anything to do? I have tried using a lock picking kit, a hammer, a knife, I am starting to panic, I need the photos in there because they are the only copies I have.

380,"So here’s the story.

In roughly 3 months, I’ll be leaving my job to pursue a career in music with my band. We will be doing tours up and down the east coast in our own van and trying to make it in the music industry. I currently work in a sales position that I absolutely hate, and I’ve been looking for a way out for a while now.

This is a job that weighs on me very much, the people I deal with tend to be rude and obnoxious, and on top of that, it was just a mistake to take this job in the first place because I’m not a people person AT ALL. I prefer my own company and I don’t get that sense of joy out of helping other people that some folks speak of.

Lately I’ve been depressed and anxious over my job, there’s always new policies and procedures that you have to keep up with, and I’ve been slipping up recently with that, telling customers the wrong thing and just being generally not good at my job due to the fact that I know I’ll be leaving soon and I’ve gotten to the point where I literally can’t even find the energy to care. I drag myself out of bed every day, dreading the work day ahead of me and counting down the minutes, no— SECONDS until I can head out the door.

I want nothing more than to be able to pursue a career in music with my band, and based on some experiences I’ve had with some bands I’ve been a part of before, I have a lot of hope for is, simply because all of our members are committed to giving 110% to get us on tour and eventually get signed. I don’t want to talk too much about the band, but this way you’ll at least know what I’m looking forward to.

I know I need a way to save money and keep myself going until we go on tour, and obviously I need a source of money to support my passion and make my contribution to taking us as far as we can go, but with the way I feel every day when I wake up for work, it’s getting harder every day not to type out my two weeks notice and be done with the place. There’s so much fuckery that goes on there, but I’ll save that for another post. Point being, I want OUT, and I want out NOW.

I’m genuinely to the point where I feel like another day at this job is gonna drive me insane, and it’s affecting my relationships with people. I didn’t use to complain so much, I didn’t use to always ramble about how I hate what I do, but now I just feel like such a negative person and I think this job has really changed my outlook on life for the worst.

I’m having a hard time deciding whether it will even be worth it to quit and try to find another job so soon before our tour starts, but the thought of having to stick with what I’m doing for another 3 months gives me high blood pressure and I literally cannot afford the overlap in paychecks between switching jobs as I’m barely able to support myself as it is right now. 

I also have a lot of collectibles that I’ve inherited from a deceased family member that are just gathering dust, and I wondered about trying my hand at eBay selling for a few months to keep myself going. 

My job is sucking my soul.


What should I do?

385,"I (24 m) am from the east coast, but have been working/going to school on the west for 3-4 years. Last summer I was on the fence about work, so my old boss offered me a raise and told me how much work there was to be done this summer. This is a freelance landscaping job that he started. The last summer I worked with him it was just me, another guy, and him- so small crew always. Anyway, last summer I come back to work, as I was just told I would be getting paid under the table, have a raise, would be getting 40+ hour work weeks with average 500$/week. That summer, none of that was true. For the majority of the summer it was me and an old high school friend who worked for him. Throughout the days we would have really no work to do except mow lawn/weed whack. A few weeks roll around and he explains to us that he needs to put us on his records for his tax purposes so sometimes he’ll give us cash and sometimes write us checks with money taken out of our check for tax purposes. Summer goes on and on, nothing really changes- doing same monotonous, tedious jobs day in and day out. I constantly tell him about the work he keeps bringing up and he always finds some excuse. More days go by and the boss has taken a long time to pay me and the other employee each week. He eventually quits cause he never got paid( I agree this isn’t the best way to solve a problem, he just ghosted the boss pretty much). I’m left struggling to pick up pieces and what not. Later on, I find a job that’s suitable for my major and what I went to school for. As soon as I tell him I can’t work for him anymore, he throws me attitude on me bailing on him and whatnot even when he constantly knew and told me that I was not in this job for a long commitment.  Dude  was just a straight up asshole about it. It took me over a month to get my final paycheck that was not even 500$. 

Now a few nights ago, I text him asking about when to expect my tax papers. He calls me and leaves a voicemail explaining that he’s not claiming me or the other employee as a dependent cause we didn’t make over $2500. He said “ you’re welcome you’re not on the government’s watch” (something like that; he’s very pro trump and anti government). So am I getting screwed out of that money that he took out of our checks? Where does that money go?

TLDR; boss said he’d write me off as a dependent, took money out of my checks for tax, now is saying he’s not claiming me as a dependent and I will not be getting any money back.

386,I’m a 20 year old male in college. I sleep 8 hours a night and my sleep schedule is fairly consistent. I drink plenty of water and eat enough every day. I rarely drink caffeine. Somehow I’m almost always tired and I don’t know why. I just feel exhausted in the middle of the day and want to take a nap. Is there anything I can try to help before going to a doctor? ,26Feb2018,4
387,"My family are moving houses, but the new house we're moving to is too far away from my college. I'm in a vital stage of my education and therefore can't afford to leave my school. As a result I'll be renting a room in a 2 bedroom house (for 4 months), the owners  will also be living there. They're a couple in their mid 20s.

So what advice would you give a 17 year old student sharing a house with others to make life easier for me and how can I be a good tenant/room mate? 

My mom has suggested preparing meals for the following week in one day to save time,  whilst my dad has helped me budget my food, travel and socialising expenses for the 4 months.

Are there any tips or life hacks that you wish you knew when you started to live independently?

Any advice or input would be appreciated  :)",26Feb2018,3
