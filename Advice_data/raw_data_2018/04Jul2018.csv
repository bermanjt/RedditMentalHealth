0,"Disclaimer - I'm not really sure if this counts as abuse, there is a blurry line between abuse and child discipline, and that's why I'm asking advice on this subbreddit

When I was little both my parents worked full time jobs, and early every morning I would go to my step-great-aunts house and my parents wouldn't be able to come and get me until around 9 or 10:00 at night. My aunt also happened to be a babysitter, so there were always other kids there.

I don't have many memories of being at her house, I stopped going around the time I was in 3rd grade. I remember little things, like being scared to ask where the crayons were because she would get angry with me. I remember her getting so mad she would pull me by the hair and drag me to the time out spot where I would have to wait for hours until my parents got back, sometimes skipping meals. I don't think I was a bad child, she would just get annoyed if I asked to many questions or if I wanted something specific like no mustard on my hot dog. She never punched me but I remember being slapped, spanked, and pulled by the hair, not to mention the screaming and yelling. 

One distinct memory I have is having to hide all the toys in the bathtub and then us kids having to hide under the stairs. There was a man who came and looked around the house, thinking back on it now, it could have been someone from CPS. The main thing I remember from the event was being terrified of making a sound because of the amount of trouble I'd be in.

I never told my parents about this happening, I think my logic back then was all adults are on the same team, and I would just be in more trouble for telling them. I know I didn't want to go every morning, and my parents may have thought I had separation anxiety or that I just didn't like her. They couldn't do anything to change it at the time because she was the cheapest babysitter they could find, only charging $1 per hour per kid.

The reason I'm in this advice subreddit is because I've only really started thinking about these things now and I know she is still a babysitter. I've been thinking about telling my parents about this and trying to see if there is someone we can report these things to, hopefully to prevent other kids from going through the same stuff I did. Like I said above, there is a blurry line between abuse and child discipline, so I don't know if much can be done, especially because this happened about 8-10 years ago and I have absolutely no proof of this stuff happening. I've thought about going to child protective services, but I have had many friends that have gone through worse abuse and CPS knew and just let it happen. That's a completely different story, but basically I know that CPS won't do a thing about it.

Does anyone have any ideas or advice on what I should do? Also, the more I think back on it, the more memories keep popping up, so I might edit it in the future to add some things if they are important.",04Jul2018,2
1,This toxic friend I knew a long time ago since I was little. Don’t know why I continued being friends with her but anyways I don’t want to as she’s toxic. She has embarrassing pics and videos of me and she won’t hesitate to share them. How can I end this friendship without her posting them or something?,04Jul2018,1
2,"So, as the title says, I am 21 and need help with driving. My dad is the only one who can teach me at this point (I don't talk to half of my family, the other half are either too old, too far away, or to young to teach me.). I feel each time I ask to drive he keeps making excuses. I have been pretty upfront about my eagerness to learn and where and when, I even try making plans. But my dad is the ""go with the flow"" kind of guy, and doesn't want to make a designated time to do so. He works most of the week, and by the time he is home he wants to just sit back and relax before going to bed around 6-8pm. He only has two days off, which I have coordinated to have off (Days I don't have to be in physically, I can work from home if need be) as well so we can at least drive ONE of those days. 

Let me clear, I am not asking him to give me both of his days off to teach me, but I need ONE at least for a FEW HOURS (4 hours at most!). 

The few times I have asked when he makes an excuse he has said ""Well, you haven't made plans..."" (NO SHIT SHERLOCK. YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THEM! YOU ALWAYS SAY, ""Eh, I don't know."" or ""We'll see..."".) I told him ""Yeah, because you don't want to make plans, dad."" (Sorry, not letting you get away with that bullshit dad!)

Recently I asked and he said he had ""This, that, and the other thing to do.""( When all he is doing is a hobby he does EVERYDAY after work!) and that he only had one day off because he had to drive my sister to an appointment that was only an hour long and a hour long drive (Round trip I might add, so only two hours out of his 12-14 hour long days! We could have easily had me drive! KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE DAMN IT). 

I don't feel I am being unreasonable since I pay for gas all the time when I drive and I have been communicating my desire to drive. I have to pester him at this point to get ANYTHING out of him, and it is usually a measly 15 minute drive to the store or gas station and then back. 

I'm frustrated because I am only working meager hours at the moment (And will be working less soon to get my education back on course) so I cannot afford to get a driving coach ($800+) for 24 hours ($33 an hour), and the only person left is my dad. My dad always talks about me being independent and shit, so this seems counter productive to that. 

1) What can I do to start getting somewhere with my dad on this subject, perhaps at least a SINGLE day put towards this? ",04Jul2018,1

4,"So I've been having a hard time making up my mind between two universities for my undergraduate: the University of Maine Orono and the University of Stirling. I have to decide by tomorrow and I need help in making a decision. Below is a little information about myself and the universities, but feel free to do your own research if you want to take it a step further.

Me: 

* I'm 17 turning 18
* I've lived in Maine all my life
* I'm not entirely sure what I want to pursue for a career
* I'm not made of money, and would be taking out loans regardless of decision.
* I've never been outside the U.S.
* In high school I was a C student until Senior year when I was an A student
* Regardless of university I would be looking to transfer to a more acclaimed university (Edinburgh is my dream college) the next year
* I've always been inclined toward science, but I'm not sure if I want to be doing it for the rest of my life. 

UMaine: 

* I'd be paying $28,000 a year
* I'd start as undecided
* If I were to transfer to Edinburgh, I would have to start at year one unless I pursued a science or humanities degree.
* My parents would buy me a car if I went to UMaine so I could get to work
* I know people going to UMaine
* I'd still have my parents as backup.
* I'd be 90&amp;#37; transferring sophomore year even if I couldn't get into Edinburgh (I wasn't very impressed the 100 times my school took me there for tours and science stuff)

Stirling:

* I'd be paying $33,000
* I'd start as a Biology major
* Not sure if I can change my major without penalty if I don't like it
* If I were to transfer to Edinburgh, regardless of major I'd start year two, but I'd be considered with all the people applying for year one.
* I have no family or contact in Scotland
* I'd be working up to 20 hours a week on a passport
* I would see my family once a year. 

I'd be using UMaine as a launchpad for a better school the next year, but I've been interested in Scottish colleges since sophomore year of high school. I'm very interested in going to Scotland, but I don't know if it's the right decision to start there with Stirling, or to go to UMaine for my first year of college. I've never been home longer then a week, not out of trying, but of overprotecting parents. If you have any information about either college or the Scottish higher education system that would be helpful too. I just want advice on what one I should go to from someone who is not completely burnt on stress. Should I go overseas or stay near my hometown.

5,"I have reached out to a few local lawyers, but everyone is out since it's the Holiday and I am heated and need to vent. 

Here's the back story... 

First of all, I am female, in case that makes any difference. So my husband and I have had some issues lately and we have become pretty distance from each other (not that there is any excuse so judge away). But it all started when a friend of mine, outside of work asked me how my new job was going and I went on and on and about how much I loved it and told her my boss is pretty good looking too so that's not too shabby. From there is kind of just became a joke, ""hows your hot boss"" etc... This was all conversations that were had outside of the work place. I never made any comments, especially sexual ones about him at work or especially too him. We were actually kinda of friends, and had all hangout, and drank outside of work. He even invited my husband to play poker, and I was casually friends with his girlfriend. It was a harmless ""attraction"" if you will. 

One of my coworkers knew my husband and I were having issues, and told me she randomly has a dream one night that I told her I had feelings for my boss and he said the same thing and we were running off to get married. I laughed because I knew i found him attractive, (and other girls int he work place did as well). But I didn't say anything about it. We then told ANOTHER coworker about the dream, and we believe someone overheard and told my boss about it. But nothing was ever said to me about him knowing this. Work went on as usual and we even hung out as a group outside of work after that. 

Fast forward a few weeks... work is going fine, but my personal life is not. This past weekend my husband had been drinking and decided to search my FB messages and found a few comments between me and my friends about my boss being attractive. He blew it way out of proportion and accused me of having and affair. Which was absolute insanity!! I have never even been alone with my boss, let alone THINK about doing that. Huge fight obviously, but the next day he calms down and believes me that i did not have an affair. We are still fighting, but he knows nothing happen between me and boss. 

Monday (yesterday) I go on a morning walk with one of my coworkers (who is also my friend outside of work) and I am telling her this story as we are walking ""alone"" (or so i think we are alone) down the stairwell at work. I tell her my husband accused me of having an affair with my boss, and how ridiculous he was being, but he know its not true etc... 

Fast forward 2 hours... the owner of the company (its super small, only 18 employees, and really laid back) comes and asks to see me in his office. I walk in and his wife who doesn't work for the company, and another co-work who has nothing to do with any of this is sitting there... and the owner proceeds to tell me there has been some accusations made around the office and they have no choice but to let me go... I asked what the hell they are talking about, and they offer me no explanation. The wife pipes in and asks why I brought my personal life to work, and I asked if it was about my husband and I separating, I apologized, but a lot of us are also friends outside of work as well and friends talk about husbands and stuff. They still will not tell me what was said just that some ""comments were made"" I then look at the paper they are having me sign and it says ""handbook violation"" and that my boss ""fears for his safety.."" talk about blown way out of hand!! I said is this about what my husband said this weekend???? and all they said was ""they heard somethings... and in the world me live in, unfortunately Affairs can lead to violence"" I was like are you joking me!?!? No one had an affiar!!! Who said something... thats not the whole story!! etc.. i was an emotional mess at this point... my marriage is ending and now im getting fired form a job and company i love. Then the wife of the owner pipes in, ""your being fired for sexual harassment..."" EXCUSE ME WHAT!?!?! I never made a single sexual comment about him ever, especially at work!! They still wont tell me what all was said or who said it. I dont get to explain the story at all, and they escort me to my desk and then out of the building.. I then find out today my coworker who was also in the meeting and didn't say a word the entire time, goes back to his desk and tells my friend i was fired for sexual harassment, and who knows who else he told. I didnt get copies of any of the termination papers they had me sign as well. They told me it had nothing to do with my performance and I was a huge asset to the company so this came as a complete shock to them. 

Needless to say im still in shock this all went down, now I understand i should NOT have said anything about what my husband accused me of at work, I do take fault for that, but It was more about my husband just being ridiculous and not how I felt about my boss. No sexual comment of inappropriate things were EVER said too or about him, except to a few friends outside of work that he was attractive.

Several friends and family members say i definitely  have a wrongful termination case and to be accused of sexual harassment with no proof and no explanation is insanity. We also do not have internal HR so this entire thing was handled extremely unprofessional.

7,"A few of my colleagues and friends that I connect with always enjoy describing their ""first time"" sex relationships (not ""relationships"", they mainly talk about one-time deals... since they aren't looking for real relationships) and smoking marijuana. Then, every so often, they tend to ask if I have tried any of it (either sex or marijuana). I respond with the same statement as usual: ""I'm looking to get established and finish up my degree, then look for a serious relationship. As for marijuana, while it's legal in the state, I don't see the appeal of using it or any type of drugs."". They usually respond with ""Oh, hahaha... I see man.""

9,"There is a guy who recently got employed at my workplace. We instantly clicked with one another and we got close pretty quickly. 

He got my cellphone number and we text constantly. I am rarely the one who initiates the conversation, and he seems to always want to talk. He has switched his work shifts to line up with mine because he says he really enjoys working with me. He always jokes about hanging out and has casually invited me over to his house to swim, but I’m not sure how serious his invites have been. Every time we are around other coworkers, he zones in on me and seems to pay way more attention to me in any conversations with other people around. 

However, a few weeks after we started to become friends I found out that he has a girlfriend. And they have been dating for a few years at this point. 

After I realized that I felt kind of played, but maybe he is just being overly nice? He mentions her occasionally so I guess he isn’t keeping it a secret. Maybe I am reading way too much into this. 

I am wondering what I should do? He seems flirty and I don’t know how to go about this at this point. Obviously I would never try to break him up with his girlfriend, but I feel like I am getting mixed signals. I also feel that I am falling for him more, and I don’t know how to prevent this from happening. We work together a lot and I don’t want to make anything awkward. ",04Jul2018,1

I then say ""it was a joke!!!!!"" and then kinda laughs at it and then i call him out on deleting the photo and apologizing for offending him, but he says all good.

i don't know what i did wrong but it's not all good because he deleted the photo and was mad. i don't know what to do to correct the situation, i meant it as purely a joke and given our history, i thought he would feel the same. he's always transparent, but lately. i feel as if he is not being entirely truthful because obviously he is hurt, so i don't understand why he wouldn't admit that what i said bothered him?",04Jul2018,0

15,"If you don't want to read the backstory skip to the bottom to read what all this led up to. I am a 13 year old girl. I live with my 11 year old sister my 19 year sister and my mom and dad. When my older sister does not cook ,most nights she does because she is the only adult in the house that does not work, the three of us do dishes. Tonight was one of those nights which meant and argument between my older and younger sister. Lets call my older sister Melissa and my younger sister Julia. Julia and Melissa already started off rough mainly because Melissa is overly hard on her but everything was moving good. I had an extremely good day with Julia so we were messing around and having fun. All of the sudden Melissa turns to Julia and tells her to stay focused. A lot of times Melissa uses an aggressive and condescending tone and she used it while saying this. Julia told her it was uncalled for and Melissa made a remark about how stupid Julia said saying that. (not that exactly but explaining that is very complicated and the remark's purpose was to call Julia stupid.) Anyway, I stood up for Julia because I listen to these fights every night and most times I'm on Melissa's side and I talk to Julia afterwards to have her apologize and understand she was wrong but tonight Julia did nothing wrong. Melissa and I were in a heated argument she raised her arms like she was gonna punch me so i grabbed her wrists which caused her to accuse me of laying my hands on her and starting a physical fight. That really made me angry and I started yelling at Melissa, now our parents were in the kitchen with her. I tried to tell her that the way she says things and the things she says are unnecessary but she wouldn't listen and instead used my age as a way to prove she was right. After all this she told me if mom and dad weren't there she would have beat the crap out of me. Here's my big problem. A lot of times I'm left with my sisters when my parents are at work. My sister is gonna go to a community college and live at home. I feel scared to live at home with her after this threat but I'm afraid my parents will say something to her if I voice my concerns getting me into more trouble.

She says that her school-work has overwhelmed her and that she hasn't been having free time to talk. But she's only in highschool... doing music on the side. And when she does speak to me once every week or so, her messages are short and closed-ended, sometimes not even answering a question I've sent or acknowledging something I've said in the meantime.

I try to believe the best of people, especially people I care about. So, at first I didn't think anything of it... But when she didn't just miraculously connect more during her *holidays* \-- it started to make me wonder... And even regardless, I can't fathom how school-work prevents you having a single minute in a week's time to drop someone a line.

Part of me wants to think that maybe she just doesn't want to talk anymore for some reason... Maybe she just grew out of me, and doesn't want to say it. But on the other hand, she *has* voluntarily messaged *me* on occasion, and I feel like maybe I'm just being paranoid.

23,"Hey y’all, need some support or advice. I recently came to Nebraska for an internship on a farm, i love farming and intend on being one, from North Carolina. Everything i know and everyone i know is back in NC but my family (grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.) are in Nebraska and the internship is on a farm my uncle works for. Well i hated college and was depressed there so i unrolled and asked my boss if i could stay past summer for harvest, he said yes. So i have a job here until about December or September i believe. Work is something i love and look forward to everyday. 

I don’t have a girlfriend or anything back home except my parents and sisters whom i love dearly. I want to stay in Nebraska for a few years, working with this farm if they allow me or on another farm or as a truck driver, I’m not sure yet. I’m scared for the future in that regard. I’m a good worker and now i can find work but i love it so much on this farm i don’t want to leave after harvest. 

The problem I’m having is that i don’t anyone outside my family here. My cousins my age are married or in serious relationships and work full time jobs so it’s hard to find time between their and my schedules to hangout. I have no friends up here, i get lonely a lot and I’m not like a social outcast or rely on friends to survive but i would like find a girlfriend or maybe some friends outside of family and work to hang out with every now and then. I work 6 days a week, prolly 10-14 hours a day except Saturday which is usually about 4 hours depending on the day. 

I’m anxious for my future and if my decision to leave college to stay up here was premature and how am i suppose to find people outside of work and family to hangout with? Like there are nothing but small towns and not a lot kids my age here and less places i could think of to go to find friends. Any advice? Or support would be nice to. ",04Jul2018,1
24,"I am a 24 year old Entrepreneur from the Netherlands. Last year, after returning from a work placement abroad, I started my own business. In hindsight this probably wasn't the most clever decision in my life, as the starting conditions weren't quite ideal. A little elaboration; I moved back to the Netherlands without funds and a source of new income and crashed on the couch of a friend.

As is logical in this situation my finances were direly low for a long time, but after eight months of hard work I finally did it, I now had a (albeit temporary) place to live, a bit of money on the bank and loads of new projects that were promising good payment waiting for me. 

During these eight months I had been gradually getting more and more stressed, and less and less productive, but I kept telling myself to hold on tight and keep going at it. I knew (or at least thought I did) that the stress would go away as soon as I had my finances in order. During this time my girlfriend had been struggling with school and depression, which is why I spent the rest of my able mind in trying to support her and get her to search professional help.

As I thought, as soon as the financial stress was resolved, the major source of stress was gone and I felt relieved. I truly thought this was the point in time where I could pick everything that I had been letting go over the past months back up, that I could start investing time and energy in marketing and getting the rest of my new business in order, instead of holding on to the half-assed somewhat working website etc. 

As you can probably guess; this didn't happen. After enjoying the first day of bliss I started trying to get back to old productivity numbers, but found out that I couldn't anymore. I couldn't even get myself to walk a few minutes to the supermarket to get some breakfast supplies, so I missed loads of meals. Looking back from that point I realised that I wasn't just experiencing stress and my standard ADHD symptoms, but that it had been gradually escalating to a point where I could barely function. I'm talking about losing a tool I had just put down about 5 times an hour, blindly staring at projects and genuinely not knowing what to do, even though I had done it hundreds of times before, not being able to get myself to my workbench, feeling immense resistance whenever I had an business or leisure appointment, and so much more. 

After two days of that I started worrying that there was more at play **cue sleeping problems**. It was at this point I realised I should do some research. Found loads of articles on Burn-out and felt like this could be what I'm experiencing. It was here that I started my ""road to recovery"" I cut alcohol, drugs and cafeïne  out of my life, tried to start exercising to make sure I could sleep at night, but nothing helped.

I started by acknowledging that there was a problem and tried to do something about it. I started to talk to my friends and family about what I'd been experiencing. This cleared my mind a bit, but not a lot of new insights came my way. I started feeling good about acknowledging what was at play, but felt there was more needed. Accepting that I wasn't going to overcome this by myself I contacted my local GP, who turned out to be conpletely unable to understand my story. I got a sort of mental health survey to fill in at home and make a new appointment. The new appointment was with different GP who thankfully was very lovely and understood what was happening. She told me that it was a miracle that I hadn't turned completely crazy yet as I had been sleeping between 0 and 3 hours every night. She told me we couldn't work on this in my current state, so prescribed me some sleep medication to use for a week, so we could then move on from a little bit of a better starting point.  

One week later, I still hadn't slept more despite the heavy sleep medication, it helped sleeping in for a bit, but didn't prevent me from waking up after a few hours, only to feel way drowsy and not being able to sleep.  Felt like I was at a sort of breaking point multiple times since financially stable. Work productivity was down to barely nothing and I started to worry about drifting back into that financial hellhole, not at all aiding my sleep. The GP agreed I needed some form of professional help and gave me a referral for a Psychologist. 

A few weeks passed until I was allowed to come in for an intake, during those weeks I kept visiting my GP and got around to sleeping a little bit better, between 2 to 6 hours each night, knowing that professional help was on the way.

Fast forward to the first meeting, which was extremely wierd. After talking for about 20 minutes a colleague of my psychologist came in and made me give a summary of what we had discussed, and then listened along. He was there to help the guy decide what to label my problems  for the insurance company. After I told my story, my therapist stated that he didn't think it was a Burn-out, the guy thought it was and they started to discuss why it would or wouldn't be Infront of me, the client. This felt very unprofessional, I also told them that I didn't  really care what it was,, as long as we could find a solution to my problems . My therapist stated that he didn't think it was consistent with being under a lot of stress and going over my limits for a long time, while I obviously stated that I did go through a hell of a time. The other guy agreed with me, and they went with Burn-out anyway. 
Since then I have had two more appointments, and both have been really unproductive. I have been yapping about my week, and he adressed  nothing but stuff I already knew. In addition to that we always go in overtime. I addressed these frustrations to him and he shipped the first point off with some excuse that ""some people like it when they have that talk in front of the client""  for the second point he is going to talk to his colleagues do discuss whether I psychiatric evaluation would be in place. On the third point I asked him if we could book double slots instead. He looked at me with big eyes and asked ""why?"" I told him it was because we haven't really been getting anywhere, and were constantly 15 to 30 minutes over time. And that I found it weird that he didn't understand that, while we were again 30 minutes overtime, way in the next clients timeframe.

I *have* made some breakthroughs in talks with friends during the week, or after breaking down crying twice in two weeks while with my girlfriend, and talking after. This is kind of new to me too, because in the past 5 years I have only cried when a family member died, never in other situations, because I just can't get myself to do so. Not because I'm afraid of crying or whatever, but it just won't happen. Another big breakthrough was while talking with my girlfriend's therapist, who told me that while my work efficiency might me at let's say 5%, I'd been spending the other 95% trying to get out of this whole Burn-out situation, probably still going way over my limits, but then in my head. 

The problem at the moment is that I don't really have a feeling that I'm getting anywhere with my psychologist, and waiting a week after every appointment really tears me down, knowing that I'm falling further and further back in to the financial hell I had just climbed out of. Besides that I'm not leaving the therapist's office with new insights for myself either. A big problem of being an entrepreneur is that I can't afford to stand still, yet that probably somehow is what I need right now.

25,"Basically, last year I went to camp for 3 weeks and I didn't really like it that much. this year, I applied for a different course for 6 weeks, but they gave me a 6 week version of the course I took last year. it wasn't really my thing, and it was a really hard 3 weeks. I'm 15 if that helps. 

Camp:

Pros - gives me something to do in the summer, I'll meet a good amount of new people, and I'll get paid. It will also be a personality building experience for me. 

Cons - I didn't really enjoy it last year, 6 weeks is a long time away from home, and I'm not sure if I want to commit to something with no turning back like that.

Home:

Pros - I get to see the friends I already have, I get to party and enjoy my summer, and have a good about of freedom.

Cons - I have no source of income, it would be a very boring summer.

I'm in a predicament right now, and I could use some of reddit's imput. Thanks. ",04Jul2018,1

28,"About a week ago, i started finding flying ants in my apartment. One or two at a time. Then it got a lot worse. I pulled out everything in my apartment, Scrubbed, vacuumed, and sprayed inspect repellent on every possible inch of this place. It seemed like it had slowed down but i was still seeing a few here and there. 

Maybe its obvious, but they seem attracted to light and water (i am occasionally finding them in my glass of water). On top of that, they seem to die off quickly. So today, while i was at work, i filled my sink with water and left the light on. When i came home, the sink was filled with 30-50 ants and the toilet even had another 10-15. I have resprayed again but they keep coming. 

I cannot locate a source and i have looked up quite a few articles suggesting to leave bait, but i am hesitant. I do not think it will work since they seem to come in, annoy me for a little bit and die off. I do not think that they will make it back to where ever they came from.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any tips? i am going insane.

31,"I met a girl in November and developed an unhealthy obsession with her. I never bothered her by messaging her repeatedly or anything like that, and she never found out I had an unhealthy obsession with her. When I say I ‘met her’, that was just it: We said maybe a few words to each other but that was it. We met a few more times at parties over the next 4 months but we still didn’t really talk. From the day that I met her (November 1st) to around mid February I had extreme trouble taking my mind off her. We didn’t talk at all outside of the few words we’d said to each other at parties, and by that I mean we didn’t even talk ONCE, but despite that I still couldn’t stop thinking about her. Then in mid February I starting talking to another girl and she distracted me from the November girl quite well, but I stopped talking to her a little under a month ago, and over the last week I’ve seen the November girl twice at parties and spoke to her for a little bit (still not much though) so now again I find myself unable to stop thinking of her.

She claims she's over her and that it's fine. That was the last thing said. Everyone in the chat is already shy and akward and it even took me alot of nerves to ask if they were free, so now I'm afraid to text the chat. To make matters worse, we were using DVDs that belonged to the girl who left so I don't know if we have anyway of watching the movies and again I'm too shy to ask.

38,"The last few weeks have taken a huge toll on my mental health, both for the good and bad. Recently, I've been getting over anxiety and agoraphobia off meds, without therapy, and had my friends there to support me. The situation is rough because without them, I probably would not have found the confidence to try to get out. They don't know or see that though. I was housebound for just under 4 years, June 2014 to the beginning of May 2018 when I had a tooth infection swelling the right side of my face. I went in, terrified of being out and not knowing what was gonna happen. It was a scary but when I got there I felt something I've never felt in a long time. The freedom of being away from my home.

I got a root canal a week later then that's where things turned south. I went into the dentist to get a full checkup and let's just say not being able to go to the dentist for 4 years caused a lot of problems. To put it in perspective, I've been going to the dentist weekly since May, not so bad although between the stress of just getting out again and not having that therapy as support it's been too much. It's made me isolate myself, it's made me angry that I let myself get that bad. The part the kills me is the bill of it all if I get the work I need done... 10k. (Thanks American health care system) I guess I've been feeling guilt over that and a lot of pressure of that, since that's my parents money and to be honest, sometimes I wonder if a funeral would cost less. Not that I have any need to follow those feelings but recently I've had those thoughts come to mind in detail. Even images of how.

-----Skip here if you want to read less/the beginning-----

I feel trapped, and don't know what to say or do at this point, but it doesn't help that I haven't been the best of friend through this. I've put both of my friends, who I care for a lot through hell trying to deal with me. I didn't mean to, but I still did and I feel terrible. They told me I can be too much, they told me to talk about my problems though and I did. Then everything with them went south. They are the people I would talk to when I need to talk, and I would try to talk to them when they needed to talk. I don't know what I'm supposed to tell them, I just know I did something wrong and it's been difficult to cope with. But maybe that's how they were feeling dealing with me, it's difficult to cope with dealing with me. Maybe I'm too focused on myself and not doing enough for them. Or maybe I'm doing too much for them by saying I need to back off or I need to go when I get into an episode of depressive thoughts since I know that's when the problems start. I know they said me saying I was going to leave at random times, me saying sorry too much, me trying to put the blame on myself has been the problem. Also, they told me I don't understand and get what they have gone through, and I do not since I haven't lived it, but I want to so I can do better.

I'm not mad at them, they have been through just as much as I have, worse than me if I can say. I'm just trying to talk to them, but they need space, and that's what I'm trying to do and respect that. Now they don't even want me to message them, it's like a big 180 has happened in our friendship. However I need to let them know I care and they don't see it, and I feel like I've let both my friends and myself down. They compared me to people in their past that abused them. I'm not that kind of person, I've met plenty of people and all of which have turned out well, this one apparently is different. It hurts though that maybe I've spoke too much that they are speaking and I don't feel like I can defend myself, like I'm exiled. Speaking with them the other night was difficult, everything I said was ""you're thinking wrong"" when I was literally repeating what they had told me 5 minutes ago. I don't want to just ""move on"" though, I want to make things right but maybe it's best I go. Maybe it's healthy for all of us for us to go our course. I just don't want to lose the people I love from me not loving myself. It also just hurts since just not even a week ago we were all talking playing games and staying up watching movies. And now it's just silence and they were saying they were left in the dark, well they got each other to talk to and I'm here left in the dark blinded.

I've already spent the last 48 hours reflecting, thinking of what I could do better, what I could of done better but I'm just scared. Looking at countless therapists since I've been wanting one since April of last year. I just haven't had the chance to since health insurance didn't cover it then. Should I just take this as I should let them go, or should I try to talk again when they are ready and they message me, if they even do at this point? We've all invested a lot of time into each other, I just know that they are together and I'm not there. I'm not good with this stuff and I want to do better. I could leave right now if I wanted, but I want to make the attempt. Or is it just best honestly to go since if they don't see how much I do care, there's nothing I can do thinking of it almost every minute of my day.

41,"Ill give some background information before I ask my question.

Just about a year ago, I began to develop feelings for a female co-worker of mine. We will call her M. Eventually it got to the point where I couldn't sleep at night because I was thinking about M. After about two weeks of this happening, I decided to straight up tell her that I liked her. I walked into a room with her and told her that I liked her, then it was silent for around 15 seconds and I walked out after that. I left no time for response or anything because I had never done something like that and I was in a state of panic the entire time. 

After that I hadn't talked to M for a few days until another co-worker of mine started to talk to me about what I did. We will call this other co-worker K. She began telling me that M had began telling everyone about what happened. K also told me that M was just leading me on for fun. I began to think M was a terrible person, but I still couldn't get her off my mind.

The next week at work I avoided M as much as I could and was rude to her anytime we had to converse. After a while, M texted me saying that we had to talk. I agreed and we had a conversation about how I was treating her. I explained to her why I was treating her so bad and she was very confused. She explained to me that everything K told me never happened. I still wasn't sure if I should believe M or not. I had asked my sister at the time, who knows both K and M, who I should believe. She told me that K is a massive liar who makes drama whenever she can. 

After my conversation with M, everything was normal. Me and M began talking more but nothing ever happened.

Fast-forward to now and I have still had M on my mind for an entire year. I have to work directly with her, but its getting emotionally so hard to do anything with her without thinking about trying to start a relationship. I genuinely cant sleep at night because of it and I just don't know what to do.

She keeps talking to me in ways that would lead me on to believe that she would like me. But I am too worried that I'm just over thinking things. She complains to me about how her parents are disappointed that she doesn't have a boyfriend yet. And she complains that she doesn't have a boyfriend yet.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Could anyone give any advice that would help?

When I got back home she started messaging me and we talked for a couple months. After a while she said she needs to go on vacation and was wondering if I would be down for that. I thought about it for a while and decided fuck it. So we decided to go on vacation together in May in Europe. (We both paid for ourselves)

We spent 2 weeks together in 1 hotel room and were basically together 24/7 and we got along great for the most part. At the beginning she told me she doesn't want a long distance relationship so she was being cautious about getting attached to each other. But as you might expect spending that much time with someone we got attached to each other. We were always together and we started holding hands then kissing then having sex and by the end of the vacation we were having sex twice a day and cuddling at night. After the vacation we have a conversation about ""what now"" and I tell her if she would ever move to Canada I would like to pursue a relationship and that I don't see myself moving to her country mainly because life is way easier and better here when compared to her country.

Anyway vacation ends in tears from both parties because we will miss each other. Fast forward a month now and we don't talk as much because we are both busy but I do miss her and I find talking to her makes me miss her more so I try to keep my distance. Now she's getting mad at me saying things like ""we were sleeping together last month now we barely talk.""

Now my question is what should I do? I am doing well financially and I have free time during the winter so I could go and visit her but she doesn't want to even think about relocating here but she doesn't want to lose contact with me.

I can’t live the rest of my life without at least trying to fix this. I feel like since a little time has passed he may hear me out now.

Here are the only things I have come up with to try to reach out.

- My main idea which I haven’t thought through fully on how/where I would talk to him once I’m there is to drive there and try in person. He lives 6hrs away from me. If he won’t hear me out I would just leave I’m not forcing anything on anyone. 

- I’ve thought about just emailing him but I doubt he would reply and possibly not even read it. He has a huge problem with seeing people as people or showing empathy over the internet, games etc; 

- I could try to call but it has the same issues as emailing him does. For him to even take it I’d have to try calling from another number? Or calling once everyday like a bill collector until his curiosity peaked but I don’t really like that idea either because once he hears it’s me who’s been calling he’s likely to hang up. I don’t know if he’d take a call from me. Maybe? If I some how lucked out and he was curious.

- I feel like if I wrote him a real paper letter he would be more inclined to read and write back, without him having that lack of empathy issue happen. But I don’t know if he would and I’m trying to come up with something I can try that’s full proof since I only have one last shot really to fix this.

Tl:dr tldr I’m looking for ideas and options to reach out to the most important person in my life that I haven’t thought of or building onto the ideas I listed above that I’ve already thought of.

57,"I find that I like reading and contributing to the advice boards, but I am a bit perplexed at how they operate. What I find stunning is just how supportive these communities are, I honestly did not expect that. I am also impressed with much of the people who give advice, often you find very thoughtful advice. I am troubled at how quick the threads often jump to a conclusion and then how loud the echo chamber becomes. On the plus side there isn’t a flood of flame wars, and honestly I think by the time someone posts her, the issue has generally gotten out of hand. So, there is some logic in people jumping to a conclusion. The problem, is the problem advice always has. You have limited amount of information from a single perspective. We all color things a bit when we go seeking advice, and so we mostly get validation. I think there is more value in playing devils advocate on here though than anywhere else. This is a perfect place to do so. When you go to a friend, and the try to challenge you to rethink your assumptions, it carries risk to the friendship. In this place we are most free to be the most honest. Few other places can you find such a perspective. Most of us, have plenty of places to IRL to find support. Though I think part of why people like coming on here is because it is supportive. 

I often find myself contributing more when challenging an OP’s view. I try to be respectful, but I wonder if it is in the end a valuable thing to contribute or if I should just stop peeing in everyone’s Cheerio’s.",04Jul2018,2
58,I have never attended a friend's wedding before. I have a floor length black dress that I've been wanting to wear but not sure if allowed and I thought this would be a nice occasion to wear.

The invitation doesn't state formality but we were invited for daytime church ceremony and evening reception.,04Jul2018,1
59,"I made speedies with my social worker, but I'm too depressed to eat any. They took me to the mall, but I was just thinking about the thing that I'm depressed about the entire time. That someone is slandering me and their friends are stalking everything I do when I just want to move on.

my mom is making popcorn and she asked if I liked eating the food I made and I lied and said yes, but in reality I didn't eat any of it cuz I'm too depressed to eat food.

I was always depressed and used to slam the dinner plate on my head, telling my mom that I don't deserve to eat food and the dog would eat it up.

Then my friend for 15 years that makes everyone hate me and like him instead and he sexualizes them and hes a huge racist, said ""Remember your ex-girlfriend? She started talking to me and I told her that you drink beer on the weekend and to stay the hell away from you.""

I talked to her on Tumblr and everything she said meant a lot to me. She told ""If I met you someday, then I would totally be your sensei!"" and she's really cool.

Then I acted crazy and inappropriate when she was blocking me on twitter and I wasn't sure why. And I left her alone for a year and two months, ever since she finally told me how she feels.

But I found out recently that she has screenshots of private messages that I sent to her, on her public twitter. I vented about it on reddit, without saying who she is, and she wrote about it on twitter within twenty minutes, and her girlfriend messaged me telling me that they're both crying and to take down my reddit threads. I promised her that I wouldn't make another reddit thread about her and that I'll leave them alone forever.

I'm so sad. I wish she'd take down the tweets about me that have screenshots of private messages that I sent to her. And she said some stuff about me that isn't true. I deserve to have the tweets up about me, she's a really cool talented person that has similar interests to me.

I wish I could move on from all of this. I wish she'd delete her tweets about me. I'm too afraid to make games and make a kickstarter and stuff, cuz I'm worried it'll spread. Her girlfriend told me that she told her to leave the tweets about me up, so that everyone can see that I'm a horrible person. I messaged her girlfriend about it, asking her if her girlfriend could take down the tweets, but she told me that I'm the bad guy and a horrible person and that she wishes I was dead and to get it through my head that I'm a terrible person and the bad guy and that she wishes I was dead.

I keep thinking about this constantly and her girlfriend says she's saving every message I write, to a police report about me that they're both making about me, and I don't know who else to talk to about it.",04Jul2018,1
61,"I was a camp counsellor at 19 years old (am 20 now) and it honestly ruined all my self-esteem and is/has been a point of high anxiety for me. From the very beginning in training, we did a personality test and I was put into the scientific/analytic category (which I agree with- although I almost tied with the emotional/nurturing category) with only one other counsellor- and we were compared to characters such as House, Sherlock, etc. At that point I already felt like I was being put down and seen in others eyes as a sociopath or something similar. 

Although the kids loved me and I had some really strong and rewarding memories at camp,  I think I was only counsellor to only win one counsellor award and felt like I did a good job being a counsellor but failed at being the combination of a fully responsible, fun, and stern counsellor all at the same time. I am a calm person and every day was a struggle for me- I would be physically and mentally exhausted dealing with so many children and being full of energy and still not meeting my boss' expectations (comparing myself to the other counsellors). 

It all ended very badly and I felt like a complete failure when I got really sick (being tested for pneumonia, couldn't talk loudly, lots of coughs) at the end and my boss told me she was dissapointed that I left the team like that (I do understand its hard to replace a counsellor for the whole week). Many of the kids had personal issues they were dealing with and although there were many highschool and university students like me who could handle it well, I had no idea if I was doing the right thing and as I had never personally gone to a summer camp before (specially outdoors)- felt ruined.

Now, I feel like I can't take risks with new jobs and something like this will happen to me again- I always have highs and lows of not feeling confident in my social skills even though I know on the outside I am very social/ easy to talk to. I learned a lot about leadership and although I want to do it again to prove myself I can do better- is it okay to accept that this is something I won't be good at and just focus on my other strengths and my career path in research?

72,"There’s this girl I’ve been friends with for a long time. I’ve loved her since we were 4th graders. I’ve known her since we were in first grade. So she’s been my friend for a long time. Back in August she moved to a city about an hour away from where I live. I was devastated and I became depressed for a while. I’m fine now though. I wanted to keep trying to win her over, but it just hasn’t been working out in my favor so far. I haven’t seen her often at all. I last saw her in the middle of May. During the entire school year I saw her just a few times, and there was a 6 month period that I didn’t see her at all, which ended in May, the last time I saw her. I’m sure that I’m going to see her this summer, but I’m starting to think this isn’t going to work out. I barely see her and even on the occasions I have for the past year or so, I haven’t even gotten to spend the entire time with her. It just doesn’t seem realistic anymore. 

I don’t feel like I have any more energy left to keep trying to win her over. I’ve been trying since we were FOURTH GRADERS. I am nearly 14 years old right now, and I have loved her since I was a 9 year old. I just don’t think i have much of a chance anymore. I never get to talk to her. And now I’m beginning to wonder if she even thinks of me as a friend anymore. During the 6 month period I didn’t see her, she didn’t ask to see me ONCE. WERE YOU SERIOUSLY THAT BUSY FOR THE ENTIRE FUCKING 6 MONTHS THAT YOU COULDN’T AT LEAST MAKE AN EFFORT TO SEE ME?!! The reason I didn’t ask myself is because I didn’t want to come off as creepy. I don’t know if I can keep going on this journey much longer. I’ve loved her for a long time. The conversations we’ve had, the laughs we shared, the fun activities we did. I’m a bit frustrated with her parents for deciding to move. I just don’t get why they needed to move. You already had a big house with a fucking huge backyard, and yet you sacrifice our friendship JUST TO GET A HOUSE NOT MUCH BETTER THAN YOUR OLD ONE. Was there not a good enough house IN THE AREA?!!!!!! IN THE ENTIRE CITY OF RIVERSIDE WAS THERE NOT A HOUSE GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU TO LIVE IN?!!! AND NOW OUR FRIENDSHIP IS SLOWLY GOING DOWN THE TOILET. I don’t want to lose one of my best friends, but I’m scared to death that it might happen. I’m just so sick and tired of just sitting and hoping to see her, and end up waiting months.

She's pretty goddamn amazing. We hung out a lot during the class and I feel like we've hit it off really well. I know for a fact that she at least enjoys my company (laughs at my jokes, is interested in my thoughts, often brings up things I've said that even I nearly forgot about, etc).

So I figured, hey why not ask her out to lunch? I called her yesterday at around 5:00pm and asked if she was available. She sounded like she wanted to do it and gave me some dates of when she was busy and one day where she MIGHT be free...which is tomorrow. She said she would call or text me when she was sure if she could make it to lunch that day.

She has yet to contact me.

I don't want to be annoying and be like ""hey you still down?"" because she does have a busy schedule but I also really don't wanna fuck this up and make her think I'm not interested or something.

I found about open interviews with a place I've Always wanted to work at, when doing interviews i made it very clear that i would ne taking a trip to germany for a few weeks and also i need flexibility, they were very good with matching what i wanted and said they were pretty flexible too. Only thing was they allow 14 day vacations unlesss you worked for a year you'd get personal leave. So i was told they'd put me on ""termination with getting job back after the trip"" basically put my job in the air and give it back if i wanted it back. So now thats done on to the other stuff.

Specifically, I think i am an irredeemably awful person. My isolationist streak, plus the age gap between me and my peers, has caused me to have a hard time connecting with people. My only close friend was a girl who we'll call Emily, a girl i go to school with who is also my age. Shes a theater person, im visual artist so we both left high school early. She is much better with people than me, and has a very large net of people, but we where still very close. We where/are each others emotional rocks. I dont think it really matters, but we were sleeping together, but out of mutual hornyness. It was not romantic in any way, on either of our ends, but it would feel like i was leaving out a important detail if i didnt bring it up. Either way, she is currently working at an acting company out of town over the summer. This meant we stopped the more parasitical aspects of our relationship where we would bounce our depression off of each other. This acting job was a big deal to her, and that along with a much better support network than she has had in the past has caused her to be doing extremely well over the last month. This is obviously awesome, and even still makes me extremely happy. Anyway, we hadn't seen each other in a couple weeks because of how busy shes been, which is longest we've gone without seeing  each other in a long time. I got a text from her that the space has been extremely good for her mental health, and that she doesn't want to talk to me for a while until she gets over he ""issues with me."" I assume this means my self hatred and self defeating tendencies, but im not sure.

This basically destroyed my self worth. I am worried that I am someone you have in your life when you doing poorly, and when you get control over your depression, you move on. This has happened before with my best friend in high school. I dont want to be like this, I want to have a positive impact on my friends lives, and if im not i dont think I deserve them.

92,"How can I get family to help care for a 3 year old and two 1 month old twins. My husband goes out of town for weeks at a time. 

 A little backstory: my 3 year old also has a cousin the same age on my husbands side. This cousin has been showered with attention and looked after from my husbands family to the point that the parents don't even have to drop-off or pick-up this kid from daycare. These parents have also been known to leave their kid with family members for a few days while they take 'mini' vacations. 
My mother-in-law has done a lot of this childcare since she is retired. I wrongly assumed I would have family support when these twins were born. 

 I am not shy in letting family know I am desperate for any kind of help and that I am really struggling. My husband has also personally asked his mother to help me while he is out of town as I am having a rough time, even if its to take my 3 year old for the day. That my 3yr old's cousin has 8 people looking after her, why not help someone that really needs it, me. Turns out his request just stresses his mother out as she doesn't know if she has the time to help me while caring for my 3 year old's cousin.
I don't understand because my 3 year olds cousin's, mom and dad are normal white collar parents. It's not like they beat their child. I don't understand why this cousin needs so much caregiving. 

My mom works and helps as much as she can. Neighbours have offered to snuggle a baby, but honestly I don't need baby snuggles, I need babies fed, my child fed, entertained, laundry done, dishes washed. I've only met my neighbours once, so I'm not comfortable asking them to help me with extra tasks.

93,"I went unnoticed pretty much all through high school. I wasn't terribly dorky, but I certainly was not considered remotely popular.

Two years out of college and I found myself at my happiest and most confident, working at a well-known fashion label in NYC. I had a great support system of friends and felt on top of the world. 

Recently, my dad got sick so I had to move back to the small town where I went to high school. I got a job at probably the most prominent company in the state, but unfortunately, with that came a lot of people from high school who never made it out, but still think they're the shit. 

I just had my first few weeks of work and it truly feels like nothing has changed. I've matured and gained a lot of confidence, but when I'm around all of these people that never noticed me and continue to not notice me in this new setting, I feel like my old self .

97,"So, I’ll make this quick: about a week ago my friend’s brother, who I also knew and hung out with killed himself at their shared house right as I was moving in. Today we both agreed I should go ahead and take his room and began clearing out some of the closets to give to his bro before I moved in and I found a huge mass of letters to his family which I know means it was definitely premeditated. I was pretty shocked to find this surprisingly, because we all assumed he did it in the moment but also intended to be saved at the last second. 
His brother left tonight to stay with his gf and although it’s late, I know he’s still up...
Should I call him now and tell him or wait? It almost feels wrong sitting here with the knowledge he has a letter waiting for him and not telling him directly. What do you guys think?",04Jul2018,2
98,"It's weird. After I go trought a very bad situation, a very bad one, I automatically start crying without actually feeling emotional pain. I just cry without explanation, and it's weird because in those moments my mind feels clear, I can think of possible solutions to the problem and I feel very rational while I cry with a deadpan face. But in the rest of the day the pain starts appearing slowly until after some hours I can finally feel it and ugly cry if I need to.

Is this normal? I know it sounds like a dumb question but aren't I supposed to feel first and then cry? Aren't I supposed to feel psychologycal pain in the same moment whatever happens, happens? Like it does with other emotions like fear or rage? Thank you!",04Jul2018,1

100,"There was a guy in college who I instantly connected with. We would stay up all night talking, watching movies, and just hanging out. I would say we developed a very close friendship, but for me it was way more than that. I developed very strong feelings of love for him, more than I have ever felt in my life. Of note, he was previously diagnosed with severe autism as a child but his parents denied it. You can tell by his mannerisms and behavior there is some social difficulty involved. I found it very endearing that he chose me to confide in. Even though I am a very social and seemingly confident person, I am riddled with insecurities. 

He said he didn't reciprocate, and has since moved on. I know there isn't any point in dragging the past, but I always wonder if any part of him wanted more than friendship. I don't know too many men who would invest that kind of vulnerability and time. I just want some way of getting closure for myself.

101,"I'm a 17 year old guy and this is an unusual issue I have and it is the only strange issue I've had. I shower twice a day and I've always been extremely hygienic. I use too cologne and I did not realize this until today. I could have Obsessive Compulsive disorder regarding my personal hygiene. I've never been 'obsessive' about anything else.

The cologne I wear is overpowering. So overpowering that people stand at a distance when they speak to me, and often avoid me as much as possible. I am not one to interrupt anyone's day, so when someone avoids me, I avoid them. I honestly did not realize this until a family member told me that ""Your cologne is beyond overpowering and I can't stand anywhere near you"".

Since I've realized, I honestly have no idea what people have thought of my overpowering cologne. I have stopped using so much cologne however I still use it. It's not as overpowering. I have a very weak sense of smell, so I can not smell it. And that's a major issue regarding my weak sense of smell.

104,"So a little bit of background: I grew up without too many friends, which really didn't bother me as a child because I didn't know any better. As I grew up and began understanding that I was socially isolated, I became lonely. I really began to make better friends when I was in high school and understood how great it was to have company. 

However, I occasionally experience these ""manic"" episodes around people (for a lack of a better term, sorry if this isn't correct.) I become extremely uncomfortably hyper, especially around new people. It becomes uncomfortable both to me and the people around me, and I am unable to stop. It is almost as if this other persona is taking over who is completely over-the-top when it comes to energy and speech. I tend to become crazy, and I come home feeling embarrassed. I tell myself before every interaction not to become hyperactive, but I can't stop myself

At work, around certain new acquaintances, and around my family, I can keep a calm demeanor. Around new people it becomes unbelievably difficult to control. As a side note, I am diagnosed with anxiety if that makes any difference. ",04Jul2018,1
105,"I got into a personal talk with my SO. I was telling them about some situations in my life that male family members had done to me ( female ) as a child. 
Now, before this conversation, I had never particularly thought over these situations. It hasn’t affected my relationship with these male family members, and I don’t believe that I have issues stemming from them. But, now that I have actually told someone, the only person to ever have known, I’m starting to actually consider whether or not these situations could be considered abuse or molestation. 
The first situation(s) occurred when I was 4/5 and the male was around 11/12. He had made me touch him before, but not like forcibly. More like “ you should do this “ and as a curious child, I did. There was never any blackmail or violence, and it was simply me touching his penis for maybe ten seconds. He exposed me to porn and we had found a vibrator in my parents closet. He asked me to use it, and I told him I wouldn’t in front of him, so I went to the bathroom and locked the door and turned it on for like thirty seconds probably. The biggest worrying instance was when I was laying on the couch and he asked me if he could have sex with me just to see what it felt like. I told him no, because in my infinite child wisdom, I thought I would get pregnant. He got upset and told me to go to my room, but came back in and apologized. That was my last instance with this particular male, and we are actually close now, this happened about 17 years ago. I never told anyone, except my SO today. 
The second male, I am not even sure this actually happened. In order to make this story make sense, I do have to state that this is my father.  
I slept in my parents bed probably up until I was 10/11, I had bad anxiety and my mother worked nights. I woke up in the middle of the night to a hand groping my breast. I do not know if this was a dream or maybe I was dreaming and started touching myself, or what. I remember grabbing the hand and pulling it away and I fell asleep immediately after. The next morning I asked my father if he had woken up at all, and he said no and didn’t particularly seemed worried or bothered. My relationship with him has always been kind of strange, he makes sex jokes a lot, never involving me though. At this point, he doesn’t make me uncomfortable anymore, but growing up when I was going through puberty, he did make me feel uncomfortable a lot as I felt like he stared at my developing boobs a little too much, and occasionally made strange comments about them. It never got to the point where I was constantly uncomfortable but it was enough that I hit a point where I had to ask him to stop. 
My SO said after I told him, that he had always kind of gotten those creeper vibes from these two people. This came as a surprise to me honestly, but now that I have told someone I’m reflecting back on it. 
Do these situations seem to be molestation or sexual abuse? That physical situation with my father is the only one, and the other male apologized a few years later about exposing me to porn and the things he had done previously. 
If this is molestation/abuse, I don’t really plan on doing anything about it since I’m close with both of them and don’t seem to have any lasting effects from them, but I’m just wondering. ",04Jul2018,1
106,"I’m a girl in my early 20’s and I’m a slave to my phone. I care about social media too much, and I frequently deactivate my accounts with the intention of keeping off my phone and keeping away from the fakeness of social media.

Everytime I deactivate, my friends and family stop contacting and replying to me and so I end up reactivating just so they remember my existence and accept my invitations to hang out. Once I reactivate, I’m suddenly back into the whole ordeal of comparing myself to others, caring about who likes my (completely irrelevant) selfies and crap and questioning my self worth. 

On the odd occasion that people do hang out with me when I’m ‘offline’, they’re all just on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook etc. and they seem like slaves to it so spending time with people isn’t a very good distraction. I struggle to find hobbies that I’m passionate about and I tend to rely on being social to keep myself occupied.

I’m aware of the effects of social media and what it’s doing to people, and I want nothing to do with it. Does anyone have any advice on how I can refrain from reactivating all my accounts? How did you stay off social media and what effects has it had on your life since quitting both positively and negatively?",04Jul2018,10

108,"Hey everyone! how do i start this? I've always been sort of non-confrontational and borderline doormat. I really did my best to follow all those mindfulness and kindness advice that self help media tout.

At some point I just got burnt out. I've just had it with putting up with all the bullshit and people overstepping on you while trying to smile your way through it.
I felt like I had to stand up for myself.

Recently I kicked out my cousin from our house. He has been staying with us instead of his own parents. I'll say straight out that he is problematic; that even his own parents are sick of him.

He was rude and entitled and we constantly had to compromise to him. I won't even try to enumerate *all* the bullshit we've put up with. The trigger point where I had to confront him was when he was yelling at us, for not feeding his new puppy the right food. A puppy that he barely spent time with and we were forced to take care of. I loved and took care of this puppy. The rest of the household was averse to dogs (allergies, trauma, phobia). Everyone had to compromise to him.

I didn't appreciate the yelling so I had to confront him with his bullshit. He decided to leave after and left a message how he hates us, he's the victim, and he's never coming back.. which I honestly felt relieved to hear since putting up with him for so long has been debilitating to my mental health.

Today, an employee of ours is crying. I overheard her on the phone talking about me, LOUDLY. She was saying how why I'm talking to her now even though she was blatantly ignoring me (*because it's her job?*). She's still begrudged that I told her off the other day for her rudeness. She walks out on me sometimes while i'm still talking.
After hearing that I got pissed, she's literally complaining why I was chatting her up, why i was trying to be civil and be harmonious. I'm so sick of passive aggressive behavior and I'm just done with that.

I told her after her phone call that if she didn't like me talking to her, then I won't, I was just trying to be nice, if she doesn't want nice, fine.

Now she's crying and wants to resign.

It's like in a span of weeks, i'm kicking off people away from me instead of trying to accept them for their flaws. I've just had it with putting up with behavior that i find harmful to my mental health.

I don't know now, if life has turned me into a bitch, or if I was just an awful person all along, or if i'm just surrounded by shitty people that i've been forced to put up with.

I do believe that I have to do these things for my own inner peace, but still I feel like a bad flawed person for doing so.

tl;dr: Kicking people who are problematic for me away and feeling like an insufferable bitch.",04Jul2018,3

But me, being the most stupid desperate person I was, I lost patience within a couple days and started dating some girl that I didn’t even like that much and eventually broke up with her after a couple months. I apologized to the girl who wasn’t ready to date, and she seemed all good but I could tell she lost trust... and then a couple months after we started talking again and it felt like she liked me again but then I was talking to her friend’s friend who told me that she only talked to me to CURVE ME  after leading me on and idk if it was true or not but I stopped talking to her after that because I felt so guilty that she is still upset... things are so awkward with her now and I’ve been trying to move on for almost a year now but I honestly can’t like I’ve never felt this way so strongly for someone ever in my life and because apparently she was just leading me on I lost so much confidence and I literally can’t talk to anyone new.

I write treatment plans, lead weekly teacher meetings and assist our school’s therapist in group therapy for foster parents. I also lead a class of 20 3-year-old children, many of which have severe emotional dysfunction. 
This job has become so bad for my mental health and not for the reasons one might think. 

I am working ten (sometimes twelve) hours a day in a high stress environment where I am being guilted into taking no lunch break for the sake of my understaffed workplace. This job is such a good step toward a better future but the owners are greedy... they understaff and don’t provide necessities for the workplace. Training is nonexistent so it’s left to veteran employees (like myself) to run a huge classroom while guiding new, inexperienced employees without any additional support. I’ve tried to bring this problem to light but my opinion seems to have no significance. 

I don’t do anything I love anymore... frankly I can’t even muster the emotional strength and desire to enjoy any time I spend with my SO... so my relationship is in shambles. I haven’t touched my guitar in months. I hardly work out anymore for lack of energy and I am a historically very outdoorsy and athletic person.

I want to add- I love children and I love what I do. I am looking forward to beginning my masters in social work beginning in August. I am afraid that if I keep working in this toxic environment that I will lose my love for the job that I do. I am so tired of feeling so angry and so sorry for myself all of the goddamned time.

The thing is, I don’t really like these friends that I play with. It’s kind of fucked up but it seems like they’re not gonna get far in life. They literally just play games ALL day and are super cynical about everything in general. They get home from their shitty dead-end job just to complain about it and not do anything to help towards their future and escape their current job. It’s so fucking infuriating too when they just talk down upon me whenever I do something good for myself. “Oh, I’m learning this and improving myself?” “Well that’s too fucking bad because you can’t ever be good at anything.” It really took away from my mental health and their toxicity of downplaying everything that I do has kind’ve gotten to me.

Anyway, my issue is, I'm afraid of asking her out because if I get turned down, then that will probably make the restaurant too uncomfortable to eat at, and I hate to idea of screwing my mom over like that.  And that's really my biggest issue, so if anybody has something to say that would help alot because it's kind of eating away at me.  Thanks!",04Jul2018,1
137,"First and foremost, thank you for reading this; I hope you have had a great day, and if you don't then I'm sure it will get better.   


Well, getting to the heart of the subject, my problem is the next; I'm being tortured by the idea of falling in love and finding someone that loves me with the same strenght. This doesn't sound bad from the get go, the problem is that I can't stop thinking about that, at all hours and in every moment and this has happened for many, many years. It makes me feel very bad, it makes me feel very lonely and unworth of being loved. Or even worst, I even ask myself if someone could even love me in a genuine way. Even though I know that those ideas don't contribute anything.   
   I try to love myself, I try to focus in the things I like. I think that I deserve love, but when those feelings starts blooming once in a while I can't appease them. It really hurts... and what is worst, I never read of someone with a similar case like mine on the internet or with any of my friends, that makes me feel even more alone.   
   That last statement requires clarifications, I say that I never read of similar experiences on the internet because I never had a girlfriend (by my own decision) even though opportunities I have had. The thing is, I despise relationships based of fear; fear of being alone or to meet the expectations of others. I have this idea of... well... twinflames, and I know many people considers it dangerous idea but I can't love someone who I don't feel that is my twinflame.   
   So... I wanted some peace in my mind and in my heart. What can I do for easy this pain? I definitely don't want to be in a relationship with anyone, that is a big no. If you could contribute something, I would thank you from the bottom of my heart. It could very well be your subjetive opinion on the matter, all is welcome.   


  
P.S: The fact that I believe in the twinflames doesn't mean that I think less of other types of relationships. Yes, I wouldn't have those types, but I still cherish them. They're beautiful as they are, it doesn't matter if it's for fear or superficial reasons; in a certain point of time two people (or more, I don't judge) loved each other, and for me, it is a light that survives the passage of time, the love may fade, but that love was there, eternaly static in that time.

139,"I live with my family of 2 parents, a younger brother, and an older sister. I’m 19F. 
I’ve been going out with my friends almost every day whether it be after work or on my off days, almost never home except to sleep most of the time. It’s becoming the end of summer and if i have the option to get out of the house, i’m going to take it. For example, I go kayaking, camping, go out to eat, over their houses and just hangout like a normal teenager. I smoke weed sometimes but not socially, just for my headaches. 
My friends are mostly male, just for the reason that I get along with them so easily. I do have female friends I go out with as well, just not as often. My dad doesn’t like me out every day, he wants me home sometimes to spend time with him or the family, but we do not do anything when I am home. It’s literally just sitting down and watching TV. I stayed out until 3am tonight and he was questioning my ability to be responsible and my ability to steer my life the right way. He said he doesn’t understand what I am doing with my life and why I go out so much. Mind you, I work 2 part time jobs which takes up most of my time, and i’m on my second year of college.
In the past i have made some very poor decisions when i was about 15-17 years old. I haven’t done anything since and have been very responsible. I know he worries about me, I understand that but I have my life to live. I’m young, i’m finding new interests it’s summer for fucks sake.
My mom on the other hand is in the middle. She worries for my safety too but she understands I’m just living my life, going out, meeting new people, picking up hobbies, finding myself. 
The point is, I don’t know if my dad has a good point. I want to move out and have the freedom I know i’m ready to have, but i don’t want to burn my bridges with them and spend my money on rent when i know i don’t have to. He says he doesn’t understand, maybe i can make him understand? 
Sorry this post is all over the place, i’ve never done this before!! If I could get your opinions on what I should do, or how others would feel about this situation, thank you !",04Jul2018,1

142,"I lived with my grandparents for my first years of life, as my parents were building our home. After it was built I still would visit my grandparents often and stay with them.

Excuse my fuzzy memory, it's a mix of what I know and what I was told by my parents. My grandparents would manipulate me by buying me gifts to stay with them, they convinced me my parents were abusive and that I should stay with them instead. They tried to convince me my father isn't my real father. They'd do small things like say (to child-me) that I can't tell my mother I went to the movies with my grandparents, or I'd be in trouble. I'd hold that stress in until I'd break down crying and ""admit my wrongdoing"" to my mother because holding it in hurt. (There is a lot more but I won't get into it)

I really believe that fucked me up mentally. It might be why my mind is messed up now with my depression and insomnia.

They also ignored and shunned my younger sister which put us in a rift for a lot of years.

These days my grandmother is senile and my grandfather has turned into a mean person due  to a stroke. He's harsh to my mother and it breaks her heart. They're nice to me, but overly so. My grandpa never stops hugging me and it makes me feel like a piece of shit to say that makes me uncomfortable. My grandmother whispers in my ear that they'll get cps to ""save me"" or make me live with them.

My mother won't let me visit them, but it's partially due to the fact I told her how awkward the visits are. 

Should I try to visit them more despite the bad memories and awkwardness? I think I awnsered my own question as I'm crying finishing this up.  It breaks my heart to consider them passing and I was too shitty to go visit them, but visiting them brings so much anxiety.

143,"I'm gay and my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me at the start of the year.The reason for breaking up to him was he only saw me as a friend at that point in time and he couldn't find solace in me.  It's been 5 months since our break up and I've tried everything to get back together, but all attempts failed. It was just difficult to one day wake up to the news that relationship is over, because on the day we broke up, we were fine until he popped the question. Despite that, I held on to the belief that we were both in love as he never fully stopped talking to me and would occasionally ask me out from time to time for lunch. Just recently, I found out from his friend that the actual reason we broke up is because he was struggling to accept his sexuality, his parents were conservative and starting to meddle with his personal relationships and setting him up for blind date with girls and arranging potential marriages (yes, we're Asians). He felt happy with the relationship we had (as much as we went through a lot of ups and downs), but decided to ""wake up"" from the ""fantasy"" that our relationship brought to him. He decided to cut me off his life now because he's immensely afraid of hurting me if things continue to drag on any further, and it hurts him to see me hurt. To make matters worse, his friend shared that he intends to move to another country after August or year end to seek better job opportunities elsewhere. Knowing him and what he used to say to me, I think it's perhaps a form of escape (maybe not). How can I salvage this in any way? Did anyone else go through a similar struggle? If there is truly no end to this, how can I make the best of our time together? ",04Jul2018,1

A year ago I started working in data analytics for a big retail company thanks to quite a lot of fortunate coincidences which saw me go from being an in-store customer rep to the position I currently have.

I love my job, but I'm really struggling to leave work at the office and actually have a life outside of it. 
When I do have the opportunity/time to do stuff I'm so tired from work (esp. on weeknights) that I usually not go or go for a little and leave super early.

147,"First off, I should probably start by saying that I am a girl. (I have a boyfriend that I have happily been with for almost 2 years)
I was staying at a vacation house with a couple of friends. One night we all got pretty drunk and I decided to go to sleep. Shortly after that, the guy I shared my room with (He has a girlfriend that he hasn't seen for a few weeks because she is studying abroad, so I suppose he was pretty on edge sexually) went to sleep as well. We talked for about half an hour and at one point I said that my heart was racing. (I suffer from occasional anxiety which leads to increased heart rate.) For some reason, he thought it would be ok for him to ""feel my heartbeat"" by slipping his hand under my shirt and basically grabbing my (obviously) braless boob. I immediately reacted by slapping his hand away. Now, I don't know if he did this by accident or if he thought that this is what I was playing at, but it was definitely inappropriate and uncalled for. 
The previous day he had also behaved a bit weird when we went to sleep. In his half-asleep state he cuddled up against me, resting his crotch-area against my thigh. I asked him what he was doing and he quickly rolled back to his side of the bed with the words ""I'm sorry, I thought [his girlfriend] was lying next to me haha"". 
When I confronted him about the boob-incident the next day, the conversation went as follows: 
Me:""What were you thinking last night?"" 
Him:""What do you mean?"" 
Me:""When you grabbed my boob.."" 
Him""Oh, sorry..""

I don't really know what to do at this point. I've already told my boyfriend and he's understandably furious. I doubt the right course of action would be to tell his girlfriend, but I'm extremely mad about his audacity to ask ""What do you mean"" after confronting him about the situation. It could have been a genuine alcohol-fueled (even though I would never consider alcohol an excuse) mistake, but he should at least be able to own up to it.

\-I feel like there's a huge barrier in my brain that's preventing me from really appreciating anything.

\-I often find myself not knowing what to say in situations, and whenever I'm typing something out I typically come to a point where I can't think of a certain word to fit whatever sentence I'm typing.

\-I also commonly find myself dozing out and forgetting to pay attention. This shit happens a lot to me. There's people that talk to me two feet away from my face and somehow most of the time my brain finds a way to stop paying attention midway through their words. 

\-I can't stop being anxious over dumb shit. I'm too scared of doing the wrong thing and whenever I do the smallest wrongdoing, all sorts of thoughts jump to my head about how it could ruin my life.

\-I've trapped myself in a cycle where I hit a very low point in my mood and then say ""fuck it, I have to get my shit together"" and then after deciding so I make a very minimal effort to do so and then after a couple of weeks it goes back to the same low point I was at before.

172,"I am currently 22 and working a one year full-time internship, a 2 hour per week part-time job, taking two night courses, and leading a volunteering club at school (that many students take for résumé booster, and takes 15-25 hours per week of my time). 

Unfortunately, I realized that after failing a course's midterm (mind you that this is my second time taking this course), I have had enough of failing. School is my number one priority because then I can pursue my professional designation, get myself and my family out of the financial circumstances we have, and keep pursuing my personal and career dreams. 

However, alumni members of the club would sell this club-- as the ticket to their full time careers, due to the connections they have made and skills learned starting or managing a business/project. Usually, members also leave during their graduation, and I technically still have 1-2 years left. 

Certainly, this club has taught me to start an entrepreneurial endeavor, how to maintain a project, and how to deal with stressed out students. Also the opportunity to make connections with students, professors, and professionals in my field, but I am also stressed out that it shows on my grades, and so at what cost? 

Frankly, as an individual that does get depressed and severely anxious (which is something I don't want to make an excuse out of), has been difficult managing emotionally, and mentally. 

I have to admit I joined this club and eventually lead it to gain confidence (still have low self-esteem), and assertive (absolutely not close to it). I also have doubts as, most of the time it appears that they have chosen me (Faculty managing the club) because they had little choice since our previous leader left this time around, and leading this club takes a lot of time and effort. 

I understand I will look like a major quitter, and be talked by them as someone who couldn't handle hardwork. But that's the reality of how I've been feeling the past couple of months. It's also not fair to the team when most of the time, their leader is focused on more significant priorities, such as my internship (so I'm not physically present), as well as my education.

That being said, how should I go about this? Should I still stay? Leave? If so, how? I'm so scared of the unknown, as I have honestly put time, effort, blood sweat tears into this club (it may sound stupid, but yes). The group of friends I've made the past almost 3 years, became my closest friends (though my boyfriend believes if they are my friends, they wouldn't leave that quickly or they were just my friends out of convenience). 

I'm afraid they'll hate me, can no longer be connected to them, and ask for any support. Please help. ",04Jul2018,1

174,"Hello Reddit,

this week i managed to reach the lowest and saddest point in my life.
For starters, i started my new Job, where i had to move away from my family for 6 months. Still, the salary of more than 2000 euro per month made me think its worth it.
So without any friends or family near me i eventually got bored and started Online-Gambling and made some losses and some wins. Once i got a big win, and ever since then i am hooked to it. Which lead me to play more and more and eventually losing a lot of money. Losing the money made me want to win it back, and the pressure is risong every day. Now i moved in with my fiancee 2 months ago and i already took 2 loans (3000+2000) plus i owe my grandma 1500 and approximately 5500 to my parents. Which is an insane amount. I habe time to give back to my grandma, but i pay 400 per month to my parents and 160 for the 2 loans named up there.
So now it's the beginning of july, i am 1000 in dept on my bank account( can't go higher). I already payed the 400 euro tp my parents, and i still have rent and all other expenses to pay. Which is like 300 € for gas ( only to get to work monthly).
And like 300 € for phone, internet and stuff, plus 200 euro for food etc.
Now i have money to pay travel expenses until mid of next week and thats it. I can't get to work or buy food or anything else.
I guess you can now understand why i am at the lowest point.
I need advice what i can do to get out of this situation.
I can't get any more loans(which isn't beneficial to get out anyways) and i am afraid to tell my parents/fiancee and absolutely ashamed that i got into this situation.
I know the only thing i can do is approach my parents and explain my addiction or whatever leads me to dumb decisions like it, but i don't know how to approach them.
Please help..
And advice for everyone out there...
NEVER start online gambling, it's highly addicting and you ALWAYS lose in the long run. Just take it from someone who got depressive in a very short time and can't think of any way out anymore...

185,"Alright, so I feel like my life as it revolves around my housing situation, needs to be on the Jerry Springer show or something recently. 

I currently rent a tiny side of a duplex that I used to live in with an ex-gf. Her uncle owns the place, but has recently decided to sell it....most likely to my ex-gf. So I would leave, she would move BACK into this side of the duplex, and keep the other tenant in the other side (he's been there 30 years). So soon, I will lose out on my cheap rent deal. 

&amp;nbsp;

Knowing this, I recently reached out to a friend who I lived with in college. His landlord was also preparing to sell his house, so we both needed a place to live. We considered both renting and one of us buying and renting to the other, and settled on the idea that I would purchase a home and rent a room to him. 

So 2 months ago, I got my pre-approval and entered the housing market, looking at places that I liked but also considering his needs. I've looked at a ton of homes and put offers on 2 of them.  I lost both bids. So, realizing it might take me a little while to lock something down and close, I reached out to him yesterday to see what his landlords timeframe is for selling so I could make sure my buddy wasn't going to end up homeless waiting on me to close on a house. 

Come to find out, his landlord decided not to sell AND he's now in discussions with a company in a different state for a job and is unwilling to commit to renting a room. These things in and of themselves are reasonable, but the fact that he FUCKING DIDN'T TELL ME AS I WAS BIDDING ON HOUSES sent me through the roof. I had even been sending him info on the places I was bidding on, and not once did he mentioned ""O hey, yeah, I know I agreed to rent from you if the house fit my needs, but I'm not going to do that anymore"". So I almost went under contract for houses that I couldn't afford without renting a room, and he didn't say a fucking word about it. I still wouldn't even know if I hadn't asked....

So this leaves me with a dilemma. Regarding my housing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here are my options as I see it. 

1. Continue house search. Buy, and then rent a bedroom to a stranger for income. 

2. Try to find a stranger to commit to renting a house with me. 

That's pretty much it. 

I cannot afford to live in a single-bedroom because they are $850+ rent here and I make $45k/year and have student loans. The only way I could live alone would be to rent a super shitty apartment in a very sketchy neighborhood for like $600, but even then, I'd likely have to pay pet rent for my dog, plus $100+/month for a storage unit for my tools/bike/workshop equipment/etc so it's still not really a good option. 

&amp;nbsp;

Option 1: The way I see it, this still might be the most attractive (albeit shitty) option. If I buy, I get control over the house, it's easier to find (dear lord, finding rentals that aren't multi-unit apartments here is a near impossibility), I'll be building equity, the place will be much nicer for equivalent costs, and if I buy a 3 bed, I always have the option to fall back on renting both rooms if times get tough, which could more than cover the mortgage.

The downside is that I'm taking all the risk for renter damage, all the responsibility for finding/vetting/etc renters(although I'd still have to do this to find someone to rent with), they would be alone with my dog at times, and obviously I'm responsibility for maintenance and repairs (not a huge deal, I'm handy, but there's still financial risk there). If I had to sell the house for any reason, having a renter in it (unless they're willing to jointly void the lease) would make it hard to sell. 

&amp;nbsp;

Option 2: This doesn't seem like nearly as attractive option, but it does remove some risk for me. 

The biggest pro here is that if there are issues with the other tenant (damages mostly) it's the landlords problem and not mine (sort of, there's usually joint liability in leases so there's still risk). I would also not be responsible for any repairs or maintenance. 

The downsides are, 1. It's very hard to find nice houses to rent (most landlords only put a sign in the yard and that gets them more than enough potential tenants). 2. I need to find someone to room with FIRST and shop for a place SECOND, which means we have to agree on location, price, amenities, etc. (If I own the house, tenants self-select for most of this without my effort). 3. If the person agrees to rent with me, then backs out, I'm homeless. If I buy and they back out, I just have to cover the mortgage by myself until another tenant comes along (hard but doable short term). 

What do you guys think?

188,"I won't state any names but she is female and I'm male. We both suffer from Mental Health Issues mainly depression and I suffer from anxiety too. So throughout getting to know her I built up a trust in her and cared for her when she was down like a friend would she would always state that I'm one of her best friends. So up until recently she had a boyfriend in which I respected, I think. I threw compliments her way but they weren't over the top. like if I shown a picture of her you would find it hard no to compliment her. She would help me a lot with my mental health, infact she was the person who saved my life. told me not to do it and to see a therapist. At that point I knew someone cared for me. I'm seeing a therapist now. But that's nothing to do with the story anyway, we had a good friendship recently like I felt like I was doing everything right, made her laugh. didn't make her annoyed and was always there for her. Okay, I understand this might be hard to follow anyway. She has 2 other friends she introduced me to one Australian, who she considers her best friend.

193,"ok, thank you to whoever took the time to read the long post and give me an advice. In summary, i befriended a person she betrayed me and the aftermath of that is my life flipping out on me, i don't want to come out as a whinny person but they say that words cut deeper then knives. when i was young i did get physically abused but now its the verbal which effect sticks longer than a bruise.

# The Problem:

I really don't know what to do, i have two more years till graduation, im afraid the more im being at home that the abusive words would get to me and i won't be able to function probably, im getting blamed for every problem that happens in the house every bad thing that occur is in one way or another is my fault.

# Further explanation

an ex-friend of mine sent an offensive voice note to my mother, who is a strict person to no end, and she flipped on me treating my like a trash verbally abusive to no end. I have talked to her told her my side of the story but she choose to believe a voice note not even along with any evidence. Im at a dilemma because the fact that my mother who never trusted anyone choose to believe a person like my ex-friend knowing that her daughter is an open book everything in my life says that im the opposite of what that voice note stated. Since the death of my father i have been  dependable on my mother financial support and in this country its hard to get a part time to help me get dependent on my self. Hence i have been shutting my mouth and getting that abuse without answering her just because i want to finish my study, but lately i have been noticing how her words are starting to affect me. i have noticed it in my internship interview how the interviewer was telling me to actually express my own thoughts on a matter but i was actually afraid to do so, even though in my previous interview it didnt happen before. *im starting to lose my own person, im believing every word she is saying about me. i know im not so bad as a human but the more im getting her verbal abuse on the daily the more im starting to believe im worthless, failure, ugly and do not deserve what i have..... All because i met a person &gt;&gt; became friends&gt;&gt; got betrayed by them*

# Background info:

So since young my family kept me and my siblings pretty sheltered, basically at 15 years old my peers started to understand a bit how the society works, common rules like not everyone is good, not everyone is bad. my point is they got to start learning how to tell the difference.

i got to meet two friends and we stayed friends after, i mean why would i. That was until i moved across the world and found myself on my own no friends no relatives nothing. i made some good friends along the way, but that was until one person slipped and become more than just a best friend.

# When it all begun...

so this person become my roommate eventually and our bond got stronger she had issues with her life that made me wanna help as much as i could've, and i did. After a while she begun to be distant from me, i tried to work on our friendship but i got tired after the many times she clearly stated she didn't give a shit, i mean the girl did try to commit a suicide so i didn't wanna give up on her just because she tries to push people away with hurtful words. Eventually, me myself started to feel like i was falling for depression and started to steer away from her fearing my condition would be negative for her.... for a while stuff went good but because a minor issue concerned a small amount of money she went ahead and sent ***A VOICE NOTE***  to my mother who is very strict about me being a whore and drug addict and an alcoholic, which was everything she was doing ( to be honest i didnt once call her a whore but i didnt care if she moved from one guy to another in less than a week) and that led to my problem.",04Jul2018,1

196,"So a bit of back story - I moved interstate two years ago away from home to experience new things/study and most importantly get away from my home life. Even as a teenager I’ve never been happy at home (I don’t get along well with my siblings and my mother is an alcoholic)

Due to financial situations and my sister getting married I moved back home this February in hope I could save money to do my first trip over seas. 

The problem is I’m now as depressed as I was before I moved out, I’ve gained a bunch of weight, I’m constantly out of the house to avoid being home so I don’t end up saving as much money and don’t work on my hobbies and I’m struggling to watch my mother ruin herself. 

But the thing is if I move out I probably won’t be able to afford the trip I wanted and will have to worry about a sublet or covering my rent while I’m gone.

199,"Okay, for reasons I do not care to explain that would never be acceptable in the eyes of my partner's parents, we want to have one child via artificial insemination. We can't seem to come up with an excuse that their parents would buy into. 

We have thought of using fertility issues as an excuse, but we plan to have one blood child (as in both of us are genetically related to the child) first so that throws that one out. We also plan to have more blood children after the artificial inseminated child too. 

We also have come up with the idea of pretending that a couple or a friend asked us to do this so they could have a child, but then they bail. We've had a couple different scenarios of that, but overall I think that would be too complicated, and I wouldn't want the child thinking I know their mysterious parent that ditched. Sexual/fertility issues are more likely to not be something the child cares to know, while making it still possible to be honest that they are artificially inseminated.

I honestly just can't think of a good enough excuse that would allow us to do this without the drama. I don't want any comments telling us not to do it or whatever.

200,"I don’t know if this is the right place to put this, if not, I apologise.

What I’m hoping for is for you guys to give me advice on what I should do and if you think what I’m suspecting is correct.

Background:

Had a group of friends who I hang out
with and play Xbox with everyday. (We know eachother in real life and hang out in real life too). I have an amazing girlfriend of 7 years and one of my friends... let’s call him “S”.

S has a girlfriend too, been with him 2 years. Me and S’s girlfriend talk every so often, she speaks to me more then anyone else in our little group.

Problem:

I think she’s into me.

Reasons why I think she’s into me:

- She messaged me the other day saying, “S fancies you” and I replied with, “S isn’t you” jokingly, and she replied with “dayummm”, then I replied with you into me? And she said “shush with a whisper face.

- She sent me a picture of her broken foot (foot is the key word here), we had a conversation about it and out of the blue she sent me another picture, of both of her thighs spread, and a tiny blanket covering what would have been her underwear.

- I was having relationship problems and spoke to S for advice, S told his girlfriend and she message me saying, “If I was your girlfriend, your happiness would be my main priority”

- During a conversation, she randomly said she wore something very provocative and sent me a picture of said outfit.

I don’t wanna bring this up with S’s girlfriend, because I don’t want to be the guy who thinks everyone is into me, you know? Or assume something that isn’t true.

I don’t want things to be awkward or weird between the group, but I do want this to stop.

How do I handle the situation without ruining my friendships?

Do you guys suspect what I suspect?

201,"A little backstory, I'm 21, live at home. It's just me and my dad, and while I do work and go to school, I've been suffering from severe clinical depression for many years. It's caused me to have really bad money bad money management skills, ending up filing chapter 7 bankruptcy at the age of 20. I also never really have any money because I spend it all before my next paycheck, my grades are pretty mediocre at the moment, and on top of that I have to cope with my depression that ultimately makes it much harder to live a more fullfilled life. 

Now,  I love my dad to death. Him and my mom met when I was 3 and he has taken me as his own ever since and has done so much for me and I'm forerever thankful for that. However, him and I but heads ALOT. He's a really agressive and a "" my way or the highway type of person"" He tends to go from 0-60 really quickly, which results in him putting me down as a person. He tells me he just says these things when he's angry but it honestly hurts my self esteem so much. He'll say things like ""you're honestly the dumbest person I ever met"", ""how can you be so stupid?"", ""You're such a fuck up"", etc... I know that's just the way he is but it hurts so much. It makes me feel worthless honestly, and I know I DO mess up a lot but I feel like I'm trying my hardest and the way he talks to me sometimes does not help my mental progress at all.  

It's been like this my whole life, and I always thought I would get used to it but I haven't, its actually getting worse. I've tried to confront him about it in the past, telling him I understand youre angry sometimes but putting me down as a person does not help my situation. He'll say he understands but will go back doing the same thing in a week. 

Long story short, is there a way that I can tell my father to not be so aggressive and not be so careless of my feelings whenever I do something wrong? Any help is appreciated, thank you.",04Jul2018,1
202,"Looking for advice on a situation I put myself in. Writing this on mobile so sorry if formatting is bad. 

My friends and family know me by my middle name, not my first name (thanks m mom and dad). So for example let’s say my full name John Steve Smith. Everyone knows me by Steve. 

OK, so 7 years ago I graduated college with an engineering diploma. I’ve always been an introvert, shy and try to avoid conflict. This is what got me into my “situation”. 

 Since I created my resume while in school as part of one of my classes, the name on my resume was written “John (Steve) Smith, so the teacher knew who handed it as I was registered in school as John Smith. 

Anyways, I applied for a job in my town. Didn’t change the naming on the resume (first mistake). Got an interview and when they called me in the two senior engineers called me in as John Smith. I didn’t correct them (second mistake, dumb I know). 

Fast forward two weeks, get an offer and I accept. I was planning on letting them know my first day that I go by my middle name, Steve. Go to my first day of work and before I get a chance to tell them I go by my middle name, I’m sat at my desk and realize their HR and IT has already set up my computer login info and all that as John. I choked up and just played it out..... here I am 7 years later still going by John. 

This probably sounds ridiculous but It’s the situation I’m in and just looking for some advice. The city I live in is small enough that I’ve made a “name” for myself I guess. Lots of different firms, clients etc.  know me as John.

What can I do? Any advice would be appreciated. ",04Jul2018,9
203,"A little background, a month ago was my dads birthday party. I (31 M) didn't go. Not because I didn't want to, but because I have been struggling with my mental health over the past eighteen months or so, and my wife also has her own mental health problems and her own personal opinions on some members of my family that would be there. In short, to attend would have been bad for both of us.


I didn't tell anyone I wasn't going, everyone was under the impression that I'd just be there, like the good little boy I am. I had around three texts that morning from my nephew asking where I was. I said I wouldn't be there, and said I was having issues. Since then, nothing. Two sisters, one brother, nephews and nieces and my dad. Nobody has contacted me to see what's wrong. I know I could reach out myself, but my family are the type to tell me to man up and get over it. The real *what do you have to be sad about* kind of family.


So I guess the advice I'm after is whether I should get in touch, or just leave it until they realise they haven't heard from me in a while? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and could help me out?


Thanks.",04Jul2018,1

205,"Gonna get back to basics

Guess I'll start it up again

I'm fallin' from the ceiling

You're falling from the sky now and then

Maybe you were shot down in pieces

Maybe I slipped in between

But we were gonna be the wildest people they ever hoped to see

Just you and me

So why'd you come home to this sleepless town

It's a lifetime commitment

Recovering the satellites

All anybody really wants to know is...
When you gonna come down

Your mother recognizes all you're desperate displays
And she watches as her babies drift violently away
'Til they see themselves in telescopes
Do you see yourself in me?

We're such crazy babies, little monkey
We're so fucked up, you and me

So why'd you come home to this faithless town
Where we make a lifetime commitment
To recovering the satellites

And all anybody really wants to know is...
When are you gonna come down

She sees shooting stars and comet tails
She's got heaven in her eyes
She says I don't need to be an angel
But I'm nothing if I'm not this high

But we only stay in orbit
For a moment of time
And then you're everybody's satellite
I wish that you were mine

So why'd you come home to this angel town
It's a lifetime decision
Recovering the satellites

Everybody really knows for sure...
That you're gonna come down
That you're gonna come down

206,"I don't know why I've seemed to already screw up my life at 27. 

I did brilliantly on tests, got a full ride to a good uni, and everyone thought I would be in a stable good career making bank right about now. Well, not sure what happened, but wound up choosing a terrible major I didn't care about, did mediocre. Then couldn't get a job and wound up thrown around in receptionist and waitressing jobs; fired from some, and the rest barely got by in, but was allowed to stay on by the grace of previous bosses. I now am unemployed, barely have friends, and can't get a reply on my job apps.

Family and friends are shocked and confused by this. Whereas those who started off at shitty uni's, now have high paying jobs at good companies, or have been able to get into graduate school, etc. In essence, everyone who isn't a drug addict is doing better than me.

I don't know what happened and why I can't seem to be successful, or do a basic job like waitressing, even if I try my butt off. Even my current passion/dream which I've been working on for a year now, I haven't been able to make tangible progress in. 

It seems like all someone has to do is just will it, and the universe conspires for them to be successful. What the *** is wrong with me?",04Jul2018,1
207,"Me and my GF are looking at buying a house and one specific one we looked at was great, huge lot size, tons of work space and its nearly on the outskirts of town (which means quiet and we like that idea a lot) however, for an extra 20K we could buy her dads house which is in town. The house itself is huge (5 bed 2 bath), smaller lot, but it has a garage so still some work space. the thing is, my GF has lived in that house for her whole life and doesn't really want to live there for the rest of it either. and seeing as we buy it we'd be there for the foreseeable future. 
I'm gettign cold feet on the house we are going to buy because her dad is willing to give us a really great deal on his house and I fear that were making a big mistake by starting out on our own without this huge advantage, but my GF has her heart set on the out of town place. I'm getting cold feet now and we only have 2 more days to decide.

209,"So, I went on African/Indian TV several times via Skype towards the end of spring talking about soccer. I was then added to a Skype group chat by the channel so that it was easier for them to ask people to come on. Anyway so one of the guys in this group chat asked me to join a much bigger one on WhatsApp. So I joined it and now we often have conversations about my soccer team. Theres 147 People in this chat. And we talk fine. 

Anyway I'm in school today and I'm taking to friends about this and my teacher buts in and is like HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONLINE SAFETY WJFKFOWWODO #+_(£ and accuses them of online grooming me only because they don't know who I am. This is also agiest as I am 15 and most of these people in this group are older than me. 

The thing is They talk with each other all the time so it isn't like they constantly message me. The only slightly dodgy time was when one of the guys asked me to send him a PS4 code to Tanzania I think he genuinely couldn't buy the code there as he was asking other people in the group before he asked me. 

My techer is basically saying don't talk to anyone on the internet if you don't know who there are becuase they could groom you which is ridiculous. This makes me feel really down. ",04Jul2018,1
211,"Hey guys, here's a bit of an intro. Currently 19, summer break, college starts next year, have a bunch of free time, live with emotionally abusive mom, love animals, love playing video games &amp; IT stuff in general, love going to the gym, mom and I see each other a lot she works from home and I think this is the problem.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I always wanted a dog as a kid, my mom had dogs when she was young but never really took the time to properly train them etc. Why I never got a dog before? Me and my mom are living in my Uncle &amp; Aunts apartment and they are definitely cat people. Never pushed them too hard but just kinda knew I wanted a dog. I guess my mom knew that I'd always let it go after some time so she didn't get deep into these conversations since Uncle wouldn't allow a dog to live here anyways. Somehow I got so stubborn and talked to him which lead us to having long email conversations and eventually I had his blessing - completely unexpected.

&amp;nbsp;

I always thought having a dog would be simple, play a bit, go for a walk a couple times a day and that should pretty much be it. So I've been looking through ads during june and found some interesting ones. Managed to beg my mom to go and check the dogs since they are mostly from countryside cities, and so it was. When we arrived at the second location the dog was very nice etc. idk how to describe a dog through the eyes of someone who wants a dog? You could say I'm spoiled, wanted a toy, got it and now it got boring but all I want is the best for the dog.

&amp;nbsp;

So we got the dog and that was a week ago, my aunt mentioned she had postnatal depression when she got her son, and that's what I thought I had since day one. It felt very weird. I'm not that lazy I don't mind walking with the dog but my mom put this fear in me that I have to walk her all the time and play with her just because she is a baby and this is what scared me. I feel like I'd have to fully give up MY time in order to please the dog (according to my mom). She also wants me to walk her outside all the time so she doesn't pee or poo in the house, it does happen sometime but she's only been here a week. It might sound selfish but I don't know if I'm ready for this. Oh and I already taught her to pee on her diaper on the balcony and she gets lots of treats and praise when she ""goes"" outside.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, 1 week after the depression is still here, she just feels like too big of a responsibility, or at least that's what my brain is telling me, I feel like I've got a rock on my heart. This morning I left for the store and figure she won't be scared if I leave her for 5 minutes (mom wasn't home), came back and she ate my glasses. Thank god they broke in big chunks so she just left it alone. This was something I was secretly hoping for just so I could somehow ask my mom that we'd return her or re-sell her. I feel EXTREMELY BAD for doing this. I just do not wan't to spend every minute with the dog and walk her out all the time and my mom is pressuring me to do so. She just comes in my room and is talking in a cute dog voice, and keeps saying stuff like ""why are you not playing with me"", ""why are you not taking me for a walk"", ""stop playing games"", ""stop watching youtube"" but all of this she's saying as if it were from the dogs perspective. I already talked to her and asked her not to do this since it is putting a lot of pressure on me but she just kept at it.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had a long ass conversation with my mom and she's acting like she's all attached to the dog and that I'm a very bad person if I sell her, but I just don't want the dog to suffer or not enjoy her life in any way, if there's a family that has 2 kids that are gonna play with her all day that would 200% be better for her, instead of sleeping most of the day with me while I'm on my computer.

214,"Hi reddit, 
Here is some background about my fathers situation. He just turned 60 and is still in a career. Pays well, but the threat of layoff is ever present. He split with my biological mother 18 years ago and has since found a new woman for his life. A mother of two kids, now 13 &amp; 15. They got together about 5 years ago, and her and the kids had moved into my fathers house about 3 years ago. 

My father has always battled with depression in his life, but about 6 months ago was the worst I have ever seen him. I believe he had some sort of panic about having to work for the rest of his life, he expressed to both me and his new partner that he wanted to take his own life.... we got through this and he was doing better for quite a while until today....

Last night, I spoke with his partner and she let me know she was moving out of his house and that she was going to discontinue the relationship. Personally I agree with this decision for the happiness of the two of them, but my fathers not taking it well. I think he has a lot of pressure from his large family of 7 brothers and sisters, who are all married and it’s producing more stress on him than ever. He’s now is a worse state that he was 6 months ago, and I have little to no experience dealing with this kind of thing. (25yo) 

Last time, I talked with him about seeking help and my father strongly opposed any medical or chemical intervention. 

Any advice you guys can give will be greatly appreciated as I feel lost. Thanks",04Jul2018,1

I have 40K in debt but that's not the problem. The real issue is my mom doesn't doesn't have a retirement. She's 56 years old and has nothing saved up. She's had a terrible unsupportive family and didn't come from wealth at all. She's also scarificed for me even though I was an unplanned child. My dads always been out the picture so I'm on my own. I'm open to paying for her retirement 100%, but I feel like I have to scarfice my 20s for the most part to do so. I have a 32 year old sister who doesn't seem to realize what our mothers situation is, she also likes to criticize me for staying in all the time. It causes me a lot of stress because I'm not sure how to live my life with moms future always on my mind. I stay in to study/develop my skills for the most part and find a jobs. I want to have fun but its hard to keep a balance. Having fun can be very addictive and distracting. On the flip side I want to really get a good job, but it requires a lot of knowledge and years to get good at the job. I don't want to regret not living as much as I should've?

217,"Ok my grammar and spelling in this ones gonna be pretty shit but let’s summarize it, I’ve only kissed twice so far in my life , I’ve only really had two girlfriends though too. But the problem is, I’m a terrible kisser, and I often get made fun of by my ex’s for it (which shouldn’t really matter since there ex’s there bound to make fun of me), but the main reason is because I kiss like shit, I guess it doesn’t help that I’m only 14 and haven’t done it for longer than a total of 15 seconds of my life, but still. Point being, when I tried to kiss my first girlfriend I went in “95 percent “ and then froze up because I got too spooked, resulting in no lip movement. My second attempt was with my second girlfriend and that’s where I really fucked up, I pretty much just placed my lips on theirs and got to nervous to do shit, they then proceeded to break up with me the same night because of said kissing. My main point is, when I kiss, how do I not just freeze up and sit there? Like when I kiss somebody is there anything I should do to make it less known that I’m a shitty kisser.",04Jul2018,1

222,"Hello Reddit,   
I  have been a lurker for a while but because of the sensitive nature of  this post, I am using a throwaway account. If there are other subs where I can post the same, please let me know. 

  
My cousin has been going through some stressful events in her life and  wanted some advice from me (I am the only close living family member she has and  doesn't know whom to turn to. Her friends have not shown any willingness  to help her once they became aware of serious nature of the situation).    
Unfortunately  I am not sure what advice to provide her and need your advice. I have  copied an email she sent me earlier and I have also tried to fill in  some information that she revealed when we spoke over the phone. I may  be missing some parts but can try to fill it in later, if my memory  serves me correct.  
Some background story may provide some context to the email, so here goes -   
A  few months back, my cousin( who lives in Florida) called me to tell me  that she thought her husband has been behaving very strangely of late.  Based on his strange behavior she initially suspected that he maybe  cheating on her. Concerned, she secretly started monitoring his text  messages and phone messaging apps. His text messages revealed that he  may not only be getting intimate with a few ladies but she also found  cryptic messages about 'packages' being delivered. Once she confronted  her husband about this, he vehemently denied everything and started  behaving even more suspiciously and secretively. Unfortunately, I think,  in her emotional state, she may have tipped him off.  Following that incident, he started hiding his phone and they started sleeping in separate rooms. He also started leaving their home at odd hours in the night with weird excuses. From his text messages and chat logs, she started suspecting that her husband may have become involved in drug dealing or organized  crime. My cousin desperate to find out more hired a private investigator  next ( an ex-cop) but did not get much help from him. When she asked the  PI when she can expect more details, the PI dismissed her saying that he will follow  his own schedule and cannot hurry things up as these investigations take  their own time.The PI also asked for more money that she was unable to  provide.  
A  few weeks later, when she confronted her husband again, he  left home and filed for divorce the next day.  He also told her that he  is planning a 2-week 'vacation' with their 6-yr old daughter ( he did not  want to disclose the location in spite of repeated requests) and there  was nothing she could do to stop him.  Her husband's lawyer also threatened her saying that if she  leaves the city with their daughter without the husband's permission, he  is going to come after her.    In the divorce papers, in addition to other demands, he demanded regular payments FROM her since he is partly-employed  and has lower income than my cousin ( she is employed though, but has  quite a bit of debt and very little savings due to some poor financial  decisions both she and her husband had made in the past).  Curiously, for someone employed part-time for 3+ years, her husband was able to put a down payment on a Mercedes car recently.   
She refused to sign the divorce papers and hasn't signed it yet. They  still live in the same house, although in different rooms, but I think  he may be biding time or planning something and does not intend to stay  there for long.  She is also afraid to move out of her house as she doesn't  have any money saved and she thinks that leaving her house would  jeopardize her and her daughter's safety. She is extremely scared for her life and the safety of her  daughter and doesn't know what to do (she is under a lot of mental duress that she recently got into an automobile accident.    Fortunately, she was unhurt but her car was damaged).   
Desperate,  my cousin finally called the cops ( and at least a couple of times since then) but they said that they  could not do anything as they cannot proceed based on hunches and need  substantial evidence. They even refused to take a formal complaint. I  understand her story seems incredible, but I was very surprised  by this attitude as it seems that the job of law enforcement officers  should not be to brush off complainants at first glance and at least try  to followup on the complaints.   
I  am copying the email she sent me earlier below (please note that she is  under extreme mental duress and may not have been able to express  herself clearly or provide all the details). I have edited the email for some typos and completed  some sentences based on my knowledge. I have also hidden all names and phone numbers but tried  to reproduce it as much as possible. I can try to fill in if necessary  based on what she has mentioned ( if anyone is interested).

Hi \*\*\*\*\*\*  
Just  want to update you regarding my current situation. I believe  that my  husband is into some dangerous illegal activities and that mine  and my  daughter's life is in danger. I suspect there is drugs involved.  His  activities have been really suspicious over the last couple of  months:  He disappears every night between midnight and 7 am, he gets weird calls  from people at 1 am or 4 am including from one particular person  &lt;Name1 (number)&gt;. Btw, I just checked, this # and it does not  exist anymore. There is this another #  &lt;number&gt; (belongs to some  &lt;Name2&gt;)  that he was calling 3 times a day until March this year.  When I  called that #, it says 'subscriber is no longer listed'. Her  new # is  &lt;number&gt;.  I found texts messages between him and  &lt;Name1&gt; talking  about 'packages' being delivered into his mailbox  everyday. They text each other and call each other at 1 am , 4 am and  they meet everyday between midnight and 7 am.  He lives in &lt;a city in  Florida&gt;. He has exposed my daughter to this man everyday  on his  way to drop her off to school. He stops everyday at this man's  place to  pick up a package ( according to my daughter). She is very  upset about  having to see him everyday and thinks he looks scary.  
Also,   apparently he has been booking hotels all over FL almost everyday,   including spas &amp; resorts on weekends, vacation rentals, expensive   vacations and cruises ( from his google search history) when he has literally no income. He has conveniently stayed mostly unemployed over  the past  3 &amp;1/2 years, deposited $800 in April and May 2018 from  his so called  current job as a mortgage loan officer (works in  &lt;company name&gt; , his  boss's number is &lt;name3&gt;  &lt;number&gt;). He shares some private conversations with &lt;Name2&gt; and 2 other females ( whose text messages have since been deleted). 

He has recently filed for divorce and can't wait to get rid of me. I also believe he spiked my drink one time.

  
I   received a call from a private # saying that they have  been tracking  my husband for the last couple of months, has some very  intimate  pictures and videos of him with other women and that he is into  'money  laundering' and works with this man called &lt;Name1&gt;.  They   also believe that my husband is about to take a dangerous step and is   planning to run away with my daughter. (I found from his google  searches  that he has been looking into hotels &amp; flights to  Bangkok). 

  
I   called the FBI and told the entire story, they hung up on me saying  that I am crazy. They didn't even bother to write down a complaint.  
I   called the local police department, reported everything again and,  they  said it's beyond anything they can do. They said that it is beyond  their jurisdiction and that it's an FBI case and they  are sorry.  
That's   all I have to say. If something happens to me or my daughter, just   understand that I would never commit suicide and please, please  take  care of &lt;daughter's name&gt;.  


 \---------------------------------------------------------- end of email ------------------  


I trust her story although I have no means of independently  verifying her claims. The FBI local office where she called asked her to call 911 if she thought her life was in danger. When she said she did call the local police, they said they cannot do anything more. The lady on the phone even laughed at her and asked her if she has been reading a lot of mystery novels?  When she persisted in making her case, they hung up on her. 

As for the call from the private #, they claimed  to be hackers . In her desperation, she had at  one point contacted some hackers from an online website and provided  some details about her husband to try and see if they can provide her  with more details. She may have also paid a small amount of money to one  of them who turned out to be a scammer as he started asking for more  money before he could release any information. I frankly think that most of these 'hackers' maybe scammers trying to extract money from her knowing she is desperate and telling  her what she wants to hear. She forwarded me an email from one hacker  asking for payment in bitcoins in exchange for information about her  husband and I have asked her not to pay any money to them ( not that she  has any). Although, strangely enough  they seem to have information about her husband's accomplice  and also the name of the woman he interacts with most frequently -  information that she did not provide. Also, one of the  'hackers' told her that after investigating the situation he did not  want to get involved, as he thought that her husband has become involved  in a large illegal operation and he did not want to become a target of  the FBI. The hacker did not divulge anything more.   


Both of us are frustrated by the fact that law enforcement has not taken her  story seriously, and also mocked her on the phone about being crazy.  I  can vouch she is not but then again I am her cousin and have known her  for a long time. Given how many complaints from jealous spouses law  enforcement has to deal with every day, I understand their reluctance. On the other hand, I also see why law enforcement could not  stop something like the Parkland shooting even after receiving several  warnings from concerned citizens about Nickolas Cruz.   


I  am not sure what she can do next or which organization she can approach  next for help. All she wants is to have law enforcement take her  seriously and protect her and her daughter. She told me she is ready to face  the consequences if her story turns out to be false. Is there any federal or state organization that can help her or even and provide her and her daughter temporary shelter  and relief? She doesn't even know what type of lawyer she should get in touch with, given it's not only a civil or marriage related case anymore (  and she does not  have the money to hire one). 

What do you guys think her next steps should be? 

(Btw, before anyone mentions it, let me clarify that I am fully aware of the standard caveats of receiving advice from online strangers. But, having been a reddit community member  for 8 years, I have seen some great advice provided on these threads, and I am hoping for the same here).   


TL;DR - Cousin thinks husband is involved in illegal activities including drug dealing and money laundering.

Reported activity to FBI and local police but has been unable to get law enforcement to take her seriously.

Husband maybe planning to run away with daughter.  ",04Jul2018,19
224,"I am not an alcoholic. I know asking a question like that makes me seem like I've got a problem but I barely drink as it is and never to excess.

The reason I ask is because I just can't find drinking enjoyable. I have been buzzed and drink a handful of times in my life and I hate it. I don't feel like ""my inhibitions are gone"" or that I have ""liquid courage"" I just feel dumber. My motor skills are worse and my thought process is slowed. Nothing is funnier or feels better, I am just a dumber person. 

I may not like the affects but I do like the taste. The problem is that when I drink in moderation I can easily still feel a little buzzed (I rarely drink so I have low tolerance). So I have to monitor how many sips I take. I like the taste but is it worth it if I have to monitor what I am drinking. I want to freely enjoy something, I don't like formulating a plan to drink something tasty. 

I just don't feel like I should even drink anymore. I am never wholey satisfied when I drink it. Is it better to just drop it all together, or will I be one of those teetotaler weirdos? ",04Jul2018,1
225,"I'll try to keep this a short as possible. So my ex (20F) and I (21M) broke up 5 months ago (after being together 2 years and a half), during this time she wrote me a couple of times, saying she miss me but doesn't want to be back together and I ignored her because I was hurt. After not talking during 4 months the day of our anniversary I was going to a friend house and I found her there in the street, it was a crazy coincidence but with her it was always like that, we always had incredible coincidences while we were together. Now she is saying she wants to reconnect. And I don't know what to do, right now i don't want to be with anyone but I'm pretty sure that if we go back to talking and hanging out I'll fall in love again. 

We were best friends since we were kids so there is no person in the world that knows me better than her and so do I so breaking up was super hard because we didn't just lose our lovers but our best friends too.

She says she will always love me and be in love with me. But we are young and we have to experiment a lot of things with different people. 

I have always been the kind of person that looks for a meaningful relationship and hate hookup culture because I think it is just empty and doesn't make you feel anything. I never have tried it but now all of my friends are telling me that I'm crazy for not kissing girls at parties or just hooking up but I don't feel like doing it. (I'm I wrong for thinking that way?)

Before her I had a couple of girlfriends relationships but when they ended I didn't feel a thing, my whole life I have been cold and didn't feel much for anyone but for her I fall like an idiot as never before in my life, so now my walls are back because I'm afraid of what can happen if I let anyone in again. 

So right now I don't know what to do, try to be friends again probably fall in love and get hurt cause she doesn't want us to be together or maybe she does and is to afraid to say it, or just ignore her like I have been doing all this time although it hurts like hell when I ignore her.

226,"**So context:** I have two friends who I'll call B and R. B has been my best friend for a while and I used to be super close to R but we ended up going to different schools so we're not *as* close anymore. 

We were all part of a bigger friend group about three years ago, and the two had been fine relationship-wise and seemed pretty close actually until a year ago. From what B has told me, R randomly completely stopped talking to her and B can't at all figure out why. Like ignoring her at social gatherings and all-- and the two sat by each other in a class but B told me that R literally never initiated conversation with her and when B did, R would give one-word responses, etc. A couple weeks ago, B texted R about the situation (basically like, *I value my friendship w you and wanna know what went wrong*, etc) and R just left her on read. B has occasionally brought this situation up to ask me for advice on how to handle it, but I have never talked to R about it so everything I know is from B's side and could have B's bias/exaggeration, obviously. I have noticed though that B and R never talked once at this one social event I went to after hearing about all this from B. 

**My actual question:** What do you think of me asking R about what happened with B that's making her do this? It really isn't any of my business and I initially told B that I'm very curious about R's side of the story but won't ask, but I just really badly wanna know why R's being so rude to her. I guess I'm just disappointed in R's behavior and am really wondering if she does have a good reason behind it. (Disappointed because B, R, and I used to be pretty tight those three years ago and I'm still pretty good friends with R I guess.) 

I'm scared B will find out somehow that I asked R about it (if that's what I end up doing) and it's likely that she'll be mad at me. I'm just really, really curious though so I need someone to either honestly tell me it's nbd if I just ask R about it **or** that I'm just being nosy and I should just let it go. Or if you have any other advice on how to approach this.

227,"I’m a multiple time sexual abuse survivor living with PTSD. I have difficult opening up to people, and after my first engagement was broken, I actually went out and slept around with a few people. 

My best friend is a guy. He has always claimed that he has no romantic/sexual feelings for me whatsoever. I’ve had a crush on him for a while, but I’ve never made a move because he’s not interested. However, as far as friends go, he was fantastic: he was there for me during very difficult periods and has always loved me selflessly and cared for me well.

I began to see him as a brother and not as a romantic interest. On Sunday he came down to see me and we hung out together like usual. Just before he went back to his family’s vacation home, he kissed me. 

Monday we decided to watch the Incredibles 2 together. As part of my healing process with the PTSD, I’ve made a commitment to not have sex until I know I can completely trust someone/we’re in a very serious relationship (like engaged). 

So as we’re there in the theater we begin kissing again, and I asked him what was going on. He told me straight to my face all he wanted was sex, and he didn’t ever want to date me. That’s when I began to be uncomfortable. 

We got pretty far, but he was the one doing everything. I just let him do it to me. I couldn’t have sex with him though. He has given me a half apology filled with the usual Christian bullshit that I despise, and half the people I have told (including my parents) have said they’re disappointed in my behavior.

""I feel like there are a lot of things I'm not getting because I don't know enough to train myself and I seem to only learn things as they come up with the customers."" I wanted to say, you don't have a plan to train me and you keep throwing me in situations where I don't have all of the information I need because you haven't given it to me. At one point you tried to get me to sell something and then had me print a contract for it that I had never seen before."" His response was, ""something's you can't learn before hand."" I get that. Howe he taught me everything as it came up. He had no plan.

Today he comes in and one set of lights aren't on. I didn't notice they were off. He starts standing behind me watching me correcting everything I do. He even starts to question things I've done correctly.

I leave and go to the back. (I don't need to work the front so I have no problem saying fuck it and walking away. I'm only working the front because we are getting so many complaints about them that we are losing customers.) I text the manager and ask her not to schedule me with him anymore. He comes to the back to tell me that some times he comes off harsh and tries to explain that the reason he was doing what he was doing was because how I open the store is a direct response on his training. He was worried that if the manager came in and saw some of the lights off she'd think he didn't teach me to turn them on. I explain to him that no one told me there were two sets of light switches in two different locations so I turned on the ones I knew about. After a minute of him trying to explain himself again I told him, ""It's nothing personal. I just don't want to work with you for more than five minutes at a time because you are brusque."" He then storms off and now he's apparently mad at me.

When we work together it's in a small 6 x 4 area. I'm ready to just say forget it. He has a bad attitude.

240,"Ok, guys, I need some advice. 

First of all, English is not my primary language, so embrace yourselves for some mistakes, it will happen, hopefully y’all can understand what I’m trying to tell.

Let’s get to it.

One of my closest friends used to date this girl, back in high school (2014), he was really shitty to her, cheating on her multiples times, not going to her birthday, among other stuff. She always forgave him for everything, he was just a really bad boyfriend in general. Eventually they broke up.

Okay, we are off high school now, they’ve been broken up for years, early 2017 I started talking to his ex, at first was pretty much about law school (we both are going to law school, at different universities), but we started hitting it off, even though we do not have much in common. 

She told me all she have been through, how she felt during their relationship, how it scarred her for life, how she cannot fell in love with anyone else, how she is still going to shrinks to try to amend the damage he’s done to her.
So, knowing how she has trouble falling for people and how she’s my friend’s ex, I started to like her, because I’m as dumb as it comes.  

Last week we kissed, and now I have this voice in my head saying to me that if I try hooking up with her again (which I want), I will get hurt, because we will not be on the same page, and it may screw up my friendship with her ex’s.

I know there’s not a right answer here, and I do not think I did anything wrong by hooking up with her. Should I just wait and see what happens? Should I invest a little harder on her? Should I just stop talking to her at all? What should I do?",04Jul2018,1
241,"I’m an adjunct instructor at a large university. I’m a (reasonable) stickler about attendance.

Students may have 2 unexcused absences; after 2 their grade drops one letter for each subsequent unexcused absence. 

3 tardies = 1 unexcused absence. 

I tell my students that if they’re coming from across campus, I know it might be a time crunch. Just let me know at the start of the semester and claim a seat by the door as to not disturb everyone walking in late. 

I tell them this two or three times throughout the semester, and it’s in the syllabus (available online and a hard copy).

I had a student (P) last semester have his grade drop from an A to a C because of tardies/absences. He was tardy to 8 classes. His grade should have honestly gone from an A to a D, but even I think that’s a little shitty, so I ignored those absences that would have dropped his grade so low that he’d have to retake the class. 

I sent out an email to students who were going to be affected by attendance, letting them know a week before grades were due what their penalty would be and to email me if they’d like to do some extra credit for a few points (I really do try to help my kids. I get it; college is rough and sometimes grades don’t always reflect your abilities. I give them plenty of chances.)

No email from P. 5 days later, I submit grades. 

Then the emails start. P is pissed his grade dropped. I sent him excerpts from the syllabus and he claims he didn’t know that (well, it’s an English class. Maybe read the syllabus). He said “that’s not fair.”

I tell him “them’s the rules” and stop replying. (I’m allowed to do this if a student won’t accept a final decision.)

I get an email from my department chair Monday with a forwarded email from P. In it, he’s accusing me of being racist. He’s bringing in “his friends who took [my] class,” saying they got better grades and did the same thing. 

First of all, I don’t know who these students are. And if they were from fall semester or prior I probably don’t even remember them. My grading has gotten more rigorous this year, as people have taken advantage of my tardy/absence policy in the past. 

I covered all of this with my boss. He understands that the student is just frustrated. I’m meeting with P on Friday to discuss the situation again. 

But I need advice on how to approach this meeting, and I’d appreciate any feedback y’all could give me. 

Concern 1: what could I tell him to shut down the conversation for good?

Concern 2: I’m not allowed to discuss other students’ grades (FERPA), so how do I address the fact that other students got different grades because their work and effort was of superior quality?

Concern 3: My boss is on my side now, but if P blows this out of proportion and makes it a race issue, how should I address that? 

I’m hella frustrated, and I’ve been stewing over this for a few days. His latest email to me says “I’m not asking to improve my grade. I just want to get what I deserve. I have other things to discuss as well.” So that was vague and ominous.

242,"I'm a late 20s M, based on BMI, currently normal weight.  

I've been lucky enough to get to my age with most of my grandparents still being alive, but they're all degrading rapidly.  I'm not especially close to any of them, but I think their condition may have led me to take my health more seriously.  Which is good, as far as it goes, but...  

Mid 2016, per BMI, I was about 15 pounds overweight.  Doctor said, hey, you should lose some weight.  So I do some research, change my diet, less meat, more fruits and vegetables, more nuts, add exercise.  OK, go along a bit, go to the dentist.  Have a few cavities for first time since I was a kid.  OK, fine, get the fillings, do some research, to prevent more in the future, reduce carbs, especially sugars.  Go to the doctor at my current weight (about 50 pounds lost since last checkup), cholesterol's too high.  OK, fine, do some research, cut out cheese, add some fiber.  Go along for a bit, do some research ... could very easily be undereating now, based on calorie counts, but not hungry beyond what I'm already eating, so... 

Making all of these changes is exceptionally easy for me - along this process, at various points, I was able to very easily cut out beer, add (unsweetened) green tea, add fruit and vegetables, cut out fruit, cut out cheese, and stick to it until it posed an issue later.  This sounds like a nice feature, but I think it could be part of the problem, in that I have no discernible emotional involvement in food or health.  And as a result, whatever I end up eating or doing health-wise is basically entirely governed with managing whatever health issues have arisen.  

In turn, I've found myself compulsively researching various foods and whether they're ""good"" or ""bad"" and it's just ... not working out.  This food is good for result A, but bad for result B, so ... ?

I'm worn down mentally at this point, and it's affecting my work.  When I get home from work, I'm just focused on moving time forward to move forward with resolving whatever current health issues I'm focused on, rather than relaxing and enjoying anything.  

I've focused on food here because that has the most inputs and outputs involved, but this is really a broader health thing - exercise and dental routines are two other common preoccupations of mine.  

As far as I can figure, general anhedonia is likely a major factor here, in that in lieu of pleasure as a factor in any aspect, including use of time, the attempts at minmaxing are dominant.  But I'm having trouble connecting that to the above to resolve the issues.  ",04Jul2018,2

My boyfriend, our roommate, and I live together in a townhouse. My boyfriend is currently on vacation 10+ hrs away, and my roommate and I are here watching over his dogs.  

I have never let these dogs outside without a leash, because they have a tendency to bolt and chase random things (squirrels, rabbits, any odd noise, etc.). My roommate decided to let the dogs out last night without their leashes at 2AM, and after 2 minutes of her standing outside, I start to get worried and run out there and the dogs are nowhere in sight.  We currently live in a townhouse community that doesn't allow more than 1 dog, not to mention that we haven't even payed a pet deposit (which is mandatory to have a pet).  

I spent 2 hours last night looking for them all around the complex and down the road, but stopped so I didn't have the cops called on me for ""suspicious activity"" (I was in all black and walking around with a flashlight).  

Today I drove around and have walked around for hours through our complex, down the road, and in surrounding neighborhoods. I haven't seen any sign of them. I've also called a few of the animal shelters in the area, but since it's the 4th I haven't received any responses, so I left messages.  

I'm not quite sure what to do. My roommate says that I cannot tell my boyfriend, but I feel horrible hiding something like that from him. She doesn't want me to tell him because she's ""sure that they'll turn up as soon as she tells him"". I'm trying to do everything I can to look for them, but I also can't run around asking people if they've seen two dogs since it could possibly get to the complex management.  

My boyfriend doesn't get back until Saturday, and if they're not back by then he will be absolutely devastated when he gets back. I don't want to worry him or devastate him preemptively while he's on vacation, but this also isn't sitting right with me.

As my sisters are both teenagers, most of the planning is going to be left to me, but as someone who hates surprises and fusses, I'm sort of at a loss.  

So we were thinking something small, with just extended family and close friends, since just a month earlier we're hosting a large party with a couple hundred people anyway, and something smaller would contrast that. For location, I was just going to do our house, but that's because I couldn't think of anywhere else to hold it. I live in Toronto, Canada, in case anyone has any ideas. So as you can see, I have literally nothing.  

I really, really want this event to be special though. My parents are just incredible people, and they take every opportunity to surprise us and make us happy at their own expense, and for once, I want to do the same for them. I know I could turn to aunts and uncles for help, but I think it would be really special to have organized the thing on our own, and I know that if we did, the effort would mean a lot to them. I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want just some plain old event like every other party they throw, I want something they'll remember, and something that will really surprise them! :) As for what my parents are like, they're just super chill, loving, sociable, and cool (haha I'd never say that to their face, but if it helps plan a perfect event for them I'll concede). They're also *very* big into all forms of charity (but especially Parkinson's Disease work) and it would be incredible to incorporate that some way.  

Anyway, It would be so helpful to hear any themes, or locations, or even just general directions to go in. Budget is 100% open. I just want to give back a fraction of a fraction of the effort that my parents have put in to making me and my sisters happy over the course of our lives.

250,"Hey guys. Just got a job offer and I have my heart and my mind saying two different things, i need some advice.

To give you some background, I graduate in electrical engineering 2 years and a half ago. Due to some circumstances, i only have 1.5 years of experience at this point. The job promised me some certain task, one of which is some coding, but that quickly changed after i joined.

At the moment, I have an offer for a position that will give me that development (its more of a programmer position), working on a project end to end like I want, customer facing as well like I want, and there is a lot of travel involved worldwide (as I want). The only things that stop this from being an obvious decision are these factors: Salary and Vacation.  


Salary: although the salary is better than what I am getting today (only by a few thousands), I've been getting advice that I need to shoot for a bigger salary increase, in the range of 15-20&amp;#37; of my current salary, even though I only have 1.5 years of experience. This makes it difficult for me to choose at the moment because this new position, although it pays a bit better and there are guarantees of salary increases whereas where i am now, there aren't any, the issue is, I might find myself in the same position in 2 years, wanting to make that huge leap people are suggesting me to do.  


Vacation: Currently, I have 3 weeks and 3 days of vacation. I'm being offered 2 weeks and christmas break (1 week) in the new position. This is an issue for me since I always take 2 weeks around april/may, and 1 week in fall/winter (non-christmas).   


As far as other benefits go, they are good. Its a smaller company, so their pension plan isn't the best but that's not a huge deal for me, I have other ways of planning for my future. Im caught choosing between something I want to do now for an extended period of time (travel and code and such), and thinking about the financials and longer term for my career.   


Got any advice?",04Jul2018,1
251,"I’ve been “best friends” (I’m not even sure anymore; seems one sided—different issue all together) with this guy from high school. We’ve been living together for over a year now, and in our line of work sometimes we are sent out for weeks and weeks at a time. Spending only one drunken day out of the week at the apartment; if any at all. He will invite his brothers over on that one day for cards and drinking.  Which is fine, I’ll participate as well occasionally; however, they leave late in the evening, he leaves in the morning, and all the trash stays on the floor for days and days and days. Until the next weekend we all hang out again. 

The last time I addressed this issue, a friend and myself spent a good chunk of time crafting a decent worded text message asking him to please keep the common area a little more cleaner. His anger took over and went off on me calling me an asshole and to not talk to him like a dog.  In my personal opinion he HATES to acknowledge anytime he is wrong or in different opinion. The usual is anger or “I don’t believe you” then followed by shutting down. I understand I’m a little dirty as well; but I try my best to take all my belongings out of the common area after I leave to my bedroom. I try not to use much waste in terms of water bottles, beer bottles, etc. so I don’t leave beer cans all over the living room for days and days. I just take my bong and reusable water bottle back to my room once it’s time for me to go to bed. 
Maybe I’m ranting; but I don’t know how to talk to him about this. Maybe I’m being to needy. I don’t know anymore. I want our friendship to be good, like Troy and Abed. I want us to be happy to see each other; but it just seems like he isn’t most of the time. I want the trash taken out of the common area; but I don’t know he does have a right to keep it in there. He does live here after all and pays his half of the rent. I don’t know. I’m just bugged and could probably bite my tongue a little better. Anyway, if someone reads this and has anything helpful to say I’d gladly appreciate it. He is a reddit user, so maybe he will come across this too. Who knows. ",04Jul2018,1

But my parents are not agreeing whatsoever, I don't know what their intentions are but my life is growing miserable. Moreover, I can pay my own rent and support myself with my on-campus job.

255,"I’m 23 and my brother is 17. 

I’m honestly just at a loss of what to do (if anything) and I don’t know if I’m being just over dramatic. 

Some family background: Our parents were very much in love and raised my brother and I full of love.  However when I was 18 and my brother was 12, our dad passed away unexpectedly. 

Mom remarried about two years later to “Jim”. Jim is not a nice guy. I think after dad passed away, Mom just wanted something or someone to be with her and Jim pursued her. I suspect their relationship got physical, my brother “Sam” has told me as much, but I moved out of the house not long after Dad died so I wasn’t around much. Sam was very affected by our stepdads abuse and I don’t think he’s ever really talked to anyone about it. 

Well this past weekend (it was Canada day weekend) I went home to visit Mom and Sam and I also knew that Sam had been seeing this girl “Hannah” for the past couple weeks and they were pretty serious so I was looking forward to meeting her. I brought my girlfriend down with me and we met up with them downtown for festivities. 

Well when we were downtown, we all had been drinking a little bit and my girlfriend had to pee. She went to the washroom and I left Sam and Hannah to go get some water. Well when my girlfriend came back out and I had returned, my girlfriend pulled me aside and told me that when she was leaving the washroom, she saw Sam grab Hannah by the arm and whisper something kind of aggressive in her ear. Sam and Hannah never saw my girlfriend leave the bathroom as far as I know. She said she was worried about it but wasn’t sure what to make of it but she wanted me to know. 

The rest of the night Hannah was kinda withdrawn and my girlfriend and I exchanged multiple looks throughout the night. Sam seemed unaffected by it all. 

I’m not sure what to do. I didn’t witness it myself but I know my girlfriend wouldn’t make this up. 

Should I say something? If so, to who? I’m really lost. I know that abuse can escalate and I’d like to stop it whenever i can, but I don’t know if I can confront Sam just based on my girlfriends account. As well, I don’t want to start drama if that’s not the case. 

Tl;dr: my girlfriend witnessed a potential abusive moment with my little brother and his girlfriend and I’m not sure what to do now. ",04Jul2018,13

We have a 4 year old and a son due October. My hours are from 3:30pm until 2am. Monday-Thursday. I get home and relax and sleep until 10am or later. My husband works 4am to 2pm. We do this schedule to avoid outrageous child care costs as we make too much to qualify for assistance. 

My daughter doesn’t protest and she’s a great child. It’s odd she seems to understand Mommy is tired and needs rest but she spends a lot of time entertaining herself. We try to do fun things often like zoos or beaches but I can’t help but feel overwhelmingly guilty. I often think her childhood sucks because Mommy is sleeping all the time and Daddy is exhausted after working and wants to relax. There can be weeks she goes with out playing like a child should.

Hi,

First some background: 
I’m from Belgium, almost finished with a PhD in Computer Science and a Masters in Civil Engineering, Computer Science and thinking of going freelance.
I’m in a comfortable financial/personal situation, due to a stroke of luck, I have no rent to pay, few expenses and a good amount of savings. 
This means I have low cash-flow requirements. 
In this PhD, I have been granted a high amount of flexibility, freedom and independence and managed to produce a couple of nice published papers.
The skills I have developed are mainly in light of PhD opportunities and research, which is IoT security, embedded devices, paper writing, presenting, giving courses and general problem solving skills. 
Programming skills are medium experience in Java, Python and C.
General Computer skills are medium with Windows, Linux, Eclipse, Latex, Word, Excel and probably missing a few.
I do not consider myself an expert in any of these but more than capable

As such, after the PhD, given my profile, I would like to maintain flexibility and freedom and was thinking of going Freelance.
This is very general but I am looking for any and all advice for somebody with my profile and my desires, in Belgium.

So what would you advise to somebody like me? Feel free to take your answer in any direction.

More specific questions:
Should I develop additional skills? For example,
Should I learn VIM? Or other common tools?
Should I get more advanced experience in my existing knowledge?
Should gain another area of expertise?
Should I learn more/additional programming languages/skills?
How should I approach getting work in flexible environments? Websites? Contact firms?
Other places you can point me at to get advise?
Bound to be more! Feel free to say/advise anything

Thanks for reading this long post. I am trying to gain as much information and advice as possible.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for awhile and things have been going great. The thing is that her parents don’t know do to them being very strict. They say things like “We won’t pay for your college if you get a boyfriend” because according to them if she gets a boyfriend she’s basically adult. We’re both 18 btw and going to College. So basically her parents were out and she asked me to come over. So i did and all we did was talk and hang out with her and her little brother. However when I was about to leave I opened the door to her father. At the time I didn’t know what to say or do so I choked up. I was told to get out by her father so I left. I don’t know what to do right now because I do honestly care for this girl but I feel like I can’t do much. I feel like my options are to let things settle down and for her to contact me whenever that it or I could head back and try explaining myself and what happened.

But then, i spoke to the council members about leaving and they say i am a valuable asset to the club and it would be a shame to see all my great talent gone. The reason why im thinking of leaving is because I won't be able to play with my old band and the genre and music we created which is rock. The music club is pushing everyone to do gigs outside i.e weddings, open mics etc. So rock will be out of the question.

On the other hand, i have a band back in my hometown but everyone's taking a break due to studies, work, etc and the fact im rarely home but we still contact each other about planning to do songs and getting back together. 

My question is should i leave the music club and be a lifeless sack of shit in college (eat, study, sleep routine) BUT hit my band up in my hometown and have fun together whenever i have a break

Or

Just suck it up in that music club for the sake of becoming a rockstar one day and not make the college life boring.

271,"Ok, so I'm an average looking guy in his 20s, I work out and have nice arms and I'm not overweight. After seeing so many couples where the guy isn't that good looking in my opinion and the girl is very attractive, I kept asking myself why I can't get that! So I've joined almost every dating app available, but I usually used Tinder and Bumble. I didn't get much luck with Bumble, but I was told there's a trick to getting more attention for free on Tinder, you just have to keep quitting and rejoining. Well after weeks of doing that, I match with a gorgeous girl.

She and I really hit it off. More importantly, she thought I was handsome, and she was clearly the more attractive one! I couldn't believe the things this girl was telling me, she was so into me! Soon, we exchanged numbers and started a ""texting relationship"". Everyday we'd text constantly, send videos and photos, and I just couldn't get enough of her she was so funny, interesting, and beautiful. There were times she acted strange and paranoid about something in her life, but I did my best to calm her down and it seemed to work. We talked about kissing and how our first person to person meeting will go and how we couldn't wait to start a physical relationship. The only problem was she lived 30 miles away from me, that was an issue from the start when i first saw her profile, but I didn't care, a beautiful girl is finally into me!

Well, after about a month there came a day where she didn't text me. The next day i texted her asking if she was ok. She replied and apologized saying she was really busy packing her things. I asked if she was going on vacation or something. She said she was going to Boston to go apartment shopping. I asked why and she said she planned on moving there for grad school and possibly live there permanently(not exactly word for word but that was the message I received). Imagine my shock! I kept asking myself so many questions that I wanted to ask her. WHAT?!? So where do I fit in this? Was this your plan from the start? Why were you looking for someone if you weren't sticking around? When did you plan on telling me this? After all this, you're leaving??? I told her that she hurt me doing that, planning on moving after making such a connection. She apologized and said she was crying that she hurt me. I sent her a long message one day as a goodbye and told her if she wanted to block me or lose my number that was fine, but I kept her as a contact in case she decided to come crawling back. Which is what I wanted! I couldn't believe this happened to me! I cried, lost my appetite, and was in a bad mood for a week. Everyone i told this to told me to just shake it off and move on. They didn't understand that this sorta thing doesn't happen to me a lot.

Well after awhile, I rejoined tider again and did my trick again and again hoping for a miracle. Well, to my surprise lightning seemed to strike in the same spot again! I met another girl who was pretty, but not gorgeous like the last mind you. We talked, she seemed to like to me, and I thought she was ok. Well, again after awhile we exchanged numbers and started texting. One night she asked if she could call me, I don't really talk on the phone so I was nervous. But we did, we talked and set up a dinner date. We met, shared a meal, talked, and went out for dessert. The date lasted four hours and we went home. We kissed at the end(which was my first kiss btw) and went back to texting each other. So after a few more dates, this has become a regular thing, we go for dinner and then do something else, and we kiss at the end.

Well, after one awkward date where her car broke down, I felt so bad for her that she was having a bad day and felt so embarrassed cause she was my ride home that time, I kept kissing her telling her it's ok, and we ended the date making us an official couple. Maybe I made mistake there, I don't know. Now comes the part where I find myself questioning things. Please don't get me wrong, this girl(let's call her K to separate her from the first girl) is plenty attractive. However, she's not exactly everything I find physically attractive about a girl. I l personally like a girl that's tall(taller than me and I'm 5""11), I don't know why I just do. K is only 5""3, sometimes she wears heels to make her 5""7ish but its not the same. Also, while she's by no means overweight, K is a little chubby. She says she wants to reduce that, but I don't know what her intentions are. While neither of these physical traits are deal breakers for me by any means, I just find myself somewhat wondering if I find her physically appealing and if I can see a future where we work.

Personality wise, K is perfect for me. We like the same things, she's sweet and caring, and she's catholic like me. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't find myself constantly feeling lucky to be with her like did with the last girl. I know what people will say, ""you didn't love the first girl, you just loved her beauty"". Maybe, but the last girl made me feel really happy. K makes me feel happy, just not the same way. Maybe it's because the last girl was technically my first even tho we never met in person, and now any other girl would make me feel the same way K makes me feel. I just can't help but wonder why I don't feel more like ""I'm on cloud 9"" by having a relationship with K. I mean I FINALLY have a girlfriend after wanting one for so many years! I thought I'd feel constantly happy when that finally happened, but I don't. And I can't help but feel like I would feel that way if K was a little more ""physically appealing"" to me. I know that sounds mean, but I think it's true. If only she were taller and a few pounds lighter, she'd be the whole package for me.

I guess what I'm asking here is: How should I feel? Is it normal to feel like this in your first relationship? Is it wrong to want more? Should I end things if I'm not as happy as I should be? Am I just wishing K had the last girl's physical traits? Why did the first girl make me feel happy to be alive and K doesn't? K is more honest and sincere, and she's definitely cute. But why am I not insanely happy to be her boyfriend? Can someone help me please?

Ever since I was young, I’ve always wanted to prove that I’m the best to show those that made fun of me that I was better but... it feels so lonely. I make posts about the awards I win in my competitions and I follow my classmates and all I see is that my feed is of all of them having a great time. I just don’t know how to connect to people and to be honest, I tend to push people away either because I’m too brash or because I don’t trust other people. All I’ve ever wanted was to be someone well recognised like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk and I guess I sound like someone who belongs on r/iamverysmart who thinks he’s better than everyone else but now all I want to do is be like everyone else. I feel like I’m two different people at times. Do I embrace my competitive side or the part of me that just wants to be like everyone else?

3. Motivation: I’m not sure what I’m working towards. When I was younger, I was a cliche. I got bullied and I wanted to prove them wrong. But it’s nothing like movies or cartoons where it all works out perfectly. My life is a total mess. I win awards at political debate competitions but my grades are a joke. I end up either hurting the people I care about due to my temper or I just push people away and regret it later. Everything seemed so clear but as more and more problems pop up, it’s like things become foggier and I’m just not sure where I’m going. I’m not sure what I’m suppose to be working towards and it’s scary. 

Everyday feels like I’m getting closer to a “bad ending”.",04Jul2018,0

284,"This has never happened to me before and I’ve tried to distance our friendship but she’s not getting it. 
We’ve been friends for over two years. She was my first girl friend that I’ve ever been close with. We’re total opposite and come from totally different backgrounds and we act completely different but I just dealt with it and whenever she would do something annoying I’d just vent to my roommate and be like oh that’s just her being her. But recently certain events have built up that has made me realize maybe I don’t consider her to be my best friend or even a really close friend anymore. 

I recently became friends with another girl who is exactly like me and we’ve really hit it off and I already enjoy and choose hanging out with her rather then old friend. I’ve realized with my old friend I don’t open up to her anymore about things because I’m the past she has been judgmental and uses one of her typical lines like “ *insert opposing opinion with a snarky laugh* but you do you boo!’ She’s extremely social and I’m extremely not and practically harasses me to agree to come to events that I end up just making an excuse to not go bc if I told her look I don’t like going out as much as you and I just don’t want to go then she’ll take it personal and then say I need to live life blah blah. 

And recently she’s become extremely needy. She feels like we have to talk everyday and if I go more than a day without texting her she calls me, DMs me, and the other day she even messaged me mom because she hadn’t heard from me. I know she means well and this is just how she is as a person but it’s too overwhelming for me now and I feel like I can’t relate to her much anymore.

It is a **new** PS4 (1TB) and a Controller.

INCLUDING another Controller, the game FIFA18 with bonus codes for ingame things AND free 14 Days of Playstation-Plus membership (This is needed for multiple things).

_____________________

After getting home, feeling like it's my birthday, I did the setup for the whole PS4 and was happy to chill because I have to work the rest of the week. 

After turning the Console on I saw that there was already a user-account of someone with a certain name. 

I searched for this Name on instagram and it turned out that theres only one person with this name who has Instagram and it even turned out that he was my age (19) and lived IN THE SAME AREA.

This basicly makes it highly likely that the console was already bought by this guy and was given back for whatever reasons.

The icing on the cake is, that this guy used BOTH premium codes before giving it back to the market.

I'm insanely angry right now cause they intentionally put that shit back in the store and sold it to me as if it was a new one.

I now have to drive another 15 minutes to the store, give it back to the store and get a new one and drive back again for 15 minutes.

The thing is that I can't do that until Monday.

Before I make a scene in this store, demanding compensation for this bullshit, I decided not to do it before asking you guys how to get the most out of that sitiuation.

Is it better to make a scene and let the anger out?

Should I be patient and ask for compesation politely?

Can I go as far as asking for compensation in terms of another PS4 game?

I appreciate everyone who gives me a good solution for this!

292,"My best friend was my first love about a year ago, before he started dating my other friend. They've been together for a year now, and I've moved on completely after he broke my heart. We used to chat about being together and cuddling and all that cutesy relationship stuff, and then he went off and kissed another girl. Anyways. So his girlfriend would give me a hard time any time I'd hang out with him because she thought I was still into him and that I was stealing him from her and all that stuff, so we kinda stopped talking for a while. Life got pretty busy. I had my first breakup (with a girl, I'm bi) 3 months ago, and since it hurt pretty bad I wasn't into anyone, let alone guys (because of the same sex relationship). So now that it's summer and life isn't as busy for us, we started talking more and catching up, him having me convinced that his girlfriend didn't care anymore, (which wasn't true, I received some very nasty texts) we would go out biking for hours and talk about practically everything.

 Recently, as in over the past few months since we've started talking again, he's been purposefully flirting with me in a very outward way, commenting on my posts telling me I look good, talking about our past ideas about our relationship and how he wishes he chose me, and he's even mentioned breaking up with his girlfriend to me. Now don't get me wrong, my best friend is a sweet guy. He's in no way a jerk that'll cheat if he has the chance, and he's not a heartbreaker. But now, he has me stuck in this awkward position. I keep reminding him and bringing up about his girlfriend, to change the subject and get his focus off of me, but it always ends with his frustration with her and how he likes me better. 

The purpose of this long story is because I'm seeking advice. If I'm being honest, part of me is having some past feelings swept up from his actions, but I don't want to be with anyone right now. I want to become an individual on my own, I want to be independent. But being constantly reminded about him and his feelings towards me isn't helping me! I'm not sure how to reach him in this subject, as he dismisses me and tells me it's a joke. I don't want to hurt his feelings, let alone hurt our friendship. And I do not want to get in the way of his issue with his girlfriend.

294,"So, my boss, we will call her ""Kim"", is engaged and has already had a bridal shower for her family, and another one for her friends.  Now, she is throwing another one for herself in our office and has invited all of us female employees, but none of us are invited to the wedding.  Kim also handed us a piece of paper that had the info to find her registry with the invite, and not long after that, she e-mailed everyone a notification of an updated registry.  We were also each asked to do a certain ""task"", whether it be bring a dessert, plates, game, etc, as well.  So this shower in the office that she is throwing for herself is one we basically have to pay for.

The issue is that, nobody in the office is invited to her wedding, and nobody can really stand to be around her anyway.  She's definitely her own biggest fan, and feels the world revolves round her life. There are 9 of us female employees and we all feel this is kind of odd, I guess?  We've discussed it, and nobody wants anything to do with her self-thrown shower, but we also don't want to rub her the wrong way and be overly rude, as we don't want to rock the work environment.   But most of all, none of us want to buy anything off of her registry or pay into this shower with her ""tasks"".

The idea of just turning her office shower into a ""recipe shower"" was kind of tossed around, where we each write down 3 recipes we like and put them in a little box for her as a gift,... but we all kind of have the feeling, knowing her, that she would be very unamused and might throw a little fit for ignoring her registry/wants?  (the cheapest item on the registry by the way is $53, which for someone you like / know, sure, easy,... but for her is kind of a stretch)

Any recommendations on what to do?  Or what would be fair?  It's kind of dumb, but any input is more than welcome.

 Tl;dr: My boss that nobody can stand is throwing herself a shower for a wedding employees aren't invited to. Wants us (employees) to spend money on her. ",04Jul2018,1

On June 24th I was taking a picture of my [large] dog running towards me and well, she never stopped and ran directly into my face. It hurt like hell for the first few minutes but there was no blood, no runny nose, and minimal bruising. It did swell quite a lot. 

It's been over a week and while most of the swelling seems to have gone down, my nose is noticeably different (wider at the top and slightly crooked). Although it's not a huge difference, it is very obvious to me and makes me self conscious.

Will my nose be like this forever? Or will it eventually heal and go back to normal? Can it become crooked or deviated even without breaking it? Or is it possibly still swollen, even weeks later?

the night of new years eve before the big celebration started i had my friends pressuring me into asking her out. i made the big mistake of listening to them. Of course she was embarrassed, so was i.

anyway shit was stirred by the guy who i thought was my close friend, i was worried that he would be able to pull her and do what i couldn't i got worried as i didn't want to see a ""FRIEND"" go out with someone who i had a crush on.

1 year later since tour started today i still find my self having a crush on this girl i know deep down i have a 0 chance i just cant face it. As far as i know she now hates me.

In the biggining of our relationship my mother didn't care to much to hear about how my then fiance and I were until we got married and promptly had children. My family isn't that close, I  hardly see my siblings  and my father doesn't  even call us on our birthdays.. but the moment was born my mother was all over us about him.. actually she brought an uninvited person to the hospital when my first son H was born (this person was my sister but still not invited.. also my sister had only met my wife at our wedding) this is a reooccuring theme of our relationship. 

She always insisted on taking him places and having sleep over at a remarkably young age of &lt;1.. we tried to let know nicely that no one does that and that this is a odd request seeing as no one, not even my wife's parents do that and my wife's have a relationship with both my wife and I. 

This is setting the stage as it were for her personality.. 
FF and add another child in the mix now 2.5 and  1: 

Currently she babysits for us once a week and my wife make an attempt at least once a month to do something with her.. but the problem is any feedback or pushback we may give her results in her crying.  

For instance: she invited my same sister who invaded our dilvery room over to babysit with her (and might I add expected us to make her dinner).. we reluctantly said yes due to the crying episodes of weeks gone past.  But then she mentions her intentions to go outside in 42°c weather..so my response was ""why don't we do something outside Saturday morning, it will be cooler and we can go to the park... Its too hot today and Sister can come too. 

She welled up on the phone.. I could hear it.  And shut down saying things like ""I was a parent once too why don't you trust me"" ""I know I made mistakes with you but..."" 

I always, always reassure her of her parenting resulting in me.. but I have to be the parent of these boys...

306,"I’m 15/M. There is a guy in my class that loves Fortnite. Let’s call him John. He is a friendly guy, doesn’t get in trouble but he sometimes looks sad and stays silent and alone for some time.


Other thing that happens with him and his family is low income (this part is speculation, you will understand it later). His mother works trough the computer and he didn’t talk about the father. He also has a brother.


The low income part comes from the fact that, as I said, he loves Fortnite but he doesn’t play it. He doesn’t because he doesn’t have a ps4. The computer is used by the mother as a work tool but it is also really old. One day, I let him play in my phone and he loved it and screamed with joy when he got his first kill.


Now comes the part of the title. Since we are in vacations and since he likes fortnite so much, I decided to make a proposal. I would go to his house with my gaming pc so he could play Fortnite. 


Well, he simply said “I love fortnite but no, thanks” (Chat isn’t english, otherwise I would post it). I tried to insist until he asked me why I wanted it so much. I answered something along the lines of “Well, i’m insisting because I know you love Fortnite and I don’t have anything to do during the vacances, so yea”.


He said that he would think about it and that he loved fortnite (again), and that was the last time we talked, one week ago.


I simply don’t know if I should wait, ignore or just insist one last time. That’s because I don’t know if it is anything against myself (he could hate me for some reason, like being persistent), if it is his away of being (he could like to be alone) or if he is afraid/trying to hide something (like being depressed or even something worse, like domestic violence).


I think I am not the problem because he kept insisting that he loved Fortnite. The way he said looked like he wanted it but he couldn’t for a reason. He didn’t even tell an excuse for not wanting.


Now, this is a little bit of stalking, but he barely uses whatsapp. He goes there when someone says something in the class’s chat (everybody in the class uses whatsapp). He uses a lot more instagram but it can be to watch the stories or use the “search” thing and just see random posts. (I know this because I have been seeing whenever he gets online) which proves that he doesn’t really talk with anyone. (I know, I know, I only stalked him for a week, don’t worry, and yes, I’m sorry but I wanted to know).


I went trought a phase in my life in which I was alone for 2 years and I really didn’t like it, so I try to make other people not pass the same. I have my own group of friends but I also care for others around me.


I thought about inviting him to my house instead but as I said I’m afraid I am the problem.

I live in South Carolina and I'm 25 years old. I have been wanting a change in my life and have decided to move. I have $3000 saved up and can save more. My plan is below.

1. Get a roommate for less then $500 per month rent lined up before I drive to Vegas area.
2. Have a job lined up before I move which makes me at least $2000 after taxes per month. I have a lot of experience with production, warehouse jobs, assembly line work and currently make $1800 month after taxes doing that.

What area's should I focus on?  Spring valley? Paradise? North Las Vegas area? 

I was thinking about Henderson city Nevada.

I understand that anywhere in the country (no matter the main city) you can get a roommate(s) situation for less then $500 per month. I pay $400 per month including utilities for my own trailor in Columbia SC - where I live now.

309,"Hi,

My current girlfriend and I have been dating for two years and she gave me full disclosure about her friend (Tom we will call him). 

She told me when we first got together that she had slept with him and then it had faded out and they had just become good friends. Also is insistent that she wishes their friendship hadn’t started like that, and that she regrets the sex.

For a good year or so I thought that it was only a short term thing but last Christmas we were talking about it and she made it clear that it had gone in for about 4 months and that the sex was happening frequently. This misunderstanding was my own fault (I think it was a case of wishful thinking mixed with wilful ignorance). It still felt really bad though, I just felt like I’d been somehow lied to, stupid as that sounds.

She also told me that she had used the fact that her ex was uncomfortable with her relationship with Tom to punish him when they broke up. She went straight to Tom’s house when they broke up and refused to speak to him until the next morning (though she’s adamant nothing happened).

I am aware that the whole fwb thing occurred during a time prior to my girlfriend going through weight loss and that it is something she is ashamed and speaks very negatively about. She tells me that she had low self and throat although Tom messed her about and was pretty unkind to her that the attention was something she needed.

It also doesn’t help that I know he asked her to date him a good year and a half after they’d stopped sleeping together.

I know it’s not something that I can really be agitated about as it occurred before me and you can’t control what someone does. I haven’t been confrontational about it really and I have met up with Tom and his girlfriend for double dates and he’s a nice guy. I’d never tell my gf that she shouldn’t be his friend and I wouldn’t want her to drop him, he’s a good friend to her. All I have tried to do is be open about my feelings but it distresses my gf quite badly when I do so I tend not to.

It just doesn’t sit well with me. And I do sometimes find myself annoyed if he calls or if they meet up for coffee or if his name is brought up in conversation. I struggle because she is my first and he’s a permanent reminder that the same doesn’t apply to her. I also worry that there’s something brewing underneath that I am missing or whatever. I don’t want to be controlling and I don’t want to upset my girlfriend over something like this.

Any advice on how I can move past this? ",04Jul2018,1

when trying to fall asleep most nights i will slowly feel vibrations to the point i'm paralyzed and my body is lightly shaking, and then i start hearing voices and ""dreaming"" totally absurd things too. 

My eyes are totally shut during this period and i can only exit this ""jerk"" mode by consciously making a sharp move, jump, or trying to shout.

I lose any sensation of time, but I think it goes on for half a minute. The longer it goes, the easier it is to break out.

It never occured more than once a night, but almost always happens once.

Should i worry? I don't know how i should even call this, but i've heard ""hypnagogic jerk"" and ""sleep paralysis"" (i think the latter is unlikely, as this happens for a minute or less.)

313,"Hi everyone, 

I'm not sure if this is the right community for this, but right now it's the only option I have to get open and honest feedback for a problem my family is facing right now. Here is the story:

My grandfather is from Scotland, and recently, his 102 year old sister passed away. She was mostly blind and deaf, but still managed to stay in her own home until the end of her life thanks to the help of kind neighbours who brought her food, checked in on her, etc. Two of these kind strangers (Mr. and Mrs. X) met my grandfather on his last trip over for his sister's 100th birthday. They also sent a video link to my parents' email address of his sister's funeral service so my grandparents would be able to see it.

This year, since my grandfather is turning 90 and since his sister passed away, Mr. and Mrs. X thought it would be nice to come over to our country (Canada) as a surprise to visit him and my grandmother (age 92). Since they had my parents' email from sending them the funeral service, they contacted my parents with the initial promise of arriving 2-3 days before my grandfather's birthday and visiting them. They asked for local hotel recommendations.

My mom (the parent related to the grandparents in question) and my grandparents are unfailingly polite and nice. Too nice. To the point of inconvenience and getting themselves in a sticky spot. She, of course, offered to let them stay here for those 2-3 days as my grandparents ""would NEVER deem it acceptable for me to have sent them off to stay in a hotel. We HAVE to be hospitable."" I didn't like this idea mostly because:

1. They asked for hotel recommendations and

2. It inconveniences us and we literally do not know these people. They are perfect strangers. Even when my dad's parents would visit from out of town, they would stay in a hotel (my mom didn't like them). 

However, a few days later, they emailed my mom back and now their plans mysteriously changed to staying here for 3 weeks, and bringing their 20 year old granddaughter along for the visit. My mom has since been in contact with the granddaughter, and so far, we have gotten these details from them:

1. The granddaughter and the grandparents are unable to rent a car, and thus, are totally dependent on others for transportation.

2. The grandparents have no desire to do anything really touristy, at least not immediately. All they want to do is see my grandparents the moment they step off the plane, and to continue to visit with them throughout their trip....even though they really don't know them, or us. 

3. We don't really know their budget.

4. They've already completely booked their flights and paid for everything.

This is hugely inconveniencing us and my mom is now panicking about how to politely let these people know they are imposing on us. Our situation is this:

1. My grandparents are 90 and 92. Their health is not in the best place, and it's very difficult for them to get around, do tourist-y things, and even really host people for extended periods of time. Some days my grandmother doesn't feel well enough to do anything at all, except for just take it easy, as her heart and breathing have become quite laboured. 

2. Our house and my grandparents' house is not that big. We have one guest bedroom that could accommodate 2 people at most. We do have a cottage where we could send them for a week, but my dad would literally have to drive them up there (3-4 hours away). They are also planning on coming in August, when it is my mom's 60th birthday, and she wanted to be up there for her birthday to  celebrate as it is the nicest time of the year then.

3. I am currently studying for my Common Final Exam for accounting (CFE for Canadians reading this thread), and it is a hugely expensive and time consuming process. I can't be entertaining the granddaughter during the day as we are supposed to treat studying as a full time job. Frankly, I don't want to either. I have a boyfriend and friends of my own who I want to see in my spare time, not entertaining a perfect stranger.

4. We are a 1-hour train ride away from anything remotely touristy, and they would need rides to the train station. Anything else exciting and touristy is even further from our city (we're 6 hours away from Ottawa, the nation's capital). 

My mom and my grandparents don't know how to deal with all of this, and they cannot say ""no"" or be even the slightest bit mean or impolite to save their lives. Everyone my mom knows (myself included) agree that she opened the door to this whole situation by saying that they could stay with us for the 2-3 days they originally presented  us with, rather than just giving them a list of hotels....now she needs to  find a way out.

My question for you Redditors is this, on behalf of my mom: How do we politely let these people know that the timing of this trip and the situation they have placed us in is not ideal/that they are imposing on us? What should my mom write to this 20 year old girl (she is emailing the granddaughter) to let her know that she will be unbelievably bored if all her grandparents want to do is visit with my grandparents? 

TL;DR: Perfect strangers who only know my family through a relative are coming to visit my grandparents, but have no transportation, plans to stay anywhere other than with us, or trip plans other than to visit my grandparents, who are old and not in the best health (or up to visitors). How does my mom gently tell them it's not the best timing?",04Jul2018,1

316,"Sorry this is rambly, I’m on mobile and I’m kind of just thought-vomiting.

So my boyfriend (18) and I (18) have been dating just over a year now. Let me preface this by saying, I care about him a lot. He’s hands down the genuinely nicest person I know. But lately I’ve felt a little ignored, and there are some things that have bothered me for a while that are starting to be hard to ignore. 

He’s very immature. He has the sense of humor of a 13 hear old. He and his friend “Derek” make Youtube videos with Pokemon figures. And whenever his friends are around it’s like I’m invisible. He never invites me to hang out with him and his friends, and if I am ever in a group with him he totally ignores me. 

He also has really bad time management skills. He’s always, always late. We’ve missed a lot of movies and reservations in the past. He always apologizes but it never changes. And more than once he’s promised to pick me up from somewhere, and then when he’s supposed to be there to get me he’ll text me that he can’t make it and I end up having to get a ride home from a friend. He’s also canceled multiple dates over text by saying he “can’t explain right now”. It was always some family thing, like he had to babysit his nephew or his family wanted to go to out to dinner together. It always feels like he’ll pick anything over me, and the fact that he doesn’t even take the time to explain why irks me. 

My mom has pointed out to me before that he doesn’t treat me like he should, and I definitely do see that sometimes. But the thing is he’s such a good guy and I really do care about him. I know people will say we should talk about it, but I just don’t know if he could be better. That sounds mean but it’s just who he is, and I don’t want to force him to change who he is for me. I’m just really conflicted. I don’t want to hurt him. but I’m not happy in this relationship. ",04Jul2018,1

I visit my country Romania every summer, live with my grandma here(who raised me). But I have a few problems which really makes me uncomfortable. 

1- Since I lived in Turkey for 10-11 years I forgot how to speak Romanian properly, I can speak and understand the language but when I try to speak most of the time I say gibberish bullshit(and if you dont know, people here are very harsh in social ways. If they see one mistake of yours they'll make fun of you. Ofc that could be just a problem of my region.)

2- My friend group who I try to meet up sincerely does not give a fuck about me. They go to the pool, out, bbq parties. And I usually dont get invited. I am a social guy in Turkey, and feel comfortable around most of the people. But here oh boy, my friend group and the language factor makes my self-confidence go down a lot. I cant even hold eye contact with a male person(I dont even mention my eye contact with stranger females, its worse)

All these things makes me sad, especially when I dream all the time about my country and when I love it so much. I tried talking to  my friends a lot, I tried to get their attention by starting discussions but they still dont care about me.

I really want to get some therapy and go on medication(even if it's just to help with the sleep), but the problem is my sister. When my mom passed and I had to move in with her, she made it clear that I could ask for anything. So I've been asking to see a doctor about my depression and anxiety for at least two months, but I still haven't gone. I've also been asking to see a dentist for over a year, still nothing.

327,"Well, Reddit said to make an interesting title. My optimal title would be ""how to cope with imposter syndrome when there's no way getting around your limitations, but have created a personality based around things you've learned and which you like to tell others"". I don't know if weeds ruined my brain, I heard it reduces your grey matter, and can make neural connections weaker. Ive been smoking pot since I was 14 basically everyday, and I'm 17 now. Basically the absolute time to become a pothead since my brain is maturing. I cant cope with my mental limitations, like sometimes it will take me about a minute to recall something that I know I've learned. Sometimes a couple hours. I know that's a bad example of how my mental limitations make me unhappy, but there are more serious things like making statements concise, and picking up new words. When I was 14 I remember being able to memorize a list of 25 words before a test and getting all of them right. I cant do that anymore. Ive read that weed decreases whatever neurotransmitter the hippocampus releases, so that could be a cause for my bad memory. But also I read someplace a long time ago that some kids who were once bright peak in intelligence around 14, and precipitously drop. Im not sure what the hell is wrong with me but I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know if I have imposter syndrome, or dunning Kruger syndrome. I don't know if what I'm saying is even remotely accurate or if I'm making this hippocampus- grey matter- intelligence peak shit up. Im mean, I honestly would kill my self if I didn't love my family.

(Long story short I spent two months in a relationship with someone who blew hot and cold and wasn’t emotionally available, and he was insanely difficult for me to get over.) I met his friend while I was still with my ex and he seemed like a great guy. For obvious reasons I wasn’t romantically interested in his friend when I first met him. But  anyways, a year after my ex and I had split, his best friend matched with me on tinder. I figured he just wanted to hook up but he didn’t, he actually tried to get to know me. We’ve had an on and off friendship for like two years. Part of the reason it was so on and off was because I was still casually hooking up with my ex, whom his best friend lived with. I felt like a jerk for being so indecisive about which one to stay in contact with and I talked to my ex’s best friend (let’s just call him Blake), and he was totally understanding of my indecisiveness and didn’t harbor any frustration over it. Well my ex and I haven’t hooked up since about two and a half months ago, and Blake wasn’t there when it happened. I stopped keeping in contact with Blake because even though he didn’t feel like I was being a jerk by being friends with him while hooking up with my ex, I still felt bad. I felt like I should get whatever lingering feelings and urges I had for my ex out, what a while (like 6 months to a year) and then once I’ve completely rid myself of my ex, then it would be appropriate for me to talk to Blake again. But he would message me as if to check in on me. It kinda seemed like maybe he missed me. At first I would respond but would try to keep the conversation short. But Blake moved out of the place he shared with my ex, and started to miss Blake more. So I slowly started messaging him again. At first he seemed like he reciprocated the interest. But the last three conversations we’ve had he seemed absent from the conversation, kind of like he was just responding to be polite or avoid causing drama. He says he’s been busy working and making art. But the last message from the last conversation we had, he hasn’t read in a week. It’s possible he just isn’t aware i sent him that last message but he’s never left any of my messages unread for so long. I was never romantically open with Blake until we revealed that we had liked each other. I worry that I may have been too forward in the past. (I wrote a poem that I told him was inspired by him but was embellished,  and if he sent me cute selfie on snap chat once in a while I would screen shot it and tell him he looked cute.) but I think it’s also possible he pulls away because he’s still not 100% over his last ex and he doesn’t want to mislead or mistreat me. I have no idea what to think. Does it sound like Blake is blowing me off? Or is it possible he just forgot to read my last message and I’m overthinking all of this?

338,"So it's more of an online thing, as we live in different states.

I'll get to the point. I've had an instagram account for a while and decided last week to see if she had one and she did. That's cool and everything until I saw her story and she was with another guy which confused me because she said she had gone out with her family. Then I go on her account and she has pictures with the same guy, dating back a year to now. They weren't kissing or anything like that, but it still concerns me. I mean, the fact that she hadn't mentioned this guy seems strange to me. 

Forward to a day later and I tell her I have an instagram account and if I can follow her. Now this bit is real sketchy to me. She says to hold on a sec whilst she ""makes her page look tidy"" which meant that she deleted the pictures with her and this guy and then telling me to go on ahead. 

So I'm convinced that she's dating this guy but not telling me about it, like maybe she just wants me around for ""fun"" as this guy goes to university I think and is probably busy. Funny, I'm convinced she's lying about her job too and is actually just seeing this guy. 

The thing is, we live in different states so I can't really tell if she's lying. We mostly text so it's hard to tell what she's really thinking, like guilt maybe? Idk, I just feel used. I have no idea what to do. 

Should I tell her that I know all this and confront her? I'm pretty convinced that she's been dating this guy for a few years as they went to school together I think and maybe she's bored in her relationship hence her texting me. I may not be the only one too? She probably has a franchise of this shit and it hurts because I do like her, and the fact that she's lying to me and telling me how special I am to her sounds meaningless thinking about it. 

I want to know the truth but I don't know how to get it. If I tell her this shit and it's not true then I'll look like an asshole and she probably won't forgive me, but I can't sleep well knowing that she may be lying to me. I don't really want to feel used anymore. The fact that she deleted those photos is a big sign, but I also saw a guy in a reflection of one of her photos she sent me and I'm sure it's him.

339,"Hi everyone! I'm 15 and I recently moved to a new school due to intense bullying that left me hospitalised for a few days and led to my 10 year old sister being stalked.

My time at my new school has been going fairly well, the only issue being that the examination board is different so I'm years behind on most subjects. This has proved incredibly difficult as I'm strongly academic and the only real thing I was ever good at was school work. I've understandably been extremely stressed because I'm now faced with the prospect of failing school.

I've always struggled emotionally but my parents refuse to acknowledge anything is wrong and refuse to take me to a counsellor, so I'm quite frequently extremely depressed. The school says that it cannot intervene without my parents' permission.

Moving school has opened up a new opportunity for me to try and cope via a social life, despite the fact I'm both slightly autistic and gay isolating me. Nevertheless, I've finally met people that it's safe to be around and call friends.

I had my birthday recently, and as my dad hadn't been payed that month I had to save up for my party. This is the first party I had with friends for five years so I've spent a lot of time preparing. I made decorations, cooked a meal (Which I've since left in the fridge. Oops its probably rancid now...), and most importantly I spent £300 on a go-karting session that is due to take place this Sunday.

Over the past two weeks or so I have noticed that people respond to me with annoyance and disgust, and I just can't t work out why. This makes me slightly suspicious when every single one of the eleven friends I invited to the party cancelled within the same two hours with no excuse. 

I'm not able to cancel the go karts so I'm probably going to have to race by myself. Family members are refusing to join in and I don't have any more friends I can invite. I'm extremely sad about this. For once I thought I finally had some friends but I'm really not sure. I've wasted time and money and I've started falling back into loneliness and depression. 

I just don't know what to do in this situation. All the preparations are wasted and I can't properly participate in the activity I booked. The go karting centre has refused to refund me and my friends aren't responding to texts (which they've all seen). I feel lonely and let down and I'm slightly lost.

340,"So I was in a year and a half long relationship, my first real ""wow I could be with this girl for a while relationship"". Through a mix of things it ended, we haven't talked since and she doesn't have me on social media anymore


She just graduated high school (we started dating when I was a senior and she was a junior) so she still lives in the same town/county. She was at a park party that the fire department puts on every year. Well my step dad is the fire chief so he and my mother were there running it and she saw her there

I come home for 4th of July and my mother starts to tell me. She asks if I still talk to her and then she says ""yeah well I saw her (ex gf) at party in the park, she was with (female friend of hers) and..."" 

I asked her to stop talking about it and excused myself. Idk why it got such a reaction out of me but it made my stomach turn, I went to the bathroom and thought I would cry.

My life has been so shit lately and I feel so alone, but she always just made me feel safe and secure and like someone cared alot about me in this life. Now that I'm not with her it's like a huge part of my life is gone. Even hearing about her makes me depressed, and I'm really bummed out just from that little bit my mom was telling me about",04Jul2018,2
341,"I'm 29.

Essentially, title.

Non-essentially, I have never met my biological father. Mom ran away with me at a super young age (~3 months) because he did something bad. I don't know what that thing is, as my mother doesn't retell the story ever. I know some advice will be to talk to her more. I'm looking for additional advice. 

Recently, my mother was contacted by my biological Aunt through Facebook. She relayed that my biological grandma is dying and would like to meet me as a death wish. I was her first grandchild apparently.

Surprisingly, my mom is okay with this, and even encouraged me and said she'd go with me. She worked in hospice for many years and said closure is important. She said both of my biological Aunts and my biological Grandma were always good to her.

So I ask: Do I grant this dying wish to a grandma I've never known? Does what my biological father did (or didn't do) matter when it comes to meeting her?",04Jul2018,1
342,"It's been about 8 or 9 months since I've been with this company and I resigned because I had to go to uni. Today I checked their blog and they erased my first and last name off every post I've written for them and labelled it with ""Admin *company name*"" instead. 

Though I did sign a contract with them saying that everything I write belongs to them, this has to be unethical on some sort of level, right? They aren't 100% wrong to replace the author name with ""admin"" because I was an administrator. 

Not sure what I can do or how I can approach the marketing team about my concern.",04Jul2018,0
343,"As the title says, I need help not associating all sexual things to an old friend I had. To keep our relationship brief, we were something of friends-with-(mild)-benefits with some emotional baggage shared between the two of us. Its fizzled out now, with little communication between us, but I can safety assume its over. But now, whenever I see something that revolves around sex, the pleasures of the body, or anything of that nature, I think of that person, and my stomach sinks, and I can't help but feel like shit. I feel like I wasted my time and energy. Did I like that person? Kinda, but I just want to stop thinking about them whenever I see something about pleasure or sex. ",04Jul2018,1

345,"I played sports my whole life and it was so much fun but it's just not something I don't find fun anymore. My body is very laid back at this point and I already feel like my legs are old but my parents just think I'm lying to try and get out of doing sports. I just want to focus on my academics but my mom insists on playing a sport because it will make me look like a well rounded person, but I already have a job and I'm very outgoing if I need to be. Is a sport really necessary to get into a good college? Is there any way that I can convince her to change her mind? ",04Jul2018,1
346,"So, there's no way I can catch you up with everything that has transpired in my life. I'm writing a book about what happened, and it's already a phone book. [Here's a brief synopsis of the main points of what happened.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/8l49a5/returning_to_civilization_or_how_i_escaped_a_cult/)

I'm obviously traumatized, but it still hasn't completely hit me. I'm in a real good mood most days, but I can tell I'm in shock. It feels like I'm about to get hit by a tidal wave. [Its like everything's trying to get through the door at once, and it's stuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0euMFAWF8) I'm seeking out therapy and support groups, and trying to socialize so I can surround myself with people to help reel myself back to normalcy.

[It's also really messing with my mind, and has made me take another look at my identity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/8vk8bp/the_ijuggs_gets_drunk_and_spills_the_beans_stream/) I don't know how to go about addressing this issue. Well, I do. I need to branch out and experiment, but there's the hard part. This part of me has been so suppressed that it freezes around people. I always feel like I'm locked up in my head and can't connect because I'm always on defense.

What are some things that would be good for me to try? Any advice on how to cope with the emotional aspects of these things, or on being comfortable in my own skin?

347,"Hi Reddit. Throwaway account, because some people knows my real Reddit and I rather not let them know. I'm fairly young (18F), but I'd like to know what I want to do in the future. 

2 Years ago I applied for the study International Media &amp; Entertainment Management, I was supposed to go last year, but I failed my year so I had to redo my year. This year I applied for the same study but also applied to European Law, as a back-up in case I wouldn't have been accepted, but I also really like to be involved in law and stuff.

However, since I was a young kid, I always looked up to police officers. The thought of enforcing the law is amazing to me. But there's such a negative reputation to Police officers (which I understand but slightly disagree with), and I don't want people to think badly.

Obviously my parents and my whole family wants me to study European Law, because of the salary possibility. But I'd also like to go into the Media &amp; Entertainment business, because that's where I feel comfortable in. But I also want to be someone off of the police force. In short, I just don't know what to do.

I thought of studying Media &amp; Entertainment management and when I'm finished with that study I'd study European Law. And maybe as last resort to join the police force. What do y'all think I should do?

\*\*TL;DR\*\*

\*Don't know if I want to study Media &amp; Entertainment management, European Law or join the Police force. All three of them are of great interest to me.\*
