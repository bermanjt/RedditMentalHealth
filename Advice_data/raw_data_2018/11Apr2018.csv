0,"Just throwing this out there from a “throwaway” account....

Is it weird that a teacher (professor) of mine asks me personal questions? What my spouse does for a living? Not the first time either. Since I’m in town for school stuff, where I am staying? I’d hate to overreact if it’s innocuous however...The vibes are weird man. I hesitate to contact now because I’m afraid “Mr. D” will get the wrong idea. ",11Apr2018,1
1,I have plans to visit this guy in his city this weekend and he already booked a hotel. What do I do? ,11Apr2018,1
4,"For some relevant background information, I lived with family until I was 30 (basically) with only a two year break where I was living on my own (best time of my life!!).  I moved back in because my mother/brother are disabled and my dad, who used to help support them just took off one day, never to be seen or heard from again.  My mom needed care and was not in a position to move, my brother was an emotional mess and neither of them could afford the rent without a third contributor.  So, that's been my life until recently.

The thing that made this the most heart-breaking for me (other than losing my dad, obviously) is that I'm an extremely social person who has a lot of friends, most of whom I'm very close with (as close as I am to my family) and virtually all of whom I've been neglecting for a long time because my family home wasn't/isn't a place that's conducive to hangouts for several reasons.  The main one is that my brother often has panic attacks when people are over and feels like he needs to stay in his room the entire time.  I've been having people round at an average of about once a month tops for 7 years now. Between this and many other similar circumstances in my life, I've felt like I've never had any aspect of my lifestyle on my terms- but especially my social life.  The entire time someone is over, my stomach is in knots, worrying about whether my brother is okay, whether he's upset with me, etc.  I have fantasized literally every day about being able to finally live in a place where I can just have people over whenever I want, spontaneously and without (for once in my life) having to think about/worry about others.  I want to just invite people round and have a good time without it feeling like an act of cruelty.

Eventually, I met the man of my dreams!  I'm not exaggerating when I say that this guy is *perfect* for me in *every single way* apart from one.  We've been together for a quite a while now, and we're transitioning into living together.  We're super compatible, we're both clean, friendly, honest, emotionally supportive, understanding, love the same things, etc.  A *lot* of stuff is on my terms now!

The thing is that he doesn't like having people over.  At all.  Part of the reason for this is because he grew up in a place where he had almost no privacy; he's always been an introvert (which I honestly really like about him) and he's a quiet person all around.  On top of this, he works at home- so, basically every day, we're both living in his office- and he doesn't want people coming over to the house while he's working, since it makes it really hard for him to concentrate hearing others around or even just knowing that there is someone in the house, even though we're in separate spaces and whatnot.  Similarly to my brother, he feels like he has to sequester himself until they're gone, and he also wants to have a say on who comes over and when.

The upshot of this is that I can't really have people over without feeling bad.  I feel like I need to get permission to see my friends and it completely ruins the entire experience of inviting someone over for me because all I'll do is worry the *entire time*.  Even when he says he doesn't mind someone being here, I can tell that he actually does and that he's on edge, anxiously waiting for it to be over.  The emotional burden of worrying about that is so extreme for me that it's just easier not to have people over at all.  Which sucks, because I've put so much effort into making the house and garden really beautiful and fun for visitors.  :(  I really poured my heart into everything.

When we had that conversation, I felt crushed.  I can't even describe how much I was looking forward to finally having that weight lifted from my shoulders and being able to invite people in for tea (I have an awful lot of tea pots and tea cups which have been collecting dust at my mom's house), making them feel *welcome* instead of having to make excuses all the time, cancel plans, try to politely make them leave, always insist we go out, etc.  I mean, obviously, I can go to other people's houses (that's primarily what I do, and have been doing for years and years), but I REALLY wanted to be able to FINALLY have people over at my place and not have to do backflips trying to be polite and explaining why nobody is ever allowed over, and no, they can't come in for a quick sec.  I love being a host (it's one of my favourite things in the world) and I want to be able to make people feel like they are part of the family, as they have done for me at their own houses.

In the past, I've explained the situation of my family to many people, but they would tend to just advise me to ignore the needs of my brother (which I honestly found callous as well as unrealistic).  I'm afraid to tell people about this new situation.  I'm worried that they will just write my partner off as controlling without taking the time to appreciate our dilemma.  But I also don't want to have to go out to other people *all the time*, wasting money to get around, rarely being at home, etc.  And most of all, I can't bear the thought of having to continue living my life making excuses to blow people off.  My partner and I have discussed this at length, struck up reasonable compromises and whatnot, but I really don't know what to do about the anxiety aspect (from him and me).  I just want to feel like he's going to be okay with it if I have someone over for the day.",11Apr2018,3
6,"So this is actually an ongoing issue and I could use some advice.

Background, a couple friends and I co-own a house (cuz it takes the combined income of 3 people here, grumble) and we plan to add on since we have a huge backyard.  Problem is, my housemates are somewhat lazy, very messy people, so various items lay scattered about the outside, especially in the backyard, and the husband's idea of cleaning up the inside of the house is to throw crap out in the backyard.  He orders delivery all the time and just lets nature break down the boxes (I have stopped cleaning after him; Im not their maid).

Recently, the city has sent Code Enforcement to talk with us a couple times to order us to clean up our front and back yards: I know the garbage and recycling bins are to be out of sight except for pick-up day, but they havent said any other specific rules we are violating aside from take care of the yard and dont throw boxes and garbage out back.  They did imply that nothing can be out front.  We havent been served with an official fine or letter; they have been polite and seem to be trying to keep it off the record.

Now my housemates' plan is to build a fence in the front yard, keep all the items behind, and tell the city they can ""get a fucking warrant"" to check we have cleaned up the backyard.  IE, comply only by hiding the garbage and not actually fixing the issue of PICKING UP THE FUCKING GARBAGE!  I want to keep on the city's good side, especially since we have plans to remodel and will need special permits; this shit could jeopardize those plans.

The advice part, how do I convince them to clean up after themselves?

I do have a plan and I wanted to check with y'all on it.  I think I can call back Code Enforcement to meet me on a day when I am the only one at the house, show them the backyard without the housemates' knowing it, and get A) more specific things to fix from them and B) get some harsher words on what happens if we don't comply.  I am 95% certain that with a proper warning, I can convince the wife and together we can convince the husband to actually comply.

I know that I could let husband escalate and shoot himself in the foot (I have stories of him doing that before eg the night he spent in jail or his Groomzilla moments if I can find the right sub) until fines and/or a court case, but that would likely include me in the collateral damage and I really dont need this as well.",11Apr2018,2
7,"tl;dr: My friend is having a depressive episode and hasn't directly said anything about it to us (her best friends), and she's ignoring our attempts to reach out. It is making us miserable and she's done this before. When is enough finally enough?


Looking for some practical advice here. I'm a college student and I live in a suite-style (double + double) dorm with 3 of my friends. We're all sophomores. My roommate (let's call her A) is one of my best friends, as is one of the girls who lives in the room connected to ours (who we'll call B). The fourth girl we live with is a friend of ours, but we're not super close, so this only really concerns A, B, and I.


B has a history of mental illness. She's been diagnosed with both depression and anxiety and has hit a few low points in the time I've known her. When we first met freshman year, she was in the midst of an extremely toxic relationship. B absolutely idolized this girl and would drop everything for her. She lost herself in her girlfriend and put this girlfriend's needs above her own. Whenever we tried to speak to her about her relationship, she would get incredibly defensive and insist that the girl was a good person. She ended up getting cheated on and they had a messy breakup that was dragged out over the course of 4 months. A few months after the breakup, B admitted to us that her relationship had been toxic. B was emotionally abused by her ex-girlfriend, and she openly admitted it.


Fast forward to now, about a year after B and the emotionally abusive girlfriend broke up. Around January-ish B started exhibiting signs that she was in a bad place again. She would joke about how bad she was getting and about how her medication was off. She went to see a doctor and got an anxiety diagnosis around this time. Besides the jokes, she was acting pretty normal around us. Our mutual friend (M) who has been through depression himself encouraged her to seek out counseling.


At the end of February, B started dating her girlfriend, L. Almost immediately after they started dating, B began to withdraw from our group of friends. She lives in the room right next to us, but we started only seeing her a few times a week. She started going into the city (about 20 minutes away) every single day after classes with this girl. They would go out to eat, walk around the park, go shopping, etc. literally every single day. This was hurtful because, in the past, B had complained to us about she was broke and she couldn't do things with us. Suddenly she's finding the time and money to go out and do/buy things every single day with this girl.


At this point, recognizing that B was behaving strangely, M had a heart-to-heart with her. B admitted she knew she was behaving in an unhealthy way, but she was going through a depressive episode. According to her, the reason she was spending all of her time with this girl was because she didn't feel like she had to put on a show to make her happy. B had been ignoring us because it was too difficult for her to be around us and put on a facade of happiness. She said she'd talk to her girlfriend that night and tell her they needed to work on spending more time apart. 


It has only gotten worse since. We haven't even seen her. She comes into the room and ignores us. She still hasn't even told A and I directly what is going on -- everything we have found out has been indirectly, through M. We have all tried to reach out and she says she'll talk to us, then cancels the day of. The other night we found out she was crying to her girlfriend and saying that everyone would be better off without her. Since she was actively threatening suicide, she ended up talking to our RA and the police got involved.


I've never had depression so I don't understand much about it. I'm trying to be understanding and I want my friend to be okay. But at the same time, I'm incredibly frustrated. This is the second relationship that B has been in in which she completely drops A and I. She tells M she's miserable and then sends Snapchats to us of her smiling with her girlfriend. She posts about her constantly on social media. It's upsetting, and we've tried to reach out to talk about it with her but she won't talk. She doesn't care about how the situation makes us feel. I understand that the depression is making her withdraw, but she's spending every second of her free time with this girl and can't even find it in her heart to inform us about what's going on. She hasn't said one thing about her mental state to us directly.


I care about my friend and I don't want to abandon her in her time of need. But I feel like this goes beyond her depression. This is the SECOND time she's entered into a relationship and grown obsessed with the person she's dating. This is the SECOND time she has completely dropped her best friends for a girlfriend. It's been upsetting me for a month and a half and I can't even tell her it's upsetting me. I care about the way she's feeling, but I also care about myself and I don't want to continue a relationship that makes me feel this way. Is it wrong of me to end this friendship?",11Apr2018,1
8,"We've had this apprentice in for the last 10 or so months, who's been doing an alright job but he keeps butting into conversations and meetings when he hasn't been asked to.

I understand the position he's in because I was in a similar one a few years ago. I know how it feels to want to be part of what's going on in the business and not being able to do so but it's starting to get out of hand.

For example, I could be having a quiet conversation with someone about their weekend or how a meeting with a client went (doesn't matter whether it's work related or not; it happens all the time), nothing loud enough to be heard from a few desks away, and he will literally wheel his chair over and slide in in-between us to join in.

Or even worse, I've been on the other side of the floor, talking to my manager about something really personal like when my hospital appointments are and he still walks over and says ""what we talking about?"". I try to be curt or non-responsive to him but it seems like he doesn't get the message.

And as for butting into meetings, similar scenario as before; talking to my manager in a meeting room (glass walls and you can see who's in them) about my job performance and he just opens the door and asks if he needs to be in here. He just seems to just try and get involved in everything whether he's invited to or not.

I know he means well because he clearly want to be taking part and I guess he's just being over enthusiastic. Like I said before, I know what it's like to be new to the team and to the industry as a whole but it's really getting out of hand. Multiple people have acted like I have and tried to carry on as if he's not there, or even say 'this is private' but the message really isn't getting across and I don't think anyone has taken any steps beyond this.

I have no 'power' above this person whatsoever, I'm a few positions above him and it isn't my place to discipline him. Whenever I bring this up with management they tell me to not be so serious as he's new but he's nearly been here a year and his behaviour has hardly changed.

What can I do to try and relieve this? I really don't want to come of as condescending to him and I also don't want to be perceived by management as undermining them and taking matters into my own hands.

I wish I didn't know this sub. I wish I never had to. No one will take me seriously either, they won't take me seriously for anything; and I sit and worry about pointless shit that will come and go. I've spent my life worrying about the outcomes and consequences of the decisions I will make, yet because I'm such an indecisive cunt - it always turns out bad. I can't make decisions and because of this, I'm socially inept and unable to work under stress. I hate my life, I hate who I am.

11,"I’m just now finishing up my first year as a computer science major, and then coming to the realization that I have no skill in it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I’m getting bad grades, I’m finishing the first year with a near 4.0, I just don’t think it’s a good fit for me based on passion and how I learn and study. 

The only true passion I have is drawing. I spend a good chunk of my childhood becoming a better artist and studying anatomy (my specialty is drawing people). In the summer I could spend upwards of 8-10 hours a day just drawing and studying art. I have no drive to do something like that for cs, that’s why I’m worrying about my major, I feel like I’m going to be some average OL, with only a basic understanding of her job, doing menial work. I think that just might kill me.

Of course I know there’s no money in art, but it’s truly the only thing I got to offer in terms of talent and skill.

I (f 19) have been with my bf for over a year now. A few months ago, I moved in with him and his parents, partly to escape emotional abuse that I have suffered my whole life. I never expected to solve all my problems this way, as I have been diagnosed with multiple mental disorders including depression and anxiety, but recently Ive been feeling just as bad if not worse than before.

His parents get into constant screaming matches at the drop of a hat, no matter the time of day. His dad is never sober as far as I am aware and cant take care of himself, but is constantly belligerent to anyone who tries to help. They both talk down to me and my bf frequently, no matter what the subject. Everyone wants to leave, but no one has the means to move.

21,"Hey, thank you in advance for reading and any advice!

I'll try to keep this short but the subject of the post is my best friend of 5 years.
We've never been anything more than friends and he's never shown any interest before November. We were drinking and he confessed he was attracted to me sexually. We talked a lot and figured we were both on the same page - we were both attracted to each other, single and happy to have emotion-free sex. Just to note, I trust him with my life and wouldn't enter into a fwb relationship with just anyone!

Anyway, as he was drunk and I'm not attractive in any sense of the word (super overweight too) I asked that we wait until the next day to take any further steps. He agreed, we spoke the next day and he was still sure he wanted to sleep with me. So we did and it was great. 
Afterwards, we didn't really discuss it much but he insisted he enjoyed it and would be interested in doing it again. Since then it has sort of come up lightly, and we've spent a lot of time together since...but he's made no moves.

I'm too awkward and afraid of rejection (due to the whole ugly thing) to make the first move and he is fairly confident. A few months back he was comparing his exes to foods and mentioned I was like chicken nuggets - super enjoyable but you shouldn't have too much. I asked what he meant by that but he just said he didn't want to get used to having sex on tap and stop making an effort to find a relationship, but that he would be interested in doing it occasionally.

That'd be fine with me, but it's been several months and he has had plenty of chances. I'm going crazy, being with him was so good and I'm totally up for doing it again. But I want to stop hoping the whole time we are together that he will start something. I just set myself up for disappointment and I've stopped being able to enjoy him as a friend.

I know I should be a big girl and use my words and ask him outright but I wouldn't even know what to say - if I could possibly get the words out!
I wonder if there is a way I can find out more subtly? Thank you!",11Apr2018,2
22,"Long story short:

* I graduated from university with honours but I didn't like the program that much and don't want to pursue it further (dropping out was not an option so they don't know about my 'mental health' at all)

* I picked a college program that I thought I'd actually like and be able to get a decent job upon graduation (and experience!)

* I got accepted and told my parents

* They are angry because I didn't ask for permission (but the real reason is that it's not prestigious enough and they'll have nothing to brag about to their friends)

* They want me to choose a new program even though I've already said that I don't want to be a doctor or go to graduate school (graduate school could be a possibility in the future, but right now I'd get eaten alive)

* If I stick with my original choice, my parents will probably disown me 

* Even though I'm sure of my choice, I can't take any more yelling or threats :(

25,"This is crazy and has me stressed out lol. First off, I haven’t been in a relationship since middle school, but I was very interested in this girl my senior year of high school. She was more or less using me as a rebound. She was hanging out with me, making out, and she was very close to taking my virginity. However, right before, she ditched me out of the blue for another guy and I built up trust issues. After 4 years of college, I’m a 24 year old virgin, but by choice pretty much. I hate falling in love. I feel like the girl has control over my emotions, I’m stressed out about the relationship, and all relationships usually come to an end and leave you in pain. My dream is to become a stand up comedian and I’ve been telling myself “ I will not get into any relationship until I achieve my dreams. If I fall in love with someone, I’ll have a family with them, that love will die off (divorce rate in the U.S. is like 70%), and I will be trapped having to support a family by working a regular 9-5 and not be able to chase my stand up dream. I will live in misery and regret.”To get my name out there, I started a channel on mixer, which is a video game streaming service where people watch you play games and chat with you. I enjoy it because I make people laugh. However, 2 days ago, a curveball was thrown my way. This 25 year old attractive female from Cali started to watch me. On my channel, I have no filter. I talk about how many times I masturbate a day lol, my fears (even the one about being trapped by a woman), that I’m an ass man lol. She was constantly putting “hahaha” in the chat box. I always talk to the viewers and said I’m from “dc” and she says she is visiting DC in two months. I don’t think anything of it, but just continue to talk to her and all the other viewers in the chat. The more I talked with her, the more cool she seemed. She likes video games, going to the gym, living a healthy lifestyle etc. and I’m the exact same way. There was a lot of other things we have in common too. I started to feel like she liked me, but thought maybe she was being a flirt. However, she watched me for 5 hours straight. Today I hop on and she immediately tunes in. This time I actually start to “voice chat” with her and we play games together. I’m still not thinking this is going to lead to anything and that we will just be gaming friends. However, it becomes very obvious that she is really into me. She ask for my snapchat and starts snapping me, she asks me when my last relationship was, talks about how she can’t wait to come to DC and get her hands on me! The fact that I met a girl, let alone a very pretty girl, on a video game streaming service is hilarious. It just reminds me of that saying “love will come to you when you least expect it” lol. However, I don’t know what to do and this is not a part of my plan. My plan is to work, live with my parents, save up money (I already have 20,000 saved up), begin stand up comedy, and then move wherever stand up comedy requires me to move. If I meet with this girl, especially have sex with her as a virgin, I’m going to fall in love and get waaaayyyyy off track. I’ll be to focused on her. I’ve seen what love does to people, let alone virgins. I could see myself moving out, living in California with her, not being able to save money, having a kid, starting a family, that love eventually dying off, and then me feeling trapped, miserable, and my dreams out the window. I can’t let this happen. I like this girl and don’t want to break her heart, but I cannot fall in Love, which I see as a trap. Any advice? This has me stressed out and scared lol.

I have been crying daily for the past days and haven’t been able to move on properly. I know it’s been only like 5 days but it sucks. I’m not use to this, even the usual rebound doesn’t attract me, it just hurts and sucks. I started praying, praying for a miracle and for her to come back. We were both majorly into Wiccan culture and I could feel the stars and sun are completely unaligned.  

I’m sorry everything is a complete mess, I really am. I already lift and play games but it isn’t enough. I even tried tinder and I got nothing but bot matches. The cruelest of irony. Tomorrow I have off from work and I fear it so much.

29,"i'm a 16 year old with a single mother. my mother is a schizophrenic, borderline alcoholic, and apparently she smokes meth.

i found her pipe and meth in the bathroom last night, on the counter, under a towel. she was obviously hiding it from me. i haven't talked to her about it and i really... don't want to. she has a tendency to get angry and yell at me so i don't want to piss her off.

i called my big sister last night, whom is a recovering addict, and she told me that our mom had been lying to her about being sober. she said she'd talk to her about it but she hasn't called today, afaik. she lives a city away and can't easily come over.

i'm afraid to tell anyone because i don't want cps or the cops to come. everyone i know, except for my sister, would call either the cops or cps or they'd rip me away from my mom. i have a therapist, but i don't see her until next week and there's really nothing she can do either.

30,"The title may sound weird, but I'm 18 and I've done a lot of reflecting on my life experiences. The story starts at home where my father was very emotionally abusive once he lost his best friend, his occasional drinking became every single day to the point where he would put mortgages on the house to buy himself alcohol. When I was in 4-6th grade my bullying was so intense I started cutting myself and always thought of killing myself. I needed attention from somebody and I had no friends or family I could reach out to. In 6th grade I started reaching out to older men (early to late 20's) telling them I was 16, when infact I was 9. I obviously did NOT look 16, nor did I even look 12 I absolutely looked my age. I started showing them anything they wanted in turn for them to give me attention. It got less severe the more older I got but I started telling my best friends in junior high I wasn't a virgin (I was) and started dressing really slutty to get 9th graders attention. I met a guy over facebook and I told him I was 16 again (after I revealed my age after 3 years of dating he told me he knew I was not 16) and he was the first guy I had sex with, we had sex the summer of 2015. So yes, I was 15 but have been dating him and performing oral since I was 12. This is disgusting and I am not proud. My mom found out and instead of calling the cops she just let it happen because I told her we were not having sex (because we werent) I would sneak out late at night and hitch hike to see him, and be back before my mom knew. These kind of child predator relationships went on until I was 16. Lots of different guys and I was convincing myself I was an adult and he would never hurt me. I was emotionally abused for 4 years by multiple adult men, they would tell me I was useless and ugly and all my friends hated me, so I pushed them away... this let them toy with me to a point where if they left me and slept with other women I would apologize and beg them to come back to me. I understand this isn't all their fault and I am at fault too but now that I am in a healthy relationship I truly see what everyone else was seeing. My self harm continued and I developed anorexica. My best friend and I both were anorexic, and self harmed... She told me I couldn't be anorexic because I was too fat and I was a self centered bitch. I started my journey with only purge bulimia- I wouldn't eat anything and to relieve my stress during the school day I would excuse myself to the bathroom to vomit at least once per class. I barely ate anything and was 100 pounds but I was still bloated all the time and wasn't skinny to the point where anyone cared. To this day I still have self image issues and this let me be a target for child predators almost my entire life, I have never trusted anyone other than men older than me and I have a hard time telling people because the only people I've ever told just judge me... A lot of young girls now post pictures and videos on social media and attract these men, a lot of these girls are flattered and are victims of child predators if not murder. I don't want anybody to go through what I did, and this post cannot sum up my years of depression and self hatred, but I just want to stop at least one girl from making the same mistakes that I did. After finding out about Katelyn Davis I have been seriously motivated to try and help, because that could've been me. ",11Apr2018,2

36,"So there's a little bit more to this story actually. In December I moved in to an apartment with two of my friends who had already been living there and whose names are both on the lease. My name hasn't been put on the lease, but every month we split the rent, utilities, and WiFi three ways equally. In May, another one of our friends is moving in with us but apparently isn't going to pay rent \(meaning that we would keep splitting the rent three ways instead of four\). We haven't discussed it yet as a group, but obviously it would be unfair to not split the rent four ways. I'm sure that when we discuss it, we can come to a solution, but if the three of them do not want to fairly split it four ways, would it be wrong of me to simply move out? I have several other backup options, and technically because I am not on the lease for this apartment I am not obligated to stay here for any amount of time.

I am only going to need a place to live until mid\-September anyway since I will be graduating soon and leaving the country to start a new job.

I'm a senior in high school, and only have a few weeks until I graduate. There's this cute girl who out of the blue started liking me, and I myself am pretty interested in her. For some reason, and let me tell you it is frustrating, I can't work up the balls to talk to her. I've barely made a move and its been nearly 2 weeks, and I can't tell if she's losing interest in me, but she still acts very awkward around me too.

38,"We were trying to park and there was someone who was taking up two spots with their hazards on, waiting for someone. We partially pulled up behind them and we waited for them to move forward. After around a minute I opted to get out and ask them to move forward, but my dad said that’d be unsafe (I’m a white 16 year old guy, for perspective). After around 90 seconds he just decided to back up and drive past them to find another spot. We both looked over to see who was in the car and it was a black (hopefully not a factor to him) woman with someone in the back seat. He looks back to the road and mutters “dumb bitch” in a tone I’ve never heard him use before. I was very taken aback and I muttered “you really shouldn’t say that”. He was silent and around a minute later he said “dumb person.., I meant.” 

Sometimes he calls women “chick” and he’s said n***a before when making fun of the hip hop I listen to, and he always laughs until my mom and I have to tell him to stop doing that. 

I doubt he’s actually hateful, I think it’s just from ignorance and/or not adapting to society’s rapid changes, but I don’t know what to say or do. I felt a pain in my chest when he said it and I was scared. Anything helps. Thanks.",11Apr2018,0
39,"Honestly everything is going pretty great and I cant complain. 21, male, live alone/fully self supporting with an exciting job etc. But I find I can never just relax. Other people my age seldom ever do much except after work just calmly go home and watch netflix and sleep and never plan anything.

I always plan every single thing in my life, months in advice, years even. Each day I have a list of things I want myself to do. Every single day I am planning in my head for the future decades away too like how I want my career to go etc. In addition, I am always angry at things that I cannot control like insurance, taxes, etc.

How do other people get away with not planning and just going with the flow? I would never achieve my goals that way. 

In addition to this, I have 2-3 friends but we don't feel too close and I've never felt close to anyone except immidiate family. In my everyday life, am not shy or anxious and I am confident unless you go deep down. But that is because I never try to do more with people than just be acquaintances; I stay where I can't be hurt/rejected/fail. If I ever tried to have a girlfriend or something, I would feel incredibly anxious because I have no confidence because I don't like myself deep down. 

So a whole load of problems but boils down to 1. Always stressed/beneficial and negative over-planning? 2. Lack of and lack of ability to obtain close connections. 3. Lack of love for or value in myself, honestly just believe I am shitty person to others.

46,"Thanks for clicking and reading, any advice welcomed. Sorry, I forgot ""is"" in my title. 

My parents fought for custody over my brother and me for nearly 18 years. My grandfather, who is 1-3 months away from passing away is a significant legal presence in our hometown and funded my mother's court fees. He mainly kept it going to save his reputation.  

She was an alcoholic and abusive for many years, yet managed to keep custody up until the end, mainly due to my grandfather influence. 

To complicate things further my brother and I live 4.5 hours (by plane), so traveling is both stressful with work and time-consuming. My mother is only prepared to offer half the flight, while she has been gifted 35,000 dollars to reno her house from my passing grandfather.  

I respected my grandfather for his intelligence and life story. He is 98 and fought in WW2, successful practice, etc. We got along informally during my childhood, while I was too young to grasp what was going on. I still feel compelled to go back on that note. 

I can't tell if my feelings to go back are due to my need to do the right human thing for my passing grandfather. He has expressed he would like to see us. 

Or, if I am just being bullied into another situation by a selfish mother.  Who again will easily spend thousands on herself, while making me feel guilty for asking for flight cost help. 

To add one more complexity, my grandfather set a $60,000 trust for post-secondary school for my brother and me two decades ago. When my father finally won custody, the trust money went to my mother who spent it on alcohol and a powerboat. My grandfather to my face told me it never existed, which of course I had the document proving it did. 

TL:DR - Grandfather dying, abusive mom wants us back, torn on the right human thing to do.

51,"Warning - long story 

I[22f] grew up in a religious environment. My family or at least majority of my family grew up in the Church of Christ. Missing church was not an option unless you were really sick. Lately my faith/beliefs has been decreasing not in God, but in the church itself. I have been questioning the Christian religion for many reasons most are because of things I've experienced in the passed. Not only that my family are quick to forgive for any situation no matter how had it is. I've also been through a lot from ages 5-19. I went through bullying both at home and school, child sexual abuse by family and non family members between ages 5-9, and sexual assault by my sister's husband at age 19. During the time of the pain I got little to no family support whatsoever. When I first told my parents about the sexual abuse I went through by my brother they didn't do much about it except my mom got in his face and told him she hated him but later on apologized for it and said she didn't mean it. My parents didn't get me into counseling or anything after knowing about it, which has messed me up as the adult I am now. I did go through counseling from middle school through high school but I got into counseling because of trusted adults at school. When my mom knew about me getting into it in middle school she wasn't happy about it. I think she wanted to keep what happened from people outside the family. Pretty much she was protecting my older brother.  As for the assault, it happened 3 years ago and I'm still suffering from it now as we speak. When my family knew about it I got the same results as when I told my parents about the abuse, nothing was done about it. I went to therapy for help and it helped me a lot, also I got support from my best friend, and my first cousins whom I'm very close to. Sadly, for two months now, all the years of hate, anger, and resentment has finally surfaced due to me holding it in for so long. I'm not the type to hold a grudge or hate someone. Anyone who knew me would tell you I'm always sweet and forgiven but I think that me is slowly dying. The reason why these negative feelings surfaced is because I have told my mother and my older sister that I don't want her husband around me (no I never reported him only because my sister stayed with him and I don't think there would of been enough physical evidence to put him behind bars. He harrassed me physically by touching me without my consent and was sending me inappropriate text messages of my dumb self deleted them and I know not reporting him isn't helping either but you wouldn't understand unless you've been through it yourself). Yet she still does  bring him around even if she knows I'll be at whatever event we have regardless of what I said. I feel as if my family does not have my back and I feel disappointed and sort of betrayed. I took a semester off of college because all of this was affecting my ability to do schoolwork. I'll be going back to school in the summer to finish getting my degree. But once I do I'm leaving my hometown, and honestly I don't ever want to come back. I'm done talking about what happened because nothing was/has been resolved. I've comtepletating on cutting ties for these pass two months. The only ones I won't cut ties with is my first cousins. So I guess I'm asking for advice as to, should I cut ties with my family or sit them down and try talking to them? And is it right that I feel the way I do towards them?",11Apr2018,1

**Would a psychologist with a PhD be more skilled at treating clients than psychotherapists with less education?** I am wondering if I should switch to the psychologist before I continue more sessions with my current psychotherapist.",11Apr2018,1

66,"
Monday 6.45pm- got a call from a female wanting medical certificate, told her that I can write a medical certificate for her if she comes in before 7pm. Told her that is she can't  make it before 7pm,  she can try getting the medical certificate from pharmacy X since they're open till 9PM and she should check with the pharmacist on duty there if they can write her one.   

(The customer is a local and drives. and pharmacy X is only 3 minutes away by car from the store I'm at. Pharmacy x is owned by the same boss.) 

At 7.00pm, we proceed to close the store. Tills were in the safe by 7.03pm and getting ready to leave. She arrived at the front store at 7.01pm and the staff told her that were close.   

Customer told her that I'm writing her a medical certificate and staff went down to the dispensary to check with me and said she's refusing to leave.   

I went to the front door, told her that it's past 7.00pm and I am not writing the medical certificate for her.   She then made a scene for not getting a medical certificate and accused me of calling her a liar.   She said ""I was here at 7.00pm and now you're telling me that you're not doing it for me?! You're doing this to me on purpose! I'm going to report you! Don't you worry."" Then left the store.   

Now my boss is asking me why couldn't I stay 5-10 minutes past closing time to wait for her and write her a medical certificate. And he's saying how UNETHICAL  it is. 

Jokes. 

I'm not even getting paid for staying back. And neither will the other staff get paid.   

I used to love work a lot. I would stay back 3-5 hours past my paid hours just to prepare the store for inspection together with other staff. And I do not get paid overtime. Sure he paid me some money but NOT what I should get. Same shit happen when it was flu clinical week in the store ( and this was when the boss wanted me to arrive early and leave late to prep for flu clinic). I never get paid for what I am suppose to get for all those extra hours. 

My question is how is it unethical that I refuse to write a medical certificate? I am not obligated to write one anyway (as per guideline). How is it ethical that an employer expects employee to stay back and not pay them? What should I do now? ",11Apr2018,2

All I can think is why would you want instagrams without a following to advertise your brand?

They said to but 3 items from the store (the items were very cheap.. almost too cheap) just to show that I was actually interested in supporting their brand which seems pretty legit  but idk..

68,"Hi, I'm really interested in how people who not in China think about this, let me introduce it in short:

Someone  \(Let's call her CO, Cat owner\) CO said she is sharing a house with an  international student（call her RM） who also come from China. CO and RM  is fine with petting a cat which belongs to CO in room, and RM claims  she like cats. RM wanted to post CO's cat on Douyin\(a Chinese short  Video website, maybe like Vine or some else\), but CO didn't agree.

Later,  a CO's friend told her she saw her cat on Douyin, with MAKE UP. CO felt  angry and asked if RM did this, because she saw some lipstick still  left on her cat's. RM admitted it. And from that time, CO's cat start diarrhea.

CO called the police and  complianted her roommate ""abuse animal"". Now if RM is chargeed with  abuse animal, she maybe eject from US. Some of their friends put the  heat on her because they think this is ""too much over"". So she asked if  she really did it wrong.

Well, I think  what she did is OK, but there also a lot people think she really did it  wrong becasue she ""ruined her roommate's future"". Also some claims that  ""I'm in Canada and I asked some friends of my husband, they all think  that CO is exceed"", REALLY?? I want to hear some REAL international  opinions.

My writing isn't very good and my grammar isn't at a level that it should be for someone my age, so sorry about a potential headache you may get reading this. Oh, and some of the examples I'm going to include are pretty out there, but I'm including them anyway because I want whoever is reading this to see the length I'll go to continue my awful habits. I'm sure I don't have to tell the internet this, but please don't hold back. If after reading this you have come to the conclusion that I'm just lazy, or whatever your conclusion is, please tell me exactly how you feel.. I need all the advice I can get, thanks!

I've done literally nothing with my life, not a damn thing. I can't even say that I've graduated high school. I'm twenty one years old and I've never even had a job. My only friend is my great grandmother, who I live with, and I've never had a girlfriend. I sit in my living room all day and night playing video games, eating my life away. I'll wake up every day saying today will be the day I get my shit together, but it never happens. By 4:00 PM, I'll somehow convince myself that it's okay if I eat 10 pieces of bread, cheese, and cereal all at the same time. I'll make excuses like, “Oh, tomorrow is Sunday, I'll just start then.”, or, “The start of the month is just around the corner, I'll start then”. If I forget to do something, like say make my bed, I'll use that as an excuse. If I wake up late, I'll use that as an excuse. This is going to make me sound even crazier, but I'll make excuses like this: For whatever reason, I dislike 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Dislike is probably the wrong word, I don't hate them, I just like 1, 2, 4, and 7 better. So say it's April 9th. I'll make up an excuse that it's better to start my diet on the 10th rather than the 9th, but even when the 10th comes, I'll make up some other stupid excuse and the cycle continues. I'll eat a bunch of garbage, get all depressed, and then act like tomorrow will be completely different. This is all very confusing to me because I have committed to a diet and stuck to it for an extended period of time before. In May of 2016, I was 320 pounds. By December of that year, I was down to 250. When I hit 250, everything changed. I can't stop eating now (literally can't go 24 hours without breaking the diet I set for myself), and since December of 2016, I have gained back 35.1 lbs of what I lost with no end in sight.

I'm 6'2, 285.1 lbs. When I look into the mirror, I'm disgusted. I've always been shy and introverted, but the disgust I feel towards myself heightens my anxiety when I'm around other people. I lock myself in my room when family comes to visit my great grandmother. I can't look strangers in the eye and my communication skills are God awful. I have no problem communicating with my great grandmother and some other family members, but when it comes to strangers, it's like my brain short circuits. To further cement how much of a coward I am, it's taking everything in me to even post here. I want to get a job, get my GED, go to community college, and then transfer to a four year university, but I don't feel like any of that is possible until this weight is gone. I want to do something with my life, but I'm stuck. I've been stuck for what seems like forever. My body is in shambles due to the abuse it has endured. My mind feels like it's starting to slip. I'm easily agitated and I feel like I'm always on autopilot. I feel like it's important to state that I'm not suicidal, I would never do that to my grandmother. Speaking of my great grandmother, my failures have impacted her greatly as well. Our apartment is barely suitable to live in. There are too many things that need to be replaced in our household for me to list. Our cat is old and diabetic. Bills need to be paid and food needs to be put on the table, all of which is on her shoulders because I'm too much of a coward and too broken to get a damn job. She deserves so much better but knowing that I still fail day in and day out to change. What the hell is wrong with me? Am I just lazy? How can I change?

Tl;dr Can't stop eating. My body is broken and my mind is starting to feel like it's slipping. I want to change, but I keep failing. Am I just lazy? How can I change?

P.S. I'm sorry if this post is all over the place, I just have so much on my mind. Thanks to everyone who read and gave advice. I'm going to bed after posting this so I won't be able to respond until I wake up. Any and all advice is welcome, thanks!",11Apr2018,2

78,"A friend of mine had an iPad and left it in my house. She asked for it back, but I was on the road, taking a trip for the weekend, and couldn’t get it to her. When I came back, the iPad was gone.

When I told her the iPad wasn’t there, I got no response. A few days later, I asked her if she knew anything about it, and again, no response. Finally, I told her that I had to assume she had broken into my house and taken it back, given that she wasn’t responding to my questions. I thought that it was weird that she didn’t care more about it.

A day later, I decided that I had to take action, because she didn’t even respond to my accusation, which I thought was indicative of guilt (keep in mind, I knew she read them because of read receipts.) I told her that I could only assume that she really had broken in, and it made sense because I knew of at least one time that she had before with a friend. The message didn’t deliver, presumably because I had been blocked.

I sent the message over Snapchat, to which she only screenshotted. When I asked if she was going to talk, she told me that she screenshotted my message to keep record in case I tried anything, and that she was appalled that I even accused her. When I told her my reasons and asked to talk more about it, I was blocked. 

Now I feel like I am at an impasse - I know for a fact that she has broken in once, and strongly believe she has done it again, I want to call the police. This is because my roommates have noticed things go missing as well, and it needs to get taken care of. What should I do?

Note: She was a friend at one point, but I noticed that she was toxic (as was the other friend that broke in) and have since essentially cut ties. ",11Apr2018,4

so i got his snapchat and i snap'd him right away... but my friend said i was making myself 2available. so now i reply in like 30min-1h. So does he though.

81,"I am a senior in highschool... that should've graduated last summer.. but I didn't because I stopped going to school. I wasn't always like this, I used to go to school... well I would cut classes sometimes but I would still go to school. I had friends, and people I knew and people to talk to. Everything was going well, until Nov 2016, I decided to transfer out of my highschool and go to my local highschool... It was a bad and dumb decision, I did it because I go to a specialized hs so it's more advanced than regular public school. So i decided to transfer bc m grades were not good, and I haven't been going to class. And i thought if I transferred I could do better in a regular public school and never had to go back to those classes i've missed... and face the teachers and stuff.. But when I transferred, it was fine at first. But shit just got worse and downhill from there. I literally stopped going to school for months, and I would go for liek a few days. And then I would stop going. So I did not graduate on time. And then I thought to myself, that I would do better this time around. That I would just graduate early in January and go to college for spring semester. BUT I didn't. Bc I could not go to school. It is so hard to even step foot into the school building, and it's so hard to walk into a class. Especially when you dont know anyone and have no friends. And everyone already knows eachother bc they're seniors. June 2018 is my last chance to graduate... bc I really dont want to be 19 and still in highschool... I'm just so scared to go to school bc I don't want to be judged, and it's inevitable bc I'm that kid that hasn't been to class in months. I don't want any attention. I really just want to move on with my life. I literally have 3 classes, and its literally 2 hours of school. So I don't know why its so hard to go :(

87,"Title. I'm in the second semester of college at the moment and Im having doubts about my degree and whether or not I should continue going to college.

Right now my major is Psychology and I'm working towards getting a Bachelor's of Science degree. I wanted to take Psychology and become a therapist because I went to therapy myself for a while and it really helped me. I'm a generally withdrawn, highly-sensitive person so I thought it'd be a good fit as well. I'd be working generally one and one, and it'd be a lowkey, not intense setting.

Or so I thought.

I got involved in a club recently as a volunteer and the lady who runs it is really nice. She's one of the only people at college that I feel I made a genuine connection with. We ended up talking alone with each other in her office because her other two student employees left (we all meet for an hour once a week) and I wasn't in a rush to go home because my home situation is abusive. Anyway, we ended up talking just about some simple stuff and I somehow started got onto my home life and become a quivering mess and I just started unloading how I feel. I told her I went into Psychology because I wanted to be a therapist because it helped in the past and I thought it would be a good fit and I'd decently enjoy. Which is the truth. It's not my passion, but I would like it decently, I would get paid a good salary, so why not?

Or so I thought. We talked more and I told her I really liked the arts and writing. She looked up the program the campus had for a creative writing (I think?) degree. This is because I'm particularly interested in fiction/storytelling. Turns out it's possible for me to complete a creative writing degree on the regional campus. So I can do it if I want to.

But I don't know how I feel now. Upon reflecting, I feel like my perception of a Psych Major is distorted. I haven't looked up the in-and out's of what it means to be a psychologist. (I.e, their working environment, what it entails) I just know what I've seen in my therapy sessions, and I all saw was that they take notes on a computer.

I feel so foolish now. It's like I've dived head first into something I don't know anything about. And now I'm shaken up because of my talk with my club manager. She told me to follow my passion and not give up my dreams to become a writer. If I wanted to become a writer, become a writer, she said.

But I don't know...  I did like writing for a time, for a long time, but I haven't written for joy for a long time.  What if I don't like it anymore? And even if so, I'm sure being a Creative Writing Major comes with its own set of problems and challenges. It would still be a job, which is still different from writing as a hobby which is what I did.

I don't know... If I were to become a Creative Writing Major, I wonder if I would even be satisfied. That's what I'm afraid of. Jumping ship and the possibility of it being a huge mistake.

And I want to write books. Or I did when I was writing. I know, I know, THAT job is something you do on the side on your own time while you work on your real job. I get it. But what would that mean for me? If I became a Creative Writing Major, would I be able to become a journalist, editor, or something else? Would I be able too? Would I like those jobs? Is writing even my passion anymore? Do I have something I'm passionate about anymore?

I don't know. I don't know, I don't know.

I'm just so conflicted. I mean, a job is a job. I'm paid to do the job, not because I like it. So I wonder how much I'm allowed to want for myself. But, on the other hand, I'm not sure if I like my current path. I've only taken one psych class, general psychology, and I liked that well enough but I don't know what the rest of the path is going to be like. And I recently got hired for the first time as a server at the school I go to, and I can't fucking stand it. I only work once a week and that seems like almost too much. I hate it. It's tense, it's competitive, it's stressful, it's busy. It's pretty much the opposite of what I am, which is a relatively introverted person with a need for harmony in their environment. I am intensely uncomfortable with conflict, partially because of my abusive background.

Am I expecting too much from a job/career? After all, I need a job, period, so that makes me feel I can't be too picky. On the other hand, I despise my server and job and I feel like it's too much for me to take despite that I'm doing the best that I can.

Honestly, I went to college because I felt like I had to. I've gained a lot from it but I'm not sure if I feel like I'm glad I decided to. And now it feels like it's too late to turn back, or so I feel.

What do I do?

**TL;DR Psych Major in College, feeling doubtful because I don't know much about the job, the lady who runs the club I'm a member of at college suggested I follow my passion. I told her my passion was the arts, and specifically fiction writing. That would mean a creative writing degree if I wanted to pursue that. Except I haven't written of my own volition in years and I don't even know if I would like it anymore. I don't know what I want to do or what my passion is. Help?**",11Apr2018,4

However the past few months, she has come down with really bad inflamed gums. I’ve gone to two different vets and they both gave her a steroid shot, however the second shot seems to not be working and she hasn’t eaten in about 5 days. This has costed me $243 already. They vet told me if this shot doesn’t help they will need to do blood work, a dental cleaning and possibly even a full teeth extraction. The estimated cost for all of this is $4,000.

89,"I really like making people laugh and I feel like I know how people think and work on Youtube and the Internet enough to make something special. I have been a lurker since I started using it around 2008. I feel like I can create some really cool content to share with the world.

However, I have so many obstacles personally and on the site itself that slow me down. Youtube, for example, is really shitty sometimes with how it treats its channels and it favors content over other content. Also, I am really bad at following through with things unless I have to, like my jon for example. Even programming, something  that I used to do all the time, has become hard to continue doing. I got into a full time job recently and it's been taking up most of my time. I have a really hard time focusing and I zone out a lot. Some of my co-workers are starting to get frustrated with me because I'm actually failing to follow through on certain things. I'm not depressed or anything, I'm just frustrated with how painful it is to just go and finish something for once. I promised this guy on Reddit that I would finish a game for him and I never did because I never made that time. Instead, I get caught up in how I'm not using the right language or if I should just scrap it and learn Unity.

My other problem is that I live in a house of four. If I wanted to stream to Youtube or Twitch, I would have to be loud sometimes in order to be entertaining and it is nearly impossible with everyone sleeping. I get texts from them throughout the night about how I'm keeping them up. I used to livestream for about a month and gave up because I was keeping my family up at night with my laughing and joking. I get it, everyone deserves their sleep and I respect that more than I would want to ignore it.

So I had to make a decision that I would either have to disregard my family and try to get some progress on the Internet or accept that it just wouldn't work with the obstacles that life gives you. I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I feel like it's a lottery at this point.

90,"So my mom and my stepdad have been together for 4 years, that’s how long he’s lived with us too, they only recently tied the knot. I’m 14 now, and he’s acted strange around me for a little over a year now. For a couple years it was just always continual arguing between us and my mom would always make us apologize to each other. But it seems about a year ago he started acting strange. It was 2016 late summer early fall and he just always gave me hugs. Hugs and hugs and hugs, still does to this day. Around September I moved in with my bio dad for a while. Around this time my stepdad always texted me. Everyday. More than my current boyfriend. One day I had texted my mom about how I was feeling self conscious and sad about my looks. Idk maybe my mom told my stepdad or he was looking over her shoulder, like he does often, but the same hour he texted me “heard you been feeling down because of your looks lately” and I was just casual and thought he was trying to be a good dad. But then he started calling me hot, and sexy, and even said he found me more beautiful than my mom. He asked if I had used the condoms my mom bought me. And just general questions like about what my boyfriend and I did, which I blew off with stuff like “oh we just hangout” or “I don’t wanna talk about if I kiss him”. My creep radar went off and I immediately screenshotted everything. Once I moved about with my mom in December thing were just the same as before I left, my mom did know about the texts. He just seemed to hug me more often, and longer, and always wanted to talk to me and sit by me and ask me questions about my romantic(or ig him prying to see what I’ve done sexually) life. I used vague answers and just avoided him. Me not being an innocent child I snuck out of my home in August of last year. Phone was confiscated and nudes (not full nudes) were discovered. I was grossed out that my mom would show these pics to him. And then he’d always comment on how my boobs were getting bigger after this. Or when I was shopping for undergarments he’d closely watch me. This school year I played football and I had to wear a compression shirt which I could not get off on my own. Typically I had the volleyball girls pull it off for me. Or my mom when I got home. This particularly day I got inside too late because I owed the coach pushups so the volleyball girls were gone. All I had on under was a bra so my male teammates couldn’t help. My mom was out with a friend. I would be stuck in this. So I agreed to let my stepdad take it off because my little brother was already asleep. He grab it and pulled it off. After he’d taken it off he let his hands fall and trace the curve of my upper body before he left. I had my back to him so he couldn’t touch my boobs but brushed against the top of my butt. He’s always given me hugs and gotten upset and distant when I’ve had my boyfriend over. And when I got my phone back he made me delete the screenshots from our old conversation off ALL sources, through conversations and off my google photos. And then when I’m irritable and just want everyone to leave me alone (like tonight, I should mention that I specifically asked everyone to give me space, and clarified it’s because I’m irritable) he comes up and hugs me. I’m blaring my music through my headphones and reading on the couch and he just hugs me. I crunch away because this makes me uncomfortable. He had pulled one of my earbuds out and asked what’s wrong with his nasty breath right in my face like his face was an inch from mine. I just said I’m irritable. He goes wtf and I put my headphones back in. Idk what he yelled but I know he kept yelling at my while walking off.  He also randomly puts his arm around me and kisses my cheek really close to my lips. This makes me uncomfortable and mimicked past behaviors of my last molester (which when I was forced into telling them he had accused me of lying and got my mom on board even though she believes me now that it’s too late). Idk. Should I tell my mom I’m uncomfortable. Anytime I’ve said something similar she tells him. And he starts a fight. I should mention he makes my mom happy even though she can do better. He has cheated on her and called her fat and ugly. I just can’t stand him anymore. I can’t put on a fake smile anymore. I don’t feel safe in my own home. And if I posed the question, me or him, I’m afraid she’d choose him. My therapist says I have two options. Which is the me or him question. And sucking it up till I can move out. Which is 4 yrs. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna ruin my moms happiness, but what if he’s just holding her back from all this great stuff she can accomplish (like going back to school), a better partner. She’s had guys throw themselves at her. Any guy would be lucky to have her. But she can do better. And I don’t wanna live with him anymore but I don’t have any other places to live.",11Apr2018,20

92,"I'm graduating from community college in May, but I feel such guilt about it and feel like I don't deserve it. 

A bit of background: I've been attending this school for nearly 9 years. For most of that time, I just kind of floated around, not sure what I wanted to do. I tried to take the classes necessary for an A.A., but after struggling and dropping them shortly afterwards, I decided to focus on classes I enjoyed that WEREN'T required. After a few more years of dabbling in different subjects (usually half-assing or failing), I realized that many of the ""fun"" classes I had taken and done well in (As and Bs) fulfilled a large portion of the requirements for a Certificate of Achievement. I decided to take the hint and pursue the remaining classes to complete that certificate.

3 years later, I'm wrapping up the requirements, while taking ""filler"" classes to bump me up to 12 units per semester so I can continue to work as a student worker. Most of the filler classes I take I'm either A) getting by okay or B) straight up flunking but still staying above the minimum GPA needed to continue working.

Now, it's almost graduation day, but I feel like I've done so little compared to my classmates. You always hear ""Obviously you worked hard, you deserve to graduate"" or ""You are the achievers"" type-speeches, but in my case, it seems more like ""you technically fulfilled the requirements laid out by the state education board, so here is a piece of paper saying so"".

I'm not transferring to another school after graduation. Again, I'm getting a certicate, which is pretty much the bottom rung of the ladder as far as degrees are concerned.

I felt like such a fraud buying my cap and gown. Has anybody else felt like this?",11Apr2018,1

99,"Okay I’ve volunteered at this horrible ass summer camp for the last two years for like 450-500hrs because I’ve been in scouts for a while and giving back and shit and college apps yadda yadda yadda. Anyways, I’m now 16 and I can legally work for wages so I’ve applied for a summer job at a grocery store close to home, and I’m also looking into taking summer classes that I’ve been waiting to take because education truly is my passion and I really enjoy learning. Furthermore, today my parents told me that I can’t work there and that I’m working at the summer camp and they said I cannot work at the grocery store (or any other job) and I can’t take summer classes because I already have made a commitment to the summer camp (I DIDNT MAKE IT, MY PARENTS FUCKINT DID). Last year (2017) when I was volunteering up there I pushed off 2 summer classes, for the sole reason that I thought I’d be available and able to take the classes next summer (2018).   This would be my first year that I’d be able to spend with friends and do things a normal teenager does and enjoy myself with friends that I’ve missed out on for high school. I’m a pretty bright kid and I can’t tell you how much I genuinely want to learn and take classes and the desire is really strong. Another thing, if I worked at the summer camp I’d be making less than minimum wage (id have to pay for housing and food (which is like glad my earnings) also I’d be working ~ 14hrs a day and be getting paid for 7 of them each day) If I worked at a grocery store, I’d be making pretty much twice this, id have free time to enjoy myself, and I’d be able to take classes. I also hate the camp because unlike me pretty much everyone up at the camp does some form of illegal narcotics, some pretty intense shit too. They are have no ambitions, they all lack basic problem solving and any logical analysis, they’re all rude and mean to me. I can’t stand being up there, I genuinely don’t know what’ll happen to me if I’m up there for 8weeks. I don’t understand why they won’t let me take classes and make a decent wage, that’s what I want to do, any other parents would let their kid take extra classes in the hopes that they’d enjoy themselves. I fucking hate my life when I’m there. ",11Apr2018,1

101,"Background info:  I did not get along with my roommates whatsoever this year (they were all random) and decided to move out of the apartment and into a house with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. The apartment was paid for by my parents but since I’m on two leases now, I am responsible for paying my rent and utilities at my house (boyfriend and I split it 50/50). Money has always stressed me out significantly but now it’s even more serious and can actually affect me in the long-run.

Because I’m so stressed out and my mind is pre-occupied with paying bills and working, I’ve slacked on school this semester. I’m in my second semester of my sophomore year at my state flagship university.

I am 3 points away from failing one of my classes. My grades in all of my other classes aren’t great but this one in particular is very bad because it’s already my weakest subject in general. It has nothing to do with my major or minor and I’m only taking it to pass our core curriculum for graduation.

I’m already 3 points above the failing grade but I know it’s going to be near impossible for me to pass our last two exams. I don’t know what I’m doing and there’s not enough time for me to catch up. 

My school does offer a grade forgiveness program where I can retake the class and it won’t effect my GPA. However, I still have to have the bad score on my transcript before they’ll let me apply for grade forgiveness and then retake the course.

In the meantime, I’m going to lose both of my scholarships this year. Combined they take off about $5,500 on my instate tuition. Not a lot compared to the price of tuition but I was fortunate enough to have my parents pay for all of my education and to not take out any student loans.

I feel like when they see that I’m not getting my scholarship, they’re going to force me to take out a loan to cover the difference. From what I’ve heard about student loans, this is my worst nightmare. I’m already dead broke. My account is in the negatives as I’m typing this. My degree is not going to give me a good paying job unless I completely work my ass off.

But I’ve lost the motivation to go to school. I sleep in a lot of days because I can’t see the point in going. This has a lot to do with my mental health but I just feel like the stress from money and school is all interconnected.

I can’t ask my parents for money but I need advice on a good way to explain to them the situation I’m in. I feel so lost and hopeless. I’m ready to drop out of school because I just can’t find the motivation to finish.

How do I tell them about me failing my class? How do I ask for help? I know I shouldn’t drop out of school but would it be a smart decision to take a semester off and work and save money?

I’m sorry this may seem unorganized. I’m rambling and also on mobile.

TL;DR I’m failing a class and stressed out about financial issues. How do I talk to my parents and get help?",11Apr2018,1

103,"Hello there. 

I’m a freshman in high school and I feel invisible, especially at school.

Most of my friends have basically deserted me. I only have a few people who I consider a friend, and even then they never prompt a conversation with me, I’m the one doing that. No one asks how I’m doing or initiates a conversation. No one texts me, no one asks me to hang out, nothing. I’ve grown accustomed to it by now but it bothers me. I’m not the socially awkward kid who talks to no one and sits in the corner. This hasn’t really been an abnormal thing to me till now. I’m an honors student so my peers are all people who everyone knows and have massive circles of friends. Everyone knows them. People know me, they just act like I don’t exist. I sit at a lunch table with people who I used to be friends with but now I’m getting kicked to the curb soon, to be replaced by others. And it’s not like I’m the person who isn’t involved in extracurriculars, I’ve been involved from everything from musicals to woodworking to athletics. I’m not the person who usually is quiet and talks to no one but it’s looking that way for now. 
 Anyway I can change this?

106,"I was laid off for the first time in my life a few months ago, and though it's through no fault of my own, I know it's messing me up badly.  

I originally went to school to learn game design, specifically level design, cause I taught myself how to use the level editor that came with Unreal Tournament when I was a kid and I wanted to learn how to do more. I was naive, and I heavily romanticized the game industry since I did very little research on what the job itself was like. I took a two year animation program that would transition into a game design program, but chickened out my second year cause I thought I'd never get a job in the game industry, so I did a third year of animation instead. But jokes on me, cause I still had a terrible time finding a job in my field anyways.  

I'm not a great artist, I'd say I'm average at the best of times, and most of my years in school was me working twice as hard to catch up to my peers. My lack of self confidence could be absolutely crippling and it got worse as more time passed and I still could not get a job at any studios. After little over a year, my friend helped me get a job at a vfx company doing compositing work. It was my first real, full-time job with benefits in an office and though I knew I wouldn't stay there forever, I liked the idea that it would be the stepping stone for more opportunities in the future.  

A few months after renewing my year-long contract, they ended up laying off a good chunk of the employees, myself included, and now I'm having second guesses about what to do with myself. I don't like contract work, the idea of freelance makes me horrendously anxious, and the animation/vfx industry just seems terribly unstable. Like you'll have to actively hunt for a job every other year and be willing to move to a different city and just hope that the company you work for doesn't end up getting shafted by their client. Maybe I'm just bitter from my own experience, but I just can't see myself being able to put up with it when I'm older and have a family I need to take care of.  

So now I'm thinking about going back to school. I've thought about doing two years in accounting and then get work as a bookkeeper or some random office clerk job. I've also thought about doing programming since I could at least kinda twist it into working with what I had originally went to school for but still have the option of using it for some help desk job or something. I'm leaning towards accounting more only cause I wasn't that great at programming when I took it in high school.  

My other option is to go back to working at a grocery store and just work hard and long enough that I eventually make a decent salary. 

But honestly I have no idea. I don't know what to do. I don't want to end up like my parents who either got stuck at a low paying ""part-time"" job or barely scraping by with self-employment following a dream. And I'm tired of worrying if I'll ever be able to make enough money to survive on my own. I know I'm not old but it feels like I'm wasting time and that it's really easy for me to end up on the streets if I don't figure out what sort of career I should be focusing on. I don't want to be on minimum wage forever, that's all I know for sure, I just have no idea how I can make it better.

And we have had fights over the OCD thoughts. 

I have also had OCD over whether I was cheating or not (they are called false memories) and it really screwed with my head. I told him about it,and he said that it was just OCD,which I did figure out myself it was just OCD.I have never had sex with another person.

114,"I'm sorry for the rant.

I've had a rough semester, in the span of a month I got the flu twice and lost my grandmother. I've done my best to catch up in my classes and stay composed and to the outside world I probably look like I'm made of steel, however on the inside I feel hollow. I feel like an asshole because I'm failing my girlfriend.

After a string of failed relationships, I finally found someone who made me happy. After over a year and a half however, that happy comes and goes. I know not every day of a relationship is supposed to be sunshine and rainbows, but I don't think it's unreasonable that you should never go to bed wondering if you hate your partner. 

Right now, she's also going through some stuff--a few physical injuries and a lot of stress from university--but I just can't help her. Every other day she's having a depressive meltdown where she loses the momentum to do any and all of her work and getting her work done is tied directly to her self-image which turns it into a positive feedback loop. I feel like an asshole, but that asshole in me sounds partially correct: she's relying on me too much and is ignoring my problems. I feel undervalued on the days where she has meltdowns and I feel great on the days where she's feeling okay and I feel like my life is going to get back on track, but then she falls down the rabbit hole again and so I shove my emotions to the side to make sure that she's okay. I feel like an asshole because I'm comparing apples to oranges. Her struggles are not mine but there's a part of her struggles that are making it hard for me to recover emotionally.

Am I an asshole for feeling like the relationship is falling apart because we're both dealing with our own shit? I have no idea what to do. My sleep, my patience, and my general mental health are all suffering from this. There are parts of our relationship that I really enjoy but I'm feeling more and more like because of where we're at in our lives we're not being positive influences on each other. I've become codependent in previous relationships and I've fought long and hard against those urges in this one, but despite my best efforts I'm worried that's what's happening.

115,"So I have this friend (let's call her Sarah) who has these two great friends (Friend A and Friend B). But the thing is, she rarely spends time with them. She sees Friend A maybe once every two months and Friend B is a member of a club she's in and she only spends time with him during club meetings (and their club has like 10 people so they're not alone). It's like they skipped the getting to know the each other part and went instantly to the close friend stage. I can understand them being friendly acquaintances, and maybe even okay friends, but I don't see how they're such great friends if they never really hang out. For example, Sarah is going to visit Friend B who is moving to Japan, and Friend A is going to take time to visit Sarah while she's studying abroad. Like they're literally going to travel across the globe to see each other! 

I asked Sarah how she knows them so well and she told me she doesn't need to spend time with them because she just had an ""instant connection,"" She also said their relationships don't need maintaining. To be honest I'm kind of jealous because I've never become really good friends with anyone without spending a substantial amount of time with them. I mean I'm happy she has great friends in her life, but the fact that she got them with such little effort still shocks me. Maybe she's just really good at first impressions, I don't know...

116,"Hey friends. 

So I’ve been hung up on a situation that happened weeks ago. My integrity was questioned and it absolutely shattered me because I always make it a point to be honest when it’s hard, go to someone directly when there’s a problem instead of gossip about it, and (try very hard to) be kind in all situations. 


I run in a pretty tight social groupv. There’s one known problem causer, gossipy, judgy, just THAT person. She is very nice on the surface but any deeper into the onion and it starts getting r o t t e n, I am learning. Let me add that she’s not a close friend of anyone in the group except for one person, who’s kind of a drifter/in and out friend anyways.  


So a few months ago this person asked if I accidentally ended up with a plate after a Christmas party. I said I didn’t have it, and moved on. She was a little persistent “are you suuuure?”, so I got a little uncomfortable, but I just said if I saw it I’d let her know and moved along. 


Well, I was organizing my cabinets the next day (fucked up timing)  and lo and behold, I don’t the special plate. My boyfriend put it there after cleaning up and I had no idea. Because my man thinks that Christmas platters go in the back of the cabinet behind the old pots and pans we replaced with our new pots and pans. But I love him regardless. Lol. Dude logic is irrelevant here, I find the dish and let her know we do have it after all. Bf thought it was something we got for Christmas since he didn’t recognize it and we had a ton of new kitchen stuff from Christmas. Washed it after the party and he put it with the old pans to not be seen again for months. 


Flash forward and there’s an event I can’t get to. She says something to everyone about it being at my house after all and that she knew I took it by when she asked me about it. That I was acting weird. 

This gets back to me. I ask mutual friend if that statement was actually said how it got back to me, because I thought we were closer than for that question to upset her. And I know she was there when it was brought up. She gets mad that I asked her, and cuts the conversation off. I drop it. Next day I have a phone call from the plate girl. That she never said that, she’s not the one who brought it up, yada yada. (But idk why anyone else would give a fuck about her plate....) that I shouldn’t be believing what the other person says and it’s fine, she doesn’t care, that it’s not a big deal. I’m just trying to get this Santa plate off my kitchen counter in March at this point. 


Firstly, I know this upsets me and agitated me in that way when you’re trying to convince someone that you’re telling the truth, or not trying to make a face, or whatever, even in a joking matter. I tell the truth when it tears me up inside to tell the truth. I tell the truth when it’s hard to tell the truth. Yeah, it was easy to say I didn’t have the plate. Because I didn’t. know. I. had. it. But she was nagging at it and I started feeling weird. So I told her I’d look and let her know. 

Secondly, her tone upon asking me was a little accusatory, and then her telling everybody she knew I had it all along suggested she thought I stole her fucking plate. An ugly ass Santa Christmas plate. 


Have you caught on that we are boring adults here? I am not even sure why I am so upset about this situation. I have had crazier shit hit the fan in the last 3 months than being accused of jacking a plate, but whether it was a plate or a diamond ring,  but this is stuck on me for some reason. I wouldn’t have taken it and I think I’m actually mostly fucked up over someone thinking I’d lie right to their face AND steal from them. I backed out on a function she was going to be at last weekend. I haven’t talked to our only mutual friend since I asked her if something bad was said about me because I guess they’re closer friends than I thought and I guess I fucked it up by trying to clear the air before having to confront someone. I’ve sent a couple messages that have been opened with no response. 

I have a full time job and responsibilities out the ass. I’m not bored all day to be just sitting around thinking about this situation, but I have steadily thought about it every day. Why am I so torn up about this? Because my integrity was questioned in front of people I care about? Because someone actually thought I’d steal and lie to them? This feeling is like a parasite I can’t get out. It doesn’t help that I know she gossips and judges hardcore. And I’m also mad that this is still bothering me weeks later. 

Thanks for wasting time on this Santa plate bullshit along with me. ",11Apr2018,1

At the party I drank so much I couldn't walk, we had planned to be there for a few hours then leave because my gf had work early, but I couldn't leave since i had driven us here on our motorcycle, which we can both drive. My gf didn't want to leave me, but finally did after her friend said she would take care of me. When she left, her friend sat me down on the couch in the living room. She asked if I wanted more drinks and I said sure. When she came back, she handed me my drink, and then she sat on my lap. I admit that the drunk me was turn on, since she had a tight short black dress, and her legs were exposed more when she sat,not only that but she started to move her hips in a circular motion. After about 5 mins, she stood up and left. After getting tired, I laid down and then passed out. I woke up around 2 in the morning, and discovered two things. One, everybody had left meaning it was just me and my gf's friend, and two she was sleeping on top of me. I started to wake her up, and when as she was, she started kissing me. And I kissed her back. We ended up having sex on the couch until we were exhausted. After she feel asleep, I felt guilty that I had cheated on my gf, picked up my stuff and left her&gt; the next day she moved to a different state. I haven seen her since. Yesterday, 6 months later, my girlfriend told me she was pregnant with our child. She was happy and called her best friend over, and when she came, you could tell she was pregnant to. When my gf question her, she said she had lost her virginity 6 months ago. She said she didn't want to say who was the father yet, but by the way she looked at me, I knew it was my child. My gf asked her if the father was taking care of them, and she said no, and that her life has been difficult lately. Now I don't know what to do, since I love my gf and she has my child, but her best friend has mine too. Somebody, please help me.",11Apr2018,0

120,"I have been battling depression for awhile now. Was always happy in high school but now on my second year of college and after two transfers, I hit rock bottom very recently and have started telling my therapist about my sometimes suicidal thoughts. But as I’m coming out of this depression, I can’t seem to get a grip on how I feel about myself and want my self image to be. I love the idea of being hard, being more of an asshole than I used to be (I was always the really nice sweet sensitive boy). I feel like now I am much more money conscious, aware of my fuck-the-system disposition, and would like to be much more comfortable asserting myself. But as I’m coming out of this depression and trying to find people who I connect and identify with, I worry a lot about how I may be being perceived as gay (people always thought I was gay in high school too). 
I feel like I am constantly checking myself for coming across as gay. 
I have never had a sexual experience with a guy, and have never masturbated to a man, but I’m not sure if my wanting to act like more of an “asshole” is to cover for the fact that I’m gay. 
Here is a recent text conversation I had with my friends from my hometown tonight. Please tell me your read on this line of texts. 
I in the past have taken the gay remarks from my friends with laughs, but am done being made fun of for something that would be perfectly fine if I was, and also something that I am not (I don’t think?). If I was gay, I hope that that would be okay with my friends. Do you think I could be confused? Again, I love girls, always have, but have also been admittedly a little fruity and liked to act gay to get a rise out of my good friends, like grab their asses and tap their crotches playfully. Also, have always gotten along with girls very quickly, not sure if it’s because I produce a flirty and easygoing conversation dynamic or if they just think I’m gay!

Am I gay? Insecure? Bi? Help me!

See, I like the idea of getting rid of homophobia, but feel gay for doing it. 
I was hoping that what I said would be taken in a semi-sarcastic joking light, but I’m afraid it came across as me being gay. Is the fact that I’m so caught up on this and things like this mean I’m gay?? Or am I just insecure and need to get a grip?

FUCK. I have been so ridden with anxiety about anything and everything. I’ve become nocturnal to avoid interaction with people. I need to dig myself out of this depression. My mom suggested that maybe my questioning if I’m gay is just my looking for a ‘quick fix’
But I know if I was gay my mom would be okay with it!!!^^^
Could this just be my testing the waters because I know I could be bicurious? (Also don’t THINK I am, but I’m just not sure if I’m in he closet of depression of in the closet of being gay!)",11Apr2018,1

127,"Hello. This is my first time posting here and I could need some advice...

My background: Asian, male, currently studying abroad

Basically, based on the title suggested, I was just having conversation with my mom about my sister turning 17th this year. She said that she wants to celebrate it grandly, spending a lot on food, dresses, and even hiring photographers. I have been telling my mom over and over again to not spend so much on 17th birthday. A party with family and close friends should be enough, I said. My mom even said that the estimated budget is around an equivalent of 2.5k dollars.

Now I know that we are not a very rich family and that amount of money is not small. My mom already said that it's ok to spend that much on a birthday (that I believe would probably be forgotten after some time, anyway), but I am in no way agree with this. I believe my mom is influenced a lot by her rich friends and family. One of my cousin had a 17th birthday that costs around 6k+ dollars. One of her friend's daughter's 17th birthday cost 9k+ dollars in a 5-star hotel

Maybe because I am a guy so I don't really understand the importance of having a 17th birthday party (mind you, my birthday throughout my childhood is just a small birthday cake, and it stopped when I studied abroad), but the idea of spending so much money on this not-so-special occasion does not sit with me. I even kinda raised my voice to her (basically just being a bit rude to my mom through whatsapp chat) cause she didn't seem to understand that.

I don't know what to say to my mom anymore. That's why I asked for advice here, hoping that you guys could probably give me some that can convince my mom..

Thanks before",11Apr2018,2
128,"So first off you can call me T I’m an 18 year old male and a senior in high school. I’m posting this here because I don’t feel like I have anyone I can talk to about this stuff also I apologize in advance if this sounds whiny or like I’m looking for attention. 

So I would guess you all know what a social butterfly is, but just in case my definition is different from yours here’s what I mean when I say social butterfly, Someone who is VERY social and easygoing they don’t belong to a particular group, but rather jump from one group to another. They are somewhat accepted in all of them, but don’t really have any deep friendship connections in any of them. 

I would say I’m that but to the extreme I can, and have in the past, change my personality completely so as to fit in with any group, but I have no friends I keep everyone at a distance including my family. I put on, what I call, “masks”. I put a different mask on every time the group I’m around changes again I even do this with my family. Problem is I think I forgot how to not wear the masks

I feel like if I tell someone anything true about myself they will use it against me.

About five years ago I got in a relationship with a girl who I never really liked, we’ll call her Daisy. I only went out with Daisy because she asked me in a crowded hallway at school and when I didn’t answer yes immediately she looked like she was going to cry and I didn’t want my carefully cultivated image as a nice person to be ruined. Don’t get me wrong Daisy was a nice girl who I had known since I was five years old but, the relationship dragged on for two years we hung out every now and then but nothing ever happened the we finally broke up when we realized we had gone a month and a half without talking at all. When that relationship had first begun I had been interested in a girl in my class who I had gotten probably as close as I ever will to a real friend, we’ll call her Anna. Anna had confided in me about her depression and her abusive mother. I had always done my best to help her with her problems. Throughout the beginning my relationship with Daisy, for probably a good five months I had really liked Anna right up until she disappeared without a trace after spring break I never heard from her I never got any info about what happened to her. So I continued the relationship with Daisy until we eventually broke it off. Then shortly after that ended Anna suddenly pops back up, I had been walking to lunch on the first day of the new semester and I hear someone call out my name I turn and there she is so I talk to her , I never managed to get an answer about what happened to her, but I went ahead and sat with her at lunch we talked and laughed it felt like old times but then she passingly says something about a boyfriend and it turns out she has a boyfriend, we’ll call him Clark, so she tells me about her life and we talk every day some days she tells me about how great Clark is and some days she says she hates him well we reach a point where more often then not she talks about how he’s a awful. So I realize now that at the time I gave her advice that subconsciously was because I wanted to sabotage the relationship because I still really liked Anna. Well one day she tells me that she thinks she’s pregnant, so I obviously tell her she should take a test and acted concerned when in reality I felt like screaming and crying. So it comes back positive and she tells me so I start to get really depressed and eventually she picks up on this and tries to cheer me up at lunch one day, asking me why I’m sad and trying to make me laugh well I didn’t work I just sat there ignoring her and reading, then at the end of lunch she grabs my book mark writes something on it and puts it back in my book. I later looked to see what was written on it and I says, hey T stop being sad after all who else will go shopping for baby clothes with me. After that I was done it felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my chest. I stopped talking to her and had began to avoid her. That was the last time I got close to someone.

Again I’m sorry if this sounds like I’m looking for attention or like I’m just whining it’s just that I have never told anyone this stuff and I don’t feel like I have anyone I can talk to about this. So my question is, is there something wrong with me? Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and to anyone can offer any thoughts at all on this.

129,"So, my parents have been extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative throughout my entire life. They frequently gaslight me, belittle me, and just act in a way that if I call them out on it they consider themselves the victims. When my brother sexually abused me they - particularly my mom - made me feel as though it was my fault and that they would side with him if it went to court, which made me believe I had to lie about it when I was questioned about it by the police and cas. They also hired a lawyer to defend my brother against the accusation, which was made by a close friend of mine who I had confided in. I feel panicky, angry, and stressed out anytime I have to see them. I've tried to forgive them for what happened in the past, and I thought I had, but what my parents just accused me of really makes my blood boil and I just don't know how I'm going to face them again or even if I want to.

I went to school in another city, met someone, moved in with them, and we recently got pregnant and had a baby together. Throughout my pregnancy my mother would frequently bring up what would happen if my boyfriend left me, telling me I was more than welcome to go back home, questioning how long our relationship would last, constantly bringing up our age gap (there's 13 years between us, however my parents are super hypocritical bringing it up since there's 12 between them), etc. I've gotten used to just ignoring those types of comments so no big deal. They came up to stay in town for three weeks around my due date to help us out and see the baby (although they really didn't help much and mainly just pissed off my boyfriend, who fully knows the history I have with them). Anyways they made fun of him for stressing out over the baby and his exams, and he's getting really annoyed because they keep telling me to come visit in the summer with the baby so ""he can have a break"", which to both of us sounds like ""but your boyfriend isn't invited"".

Anyways they stopped by again on the weekend to take more photos with the baby - which is starting to piss me off because it seems like every time they see her they want to use her as a photo prop (I'm going to tell them no photos if I see them again so that's not what I need advice on how to do). Here's the issue: Just yesterday my mom texted me saying that ""Your dad is concerned about how much and how hard you rock your baby"" and that he's worried about ""shaken baby syndrome"" which I looked up and it's a form of f*cking child abuse where you violently shake your baby and cause brain damage. What was I doing that prompted this text? Bouncing her in her bouncer to get her to fall asleep. She likes the bouncing motion and likes it to be a little vigorous, but by no means was I shaking her so hard that it would be concerning, I was not angry or frustrated while I was bouncing her, she has no symptoms of shaken baby syndrome, and honestly I'm beyond pissed off that they would accuse me of that. 

tldr: My parents, who mentally abused me, who made me believe that the sexual abuse I went through was my fault, just f*cking accused me of child abuse. So I guess my question is what should I do? Right now I'm tempted to tell them to screw off, to demand an apology, or to call them out about what they did to me in the past. I really just don't see letting this one go. I've let it go too many times in the past and I'm done just letting it go. I don't even want to tell my boyfriend about it because I know he'll message them about it as he's done so in the past and I don't want the burden of dealing with this to fall onto him this time. How do I approach this with them? Should I tell them off? What should I do? Any advice would be extremely appreciated. Thank-you.",11Apr2018,1

 But I wouldn't really call it abuse. I mean, I do that to everyone, tbh I should stop it but I mean it as a joke. I also playfully hit my mum and other people too. It's not serious although sometimes I hit too hard accidentally. But I mean it in the playful funny way.

140,"I want to be an actress, I know it's going to be hard but that's what I want to do. I was terrible a few years ago but with practice, time alone on monologues, observing, and learning I have gotten much better. I'm in high school. Last fall I got the lead in the school play. It was fun and I worked hard but I hated being congratulated by people because I felt like I did not deserve it. I did not take it all in, I did not mean the ""thank you's"" that I said when someone told me I did a good job (with the exception of a teacher who's opinion I valued highly) because I was too afraid that it would make me think that I was better than I actually was and would slack in improving. I think there is always room for improvement and I think that I can be better than I am now. 

Side note: I'm not going into theatre because I want to be famous or anything because I know how minimal the chances of that happening are. I'm going into it because It is the only thing that I have ever genuinely enjoyed, I enjoy improving at it, I enjoy the work and time you have to put in, and it just makes me so happy and I want to be happy so I've chosen to do what makes me happy hopefully until I die. 

The reason I am so afraid of becoming arrogant is because there is this really condescending and arrogant girl in our theatre program (who honestly doesn't have the talent to back up her arrogance. I don't say that to be mean but she overacts everything. She even overacts walking to another actor on stage by shuffling to them or trying to make the fact that she's moving stand out) and I see how she is and I don't want to end up like her. She thinks she's the best, she acts like she's the best, but she's probably the worst and none of her friends tell her that. My friends would have the decency to kick me on my ass if I acted like her because they wouldn't want me to go out in the real world with that attitude. But I can't help feeling that it is a slippery slope for me. If I start thinking I deserve roles because I'm one of the few good actors in our program, if I start acting confident I'm afraid it'll come off as arrogance. I know there is a difference between confidence and arrogance but I feel like if I let myself think I deserve things or have that mindset I'm going to cross the line without even realizing. 

How can I be okay with letting myself be confident and not always dragging myself down because I feel the need to keep myself from getting too confident in myself or too comfortable. Because I know there are going to be people way better than me in in college and after and I'm going to need some sort of confidence or belief that I can do it or that I deserve a role just as much as anyone else without crossing the line to arrogance.",11Apr2018,3

He lives with his(our) parents, but is very isolated apart from that. They pay for everything for him (food, board, car, fuel, etc). He has some hobbies (he does martial arts) but tells me he never speaks to anyone there and keeps his head down most of the time. He has never had a girlfriend, never even had a crush on a girl (so he says) and never even masturbated. He is a very good looking guy so it isn't his looks stopping him.

He is a lot of fun as a guy when he loosens up and can be really funny when he's in a good mood. However most of the time he is incredibly cynical about his life, other people and has very poor social skills. At certain times when he talks to me 1on1 he will confess that he hates his life, is very self-loathing and feels like he is destined to have a mediocre life. But when I suggest things to change it he just does nothing.

He avoids eye contact with strangers and can sometimes feel like he is just staring straight through you when you speak to him. Even me, his brother, have found myself saying stuff like ""stop staring at me so intensely while I speak to you"". He has this look in his eyes when you speak to him that makes it feel like he thinks that you're lying to him (imagine the look you would give someone who was clearly bullshitting you and you wanted to make the sweat a little). When I call him out on this he usually apologises and says he didn't realise.

I try to invite him to do social things with my friends and girlfriend (thankfully my girlfriend is very understanding and cool about it) to get him out of the house. But whenever we are out it feels like he doesn't want to be there. He doesn't greet people, makes very sarcastic and cynical jokes (which never go down well with strangers who don't know hes joking) and overall makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Literally every time I invite him somewhere with strangers, one of them says something to me afterwards to the effect of ""what the fuck is your brother's problem? I told him XYZ and he gave me some smartass answer and made fun of me."" When I tell my bro this afterwards, he says something to the effect of ""I was only kidding"" if I tell him that it didn't come off that way, he just says he won't come next time. I've had to stop inviting him places with new people because he is such hard work for everyone.

The thing is, he is a really good guy at his heart and a great brother. He has always been there for me and helped me out whenever I have asked for his help. He is fiercely loyal and a sweet guy when he wants to be. He is just incredibly socially undertrained and seems to have grown comfortable in his isolation and safe little life.

Anyways to my question...

What do I do? I feel like this is going to get much worse for him as time goes on. It's kind of forgivable at 22, but at 40 it will just drive him further into cynicism and self hatred and he is the kind of guy who might do something drastic (he almost killed himself in high school due to an existential crisis). I am also moving from the city next year, which will reduce his social interactions even more. ",11Apr2018,1

145,"Ill try to keep this concise and to the point.

I just recently began speaking with my mother and siblings after completely cutting communication with them for 11 years. We have been speaking for about 4 months now. I recently started taking all three of em with me to the skate park to bond over an activity.

I have been slowly warming up to the idea of having siblings but one in particular has absolutely gotten my heart and I was pretty fucking devastated to learn recently from another close family member that as a toddler he approached my mother over her now boyfriends son putting his dick in my brothers mouth. Supposedly the issue was passed over as the offender was 12 at the time. I learned later that the same guy went on to fuck a 14 year old while he was 18 but got off Scott free due to just barely riding the Romeo and Juliet laws we have here in TX.

This is clearly in this guys character to prey on those young and vulnerable and is not just the sexual exploitative science of a pre teen (which I still find pretty fucking outlandish)

Is there absolutely anything I can or should do? I feel pretty powerless and appalled that someone so close to me, so vulnerable was abused in such a way and nothing was ever appropriately handled.

What the fuck even are the repercussions for a minor to rape an even younger minor? And even so this was over 4 years ago and its been kept as some fucking dark family secret in my absence.",11Apr2018,2

My school is depressing. most kids are drunk or high in class, even yesterday some 14 yr old kid was on acid trying to sell some in the bathroom. id be a hypocrite to say they were losers because i ride the bus home after school everyday (sometimes i cry on the bus and idk why) and smoke weed because im bored, play cod, eat food fall asleep and repeat.

147,"Couple months back I met this guy on social media and he’s from different state. His time would be three hours ahead of mine. He was pretty handsome and chill. We talked for maybe only couple of weeks but it seems like he wasn’t interested in me. So one day he just ignored my message and since then we never talked. Lately I’ve been thinking about him so I decided to go back and talk to him and so I asked him if he is seeing anyone and he told me that he likes this girl that they’ve been knowing each other for five years but for the past two months he’s been falling for her for some reason. So I ask him why don’t he tell her about it and he said because she likes someone else already. He said he do want to get over her but he just can’t. I tried to help him get at this girl but he just kept saying it’s hopeless. But there’s another problem, I think I’m starting to like him again but I don’t think I’ll even have a chance because we’re too far apart from each other. Him and I are still talking but I just feel like he just talks to me when the other girl is not talking to him so that just makes me a side girl I guess. And this feeling is just the worst. I don’t even know why I like this guy. I guess it’s just something about him that I can’t describe in words. I honestly don’t know what to do. ",11Apr2018,1
148,"Hi, haven't posted here before and I'm not sure if this is the place to go either. I also posted on the depression sub.  I'm in a tough situation, I really need advice on what my first move should be.

 I'm 17 and have past with suicidal thoughts,/attempts, selfharm, no impulse control, ""defiant behavior"" and so on. Lately I dropped out of school. I was transferred to alt school back in 7th grade and my last school was behavior based. Students were sent there for fighting, expulsion dued defiance and the school acted as a special needs  provider aswell. It was not helpful since I was sent there for selfharm. You can imagine how a student used to getting in school therapy 5 days a week to placed in a class where students sell drug in front of/ to teachers kind of environment. 

I have only had a job for 7 month but quit when I was hospitalized (I have no money saved). My mom found my suicide note that I written the day before during a mental breakdown. After I got out I lost hope. I cut out everyone I knew. I stopped  legally stopped attending high school. My parents, in their way of saying ""if you're living in my house, you have to follow my rules"", decided that since I'm not doing anything productive I'll won't have a phone/internet access. They took off my bedroom and bathroom door. I can't leave the house unless it's with them. They shut off the electricity to my room. They continuously threaten to shut and lock my window and want .control what I eat (make sure I'm not costing them anymore then they have to provide)

I'm writing this on my older sister's tablet, she doesn't care for it. 

This brings you up to speed with how my life is going. What happened just 20 minutes ago. My mother got upset with me over cooking. She then yelled "" if you left right now. No one will care. I'm sick of you and you're ""shenanigans"". Leave, I'm not calling the police. You can get out!"" My father stood watching, didn't try to consolidate. 

So that's it. I'm a 17 y/o girl. With only 70$ (mostly in change) having to leave at 6am. I don't know where to go and I can't contact friend or relatives. I have none. What do I do? Whats the first step. I live in the suburbs of Illinois. It's cold and I'm on foot. Please any advice with help? I have 4hrs. Thank you for reading this and I hope everyone is doing better than where I am.

150,"hi! i’m a fourteen year old girl that recently moved out of a country i’ve been born and raised in. And i’ve been facing some troubles.

I’m from the middle east but was born and raised in a beautiful country called Malaysia! I was used to being surrounded by loads of middle easterners that migrated there and malaysians themselves. I had no problem figuring in and growing up there, i knew the malaysian jokes my friends would tell and i would answer back because heck! that’s the type of environment i’m used to.

My dad found a new job in Australia, yes , the country that has all types of spiders and has kangaroos roaming around everywhere supposedly. I’ve been enrolled to a new school and let me tell you, this is not what i expected.

I thought they lived up to their profile of ‘We’re a diverse school!’. But i can surely tell you that i am the only asian in my year. Normally i wouldn’t have minded, its a new environment and i shouldn’t complain to much, but a week in and they don’t really treat me like ‘one of them’.

i take a bus to and from school, and whenever i sit down somewhere people avoid sitting next to me, even when the whole bus is full they’d rather stand. When a class has an assigned seat, people wouldn’t look so happy when the teacher tells me to sit next to them, and when i’m new to a class and choose a seat out of random people would groan and sigh to see that i’ve sat down on where they usually sit. I would pack up my stuff to offer it back to them but they just ignore me and sit somewhere else, also coming down to me sitting alone in a table for four. Usually i don’t read into these things, but one thing that really got me was when a teacher came up to me, asking me to talk to them.

She pulled me aside and asked me how i thought about the school, if the classes were enjoyable and if the students were nice. I replied and said that classes were fun, students were nice and i was pleased with the surroundings. Then she asked me if i had anyone to talk to and sit next to during recess and lunch. I replied no, saying i read a book and sit on bench while eating my bread and that i don’t mind. She frowned at me and said ‘Do you want me to assign someone to you?’ and that felt like a pang to me.

Was my actions pitiful? Me sitting alone during lunch and reading a book is not ideal? A teacher had to assign a person to me because i’m too much of a introvert to make one myself?

I read so much into this and eventually came home crying about this. I didn’t want to tell my parents because we’re still on tough circumstances and i didn’t want to add fuel to the fire. But of course, no matter what you can’t hide anything from your own parents. My dad came into the room and talked to me about this, advising me to skip tomorrow and collect my thoughts. A teacher called and said for me to visit them tomorrow in their office to -for what i’m guessing-  talk about this issue.

Any advice? If there isn’t anything regarding to the school, maybe tell me how to block out my emotions and keep going?

Thank you 💕",11Apr2018,3

155,"I'll split this post into three parts 

**College**
I am a freshman at college and I am currently taking a remedial class in algebra which i must pass or I will get kicked out of college. I have never been good at math and this class is no different. I find this class *extremely* difficult to follow. I have the book, I try to look through the steps, but I get so overwhelmed and frustrated that I simply cant follow, I believe I have a deficit when it comes to math, like as if there is a neurological issue with me, which prevents me from being good at math. I can get so stressed out and tired that I completely shut off and don't want to do anything. I am beginning to lose all motivation and truly think that I will be kicked out, which further depresses me. I really don't want to lose the experience of being in college.

**Depression** 

On most days, I will feel frustrated with having feelings of emptiness or loneliness. I believe this started in high school where I was put in a very toxic environment filled with hatred. I have tried my best to distance myself from this environment and I believe it has made me better, but It always seems to replaced by some other person or idea. I don't understand the point of starting conflicts anymore, I really don't and I prefer to be in an environment where that doesn't exist, but I always seem to be going back to such places. I don't if this a normal thing to go through in late adolescence, but I am starting to get fed up of having the same shitty feelings and doing nothing to improve it.

**Anxiety**

I would say that I have general fears about people, I would come up with assumptions that people hate me for no good reason and would on these ideas, almost being fixated on it. People who I've never spoken I believe have an utter hatred or disgust in me. This started around the same time I started college and I don't why. I believe it comes down to being judged as a bad human being. I know that these beliefs are false and I want to get rid of them but there is something about it which I can't seem to shake off.

So, what should I do?",11Apr2018,2
156,"I'm about to graduate from community college with my associate's degree and I would like to go back to work to save up some money for when I transfer to a university. However, for almost my whole life I've had issues with my bladder. Often I can go to the bathroom more than 10 times a night and I frequently lose sleep because of it. I cried so much while I was working toward my two-year degree because my condition caused so many sleepless nights. It was so miserable. I succeeded, but I don't want to go through that misery again.

I've been to so many doctors and none of them seem to be able to help me. I've been to my family doctor, several urologists, a specialist, a physical therapist, and even a neurologist with very little luck. The only thing that might be able help me is a surgery I am not able to afford, so I feel like I've hit a wall with trying to get medical help.

I don't know how often I've come to tears because all I want to do is get enough rest so I can have energy for work or school. I'm afraid I'll spend too much time running to the bathroom at work if I get a job again.

Every time I visit my parents they always say how proud they are I went to college, and my dad says he wished he did the same. My parents asked for me to show my grades to them, but I'm failing my classes, due to no desire and not enjoying study, and are nervous/scared to show and disappoint them.

159,"I'm one of the organizers of an up and coming Meetup group. Our group has recently been gaining a lot more new members, so it's all the more important that we make the space comfortable and welcoming for everybody. However, recently I've been getting reports from some of the girls in our group that one particular individual (let's call him John), has been taking up a lot of space with his actions and behavior.

One of the girls (who is a long time member), has told me of instances of John following her around even after dropping plenty of hints that she isn't interested in talking to him, from walking away to changing seats. Another girl has expressed that she is bothered by his constant need to be the center of attention, a behavior which even I've noticed by how he's cracking jokes at inappropriate times, talking over others, or hogging a mic when we go out for karaoke. 

I want to treat safety in the group incredibly seriously, and I feel the best course of action would be to call John out on this/ bring it to his attention. But I'm admittedly not too sure how to not come off as an accusatory or as an attack to put him down, especially since I personally am not affected as much by his behavior. I've interacted with him pretty frequently, so I feel comfortable being blunt to him, but I'm admittedly not great with dealing with conflict either.

166,"Huge story, but I need advise BAD 

~back story~ Junior  year (high school) I met this beautiful girl at school and we hit it off great. We almost instantly started dating and things were awesome at first. Then they kinda go bumpy my senior year when we were still dating. We were constantly getting in small arguments about small things like where we ate lunch or not FaceTiming and just dumb things. We dated for a couple more months out of high school and finally we just completely broke up. For me when I leave someone I just try to erase them. So that’s what I did.
 throughout this relationship we got close with each other’s family’s. My family loved her, hers loved me. So we went on vacations with the family’s. I’m talking camping trips, Disneyland trips and many more. With that, after my breakup with her she kept in touch with my family. Which honestly I don’t mind but i seriously think it’s an issue now. She babysits for my sister fairly often and is the only person my niece and nephew will tolerate. So she gets in on my family business every once in a while. 

Recently I’ve been told through my friends that she now has a boyfriend. Which I’m totally fine with because we have been broken up for 8+ months. I too have a new girlfriend and although we haven’t been together long, I see this one going far. Anyway with that said this is the issue I’m having now—

last night she went out with some mutual friends and she stated she was sorry for my girlfriend. When they asked why, she replied because I am “a horrible person and used her for sex and even did unspeakable things to her.” I really don’t know what that means. In our 2/ 2 1/2 years of dating I never once touched her physically, not even a pulling of an arm or something small of that sort. Also we only had sex 2-5 times. And throughout everything we did I would frequently ask for permission and make sure she was 100% okay with it. I asked so much we actually got into an argument because she felt I didn’t trust her because I told her I was afraid of any claims. But that seems to be what’s happening. So I’m extremely scared now she’s going to claim assault or even rape to get back at me or something. My anxiety is through the roof and I cannot shut my eyes to sleep. I have messaged her to ask to talk to her about what she’s said but she has yet to respond or even open said msgs. ANY ADVICE?! ANYTHING HELPS!!! EXTREMELY WORRIED. ",11Apr2018,2

168,"So I dated this girl for like 5 years. We separated when I was around 18 and she moved on pretty fast. She got pregnant with this guy only months after we separated and moved in with him. We’re both now 23, but have been talking almost the entire time we’ve been separated. We talk as friends and just catch up with one another from time to time. About a year ago her current dude found out we still talked and freaked out. Things were already bad from my understand and she decided to move in with her parents. This triggered him. He began searching town for me. Showing up to places he knew I’d go to and asking people I know where I was at, but he couldn’t find me. So he drove to her parents house and ended up beating her up and taking their daughter from her and taking her back home. This girl couldn’t stand to be away from her so she moved back in under the agreement that she would cut off communication from me and her family who advised her to break things off with him.

 Shortly after they had counciling and things started to seem better. She began talking to me again, but a few months later I realized she had been hiding it from him and I told her we shouldn’t so I stopped talking to her. This didn’t last long though, she kept reaching out to me and eventually I caved in and we talk like everyday.

Well today her dude messaged me and is talking shit and making threats towards me saying he’s gonna take me to court or hunt me down and harm me in someway. I’m not sure what to do. Not talking her seems obvious, but he’s so over bearing he won’t let her have any friends, not even females. He’s acted violently towards her before and treats her poorly.

172,"I'm not exactly sure what my rights are in this particular situation.

I work a shift job full time (Friday to Tuesdays- I have Wednesdays and Thursdays off). I ended up getting really sick this week, so I took Monday and Tuesday off, and let my manager know that I'm feeling unwell but am also needing to sort some emotional stuff out (its been stressful lately). I've been wanting to resign for a little while but something happened on Sunday which pushed me over the edge and I decided I would resign this week. I went to Winz first to see if I had valid reasons for doing so- they reassured me I did and would support me immediately.

So on Tuesday (yesterday), I sent in an email of resignation to my employer. I only require 2 days notice (its a 90 day free trial), but since I don't work the next two days anyway, I thought great, I don't have to worry about my crippling anxiety going back there again. I have not received an email back (though I have triple checked to see that the email did in fact send, and that it sent to the proper email) but tonight I got a text back from one of my managers (today was her last day since she will be on leave for a few months) asking me if I'm feeling better since I will be coming in on Friday.

Here are my questions: does the 2 day notice start from when I send the email, or when my employer acknowledges that they have received this email? I've also heard stuff that you can't take your notice period off but my notice period runs across my normal weekend (Wed &amp; Thurs) so does that mean my notice period actually starts on Friday?

173,"Before you judge, please read this. 

I am a 21 year old female, I have never been to college, I'm working part time at a baby products store. I get less than $195 a month. I cannot pay the bills, I cannot pay for college even if I decided I wanted to go to one. 

My parents are not wealthy compared to other people around us, but they make good money from time to time. Even with that, they never bothered to send me to college. In late March, my father made more than $3K. That's actually a lot of money in my country, about 48K. So anyway, they bought a tv, phones, speakers, cameras, drones etc. I never asked for a dime except half of my salary that they took as a loan the month before. I didn't have any cash, that's why. 

Well not long after that my mom got super pissed at me. I told her whether she got mad at me because I asked for my money back. She said she hates me, and that she doesn't want anything from me because I'm some sort of bad omen? (She's stupidly religious, basically believes in stupid extreme things) Also she said that she's sick and tired of me eating from home, and I should stop walking around like a hungry fat dog trying to eat what she cooks for *her* family. Even my dad said that I should stop eating from *their* house. So I said fine, that I won't eat anything that she cooks anymore, even though I am their child. So I had about $30 left with me after and I survived eating instant cup noodles. 

Then I got my salary a few days ago. 

Today my dad asked me twice to give him money. I asked him why? They'd made so much money. In my country that $3K is about 48K. Where'd all that go? We don't even pay rent, we have our own place. All I do is work at this shop and make so less money, and I can't even do anything for myself with it without feeling guilty. I have nowhere to go. I feel like shit. 

What do I do? Should I give him a loan he'd never pay back? Am I a bad person? ",11Apr2018,1
174,"Hey everyone, never posted here before so it feels a little weird but here goes.

I'm 17 year old  guy and recently dropped out of 6th Form because I hated the environment and I feel that it was the wrong choice for me. I'm much happier now that I have left and I have a lot of free time until September when I go to college.

But my friends are still in 6th Form and I can only meet up with them very few times a month. It will be even less now exams are coming up.

My friends from school are slowly becoming more distant too because I'm not at school and suddenly they're getting invited to parties and the ""popular"" social circles (when I was at school with my friends the popular people wouldn't want to be seen anywhere near us and we never got invited to any parties). I'm starting to feel very closed off. I've dealt with social exclusion when I was younger but it hurts a lot more now than when I was a little kid.

I'm not very good at social interaction as it is so my friend group is of about 5 people (one of which lives in Japan and she's super busy too).

Also I live in a super tiny village where most people are senile or middle aged and I can't drive to the closest town.

I'm beginning to get quite lonely and need social interaction. How would I go about that?

I am sure that I had selective mutism as a child.I was never diagnosed though but I didnt talk to anyone till I was 12.Even now I am still shy but my selective mutism is pretty much all gone.I still have bad anxiety.

I was told by one of my bosses that she felt I didnt think like other people.Other people would think from A to D but I would think of A to B to C and then to D.In short,she felt that I was using inefficient ways of working because I would go through the whole process instead when there were faster ways to do things.

I am of above average intelligence,I never struggled in school or standardised testing but I find it hard to focus in class or work and usually end up daydreaming.People have to repeat things to me before I get it.I usually end up self studying everything because I wasnt paying attention.

177,"Warning: mildly gross

So about 6 months ago, I started to get this pain by the bottom of my tail bone. Nothing major just hurt a bit when I put pressure on it on a hard surface.

Fast forward to last week, and after going to the toilet and wiping, there was this worse than normal pain + itchy. I wiped there so as to be able to itch it gently and there was only what I can only describe as yellowish water and blood.

There seems to be a sort of spot there but not like a normal spot. It gets irritated from, at worst a light wipe or clean, resulting in me being hesitant to do either at the top of my crack

It's ended up in me being super self conscience of how I sit so I don't put pressure on it and sometimes it feels like its bleeding but I had already experienced a bit already.

TL;DR I have this sort of spot at the top of by crack and it bleeds but with some sort of yellow water too and hurts when I put pressure on it.

180,"To give some context: at the start of this year, i cut off a friend of mine on whom i had a crush on, we were quite close so, it was very messy. We're in the same group in university which makes things even harder, but so far i've learned to deal with it, regardless of me still having feelings for him. He has a group of friends, i talk to them randomly, but there isn't much interaction aside from school stuff. 

One of them texted me about a month ago, we started just having casual conversation, he's rather shy so, in university we don't interact. We are in test season, usually i'm one of the first to finish, so he has taken that as an opportunity to talk to me since i'm alone outside. I guess i don't mind, but at the same time, i feel rather overwhelmed, i'm kind of a loner and i'm not keen on being forced to conversation with someone i barely get with. Eventually, i told him about how his friend and i fell out, once he was aware he just said he understood me and all that jazz. Later that day, between our usual texting, he told me i had left him with ''many questions'' about what happened between his friend and I, i asked him what were they and he asked me to go to the university's cafeteria after our next test with him, so he could tell me. I just avoided that by telling him i had things to do, hoping that he would not insist on it. He replied to me today asking me again if i wanted to go another day, or to somewhere else.

 I want to think he's just trying to be friendly, but it sounds rather naive, considering his insistence and the 1-on-1 hanging out. 

I really don't know what to do, i might sound mean or like i'm overreacting, but i'm really not interested in him as a friend, much less as something more, then you have the fact that he's a friend of the guy i still have feelings for, makes me feel uncomfortable that he's even doing this in the first place. I don't know how to reply, i'm between avoiding him as long as i can, or try to be direct in a polite way. Help? Thanks in advance!

182,"In college I have recently been both getting behind work and missing homework deadlines due to my tendency to procrastinate. I will sometimes sit down at my desk at home thinking “Alright, first I’ll do [subject] work then move on to [different subject]” but somewhere down the line I usually end up going on chat sites or browsing YouTube. 

Sometimes I can start the day being very motivated to do work, but as soon as I slip up or don’t understand a question, there tends to be a downwards spiral from there. I don’t ask for help in case I am ridiculed for not knowing the answer. Instead, unless I am taking a test, I’ll pull out my phone and use the internet to find answers, that moment from which I start getting distracted.

Any advice? I would be very grateful if anyone could give me tips on how to prevent procrastination!

184,"It happened around 3-4 years ago. 

There was this guy who I [F] really liked and had a major crush on, and a few of his friends found out and told it to him despite promising not to. Note that we barely knew each other at the time. I only got to know him as we had a few trainings together. I got really embarrassed and asked around for his number before I started texting him, first anonymously. He asked multiple times who I was and I decided to tell to him. At first he didn’t recognise who I was, but then after talking a few more times he finally realised and blocked me off the chatting app. I then borrowed my friends phones to continue texting him and telling him sorry, can we talk and other stuff that I can’t really remember, but their numbers got blocked too. 

Around the same time, I followed his instagram account where I proceeded to comment on his posts. He asked me to stop, but I still continued to until he blocked me off as well. 

I gave up trying to communicate but made 2 posts on Facebook about him, which I deleted soon after as I realised a lot of people could see it. Later on one of his friends would message me on behalf of him to take those posts down (at that point I already did). He knew about it as many of his schoolmates saw the posts. I realised at that point that rumours were spreading about me in his school.

It took a few weeks for everything to cool off, and I ceased interacting with him. 

So every year we have an event that involves several schools that spans over a few weeks, one of which he attends so I have been seeing him every year for the past few years since the incident. However, this year will be my last year that I am participating in this event, and after this post I only have 2 more days to see him and apologize. I think one of the reasons I’ve considered apologising is because I want to have closure for what I did. I genuinely feel sorry towards him for my actions as I must have made him uncomfortable. 

I know that what I did was really creepy and desperate, so over the years I have constantly reflected and tried to better myself. I do want to apologize, but it seems so terrifying to face him. I have already prepared an apology and rehearsed the situation in my head several times. I have also consulted a friend and she told me she wouldn’t agree to talk to me in the first place, and told me he most likely already forgot about this incident. 

If you were in his position, would you agree to listen to me? Would you forgive me?
Is this worth apologizing over?

Despite the fact that finals are around the corner, I chose to postpone studying that night so that I could make time for us.  
FYI- I don’t have a problem with masturbation,  I was looking forward to having some steamy sex with him. 

During a class break, I texted him a time to come to my place. He shows up an hour and half later, when we get to doing the deed he couldn’t climax and claimed that he was tired. I asked him if he had masturbated and he said he did right before coming over to my place. 

I thought this was pretty selfish of him... I feel that he robbed me from our intimacy, my ability to pleasure him, and enjoy a passionate evening with him. I’m so upset that he couldn’t be a team player (and wait 3 hours) that I’m considering breaking up with him. 

(He is joining the Marines and will be going to OCS in September. In the short time I’ve known him he does prioritize himself and his things as it fits him (which is understandable for the short time we’ve been dating) he has expressed interest in staying together while he is in the military, but this makes me feel that if he can’t be a team player now and follow through on the things he agrees to while we are in close proximity with each other, I’m not confident that he will be able to flow through on things while we are apart.)

I want the job more than anything for a few reasons:

- It’s a step in the right direction for my career 
- It’s 15 hours less work a week but I will get paid approx 40% more than what I’m currently on
- I feel like I could make a difference in this job (working with children who aren’t able to live with their families but aren’t able to live in foster care either)
- It could be a fresh new start for me
- I currently go to uni one unit a semester which will take me years to finish - if I’m working less hours I can go to uni more so I will finish sooner

- It’s four hours away.
- I don’t know anyone in this town except for my Parents and my brother
- My mum and I don’t always get along so even though I’ll eventually live by myself I’m scared we will clash far more whilst I’m living with her

- The town is a lot smaller and doesn’t have anywhere near as many shopping opportunities (I’m big on shopping)
- I don’t want to move and end up regretting or hating it as if I move I’ll need to stay for at least a year before I could move back to my current town
- I finally feel like I’m happy enough (happier than I was before) where I am and I could potentially get the same job working full time in the town I’m in except it will be more travelling to work, a bit harder and it’s full time where as I want to work less so that I can go to uni

Now my girlfriend has decided she no longer wants to be his friend, never wants to see him again, and actually hates him a lot. She is really mad at me too that I would still be his friend and wants me to be completely on her side.  So we get in fights about it. 

Any advice? Should I defriend him? Does this have to be completely black and white or is there a grey compromise I could find?

213,"So, my best friend and I are pretty comfortable with each other. We talk to each other on snapchat a lot, and my mum found those messages. I once got my period 2 weeks late, and messaged my friends saying 'I'm a knock-off virgin mary,' and my mum is convinced I'm pregnant. I lied to my parents once about going to her house, when in fact I was going to a psychologist for my anxiety, depression and eating disorder (none of which I want my parents to find out about). My friend and I always send each other memes or videos we find funny. For example, I sent her a text saying 'Whaddup, I'm Jared, I'm 19 and I never learnt how to read.' MY mum is convinced I'm dating a Jared, despite telling her to google that text and find out what i actually means. I had lied to my mum about the pair of Doc. Martens my dad had just bought me, saying they were $150 instead of the $250 we paid, because I know she'd freak out. She saw those conversations. I also once said that the 'public transport system can suck my d***' because the bus was 20 minutes late, and I was going to be like 30 minutes late to school. We swear a lot during out conversations, as I obviously don't talk to my close friends like I talk to my parents and vice versa. My mum took my phone, took a photo of ALL the conversations and blocked my best friend on my account. I feel so horrible, like this can't be fixed and I'm freaking out. What do I do?

214,"I’m leaving the company. For months I’ve been bothered by a super creepy coworker who is kind of obsessed with me. All day he will comment on anything I do, say, wear, even tho he sits a couple of desks away from me. When I go for a walk outside with a coworker he follows, if I go out for lunch with someone, he’ll show up at the place.

I suspect he might be autistic as he does not understand any hints or comments about his behavior and also doesn’t understand small talk or jokes.

222,"A little background information:
I'm 24, live in a major city in the US, have a job that a love, and have never had an issue talking to women. I am single and don't really care if I have a significant other anytime soon, but I am not opposed to it. For the most, I'm happy with where I'm at and where my life seems to be heading.

Around August/September of 2017 I met this girl, we'll call her Katelyn. I find Katelyn attractive (She is probably a 7 or 8 for most people), funny, smart, and she generally seems compatible with my personality. We like similar things and have things in common.

The first day we hung out was great, that night we banged a few times and it was awesome. We kept talking and hanging out, and I started noticing really odd things about Katelyn and how she acted. She third wheeled me pretty hard one night, and never really seemed to be interested in me. She always talked about herself and her own problems. I get that nobody is perfect; regardless, I noticed certain red flags about her that lead me to believe she might not be 100% emotionally stable. She also has been with a lot of dudes in the past, and said she cheated on a boyfriend before. To note, she was dealing with some pretty serious health issues at the time and the doctors were not sure if she needed surgery or not. Obviously, this could make any normal person act differently and be more stressed out than normal. Her condition came up on one ""date"" we went on, we had to leave super early after driving an hour or so and paying for a haunted festival deal. Personally, this didn't bother me at all. I was supportive and made it clear I didn't care at all that we had to leave early.

At one point she made it very clear she didn't want a relationship. She just wanted to be friends. This was pretty upsetting for me because I liked her a lot at this point. So I said to myself, as long as we still bang I'll be cool and go with it. When she is ready we can be together. At the time I didn't know this about myself, but I was not going to be able to sustain that friendship. It was like some awful purgatory type scenario where I was stuck in between friend zone and dating. It made me constantly question myself, her intentions, and to be honest it was horrible for me mentally.

In late October or early November 2017, I fucked up. We went to a bar and got super hammered, then went back to my place and she stayed over. Let's just say I got too drunk, and my subconscious spilled the beans in an embarrassing manner. ""I just need to know there is a chance"" was uttered at one point among other things. The next morning I realized how much not being able to be in a real relationship with her was eating at me.

She didn't want to talk anymore after that, and I eventually got over her and moved on.

The current predicament:
After not hearing from her for about 6 months, I get a text from her yesterday (April 10 2018). Against my better judgment, at her request I met her at the bar for a few drinks.

The bar is close to me, about an 8 minute walk, so I have some time to think on the way there and try to mentally prepare myself. Literately no idea why she wants to hang out at this point. 

I was my normal self, calm, laid back, and easy to talk to. We caught up and we had some great conversations.

Emotionally speaking, I was doing great. No hard feelings, no sense of nerviness or discontent. We even talked about what happened and it wasn't awkward at all. She even seems way more emotionally stable. She was genuinely curious how I was doing, and asked a decent amount of questions about me.

Then she said something that I thought wouldn't bother me at this point, but hit me like a sack of fucking rocks smashing against every bone in my body.  ""This guy I've been seeing"". Mid sentence, totally nonchalant, while she's explaining what she did on St. Patrick's day. After this she mentioned him over an over. She even talked about a different dude as well that she was dating in DECEMBER. My immediate thought was, ""that's weird you told me over and over you are not ready for a relationship, but it seems like you dived into one right after we stopped talking"". To be clear, didn't say this, just a thought. This in particular makes me fucking pissed.

I kept my cool throughout the rest of the afternoon, even though I wanted to fucking scream. After the bar we went to her new apartment that she is waiting to be finished being renovated and checked it out. To note, her new apartment is literally a 3 minute walk, if that, from my house. She moves in the end of April.

During our conversations she mentioned a few times that she doesn't see her relationship with the current dude going anywhere. To be honest he seems like a dirtbag. Admittedly, because I'm still attracted to her and still would love to slam her like a screen door in a hurricane, this is obviously a biased option on my part.

She wants to be friends. The feeling I'm getting is that this time it is total friend zone. I absolutely cannot do this again. It's already sending me down a emotionally straining and stressed path. Based on my previous experiences I know that if get into another situation where I really like a girl but she is friend zoning me to some degree, it will drive me insane. I realize that I need to look out for myself on this one. To note, I am still good friends with some girls I've dated in the past. With Katelyn, it's different.

I want to grab drinks one more time and tell her that I can't be friends. That I've learned about myself in the last few months and I know what I want. I want her, completely. If we continue to hang out as friends my feelings will only get stronger and I'll be setting myself up to get hurt, again. If she needs me she can call and I will always answer, but I can't keep hanging out as friends without it fucking killing me inside.

Any advice I can get would be great. I'm I being to selfish? To jealous? Is she being unintentionally (or intentionally) malicious by flaunting her new dudes shes been with in front of me so much? I'm worried that giving her an ultimatum is to harsh and I'm being to over the top about this. Why did she date a dude right after we stopped talking even though she told me she wasn't ready? I am usually pretty good at picking up signs and identifying what people truly want. For some reason I have no fucking idea what she wants or what her intentions are. But should I even care? Should I take everything she says at face value?

225,"So I have been with this girl for about two years now, and generally I am happy with the relationship,. We rarely fight, and are really good friends and laugh together, share the same interests etc. It’s cool. She does a lot for me in terms of work (we work for the same company) and she is always there for me and generally very selfless. 

One thing which really gets under my skin though is she expects the world to be bought for her and paid for her by me. This has always been the case. Bit of context here, we work at the same company but are different compensation grades. I earn roughly £21k per year, and she is on £41k per year. She earns way more than me!

When we first started going out I paid for the first few dates, being gentlemanly and everything, I was happy to do it. Then we were for dinner once about a month or two into the relationship at a relatively cheap rough and ready chain restaurant and I suggested splitting the bill and she got all huffy with me and weird. A literal argument almost broke out, she said she just expects to be paid for when being out. Either way we split the bill that night because I refuse to be milked that way. 

So we’ve now been going out two years and to her credit she has been paying for the occasional meal out or night out. I’d say the ratio is for every three things I pay for, she will pay for one. But she is always kinda weird about it and sometimes I dread asking her to pay for things so I just volunteer to avoid a difficult scenario.

The reason for this post though is because it’s getting too hectic for my liking. She also has this whole princessy (cringe) attitude and actively asks for me to buy her presents or surprises, mid range price points I guess. But it’s too much, here is the latest example of what’s happened. She has been narking me to buy her £50 champagne glasses for a while (I just bought them to shut her up) and she text me asking for petrol money, another £40 gone. We are going for dinner tonight of which I will be expected to pay £60-80 and one of my favourite comedians is coming to town and I asked her to go and she replied saying “are you gonna treat me?:)” when I said you pay she went weird... so that’s another £70 down for me.. all of this in the space of 3 days!!!! 

Am I being tight here or is this behaviour  by her out of line? Also if it is out of line, any advice on how to approach it??

Obviously I don’t want to work a dead end job all my life and live off paycheck to paycheck but on the other hand, school is something I’ve never liked. I have my high school diploma though. 

Anyway, I’ve heard that trade school is the next best option besides the military if you want to make a career. You go to school for a year or so and learn with hands on while being debt free. That all sounds great so I’m wondering if other people who went through trade school can tell me their experience and what career they went with. Was it worth it ? How much money are you making ?

Currently, I’m in south Florida so it’s expensive where I live so I’m looking for a career that is looking to pay a lot. I’m someone who has always been good with my hands and into computers.

230,"I (f/24) dated my sisters best friend (m/23) for 6 months (on and off) and he fell super hard for me. I fell for him too but he was my first love. We’ve been properly broken up (no longer having sex) for about 2 months now and he told me he’s still in love with me and wants me to stay with him on my next visit to his city. 

He was my first boyfriend but he is also one of my best friends. I however am the second girl he’s wanted to marry and one of 120+ girls he’s been with (some of which while dating me). 

I love him and am still in love with him to a degree but in his mind I’m the end goal, I’m the forever and I just don’t feel that way. I have a need to comfort him and help him and give him what he wants but I know that he isn’t my forever, he isn’t what I want long term or short term anymore. We’ve both taken the breakup VERY differently. I’ve been ok the whole time because I know that this isn’t the end for me or for him, that there is other people out there for us, that our relationship wasn’t as great as he believes because it was great one sided but not both but he do any see that. He’s struggled with depression and sadness and meaningless sex and feeling like he’s lost his soulmate. 

I stayed in the relationship after being cheated on within a few weeks, did everything for him and let him treat me like crap because he told me he loved me. I ended up leaving and moving but still kept a relationship up with him because at the time I wasn’t sure what I wanted for my future anymore and I loved him and was deciding if that was enough to forget about all of the negatives in the relationship.

I know I haven’t helped the situation.. I wanted to stay friends because I do love him and shared some important parts of my life with him but I’ve led him on at times and tried to be what he wanted and say what he wanted to hear. I think he thinks I’ve been struggling since the breakup because he has but I haven’t as much as him. I’m ok but he’s not and I feel a need to help him.

236,"Hey..
I’m a 21 year old male in my second year of college.. I have really struggled to make friends due to my social anxiety.. It’s very difficult to make friends, and when I finally do, it’s even harder to maintain them without going crazy.. I have really horrible trust issues with people..
I find that the few people I consider my friends lie to me with more frequency than I’d like.. I usually get really invested and vulnerable with my friendships..  I also really value truth, so it really affects me when the people I care about and trust so much lie to me.. Even if it’s a white lie, a lie to save my feelings, or any lie at all.. No matter how innocent.. If they are willing to lie to me about something really dumb such as what they had for lunch, how am I meant to trust bigger things they say? After being lied to once, how do I know I’m not being lied to again? How do I know if anything they say is truthful? How do I know if they’re feelings for me as a friend are truthful? Can I trust that we are even friends? 
Am I being too harsh on my friends? I’m always very vulnerable with them and put all my trust in them, so being lied to is extremely hurtful..  Am I exaggerating? I just hate being so invested and vulnerable with people who seem to not be as honest as I am.. I wish I could trust my friends.. Is it partially my fault for asking very intimate questions and perhaps putting them in a position where they feel they have to lie? I would totally respect it if my friends don’t want to talk about something.. I would rather be told “I don’t want to talk about this” than be told a lie.. But it seems like my friends usually choose the latter.. 
So Reddit.. Is lying forgivable? How can I trust anything anyone says if they’ve been dishonest in the past? How much of this is the fact I was lied to VS my own trust issues? Is it partially my fault for asking such intimate things? Are my expectations for honesty too high? Am I alone in these feelings or does anyone relate? If I’m lied to, should I bring it up to them (I don’t want them to feel confronted)? And if I’m in the wrong, how would you suggest I go about dishonesty not bothering me as much?

Personal projects as well - I went to an arts high school and also art university, and have been involved in art since I was like, 8. I will often get an idea and really like it, start doing something and then completely lose interest in it. This obviously gives the idea that I am unable to finish anything.

241,"Today I had a meeting with my manager and I am working in a company where I feel like I won't progress as fast as I want to. 

About me- I'm 24 junior developer/programmer that graduated last year. I'm working in a company that uses old system and doesn't even accommodate any programming languages; it's all psudo code. I am trying to do some developing in my own time but I can't even get that because I literally have no time to spare. 

Before I got this job (3-4 hours transit), I applied to numerous places but no-one accepted me until these people. Due to my transit, I have no time to do any development to progress... even if I start applying elsewhere, how will I go to interview? These people have strict policy on sick and annual leave. 

Another thing which is blocking me is some personal paperwork which I am waiting upon before applying else where (predicting 2 months estimate). Also on my weekend, I'm busy helping my parents around so weekend is literally out of the window.

Any advice will be grateful and if you need more info please let me know. 
Just help me escape this endless loop into something which I can look forward to every day when I wake up.",11Apr2018,2
242,"So sorry if this winds up lengthy, im really trying to include every bit of detail so you get the full perspective and can offter circumstance based advice, so here goes. 

My best friend and I met when we were 18, so almost 10 years ago. Lets call her K. K and I are as close as can be. Weve seen eachother fully naked, held eacother while we cried, know and love eachothers families, etc. We lived together for a year in college too. I was even asked to be her Maid of honor when she got engaged. She has me in her phone as ""wifey"" and we literally call eachother ride or die best friends cause weve always discussed how NOTHING could ever break our bond. We tell everyone were sisters cause thats just how close we are. 

K and I text every day. As well as text we snap our daily makeup/outfits. We also regualrly tag eachother in facebook memes and Insta posts of mutual intrest. Not a day goes by that I dont hear from K in SOME capacity. even if we don't have a conversation that day we are present through social media. 

K has some relationship issues with her fiance, about 4 months ago he admitted to cheating on her. She was distraught but thte relationship had already gone to shit and was headed in that direction. So she started looking for apartments, I helped her in that search. I also offered her our spare room until she found something she liked. I brought her boxes for packing things in and offered up our truck for moving day as well as our help moving her things. 

I tried to be as supportive as possible. I took her to lunch and let her vent. I never talked bad of her fiance but I did agree she diserved better and that the relationship had met its expiration long ago. When she ultimatley decided to stay with him I internally was upset cause I wanted better for her. But I supported her in the decision and told her to ignore those who tried to input their negative opinions. I even tried to set up a double date to try and get their dating life back on track. 

about a month later things were still fine. Buisness as usual. Until March 20th. She had texted me about a funny situation at her job and we laughed and jokes about it. I texted her the following day askin if she wanted to checkout the new spa in town with me that she had suggest to me on groupon the week earlier. No answer. Hmm okay. Snapped her. She opened, no reponse. Tageed her on FB no ""like"" or comment. okay....I wait a few days and text her again on the March 26th about a situation with a celebrity we both like. No answer. She read the text though.  This is when I start to get worried. I continued to keep an eye out for her on other platofroms. She hasnt posted on FB since the 20th, she hasnt added to her snap story since then, and her twitter is the same. This is very unlike her. 

At this point I asked mutual friends if they had heard from her. They responsed that they too had texted her and she didn't respond to them. They werent as concerned cause they arent as close but this is not typical behavior of her. I decide to text her this on April 2nd. ""Are you okay? I know sometimes you need your space but youve been completley absent from everyone and everthing and I can't help but worry. I can leave you alone if thats what you wan't but if thats the case just say so. I just need to know you're okay and tell you that I love you and have your back if for any reason you need it"" \- NO RESPONSE 

So now im freaking out. Is she suicidal? is she hurt? did her phone get shut off? Im entertaining every possibility.I decide as her friend its my responsibility to call her mom. So I do.  Her mom seems surprised by what im saying and says K was at easter the previous day and was acting just fine. That she had in fact spoken with her just the hour before I called. She said K has been working allot latley but the thing is K works at a call center. Tht would not interfere with her responding to a text. 

K has suffered from depression in the past and sometimes needs a few days to herself to think and process, but she has ALWAYS said something along the lines of "" Hey I need a few days to myself to collect my feelings if thats okay"" NEVER has she ghosted liek this. I reached out to a co\-worker and K has been going to work and acting tottaly normal. 

I have no idea how to proceed or feel 

At first i was worried/upset. Was I a badd friend, should I call her Fiance? Go to her house? 

Now, with all this information im beginning to get mad. She can't even shoot me one text that shes okay? SOMETHING? Im clearly concerned and she has no worry for how I feel. Im 6 months pregnant and shes my best friend. Maybe she hasnt needed me for the past 20 days but I needed her at times and she wasn't there.  

WHAT DO I DO? Do I just sit and wait till I hear from her? Considering Ive done all I can do? 

Do I Go to her house? Do I text her exactly how Im feeling? And when I do hear back how do I respond? 

I can't help but feel hurt and alone and helpless. Please any advice is EXTREMLY APPRECIATED.

243,"I've been living with my step mom and my dad since i was around 4.I have eally difficult feelings concerning my step mom. To the surprise of other people i do care about her and there are some good moments between us. I feel lost in what i feel because it isn't as black and white. My step still does stuff for me she she isn't truly neglectful and that makes me doubt things. I always feel like i need some type of validation or advice about my feelings because i feel so lost and mixed up. 

My step mom is frustrated often. She yells whenever she stressed, tired, sick etc. My dad has told me that she gets severe headaches sometimes and doesn't always feel well so she her being on or off her medicine affects her moods a lot. She always seems to take stuff out on me. She is super critical about stuff and is really hard to please honestly. She always have some type of issues with the clothes i wear. 

When i was younger i went to a special thing for boys and girls club.I had  two shirts one had stains the other didn't so naturally i wore the other one. My step mom made me raise my arms up to see if three shirt was too short.Because the shirt had showed my stomach she said i was trying to ""get attention"" that i ""knew what i was doing"".She said this same thing  when i had bent down to tie my shoe in footlocker when i had on shorts.She would always make me feel like i was disgusting somehow and gross. Last year we were living in a hotel because our home had flooded(we live in the south) i was taking our dog out to use the bathroom. This man has approached me and started hitting on me i was like 17 at the time so naturally i was appalled(tho i would be appaled now I'm just 19) and i had ignored him kind of laughed uncomfortably and went to the front of the hotel.My dad and my step mom had saw and when they came back into the hotel they were like why did you take him out in the front? (I wasn't supposed to ) i told them that the guy had made me uncomfortable and my step mom said that i had ""wanted the attention because i was smiling""and that i wouldn't admit it in front of my dad....

When me and boyfriend got together she became really obsessed with the notion we were having sex. My boyfriend wanted to drive my for senior prom last year and she would go from this undertsanding mom tell me ""its okay you can talk to me etc etc then the next its ungodly to even think about sex at all that ""she sees what we are doing"" and it is ""not of god "" how its suspicious he wants to drive to prom. Two months later on a family trip with my cousin she keeps berating me about ""walking funny"" at one point she even pulls me aside asks demands to tell her why I'm walking funny.   She would see a sexual context in everything. ""Why is your hair messed up? Let me find out you're doing something during the day for your hair to be messed up"" as of lately age constantly thinks im sneaking around in my friends dorm. She was also judgemental towards my sister who had a baby last year out of wedlock.She asked ""why would you talk to your sister about birth control?OBVIOUSLY  it didn't work for her""or ""your mom probably told your sister to keep her legs closed. ""My sister is 26.

She criticizes my apperance often one ssay a few months ago she went on and on about how i don't put enough effort in my apperance ands how my boyfriend would want to""keep me ugly"" so that i wont leave she took a picture of me to show me 'just how i look'.If i am wearing a hairstyle that she doesn't like or think it looks good she would say stuff like ""if somebody tells you that looks good they're lying"" to you or ""if you were out with your boyfriend he would be looking at other girls"". Shes controlling over my hair won't let me wear certain hairstyles threatens to perm my hair (I'm black with natural hair).
  She yells and overreacts over the smallest stuff.A few weeks ago i had got in the shower while she was in there by accident and when i got out she yelled at me told me i was lying about not hearing the shower she was in a rage pushing my head back with her finger telling me i have this demonic spirit in me that i probably did it on purpose... My dad had told me i ""should've paid attention more""
Last year we had moved into a trailer while we fixed up our house. Before the flood happened my chore was to mop the floors.There wasn't a mop bucket so i had used the sink.When my step mom found out she was livid she started yelling at me calling me stupid and pushing my head back with her finger. At one oint She put her hands around my neck like she was going to choke me.  She asked me where i got it from and when i said someone from my mom side of the family she screamed 'i knew it i knew it ' asked if i had been talking about her to other people andthat she just KNEW i had been talking about her i had said yes and she took my phone. 

For the past two weeks things hasnt been as tense last week she took be to a prayer circle apologized for anything hurtful shes said or done crying and asking me to forgive her. This week she's been mostly calm i haven't gotten really yelled at she tripped a little.she was sick on and off since the beginning of tyre year so she kept tripping about things as usual she was  yelling about the outfits i wear to work making me change and made me show her all the outfits i wore to work. She would ask my dad or my little bother what i was wearing over the phone and kept making me late or almost late to work with her persistent yelling. For years my dad has always brushed it to the side ""she's frustrated sick she's  off her medicine etc"" ""listen to what she says not how are says it"" ""well she did overreact a bit but you did so xyz wrong"" and I've been noticing lately how much he brushes this off.

My sister and my mom live in a different state then me.  ive been recently complaining to my sister about my step mom and i guess she was fed up so she told my mom my mom was livid and 
Called me a few days later.She said that she shouldn't be putting her hands on me like that and told me to speak to me dad about it to give him a chance to fix the issue. She said im old with to where i don't have to stay here i can with her or my sister or i can stay with my aunt who lives down here. 

So ive talked to my dad yesterday and he basically spouted the same stuff. That i know she yells and i should just deal with it and there is stuff i need to improve and do better on. That if i would open up more things would get better for me he can promise that. He said he didn't think i was ready to live with my aunt.So i called my mom during muy break at work and told her his response and told her my feelings of guilt. She said she can talk to him Monday. Apparently he's not allowed to talk to her without my step mom present so she said i have that on my side.

I feel really anxious and guilty about this situation. For one I'm not allowed to talk to anybody about ""things that go on in the house"" and then i feel guilty because things have been going somewhat well and i don't hate my step mom and i don't won't them to hate me but at the same time i don't want to be here. I doubt they would agree on mrw moving out i think they expect need to stay with them throughout the next three years of college which i really dont want to do.I would love to stay with my mom or sister but they are far away and i would love to stay with my aunt but that also bring up the complication of driving to school/ work.

245,"Currently I'm in service as an E4 in the army. right now i'm looking to begin college using the GI bill, and I'm not too sure what i want to major in.

most people have advised me to just take my elective courses and figure out my major later in life.
However, I'm worried that i may choose a major that my school won't support, and if they don't allow credits to transfer out i'll be S.O.L

So, for the moment, what i want to do is become a video game designer, games were inspiring for me when i was young, and i want to impress the same sense of wonder and purpose on other generations.

Now, I am a realist, and I know the chances of me being a big league designer are a bit short, so i'm looking at some form of Computer programming/science/something degree that can make a healthy living (I hear 80k is a good starting wage?) that could also allow me to branch out into gaming if i found ""stable ground"" there

246,"I have been increasingly losing interest in everything and have even had suicidal thoughts a couple of times. One day, I told my mom I didn't want to go to school and asked her to take me to a therapist because I wasn't feeling too good inside my brain. Of course, she didn't agree to, stating that they ""would give me lots of pills and spoil my health"". She took me to an astrologer. He told us everything would be all right and sent us home. 

Here I'm, still not fine and crying about things as trivial as something someone said about my going to college abroad (I have apparently opted for the **easy** option). 

I suspect I might be depressed, have social anxiety and maybe even OCD and Borderline Personality Disorder. Of course, I don't know if I **really** do because my mom wouldn't take me to a therapist! I haven't told her about any of the suicidal thoughts because she'd either get angry at me and ask me what was wrong with my life/generally just reprimand me for my ""quality"" of life, or cry and create a scene and ask the same thing. 

The worst thing is, my sister who holds a PhD also says the same thing about therapists.

253,"Please refrain from joking; I am being 100% for real about this problem. So my little brother is 16. For as long as I can remember, he is the absolute worst when it comes to wiping his asshole. 

Yep. That's the problem. My little brother get's poop residue on everything he touches because somehow he cannot for the life of him wipe without touching his poop. I actually don't know if that's specifically the problem. What I do know is that he sits on the toilet strange, frequently gets poop on the toilet paper roll, and makes the things he frequently touches (computer/laptop keyboard and mouse, his phone, communal hand towels, our xbox controllers, chairs he frequently sits in while sitting on his hands, etc.) smell like shit. His hands also frequently smell like shit. Rarely, we'll find poop in the bathtub (wtf?) anf frequently on the toilet. 

Every time he's confronted about this, he gets emotional and defensive, like with everything, claiming it's not him. It literally cannor be anyone else. The evidence is damning. On a sort of related note, I think he has some kind of unaddressed developmental issues, which my mother denies. I just want this shit to stop, no pun intended. Idk if he frequently forgets to wash his hands, touches his poop when he wipes, whatever. Confronting him about it isn't helping. 

I just want my fucking xbox controller and the family computer to not smell like shit when I want to use them. I swear to god I have to thoroughly clean them nearly every time I'm about to use them. Which is nearly every fucking day.

I’ve never been drunk as I don’t consume any alcohol beverages, but I know people act differently and loosen up when they’re drunk, I feel like I don’t belong in those places and I wouldn’t enjoy going there, and I’m very fine with it, I’ll probably just ruin the mood for them, but they keep telling me that I should go. In your honest, most sincere opinion, should I  go? And what should I do/ how should I act if I decide to go with them? Again, I wouldn’t feel comfortable going with them, but I might just so that they don’t feel like I don’t like going out with them. Another thing is that sometimes we go out to eat and they order beer/cocktail, while I order soda or water. I notice the change in their behavior. Sometimes they all become happy so we all have a good time.

Don't get me wrong, I love to interact with others and I can be very outspoken, I'm even the representative of my class, but no one seems to care when I want to express something. For example, when it comes to organizing school stuff, I ask someone else to speak for me because even if I'm not afraid to talk in front of the other students, I know I won't be heard. In another context, when I meet someone not so long after I genuinely think they forgot about me because they also start to ignore me and stop saying hi to me and stuff. I don't have many friends and I want to have more but these circumstances make it difficult for me to be more sociable and develop almost all the skills I want.

269,"So I (17/F) have been seeing someone (16/M) for around 8 months and while things were great in the beginning I'm worried that there's something wrong with me because I don't really feel... happy, at the moment. It's a long distance relationship, so there's bound to be some difficulties, but sometimes I feel like I'm not needed or that he doesn't really care about me as he has a tendency to ignore me when I'm messaging him, to forget things I've said many times, and to make fun of the stuff I like. I like anime, reading, and learning things which he often calls me a nerd or a weeb for... He's a gamer and spends all of his time playing online. However, sometimes it seems the only thing we have in common is our love of gaming. As such, it feels... Distant, I guess you could say? And when he ignores me to game it makes me feel more like I'm an option than his gf. I was just wondering why I feel like this and if anyone else has felt the same way. I remember mentioning to him how I felt and he said he thought it was cute, because it meant I liked him a lot. He still forgets that being ignored makes me feel hurt though, and its confusing because when you love someone you at least try to remember what scares them the most, no? He said he'd try to remember but that he has a very forgetful mind. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong but if anyone has any advice or has been in the same boat I'd like to hear it, please.",11Apr2018,2

273,"Hello, lovely people of Reddit.  I live in Ohio, which is an at-will state for employment.

I worked for a therapy company that provides speech therapy services for children with autism for about 7 months in 2017.  I was fired from this position. 

My department was being contracted out to day-center for individuals with special needs, some of these individuals were known to be aggressive.  As a speech therapist, we don't have the training to recognize when someone may escalate, let alone the training of what to do if someone becomes aggressive.  I, unfortunately, was punched in the face by a full-grown young woman, HARD, on several occasions.  I visited urgent care because my face still hurt a couple of days later.

After the first incident, I let my supervisor know, and she pretty much didn't care, but we were no longer left alone with kids.  After the second, and third incident, I refused to go out anymore.  The staff that was left with us were on their phones, not paying attention, or did not have the proper training to keep us safe.  I refused to keep going out to this location.

Over the next couple of weeks, in our shared office, my boss conducted interviews with new candidates, stating they were looking to hire someone ""who believed that everyone deserves services, even if they have behavior issues"" and, I swear, made a dramatic pause to see if I would react to this.  I never said anything about ""deserving"" services, and I'll provide a service in any environment that is safe, but that was the grand assumption that was made.  I just ignored it when she did this in the interview.

After the new hire was confirmed, I was fired a couple of weeks later.  I wasn't really given a reason for being fired.  I probed and she said something vague like ""follow your schedule better"" and ""growth in the company"".  Throughout the summer, I had a low census, and asked for more cases on several occasions, but my supervisor was too lazy to get the referrals through for me to see, but it was my fault that I didn't bring in a lot of revenue.  She also talked about how little money I brought in at the end of that same interview I mentioned above.

I have already submitted my work history on my resume, so this company is on the resume.  I have to turn in paperwork this Monday that asks if I have ever been fired. I feel like if they call this manager or the company, and they ask WHY I was fired, I have no idea what they are going to say.  If they get my old manger directly, she will say anything and everything to keep them from wanting to hire me.  This manager is just a special kind of narcissist, and on more than one occasion almost succeeded in getting professional licenses revoked from her subordinates.

I am applying for a government job, so I feel like they are going to contact this employer anyways.  If they just verify I worked there, fine, but if they ask about my character... they are going to rip me a new butt hole.  But if I lie that I haven't been fired, that looks really bad.

I have the option to add documentation and explain why I was fired to the paperwork.  Should I just do that?  And state on the documentation that I can provide contact info for the people who were working with me at that time?  (literally everyone in the department quit that summer)

I'm so worried about this.  I am leaving my current job in May (another autism center with unsafe conditions), and I really, really need a job, money is tight.  I just don't want to jeopardize my chances.",11Apr2018,3

275,"Eight out of ten Americans are in debt. The average annual income in 2017 was $857 a week ,but varies depending on profession and location . In America, the cost of living in urban cities are higher than in rural locations. Many find it hard to make ends meet or save on a regular basis. Deficiencies in the job market or lack of fair wages force people to survive on a budget.

A budget is a premeditated plan that maps out daily, weekly, or monthly expenses. Start by figuring out your income and deduct all your expenses from it. This should be done at least one month in advance.  Your financial plan should also be adjusted if income decreases. It’s also a good idea to devise new and creative ways to save or earn additional money.

As time progresses, ask yourself what can be done different if spending  exceeds more than what you can afford. We can revert to the old saying, “A penny saved is a penny earned.""

A friend of mine keeps sending me gifts. (Or trying to. I haven’t shared my address with this person since my most recent move.)

From an emotional standpoint, I feel that this is unnecessary and puts me in this position of being obligated to reciprocate. I don’t want any of that.

From a purely practical standpoint, some of the gifts have had to be returned because they are too big/inconvenient for my living space. (Setting aside that I don’t want them in the first place.)

I’ve tried to talk to her about this in gentle and half-direct ways: “Please don’t send me anything. I appreciate the thought but I have everything I want.” Still, she keeps asking for my address...

What’s the best way of communicating that I don’t want anything sent to me, while keeping the friendship?

281,"We didn't have any contact the last year suddenly she texted me because she needed someone that listens to her.

She told me everything about her mother and that her boyfriend left her 3 weeks ago(what a prick), it was a pretty long conversation, we proceeded to buy some alcohol and just talked the whole day.

Furthermore she slept over at my place but i didnt try anything, i just can imagine what a catastrophic time she is going through and that she now really needs a friend who talks to her rather then me trying to become her boyfriend.

Also she is super hot and gets friend requests all the time and guys constantly trying to hit on her which annoys her because she has more important things going on then getting in a relationship again.
 
She slept over at my place again after going into a bar and getting drunk with some other friends the day after.

But now i'm here realizing what a smart and nice women she is (i had depression the whole last year so i really could use someone too in my life again) but i think shes not into me, she says things like ""i wish i could find someone like you"" and tells me what a wonderful and smart person i am, right before telling me she doesnt want a relationship at the moment.
(Typical friendzone stuff) 

It just tears me apart talking to her about life while slowly falling in love with her and not being able to talk to her about it because i think it would fuck up our whole friendship. And i dont want to leave here hanging in this situation while proving that every guy she talks to wants to fuck her and gets mad at her for not wanting to.


And now i could use some advice how i should help her with her situation overall and if i should confront her about my feelings.

There is a company which has strong connections to my school. Its globally well known and its one of those company where as long as they hire me they could pay me to answer their phones. I am honored to even get an interview with them.

There are about 10 people from my school who are actively applying for jobs for the company. ALL of are different departments. And since there are so many applying it has gotten around who is going through this process. This is also upsets me because I really did not want this knowledge know until it was more secure.

The biggest talker about this company is a girl I work with is becoming increasingly making me worried because after her group interview on Monday. She claims they said by Monday ALL interns will be hired. I must again add she is not in my department.

I interview round 2 last Thursday (about a week ago) and have not heard back yet. I was one of 3 interviews he had then and he was not even sure how his department would even do group interviews this year. He had to email HR before then. On top of that he sounded busy and was coming back from a business trip last week.

This girl is constantly badgering me that I should be hearing back soon and it does not think this is good information. On top of this, my department is even adding more internships this week so her timeline i believe is wrong for at least my department. I have something like 10 jobs within this company I have applied for and have at least talked to 2 recruiters and 1 hiring manager. 3 of these jobs were applied on Monday.

Is there any way to calm my nerves. I will see this girl on again on Friday and how she is right now I cant handle her because if she gets this job she will be posting about it everywhere.

286,"Hi y'all. I'm a 25yo guy, recently married, just starting out in a new industry. Love the change, and the industry is fascinating to me. I want to stick around. And this business has some really neat opportunities to make tracks and grow. It's a small 9 man operation with plans to triple in size in a couple years. 

I had reservations working here because one of the lead managers was someone I've known for years (15 years) to be troublesome and annoying. But I signed on anyway, feeling like the trade off would be worth the risk. The owner is also a friend, and someone I knew (or believed) would act fairly and who also assured me that this manager was a manager in name only.

So I got taken on in a different department. I wasn't as suited for the department as I would have hoped, so I asked for (and received) a position in a different department.

He ""technically"" manages that department. By manage I mean drops in maybe once every other day to show funny videos and generally distract us from our work, or issue directives that even the supervisor says not to follow. 

Manager also tends to be extemely controlling of our behavior. He's Mormon, (as is the owner, and me as well), and partially as result of that, instituted a ""no swearing, smoke free workplace."" We all think it's crap and don't bother obeying those rules, which the owner doesn't care to enforce either. 

Recently he made a decision that the supervisor is irritated with. He's re-hiring his daughter home from college to work with us while she's in between semesters. 

The supervisor doesn't want her there. She states that the manager's daughter can't consistantly lift the heavy weights required by the position, and consistantly makes mistakes. As well, we all feel uncomfortable with the daughter there. We're all generally uncouth and loudmouthed, and comfortable that way, and the daughter is ""goody-two shoes"" and has reported other employees to her dad for otherwise acceptable behavior. 

This is the second time this has happened. Last year the supervisor complained and tried to have the daughter removed, but the manager made a huge deal of it. 

My question is, how do I deal with this? Suck it up and deal with it is the plan, but the issues with this manager will continue to interfere with our work and cause tension and friction in the workplace.

And perhaps I'm just standing too close to the trees to see the forest. Either way, thanks for reading. ",11Apr2018,2

I won't waste your time, so here goes:

I met this girl online while playing a game. She asked for my number and I like a stupid guy, gave my number to her. Anyway, we started chatting and after some time we kinda started virtual-dating but never met each other.

Like any other online relationship (or not) we started FaceTiming and from there things developed to a different level. Intimate photos were shared with each other.

Please keep in mind that it all this happened over a course of one year but I was never able to meet her because of logistical reasons (She's American and I am not and I don't live in the US either)

Anyway since it was a long-distance virtual-relationship, there were insecurities, oddly from her side. I was stupid enough to trust her with everything but she was controlling my behaviour and monitoring my every activity on social media. I understand that I should have realized it then, what I was getting myself into, but I was in ""love"", right ? Stupid me. 

There were a lot of fights and she'd start crying. It all felt real then, so I'd end up consoling her which made her happy and this became a habit.She claims ""I hurt her and I fucked up her life by lying to her that I love her"".

Now she has threatened to turn my life upside down. She started by messaging my friends and family on Instagram. Then she sent my pictures to other people. She did that because she asked me not to block her (I did). She's demanding and all I can do to stop her from doing this is comply.

There have been repercussions from friends and family and I have been hating myself for getting into this mess, and I have no idea how to deal with this. I never thought I'd ever be cyber-bullied but here I am looking for help. If someone has gone through this experience or knows what I can do here. Please help.

   Where am I in all of this? Well, I’m in the caboose; over these past four years I’ve somewhat slacked off and just enjoyed the ride. It was certainly fun while it lasted, but now I’m paying for it. In fact, I’m currently struggling to even graduate **period**.

The biggest problem is that we don‘t feel like we‘re getting the education we pay for. Most of the time we don‘t do anything because some teachers aren‘t preparing for their classes. 
Also when we have to do work, the task is changed as we go along so there often are around three different deadlines and nobody knows exactly what to do.
One thing that really made me angry was that they changed the lengths of our internship because we didn‘t have enough time for school. We all alteady had our internships and had a giant hassle of informing our work places and even finding new ones.
Five of us have already left the school since they couldn‘t take it any longer. We are nine students right now and it still feels like the school is overwhelmed.

I can't sing, dance, draw, juggle etc. I also suffer with anxiety, insecurities and suicidal thoughts. I've spent most of days playing video games, watching TV show, anime, movies etc. and being alone. 

The one thing I'm told I'm good at is presenting. Whenever I've been asked to present or talk about a topic in front of an audience, I've gotten compliments from my professors. I can manipulate my voice very well, I can sound convincing and attract the attention of an audience. Though I should mention, it's probably not because of what I say, but how I say those things. I've always been interested in voice acting, reading or narrating. I talk to my professor, he said I could narrate about any topic that's relatable, add some humor and talk confidently. I'm not funny and not relatable, I could fake confidence for a few minutes though. 


I'm sorry if I sound too gloomy, I'm just trying to say as much about myself that's related so it's easier to suggest ideas. I'm open to any ideas, perhaps there is a short story or a poem I could recite that requires a little bit of drama. I'll be grateful to anything.

I cannot do this for two more years, so I decided that I'm going to get a GED instead.

I know it's ""only one more month"", but I'm thinking: what's the fucking point? I hate going. I don't feel like I'm learning anything at this point, since two of my classes are subjects I've already taken(algebra and world history) yet had to take again by my school's requirements(and we're going over the same stuff I've already learned). In English, we barely do anything(we just have verbal talks about random shit) and in science it's just busy work at this point. I've read about what's going to be on the GED test and I feel like I'm pretty set. I'm gonna take the online pretest to be sure, but I'm not worried. I'm not some genius but it's not that hard.

I left school early yesterday because I just couldn't do it for 4 more hours. People either exclude me or laugh at me. In one of my classes, I listen to music as loud as possible so I don't have to hear these stupid people at the table next to me snickering for almost the whole time. If I don't barge my way into conversations in an attempt to be included, then nobody will talk to me, so I've stopped bothering because who wants that, to join when you're not welcome. Oh and most of all, everyone in my classes is a good 2 years younger than me, and they treat me like I'm a fucking moron and a burnout. 

Anyway, I feel like I may as well just quit now. Whether I keep going or not won't deter me from my goal, so who cares if I don't go? My mom says that she thinks I should ""stay strong"" and ""tough it out"" but that it's also my choice, and you know what...how about no?  What should I do?",11Apr2018,1
311,"Hello dear reddit.

It is I, Philip.

tl:dr: I want to break up with my girlfriend, how do I do it?

Long(ish) version;

So I have been together with my girlfriend for one year and a few months, and I have come to the realization that it does *not* work out for me. There no longer is any alternative other than splitting with her.

The reason is that we simply do not match. She does what she can to make the relationship as good as possible but we are basically oil and water.

She is a bosnian traditional-muslim 28 year old woman so I'm worried her family will be seriously upset over a break up.

I have absolutely no issue with her religion or age but her personality kills me.

Help me Reddit :(",11Apr2018,1

316,"I suffer from very severe depression and social anxiety, as well as several minor physical disabilities. Even outside of my own ability to mentally handle a task, it's extremely hard for me to repeatedly lift heavy objects or perform physical tasks (My feet and legs get very tired if I'm forced to stand in place for a long time, as well).

I've started looking at stocking jobs as well as cashier or salesperson jobs in smaller stores, because I think those types of jobs would be easier for me to perform. However, I'd feel much more comfortable starting off with shorter shifts, i.e 4 hours or so, as opposed to working long days first thing.

Is it rude to voice these concerns? I understand that speaking up will make me unattractive to interviewers, but I'd rather be honest and get turned down than lie and end up quitting due to panic attacks, which has happened several times.

I've thought about working a desk job, but there are none near me, and I have no idea how I'd go about working from home. I've heard things about freelance writing, but I really don't have the time to build up a following and a portfolio and stuff.

If anyone has any other ideas or tips for my situation, I'd love to hear them as well. ",11Apr2018,8
318,"I'm not really sure where I've went wrong half way down the road to now. I was a good student in HS, an AP student almost my entire schooling. I graduated with honors, I got into my first choice of university and from the moment I stepped foot into trying to finish my college degree it's just been about me trying to support my immediate family. I don't really know what to say about them sometimes.

We've never been rich, things were tough growing up and all I wanted to do was help out but i wanted to finish my schooling as well. When i graduated we became homeless briefly and that greatly affected my ability to focus while in college. I finished my first semester barely and my second before having to withdraw temporarily for that reason. 

We somehow got back on our feet, and I took a under the table job that I managed to make a lot of money to help rebuild my family life. But still I wanted to get a degree, I thought things were looking up for me and then I ended up meeting a guy that I spent 3 years together with, and we ended up having a kid who is now about to be 3. The whole plan was for us both to finish together etc, but life happened and now i'm a single mother. I was doing ok financially still, but my parents have begun to drag me down again it feels like.

I scaled back on my job, and made bad customer relations with a big client because of their over protectionism. They've maxed 3 of my credit cards along with some other ones. I've paid off a nice amount but still have two big ones that keep me awake at night. I've considered returning some things. They got themselves into trouble with our own business we built around CDL driving so now only one of them can drive. Of course that would be my mom is who has too much self pity to get out there and make it happen. They want to lease a truck but have zero money, money is running out and I can't support myself and an entire house hold of people anymore on my income. 

Oh :) and I'm trying to go back to school to finish my degree because I have like 70 credits. Everything is so uncomfortable, I'm not really sure what to do. I'm tired of bailing them out, I paid off a credit card with money i came into and my mom wanted to used it again but I told her no. But surprise surprise they get into legal trouble I had to use it to pay for the legal fees. My second issue is i have a drivers license, but I haven't used it really that much and need to get back out there to regain more of my independence..but they won't take me out or give me the time of the day not that it's a requirement as I am an adult..

I'm just at a lost on how to get my life back on the right track here...especially when they people around me are equally as miserable. I thought of trying to get a work from home job with amazon or apple just to bring in something to stay a float while I work on everything else. 

A big part of me has realized that they are part of the reason my wings haven't spread as far as they could. Minus my own self doubt. My social life is little to none and I think I woke up and realized, I don't want to be like this by the time I am 30, as well as constantly getting what it feels like shit on for not being what they expected yet they've continued to disappoint in other ways. I always wanted them to just have normal jobs when I was in HS because it would of solved 100% of our money problems actually...

So i'm hitting the brakes, but I don't know where to start really..am I missing anything? How do I turn this all around?
How do I get back on the road as well? Sorry if this is disorganized I really tried to condense everything down...",11Apr2018,1
320,"There's a girl I like. I want to ask her to hangout, but I feel if I do, the topic of friends will eventually come up...and I literally hangout with no one.

I moved here two years ago. The first 6 months I was here I went to a ghetto high school and didn't meet a lot of people. The ones I did meet were druggies or went off to college. Summer then hit and I had nothing to do...so for the first year I was pretty much shit out of luck on meeting new people.


Once summer was over, I went to community college. It's definitely a hard place to meet people I feel like. I did meet a girl and dated her for a while before we broke up. I made some friends that I was only friends with because we were in the same class.

Now I'm in my second year of community college and don't really have anyone to hangout with. I could ask some people to hangout but I really don't care to since were just acquaintances and I live 40 mins away from the college where everyone lives.

So I don't really end up hanging out with anyone and I'm kinda fine with that. Ya, I wish I had 2-3 really good friends to chill with...but I don't. It bothers me a little but not that much. I just end up working, going to school, going to the gym, or playing video games with friends I've met online.

Now the issue is, I feel like someone else wouldn't be ok with me being like this. There's a girl in my class that I like and we talk and get along pretty well, but.. I feel once she realizes that I hangout with no one, she might bail.

I mean, I'm not boring. I would like to do shit like hiking, traveling, etc if I had someone to do it with, but I don't atm.

I guess in the end, I'm fine with being somewhat alone friend wise rn, but I don't think a S/O other would be and that freaks me out, causing me to push them away before we really even know eachother.

Do I need to change? Do I need try harder to make friends? I have, and it's so exhausting. Am I normal person being like this? What are you opinions?

She never changed. She is still very rotten and called me an asshole the other day for no reason.

Sad to say, but I feel no love for her. She has always treated me poorly. Never once supported my dreams or passions or showed an interest in the things I liked. She is a bully.

Recently she went through all my belongings that were hidden in a box in the basement, and found all my fetish stuff. She then threw them away in disgust. She doesn't respect my boundaries or personal space.

I blocked her on Facebook because I was tired of seeing her face. I blocked a few other family members who were negative as well.

Did I do the right thing? She was toxic and negative, so I blocked her.

Growing up she was always evil and calling me names constantly. Always saying ""Go kill yourself"" even though I was suffering through depression and going to therapy and taking medication. It really hurt.

She never apologized. She has never changed and is always negative towards me. Called me an asshole the other day for no reason. I don't call her names at all and stay away from her.

Be it racially charged comments (im half white half asian), calling me a dog, saying I was a human trash can (which tbf I was a fat kid) you name it, pmuch anything under the damn sun that could be called insulting, I was called.

When it came to dating, my first relationship was with my best friend (who was blonde as well). She broke up with me 3x and i took her back 3 fucking times like a moron, finally she cheated on me, and told the head of department at our school that I physically abused her (we were 15 at the time). 

Even now when it comes to the topic of dating, every guy I've ever felt a huge admiration, or even love for, has always ended up with a girl that would be the exact kind of girl who would epitomize the people who I believed at the time, made my life hell. Tall, light coloured eyes, slender figure and ofc blonde. Even now, my best friend of almost 6 years, and also the one person who means everything to me, confessed his love for me- and then told me that although he loved me, he was about to start a relationship with another girl. Who lo and behold- was all of the things I mentioned above. I haven't said anything along the lines of ""ive loved you for years"" to him but i've stuck with him and he is my best friend and closest person. But it kills me, every time I see him it feels like a knife in my gut. Because he is all I have and I'm terrified of loosing him.

I know that hating these girls is wrong, and so shallow of me, but I've tried so many ways to get over myself and stop myself from wanting to a) avoid people like that, b) want to get irritated/ angry with them for no reason, c) want to cry and run away.

353,"Hello all,

Reposted from r/askmom as I thought this sub might be a great place for help as well

I am in need of some advice from individuals who are not tied to my situation. My real mother is great to talk to, but just wants me to ""make the decision that is best for me"" (which doesn't exactly help me make the decision), and my dad and step mom are not great to talk to because they judge and guilt trip me.

I am a 26 year old female who is graduating next month with my AS in Psychology. I live on the central coast of California, but am from Northern California. I am in a three year serious relationship with someone whom I love very much. My mom also loves him, but my dad does not, and it seems to be because he ""is taking his baby girl away."" This can turn into a long story quickly, so I am going to try and shorten it as best I can. As I am graduating with my AS, I was also hoping to transfer to a school down in Southern CA so I can continue my education while continuing my relationship with my boyfriend as he is moving back down to Southern CA for a job opportunity. I unfortunately did not get into any of the schools which would have allowed me to do that, but did get into schools which require me to move back to Northern CA. So I now have the decision to move back home, start my bachelor's degree studies, and possibly transfer down to Southern CA in a year, or take a year off (while still attending Community College and working) and move to Southern CA. A little back story regarding myself; I have severe Attention Deficit Disorder, as well as suffer from high anxiety. As much as I hate to admit it, I am constantly late, and am one of those students who barely skates by. I have been in college on and off since I graduated high school almost 10 years ago, and have been working full time the entire duration of these 10 years. As my life has always been so busy, and hectic, I feel I have never had the chance to work on myself or my bad habits (including bad study habits.) I feel like I have been on this constant loop of work, school, eat, sleep, repeat; and now that I am faced with this decision, a year off sounds like a really nice time to work on myself and develop some healthy habits and hobbies. However, I can't help but feel guilty because I feel I am letting my family down. They have been so excited at the prospect of me coming home, but whenever I go there, I am happy to see everyone and visit, but cannot wait to get out of there. I start to feel stagnant when I am there, and it almost feels like I would be taking a step back moving home. Moving away was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself, and for some reason, moving home feels like defeat. I also have a 14 year old little sister who is going through a really rough time, and I can't help feeling like I should be around for her. On the other hand, if I take a year off from transferring, will I for sure go back? I feel like I will now, but I always hear these horror stories from people who took a little time off and never went back. I am very torn and don't know what to do....

Thank you for anyone who took the time to read the whole post, and thank you in advance for any advice you might give! I'll be happy to answer any questions for clarification.",11Apr2018,1

How do I handle this?

355,"Hi. I am a 19 year old in a small university town halfway across the country from any of my family who is very very terrible at literally anything involved in daily life.  Part of that is because my parents do a lot of things for me, so there are a lot of adult life skills that I haven't developed yet. Part of this is that I am a fucking idiot and a very bad driver. I've had my car for about a year and have never had an accident or anything like that but a couple weeks ago I was distracted and I accidentally backed into my landlady's boyfriend's car. I talked to my parents and they said they would handle it, which was incredibly generous of them.

Today I was turning around and overestimated how much space I had and hit a stranger's car again because I am fucking stupid. So I left a note with my name and phone number, and they called and said they were going to have it towed to an auto shop a 30 minute drive away tomorrow. I'm not sure why they need it towed since the only visible damage was the bumper(?) under one of the front lights but whatever. I sent them a picture of my ID, but apparently they need my insurance information. 

I don't know my insurance information. 'My' car is officially registered to my parents, who are away right now. I think I would need to contact them to get it? But I really don't want to talk to them about this; I would rather just pay for it out of pocket and have them not know, because I know they would be really disappointed in me and really upset with me and I don't want that at all. But if they need my insurance information before moving the car I think that means a) I need to contact my parents to get it and b) They might want to go through insurance which means my insurance would go up and they would find out about it.

Is there some way I can deal with this without talking to my parents about it? If it's a complete necessity, I understand, but I just don't want them to be disappointed in me. An accident like that is understandable if it's one's first time; that could happen to anyone, but for this to happen twice in like two weeks apart is unacceptable, obviously. I think I should just stop driving altogether, to be perfectly honest. But until that happens, I still need to deal with this problem. 

FWIW, I don't know how much it would cost to repair it, but I think I have enough money from working saved up that I could pay for it out of pocket. My question is, do I have to go through my parents and talk to them about this or do I have any alternatives?",11Apr2018,3
356,"So I was tinkering with the url of my school's grading portal to see if I could see the newest test grades like changing the number on our grade report. I ended up seeing my classmate's grade by changing one number and so I put another random number and saw some random person's personal medical information. Did it a couple more times just to be sure if what I was seeing was right and came up with a few other people's medical information in other states. That must be some kind of violation especially since it's medical info, right? I don't think that kind of information should be that easily accessible. I was thinking about reporting it, but would I get in trouble myself? Should I report it or just play dumb and hope no one even noticed that I was able to access that stuff?",11Apr2018,2

361,"27f married to 31m for two years, together for nine years. He cheated on me a year before we got married with my then-best friend (we had many fun threesomes before that with her too tho just to complicate things) They had sex when I was at work when she crashed on our couch for a few weeks. We didn’t have any threesomes during that trip though and things got weird between she and I but I think I  made myself blind. I got chlamydia from that ordeal and he lied to me for a year about how we got the STD (I think I had cognitive dissonance bc I thought I got it from getting an IUD around the same time) But he looked me in the eyes and said they never had sex. So I believed him. I found out a week before our destination wedding that they had sex multiple times that trip and lied to me about it but I felt pressured to go through with the marriage cause family had plane tickets for the destination wedding.
We’ve had a fun marriage, we have great great chemistry when things are good (explosive fights when they’re bad tho) 
Six months ago he cheated again. This time with a stranger, well a friend of a friend when super drunk, unprotected sex ew. I was upstairs sleeping before work, ew. For some reason I stayed but now I find I can’t trust him. He *swears* up and down he’ll never do it again, but he also said that last time. I’m a forgiving person and I really do love him but I don’t want to wait until he cheats a third time. Am I unreasonable for wanting to leave? Especially when the last six months have been great in a lot of ways? Like I said, we have great amazing chemistry when things are good but also crazy fights too.

She's told me a lot about her past; shes adopted and has had a lot of deaths in her family with whom she was very close with. She opens up to me a lot but I don't feel safe opening up around her. She's the type of person to make fun of people who are doing their own thing and by society's standards may be ""different"".

She basically asks me to hang out every day and wants to do EVERYTHING with me. I like spending time with her but there are not many people who I could spend every day with.

I have brought this up with him in light manner stating that "" it would be nice if there was some left for me when I get home"" But i haven't seen any significant changes yet except that he reduced the frequency of how often he watches he cut it to like 3 days a week instead of 5. 
I also made mistake of looking at his phone (one time only) after and noticed that he looks at escort adds to get off; I trust and i know he would never cheat or get an escort. But it really bothered me as the girls were younger than me and so very beautiful.

367," Okay so this is more for my SO and not me- but he doesn’t use reddit and I don’t know what advice to offer him so here I am. My SO and I both work at a b&amp;m shop . At work there’s 3-5 customers who come in on a daily basis and consistently overstay. They’ll hang out for hours and hours . Some have stayed up to six .

 My SO is a charismatic guy , so when he’s working he barely has a second to himself . If I’m working , they’ll all still come in during the day - but for the most part they don’t stay quite so long if it’s me flying solo at work . Though I have experienced it , and let me tell ya - listening to someone for hours on end is frickin exhausting .

 As time goes on I can see his patience is wearing thin . He has spoken to a few of them about overstaying and they took his words to heart ... for a few days . Then it’s back to the same shit . 

 After he’s had enough of them hanging out - He isn’t subtle with his hints to get them to leave  . His responses to them become short and curt - he goes about cleaning or stocking and they still just yammer at him constantly , or get in the way , or try to help stock .. like no , just let us do our job.. please stop trying to come behind the counter and stuff .. 

The thing is , our store is supposed to be a place for people to come and enjoy (not to this extreme though lol) , so we don’t necessarily want to set up a “no loitering sign “ . And these folks aren’t bad people  either (likely they could be our friends if we weren’t so burnt out on them ) but they’re around SO OFTEN that we dread seeing them . But seriously, we never thought it’d get to this extent . None of them seem to pick up on social cues at all. 

My SO told me this morning “I heard [customers] voice coming up to the front door this morning and I almost wanted to cry “ 

This job used to be heaven for both of us . We had a good time helping people, sharing info on our products , and having some good chats with customers here and there . It’s also a chill enough place where our boss lets us explore our creative hobbies when we have downtime . Now it feels like babysitting , and there is no time for us to be creative . 
Even if I’m in the back and not working , just drawing or whatever - guaranteed one of them will stumble  their way back there and breathe down my frickin neck while I’m trying to focus . 

Sorry , we’re at wits end . Any advice would be fantastic . My SO has a bit of a temper and I really don’t want it to get to the point where he snaps at someone . ",11Apr2018,3

369,"So it's not really and addiction and it's not necessary to all food, let me explain.

So I started a cut back in early February, since then I've lost 23 lbs. Before my cut, my favorite food my whole life was wings, and living in the buffalo/Rochester upstate region, they're the best in the world around here. I was eating a good 20-40 wings a week. Now, at the start of my cut I said to myself ""I'm just gonna not eat wings until I reach my goal weight"". Not really for dietary purposes, I have cheat days where I've had cupcakes and candy and stuff, but more or less a mentality of ""well I've gone this far without them, I'll feel shitty if I slip off the wagon now"", sort of like kicking alcohol, except not as drastic.

It's getting very very hard to stay away from them. A big reason is because I got a job at my favorite place I used to order, so I get to smell wings CONSTANTLY. 

Like I said, this isn't so much about me not wanting to get fat from them or anything, I still eat good tasting food every once in a while, it's really more a test of mental toughness than anything.

Any tips on how to avoid a craving for something you want to do without? Thanks",11Apr2018,0
370,"
I take band in my highschool. Our band room is pretty spacious (about the size of a small auditorium), and there is an upcoming competition for drumline which calls for making props and what not. 

Basically, the band made 50 or so wooden boxes the size of coffins, spray painted all of them, and laid them out to dry INSIDE the band room right next to where we set up and play. There is also no ventilation in the room at all, and doors have to be locked at all times due to a new policy in our school. It is also impossible to move them outside. The smell in there is unbearable, and I would have severe headaches and watery eyes after class.

What I currently plan to do is to consult my school nurse and tell her that I am allergic to the paint, and cannot attend the class period until the boxes are out of the room. But I am still unsure as to how to proceed, and whether or not this is the right way to approach the situation. 

Any advice?

Anyways, for the 27 years I’ve been on this earth, I’ve lived with my mother and younger brother(24) who has special needs(MR amongst other things).

My father has been out of the picture for awhile and the three of us have very little family where we currently live. My relationship with my mother has had its fair share of ups and downs(she has anger management issues and can be immature/For my part I’ve made poor choices in terms of my education/career that have stressed her out).

I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m financially comfortable enough to move out with my girlfriend of 4 years(happy/solid/amazing relationship). She had been asking for awhile to move in together but I’ve been reluctantly pushing it off because of my guild for possibly abandoning my brother who I help out with(he receives some services but I’m still helping out a lot). But it’s come to the point where my GF is extremely frustrated and rightfully so.

I guess what I’m asking for is advice on whether I should move out and how to broach it with my mother.

382,"Throwaway.

I'm a huge geek out of college. I work now for a large company.

A month ago I had to wake up and attend a webinar from home. Our largest client was on it, as well as half of our higher ups in our company.

I took a shower beforehand, and when I got out, I dried myself with my towel, threw it in the hamper, then I looked at my phone.

Holy shit, it starts NOW. I can't be late.

My laptop is in the living room, my bedroom is all the way across the house and upstairs. Shit.

I panicked, leaving my towel in the hamper, put on my glasses, and went running in my birthday suit in a panic to the living room.

Log in now, show I'm there, and get dressed right after.

I logged in, and clicked the video icon to start the presentation, and then right there was my nightmare as the screen opened.

There I was, in HD on screen.

I was NAKED.

I'm a virgin at 22. And here I am, all my secrets exposed for 35 people to see if they just glanced at their computer screens.

Eyes wide, mouth open for 5 seconds. My 5'6 bare body on screen. Lily-white from the neck down. A smattering of hair on my chest and rounded belly. Not ""fat"" but definitely a belly on a geek who never hits the gym. 

And my 4 inch limp penis for the world to see.

In a panic, I spammed the icon to turn off the cam, and all it did was maximize it.

In pure fear, I clamped a hand over my penis and balls, turned my big, round, bare white butt towards the camera (my friend Ashley always teases that I have a ""bubble butt"" that she says I'm ""hiding"" under my ""nerdy khakis"" all the time) and ran out of the room for cover.

I came back, fully dressed. Everything was fine. No laughter. No commotion. Nobody must have been paying attention before the training started.

After it ended, I received an email from Mrs. Jenson, the (very attractive, and very married) 47 year old Senior Vice President:

""Next time don't go traipsing around your house with absolutely nothing on before a big meeting. You're lucky nobody else saw. Don't worry, I won't tell your boss, naked boy. Nice BUTT! haha.""",11Apr2018,0
383,"Warning: long. TL;DR at the bottom.

Some background: the guy I'm going to talk about and everyone else involved in this story used to go to school with me, but we all went to different secondary schools. The guy in question has always been kind of a loner so I'm ashamed to admit I never really talked to him much. No one really had too much trouble with him tho, and he had some friends. Lets call him A. A ""curiously"" got out of the class WhatsApp group before any of this happened.

School ends, and averyone goes to different secondaries (the old school didn't have one). A good friend of mine, lets call her B, recieves some messages on Sarahah (a social network  where you can send anonymous messages, pretty popular here on Argentina) saying that everyone at the old school bullied A and treated him like a little kid, things like that. Due to certain circumstances we found out it was A himself sending those messages. We let it pass and kind of forgot about it.

Then, weird shit started happening. A ""received a death threat"" that a friend of his forwarded to me because the ""sender"" was using my WhatsApp profile pic and thought it was me. Can't blame his friend tho, he was pretty polite and I explained that it wasn't me. There were some screenshots of the sender telling A that they where going to kill him and stuff like that. It also included a picture of A's house from outside, which ""proved that the sender knew where A lived"". It also included a 2 min audio saying that they would kill him and that they knew where he lived; the audio had a voice changer applied but it was still pretty obvious that, you guessed it, it was A. I showed a friend the audio and he confirmed it, even A's pretty sketchy talking patterns were there. You know, repeating things and sounding kind of nervous all the time, if that makes sense. Thankfully, no one believed it was me in the audio, because it wasn't.

Fast forward a month, and an Instagram account named a random set of letters and numbers messaged a girl from our class. We should call her C. Yes, the account was actually A. It was him pretending to be a certain special needs kid from our class, one that A kind of treated like shit. Everyone knew this kid, (the one that A was pretending to be) liked the girl that this account messaged so obviously undercover A sent her hearts and random stuff like that. She forwarded it to the group (yeah, you might call that a dick move but come on) and I said that it was probably A. You know, he had faked identities twice at this point so yeah. Some believed it was him, some didn't. Undercover A started also messaging B, the Sarahah girl, writing with pretty brutal spelling mistakes and sending pictures of burguers, obviously mocking the kid that he was pretending to be (Yeah, a pretty lame way to do this, but still, we were all weirded out).

Undercover A messaged me too and started sending me screenshots of *entire conversation he had faked with his main account* where he, undercover A, treated real A like crap. I told him that I knew he was A and he told me he wasn't and tried to convince me he was the special needs kid. (All of this was being forwarded to the classes WhatsApp group and more people were convinced that it was A by now). I told him to piss off and stop seeking attention so he blocked me. Oh so curious, his main account blocked me too. This convinced the whole WhatsApp group that it was A managing this fake account.

I wasn't done tho. I sent him a private WhatsApp message telling him to ""make the fake account less obvious next time"". He told me to fuck off, called me a faggot and blocked me there too. I sent that to the group, and C (the first girl undercover A messaged) talked to him on WhatsApp trying to understand why he would do something like that. She was way more polite than me so the could talk for a good while. He sent her *11 minutes of audio* saying that he didn't want anything to do with us and to leave him alone (Even though he was the one that caused all of this) and telling her that yes, he did it. The fake account was his. Kind of a victory, right? He apologized to me and some other people and I wanted to leave everything there.

Now, for the next part, I need to say this: I'm gay and everyone in my old class knows that, even A.

Aproximately one week ago I got a mesaage from yet another fake Instagram account calling me a faggot and telling me that they're going to beat me up and to ""be careful"". At first I didn't really think of A at the time but now it has dawned on me, it is probably him. I'm not saying it is him but come on. He's done this three times before.

Sorry if this was kinda boring but I don't know what to do. It would be the fourth time he has faked an identity, and I seriously don't know what he is trying to achieve.

If you get angry about everyone sending everything to the WhatsApp group, think about it. You would have done that too.

UPDATE: you won't believe it, but A mesaaged a friend apologizing right after I finished writing this. You guessed it, WhatsApp group. I stated the four times he has faked his identity before and told my friend to tell A to fuck off. He deserves it.

TL;DR: Guy I used to go to school with sent girl anonymous messages stating that he's bullied, faked death threats using my picture, pretended to be a special needs kid from our same school (using a fake account), and sent me threats (using another fake account) because of my sexuality.",11Apr2018,0
384,"So my friend invited me and our mutual friend (let's call her Emily) to visit her in Taiwan (where she lives). The three of us all know each other really well btw. So I've never been to Taiwan and I was super excited, but Emily doesn't want to go. She says she has always wanted to visit Taiwan, but she doesn't want to sacrifice half of her winter break to go there (winter break is the only time we can go because summers we all work and other breaks are too short). I suggested a compromise where we don't stay there for too long so she can still spend plenty of time at home, but she doesn't want to do that either because apparently that's ""not enough time in Taiwan."" My mom won't let me travel alone so basically I can't go unless Emily goes... Any advice on how to convince her to go? BTW she's the type of person where once she's made up her mind it's very difficult to change it. ",11Apr2018,2
385,"So backstory: 
This girl and I had been best friends from 7th grade (2011) - 12th grade (2016) and I’m talking like really close, we were neighbors so we’d hang out all the time and we went to school together. 

In 10th grade I stopped talking to her because we had a fight. I felt left out since she had another best friend and I didn’t talk to her after that for over a year. 

Around mid 11th grade I texted her saying I was sorry about everything and I was over it and asked if we can be friends again. We reconnected. 

We were best friends again until aug 2016. 
We haven’t spoken since. I never gave her a reason why. One day I just stopped talking to her. I stopped texting her back. Whenever I did, I would say a max of 5 words, I wouldn’t make conversation etc. I completely isolated myself and shut her out entirely. 

Why? I think I was just jealous again because I felt left out since she had another friend she was getting really close with and I feel like the other girl was influencing her in a bad way. (They’re not friends anymore btw) I used to say there was no reason why I stopped talking to her but now that I really look back, I can’t lie to myself, her having another close friend was part of the reason. 

I wanna be her friend again. It’s been too long, I don’t care anymore. She really is my other half and no other friend can match that. I haven’t had other friends since her. I miss her. 

Should I text her apologizing and asking to be friends again? do I come off as someone who can’t make up their mind? Am I just fucking annoying at this point? I know this looks so bad because this is the 2nd time I’ve done this and I just don’t want to do something that’s gonna make her be really annoyed with me and think “not this shit again” 

I don’t know what to do. Help. Just be brutally honest bc i need that. How would you feel if an old friend texts you? What would you do in my position?",11Apr2018,1
386,"I watched a Youtuber play NBA2k18 (a basketball game) and I got really into it. I watched a couple random NBA videos and Kuroko's Basketball and enjoyed it. I think I would like to give basketball a go - never got a chance to at school. I could try and see if my friends would be up for some games but I highly doubt they would be so I might join my Uni's Basketball club, try it out. Do clubs often accept people with literally 0 experience?

My problem is i'm not exactly fit. In fact i'm anything but fit, although not fat. Would this be a huge problem for a real beginner since the game is very fast paced. I've never done any sports really ever and have never been part of a club of any kind

I feel there are a few other questions I have but can't think of how to put them so if anyone else has been in a similar position I would love to hear about it.",11Apr2018,2
387,"I’m a 35 year old woman. I have recently felt a strong desire to pursue Medicine. I have always been interested in learning about all things regarding the human body. My mother passed a year ago, I was her caregiver since 2012. I feel like she was failed many times by her doctors. I want to help people, and I want to make sure others don’t go through what my mom did. 

I have just begun the path of getting my prerequisites for med school. Here in Canada two years of university are needed to even apply to medicine. If I’m lucky enough to be accepted after two years, that would mean another 4 years in the program, I would graduate at 41.

I haven’t told anyone really about my plans, I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up... 

I was hoping to get some unbiased opinions. Am I too old for med school?
