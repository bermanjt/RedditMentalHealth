1,"So to sum up what’s been making me feel this way,

March 4 my then fiancée and I went to Disney for spring break where she revealed to me that she was falling out of love with me and I made her miserable and we should separate and call off the wedding etc.

The following weekend I’m getting ready to move out and she wanted me to lay with her and we made dinner and watched our shows like nothing changed and I woke up to her being sexted by her co-worker at 5 am and read through their texts and they had been sexting for a while though she claimed nothing would come of it and she did it just because it made her feel something that she wasn’t with me (I know that sounds like I’m a fool for believing her but the guy is like 37 and her subordinate and not attractive like at all...like not being cocky but if I’m Idris Elba he’s old looking Kal Penn on his best day) (we are both 23) bu still that set me off yknow but I kinda just accepted I lost her and confronted her about it that morning and she kinda crumpled because I didn’t show any emotion and just finished packing my stuff and she started crying and begging me to forgive her and swearing she was going to tell me and it wasnt going any farther than it had and we talked about the fact that she showed signs of being bipolar but we both tried to ignore it and then we talked about how I had made many changes for the better in the last week (got a job, got a social life, etc. her problem with me is that I was still stuck in school and she got a manager job and I got absorbed into her and became “us” instead of myself. Which is true but I tried to break up with her several years ago when her friends and family turned their back on her and she was taking it out on me but I stayed with her because I did love her and couldn’t do that to her and ended up falling deeper in love for all her faults. She insisted we moved in together, then we moved into a townhouse farther from campus and my former friends, I alienated myself and devoted myself to her and she kinda babied me even though I tried to fight it and we looked up and I was a 23 year old unemployed pothead with no friends, and she wasn’t an unemployed pothead Bio Major with no friends and going nowhere anyway either but she landed a job and got some friends and turned it around while I sat still) we decided to take a break for a week with no contact but we had a heart to heart before I moved out all the way and held each other and kissed and all that and I felt like we had left in a better place than we left it.

Queue today, I was waiting excitedly for today and anxious about the outcome and I took her to dinner for my birthday, we caught up and talked but she essentially told me the way she felt about me didn’t go away but she still loved me and she wanted to take things slow, still not talking all the time just every once in a while. Pretty much broke my heart all over again, and now I’m fighting cutting off ties altogether and trying to find someone who loves me back the same way I loved them through thick or thin sickness or health, or just taking it day by day and hoping she’ll come back around which I know is stupid, it’s just like 2 months ago we were engaged and we have two dogs together and a home and our families were each other’s family, and now nothing, and I love her a lot, outside of my lack of direction or success I’m like an unrealistically good partner and even she said that. I’m loyal to a fault, I’m emotionally available, I’m considerate and thoughtful, dependable, etc. 

But to put the icing on the cake on my birthday, I come home and pee blood. I have high blood pressure and I’ve found some sort of lump in my right ball and I’ve been abstaining from masturbation but I’m pretty sure I’d find blood in that if I were to as well. My grandpa struggled with prostate cancer and I’m terrified that not only am I not as successful as I foresaw myself, not only am I empty inside and heartbroken with my life flipped upside down, but I also might become infertile, lose a testicle, have actual prostrate cancer, or worst case die or have a ruined quality of life. I’m going to the doctor tomorrow to talk to them about all this but it’s very very hard to keep my head up. 

Tl;dr: got dumped a week from my birthday, success seems far out of reach for me, and Im peeing blood and found a lump on my testicle on my birthday. ",26Mar2018,1
2,"So the question is,  I know I need to apologize for losing my cool with my boss and giving him attitude when he complained about me following his instructions.  I need a way to apologize but still request either clear OR accurate guidance in the first place (he's a master of either not communicating or doing so very vaguely or changing his story) . Any advice?

A little back story (if you want it) - boss sent an email to all supervisors about needing a report compiled by close of business on each Friday. 

Last Friday I was pushing it very close to the deadline (I usually have mine done ahead of time). I got a call from boss just after I had submitted the report (still with 15 minutes before the day closed) asking why my report was late. 

I reffed his email that stated Friday deadline of close of business and he sort of acknowledged by saying he would send a follow up email to push that deadline back a half hour. I thought that was the end of the conversation but he continued on asking me whether I had just planned to leave it until the last minute. 

This is the point at which my patience was worn out and my response was pretty chock full of attitude (as I was short on time due to having a half day and then meetings as well as being requested at the last minute to stand in his own place to interview a candidate). It's obvious he could hear my anger/attitude and wasn't happy as he wrapped the convo very quickly and hung up being just as short and terse with me as I had been with him.",26Mar2018,1
3,"The music scene at my university is very active and a lot of fun, with basement shows almost every weekend. The problem is, half the people who attend often smoke indoors. What should I do? From what I know, there isn't any music scene that doesn't exist outside of random basements in houses around my university. I don't want to leave the scene, but I also don't want to deal with the awful smell, suffocating air, and potential health issues every time I go to a basement show.",26Mar2018,1
4,"So I recently discoverered that probably there is a girl on the same school as me that is probably a friend I didn't see since Kindergarten.

While probably we are not even the same people, I really wanted to try and make a possible friend, because honestly I'm not a very social guy and every time I see a chance of a friend I want to take it, believing it will be my new bff.

So, how should I approach her, since I'm not even sure she's the same person? Should I ask someone that I know to send her a message asking if she remmebers *my name* from years ago?

Asking directly to her wouldn't work, I would probably not be able to stand the shame, even if she is indeed the right person.

I hope this question is understandable.

PS: I'm not very social, and I'm unfortunately also a lot shy.

10,"I was woken up this morning by a phone call saying that my friend had *just* ODed.

I should feel sad, its expected, but I'd also not seen him in years. I'd spoken to him on occasion via Facebook. He was one of my best friends when I was 16-20 and we'd been friends for damn near 20 years.

When my daughter was sick in hospital with a viral infection, he saw the status on Facebook and messaged me straight away. Asking how I was holding up. He sent her flowers. Offered to send me pizza at the hospital. 

We used to spend hours. Literally hours sitting on the docks, just talking. The sun would come up and we'd realise what the time was. He was the first person I'd ever felt comfortable to be around. 

Granted we'd drifted but life does that.. I always felt like sometime we'd meet up for a beer. I'd introduce him to my husband, we'd hang out and laugh about the good old days. 

But this morning, I was woken up by a phone call saying that he's dead. Gone. Just.. .. so fucking stupid.. he ODed. No one knew he was using. He'd used when he was younger, but stopped. He had his shit together. Now he's gone. 

I feel sad. I'm mad. I feel stupid for being a blubbering mess. I've got uni work to do and a daughter to care for. We'd not actually seen each other for years so I feel like a twit for feeling anything at all. I don't know if I'd be invited to the funeral because I've been away from everyone for so long. If I was, I don't know if I'd want to go because that means he's really gone. Like I know he is, but ... the fuck do I do? ",26Mar2018,1

12,"Hey r/advice people!  


&amp;nbsp;

Throwaway account for various reasons.  
&amp;nbsp;


So a little bit of background first.&amp;nbsp;

  &amp;nbsp;


I used to run a successful blog almost 7 years ago, it was generating tons of traffic (30k unique IPs per day+) and subsequently, money off of ads.
  &amp;nbsp;


I was the only person working on it, sometimes working 20h per day. Writing/moderating comments/researching/sending &amp; replying to e-mails, etc.
  
&amp;nbsp;

I was an one-man-army.
  

Threw that opportunity down the drain twice. 
  

First one was when I was being offered a decent amount of money to 
sell it. (I didn't know better)
  

Second one was when I broke up with my then LTR and let her destroy my financial life.
  
&amp;nbsp;

Since then, I've been patiently waiting for another opportunity and I feel like life is finally giving me a chance to redeem myself and possibly achieve some level of financial security.
  

Last summer, I joined a project that included a website, forums, a podcast and a livestream/talk show about a video game that is scheduled for release next year.
  
&amp;nbsp;

There were 4 people on the project. We were mostly hanging around, chatting and waiting for news to be released. (info about the game are scarce atm, expecting big news during E3 2018)
  

Recently, the project's founder called for a meeting where he explained he could no longer sustain the project financially and that it was consuming a ton of his personal time. (Understandable)
  

He wanted to scrap the entire project and that's when I asked if I could gain full access to everything. He agreed and transferred full ownership to me.
  
&amp;nbsp;

I downscaled the project to just the blog and put my focus on growing the twitter account, while also setting up a twitch channel.
  

The blog is getting consistent visits daily, even though there's not too many articles on it atm due to the scarcity of actual news regarding the game.
  

The project's twitter has also gained a dozen followers since I took over. I'm being very active on twitter and liking/following/retweeting anything related to the specific game.
  
&amp;nbsp;

Everything good so far.
  

The problem is, how do I proceed? I want to give everything a more professional approach.
  

Since I'm active in the community, a few people have contacted me to join the writing team.
  
&amp;nbsp;

My question is, how do I monitor the work these people would potentially put into the website and how do I pay them?
  

Hourly rate? Pay per article? How do I know how many hours they worked?
  
&amp;nbsp;

So far, people have agreed to write for the blog, mostly to have direct access to the game's fanbase and profit off of directing traffic to their own youtube channel or just writing non-profit until the website starts generating money.
  

I expect the project to blow up during/after this years E3 convention, because the company is going to showcase the game there for everyone to see.
  
&amp;nbsp;

I really don't want to let this opportunity slip away from my fingers. There's real potential here.
  

I'm also in direct contact with some of the game's developers and I've pitched the idea of some live interviews with them on Twitch, under the project's name and they've agreed, just need clearance from higher-ups to be on the safe side.
  
&amp;nbsp;

I am good at executing plans. Coming up with decent plans however, is not my forte.
  
&amp;nbsp;

If someone could hint me towards the right direction, please do!
  &amp;nbsp;


A big thank you in advance, to anyone that decides to help me.

17,"So I'm currently playing high school baseball. I was on the team last year, even though I played only a few innings out of 10 games. This year I am playing again and we have had three games. I played the entire second game but have been benched for the other two.

What concerns me is not so much that I am not playing all the time, as I know that I'm not the best on the team. What does bother me is that most of the people that do play rarely come to practice, while I come every day. Last week a new player joined the team without trying out and played the entire third game while me and a few others didn't get put in. It just seems unfair to me and the others who don't play often but do come to practice every day.

My question is how do I approach my coach about this issue? I definitely want to talk to him, but I don't want to come across as complaining and make him defensive. I would like to ask how I can improve and make myself valuable but I also want to address the players who don't come to practice and the player who walked on last week.

I could never see her more than a friend because ik it would not work out for a lot of reasons

I have been deciding who to go to prom with and I was hoping to go with E and she would like that so she wouldn't worry about a date, but a lot of people including my friend group thinks I should go with O.

26,"I am a 19 year old girl in college. I have had some boys interested in me over the years, but for some reason I always turn them down. At first I think it was because I was super insecure about my body and just my self in general. For the past 7 months or so I have felt a lot more confident and have gotten a lot more attention from guys, but I always turn them down. I'm not even sure why at this point. Maybe because I feel safer when I have control and I'm scared of being hurt. I also still have body image issues and keep thinking that I'll just wait a few more months until I lose a couple of pounds or something like that.

All my college friends think I had a boyfriend in high school because I told them the first week I met them and now I can't admit that I was lying now that I'm closer to them. They think I'm a strong, independent person who doesn't need anyone and is just focusing on being the best person I can be. In a way this is true, but for a couple of months I have been secretly wanting a boyfriend.

At this point, I don't know what is stopping me from at least kissing someone. I don't think I could ever hookup with someone at a bar or something. I feel like if I have waited this long, I might as well wait until my first kiss is special.There is the boy I sorta like and he knows, but idk it just feels weird to admit I like someone.

28,"Let me start by saying I’m already 6 semesters in with only two to go. However, in the last two years I’ve been through a lot. I had a very traumatic and isolated childhood so coming to college and realizing how truly fucked up my life had been completely shocked me. My grades started slipping my sophomore year and that summer (last summer) my mom died in a car accident. We were very close and it was a terrible loss for me. My father’s household was emotionally abusive and we no longer speak. After her death, despite the grieving/anxiety/depression I was having I decided to continue with the fall and spring semesters because my mom had always wanted me to get a degree and get out of this state and I didn’t want to let her down. Well my grades slipped horribly last semester like from a 3.5 to 3.0 and this semester isn’t going much better. I don’t care about what I’m learning and I wouldn’t be happy in a job this degree would offer me. I think my major is very elitist and pointless. I realize depression causes you to not care about things you normally would but I don’t think this is that. I have been going to therapy and other than the anxiety I have because of school, I have never felt more in control and stable than I am right now. I just don’t know what I want to do. I never had time to consider anything other than digging myself out of the abusive environments  I was trapped in. I WANT TO TAKE A BREAK AND JUST BUILD MYSELF. Here’s the thing, anytime I bring it up to my friends or boyfriend they shoot me down. “Just finish and figure it out later” okay and waste more loans on a degree that might be useless and prolong my depression?? And sometimes I feel like they are insinuating I’m lazy or just don’t want to do the work. Maybe part of that is right, but I work my ass off at my job (restaurant) to pay bills and support myself without asking for help from anyone (my father’s family waves money over my head to try to get control, so the option is always there), so I’m not that lazy.

Am I overreacting, or is it really just not a big deal?

I haven’t checked his search history since then because I don’t want to violate his privacy any more than I already have, so should I take his word that he no longer does this and just move on?

It was always,""My way or the highway!"" situation. She will go off on rants on how everybody (but herself) is incapable of doing anything right. It's never her fault, it's always somebody else's fault. 

Whenever I had to do math homework with her she would always yell at me for misplacing a number. I struggle with math, and I do admit I am not as fast as she is at math, but she would get very mad and even impatient if I did it slowly and got it wrong. She would get mad, snatch the pencil from my hand, and erase away the answer furiously and yell at me on how to do the problem. I would just start crying (I was 6 then and even till this day I would still cry.) and once she started to see me cry she would then calm down. 

If me and my brother cleaned our room wrong or didn't put our shoes up correctly, she would yell at us for that. She would constantly tell us how messy and how it will effect us when we're older. Whenever we got in trouble, she would either spank us, ground us, and just yell at us and tell us how bad we were. 

I was never allowed to watch tv shows (Disney channel or Nickelodeon shows), wasn't allowed to listen to anything that wasn't Christian music (she's super religious), and we rarely had friends over. (I never really had friends since I was constantly left out) 

When I hit puberty and had crazy breakouts she constantly reminded me how bad my face looked and how I wasn't doing a good enough job cleaning my face. I was trying my best and doing everything I could to stop it, but I kept getting breakouts. Her constantly reminding me how bad my face looked really hurt my already low self-esteem. 

 I've tried telling her how I felt, but that backfired quickly. My mom has this wonderful talent of taking your words and flipping it back on you and making herself out to be the victim and you're in the wrong. I tried telling her that the words she says to me hurts my feelings. She instantly replied in an angry manner yelling at me that I've said mean things to her and it hurts her. I immediately apologized for anything,and everything, that I've said to her and I didn't mean to say or do those things. She kept reminding me that I've said hurtful things to her. It was basically,""I've said mean things to you, but you've also said mean things so we're even."" kind of thing. She gets super defensive whenever you call her out on her wrongdoing. 

The constant,""You did/do this wrong."" voice has forced me to never say anything in fear that people will yell at me and I'll cry. Or I never try anything new or challenging of fear of failure and people yelling at me on how much I'm a failure I am. I never do anything. Cause If I don't do/say anything, I won't get yelled at or hurt by others. Because of this my social skills have lacked severely (also the fact that I've been homeschooled most of my lifelong still am). 

My self esteem is in shambles. I cry so much because there's nothing I can do and I feel like I'm going to grow up alone and worthless. I have no desire to do anything. I get extremely sad whenever I make mistakes or fail. I have no support and I don't know what love is. My mother has never really shown support or cheered me on for anything. My dad left me before I was born so I've already been heartbroken by that. 


I dont know what to do anymore. I just wanna cry. I just wish I felt loved.

46,So I work at a retail store and there are quite a few cute girls who work there too. I want to get the courage to ask them out on a date but I’m way too shy to do that. I struggle on just talking to them because I fear they will think I’m an idiot or something. What are some suggestions that would help me find the courage to talk to them and maybe even ask them out?,26Mar2018,1
47,"I am 28 years old single guy who end up being the only one in this situation in my friends group.
Lately when they can go out is just to place not made for bachelors, like brunch, romantic restaurant full of more couples and boring birthday parties. They’re my only friends and i love them, but I don’t feel going out with them anymore, I am always the third wheel and this really sucks.
Do i go search for new friends or just accept my shitty life?",26Mar2018,1
48,"Long story short, found out that I've had depression for the past 6 years unnoticed until it finally hit me in a wave that crippled me these past few semesters (examples: haven't gone t class in weeks, grades are absolutely awful even though I was an A+ student in HS and got a 35 on my ACT, I barely had the motivation to eat, didn't have basic hygiene, no energy, constant worry about my life and social anxiety to the point where it exhausted me and contributed to my depression... the list goes on).

I'm finally starting to put myself together, albeit at the cost of some personal poor decisions. I'm currently using Xanax (for the past two days) at prescription doses (.25-.5mg up to twice a day) because it literally lifts me out of my depression, makes me want to get out of bed, do work, and actually be happy with my life. If I didn't have doses of Xanax these past few days, I would not have gone to my first day of my new job, wouldn't have gone out this past weekend and recognized cognitive distortions in how I see people and their perception of me, wouldn't have gained any hope in my life, and ultimately wouldn't be writing this post because I'd be smoking weed to avoid the fact I didn't do shit all day.


Instead, after some EXTREME research (I research every drug I do for hours on end - I have a biology background and coupled with my anxiety I need to know everything about a drug before I do it. In this case, Xanax is very scary to me - addiction, withdrawal, all that shit seems very serious and not a joke.) Yet, at the same time it seems that prescription and responsible use of the drug can be done. I know I'm already doing in wrong in using medication not prescribed to be, but I have legitimate anxiety attacks that I've always warded off as just me breaking down. I started therapy, and with weekly sessions, my therapist wants to refer me to a psychiatrist. 


The problem is, I don't have the time to be patient for medication and therapy. I have terrible grades right now and my life has been in shambles, and slow progress won't take me anywhere and leaves me hopeless. If I don't recover my grades and get my shit straight, I could lose a $32,000 scholarship.

So there comes my dilemma: is it okay if I responsibly use xanax as a way to lift me out of my anxiety and depression and get me going throughout the day? With its help, I was able to work thru 12 hours of working at a bar these past two days:

A shift from 9 pm - 4 am last night in which I took .5mg around midnight and could get myself through the night. I got home from work, organized everything for the next day, cleaned my room, and slept on time to get 6.5 hours of sleep. I usually have problems with insomnia and the xanax let me sleep like a baby. I 

I woke up refreshed, and I immediately got up at 9:30 AM (the first time since last semester), showered, went and got breakfast for the first time in 4 months, and went through my 11-6pm shift just fine. Again, I popped .5mg when my anxieties got to me, especially when I felt myself entering a depressive episode and I was worried it would keep me from focusing on work.

Now, I'm in the library for the first time in months writing this post, and then getting to work on my schedule and getting back on top of class. I've set up my calendar, organized my work, and am ready to start studying (I actually want to study).


It's like this curseful drug keeps me okay, it makes me want to live life, to get through the day, and be successful. yet at the end of the day I have this crippling fear I'll get addicted, that I'm using it as a crutch, and that I need to stop because ""everyone who uses xanax uses it to get through shit thats why they get addicted.""

I could stop using it, and just work with my weekly therapy sessions, but as seeing how its keeping me going I have this feeling that using prescription doses daily for a month (my school year ends May 5) and then tapering off and getting started on an actual antidepressant (my friend undergoing depression gave me a pill bottle of Prozac, but I'm afraid to use it in conjunction with the xanax.)

I know the obvious advice here is stop using the xanax, but it seems like I have no alternative. Things are so urgent and with this scholarship and my last semester on the line. I don't see any other option.",26Mar2018,3
49,"So I’m dating my brothers wife’s little sister, secretly. We’ve been seriously for about 2 months now. My brother just bought a house and I moved in as a roommate to help with bills and mortgage. Well last night we decided to out to some local bars to celebrate my sister in laws birthday. So the night went through and the problem happened when we got back. Everyone was pretty hammered. The girl I’m dating slept upstairs in the play room, right next to my brothers room. I slept downstairs on the couch, because no one is supposed to know we have been seeing each other. She texts me this morning asking if she could tell me something but i had to promise to not say anything. She tells me that she remembers my brother groping her breasts and inner thigh when he tucked her in. And that this isn’t the first time. She continues to tell me that two other times the same thing has happened. So now, I’m lost. I have no idea what to do.

50,"TL:DR - at the bottom

Quick background: 
I’m a hairstylist and I work at pretty popular all men’s haircut chain. Today was the second time a customer who is 15 years old!! Has recorded and taken picture of me while I’m working. 
The first time was about a month ago, he sat in my chair, I cut his hair and sent him on his way. Except after I paid him out, his dad and brother went to their car while he lingered by our bathroom and break room and took pictures / recorded of me. This was confirmed by two co workers. 
We all talked about it and I stood firmly that I will not be cutting his hair again. 
They came in today and I already made a plan to go to the bathroom or to do side duties so I could skip a turn Incase it was my turn to cut his hair. Thankfully my boss took him but the entire time she cut his hair he had his head turned to me and stared at me. I was sitting to the right of her. Before and after his haircut he made his was to our bathroom about 5-6 times both times. He held his phone in his elbow in a way that seemed like he was secretly filming. I did my best to ignore him. But my other co workers were watching him. He randomly stands and lingers by the bathrooms and we have no idea why!  When he does stand by there he has his back turned to The girls doing shampoos , so they can see what he’s doing. My boss did have a talk with him and his dad outside the building and they asked him for his phone. He was hesitate but gave up his phone but my boss said she didn’t know how to work his iPhone and didn’t get to look at his albums or Snapchat because she was so shaky. We’re just a bit weirded out by the whole thing and aren’t sure what to do if this happens again. Especially when he can hide his proof it’s hard to “fire him” from our establishment. Another stylist avoids him because he tends to try to rub up on her when she cuts his hair. We’ve definitely “fired” some people for obvious NSW behavior towards us like gross things they say, or suggest. This seems a bit trickier to us. Any advice? 

TL:DR ; a customer at my work records and takes pictures of what seems like just me. Also is known to rub up on other stylists. He’s 15, he was confronted today by our manager but she wasn’t able to find anything. We are stumped and are afraid of this type of behavior , what else can we do if it happens again? ",26Mar2018,1

I will try to make this a short and simple as I can for the situation. I am a 22 year old college student my ex and I dated for a year then one day she asked me for a break to focus on her studies. I agreed because I did not want her doing poorly in school because she was too focused on our relationship we where both sad when it ended.

Fast forward two months we are still good friends hangout everyday she comes and visits my family with me on the weekend and I help her with her family issues and school trouble when I can. She starts acting a bit off I dismiss it because it is not my business. She starts talking to an old buddy of mine who has graduated from our college and as since moved to another state. She finally tells me that they are talking and also says that he told her not to tell me but she has nobody else to talk to. I tell her that I am happy as long as she is happy even if she does not want to get back with me. She goes and visits this buddy of mine they sleep together and he stops responding to her and when he does he is short with her or saying how he was not looking for anything serious. I am mad at him she feels stupid for sleeping with someone who did not really care about her. She ignores him for some time but one day he starts messaging her again and she resumes talking to him at this point I I not know what to do. I love this woman more than anything and I do not want to break her and him up I want her to be happy even if it is not with me I just feel like an asshole every time she is with him I get upset with her. I just do not know what I should do at this point I see her every day and we get along so well watching tv cooking cleaning and doing homework it is just not the same.

52,"I had three best friends. Two of them were couple. One got jealous because she cheated on him with someone else and thought she was going to do the same with me, so he pushed me away and basically caused all of our friend group to do so too. Anyways, I talked to her, she talked to him and we had a nice chat about it, he apologized and told me that it was water under the bridge. I was glad because I thought it really was so, but nope. Lately he has kept on being an ass for no reason, and my other best friend who is close to him has started to be one too. I know I have my flaws but this time around I've done nothing for them to turn their backs on me, but now I'm kept out of everything and today it's felt worse that ever. I feel lonely again and my depression doesn't help, friends were that one thing that completed me and now I feel like I have none and I don't know what to do. 

Also I know it's not helpful at all but I left our group chat and closed my whatsapp account for a while because I feel liek nobody gives a shit about me. They only text me if they need something from me, if not I'm usually the one who texts them. I don't know what to do.

I try to get to know people, share my interests, thoughts, opinions, provide support, etc. And sometimes we have a minor relationship. We can go out to eat, play video games, etc. But at the end of the day, I really feel like a passerby in these people's lives. Like, if I didn't intiate contact, they literally never would.

But even still, I can't help feeling like I was wrong, like I'm fundamentally missing some key piece of info that would make them right even though all of the internet and all of my peers agree with me.

67,"tldr; 21 yo F junior in university, miserable and will be unable to work upon graduation without attending law school or getting a masters. Dream has always been cosmo school and working with hair, but didn't pursue because I was afraid people would look down on me. Should I quit and get my license and be happy, or continue college depressed and jobless?

Hi, Reddit. This is going to be semi-long, so apologies.
I am a 21 year old female. I started community college in 2014 and in 2016 transferred to my ""dream"" university to obtain a degree in pre-law, as my experience volunteering for campaigns during the election year really inspired me. My first several semesters were amazing! I joined the honors college, made the Dean's list, became semi-active in my political party's club and while the stress of working and attending a difficult program, I was inspired. However, my dream has always been to work with hair. My grandmother is a cosmetologist, and you could argue I've been apprenticing with her since I was five. Despite my grandmother making much more money than my grandfather (I remember her buying a Mercedes with cash, ""just cause"", and still having plenty of savings. Upper middle class, basically), when I wanted to attend after graduating high school early, I was told that I was ""too smart not to attend college."" I had no idea what I wanted to get a degree in, hence the decision to attend community college until I figured it out. Throughout my entire college career, I've worked as a waitress and an assistant manager at a beauty supply company. I've done my own hair and literally every single one of my friends and family member's since I was probably thirteen. It comes naturally to me, I love it, and I am good at it. 
Fast forward to now: I failed my first class last semester. I was going through a lot of depression and anxiety in general, but I also feel that it stemmed from being burnt out, and realizing there was literally NO way that I'd be able to get a job upon graduation without having to attend graduate school or go to law school. I've been lucky enough to have my father assist me with my tuition, but would pay my own way through anything else. This semester I've had to drop down to a mere three classes from my usual six because I cry every day and worry 24/7, causing me to not be able to sleep. (I'm with a therapist and she's great, we're working on this.) I had an advising appointment last week and my advisor spent the entire session basically telling me that if I had no plans to take the GRE/LSAT, anything outside of an unpaid internship or a minimum-wage data entry position would be impossible to obtain. Now I know that I should have already known this, but my plan was that I would take the paralegal exam after graduation. This is apparently no longer an option unless I wanted to attend community college AGAIN across the state due to accrediting issues. Throughout this entire experience, I have always planned to obtain my cosmetology license in order to have something to do on the side to save up for law school or grad school.
I called my dad devastated and told him I was now planning to immediately attend Paul Mitchell or Aveda upon graduating because I wanted to be independent- I'm sick of asking everyone for help. I don't want to burden him past my graduation after everything he's done for me. I was very nervous; I basically only did this to make him proud and now I feel like I've failed him.
My father's response shocked me. He told me he'd been thinking after I styled his girlfriend's hair last week that I'd be so good in this field and that most importantly, I would be happy. Shockingly, he suggested that I quit my university and immediately go to cosmo school- he even asked me to please let him fund this so that I can start my life. I responded that I didn't want the past three years of my hard work and his money to go to waste, and he told me that it wasn't a waste, I could always go back later in life, and that he'd rather it be three years than four. I think my family can tell how depressed I've been over school, but this shocked me. We talked for hours about this (a rarity) and he is practically begging me to apply to Paul Mitchell and start as soon as possible. I am a second semester junior; I still need 45 hours to graduate, (roughly a year and a half.) He told me I could either be graduating then, with no job and unhappy, or I could be working in a salon doing what I love and making a very livable wage. 
I'm so conflicted; he left this decision up to me, but I've been so sick all day. I felt like a weight was lifted off of me when he brought this up to me, because I had never even considered this as an option. My mind operates on a ""I MUST finish school or I am a failure, I MUST get this degree I cannot and will not use without four to six more years of school or I am a disappointment and no one will ever be proud"" agenda and I'm afraid to try this and be happy. I get excited imagining this, but want to think it through. I've weighed all the pros and cons and I feel like pursuing hair would be the best option for me. Can I please have your thoughts?",26Mar2018,1

71,"I've been friends with this girl for over a year or so now, I've always had kind of a little crush on her but nothing too serious. My feelings for her have exponentially grown over the past few months, because we do a lot of stuff together and as I get to know her better I like her more. We talk all the time, shes basically my best female friend and I'm her best male friend.
I joke around and drop a lot of flirty hints that I like her and she usually reciprocates with the same signs I send her. We've been kind of like this for months now, always kind of being affectionate but never actually crossing the line. we're pretty close and from a third party point of view its kind of like we're dating without actually dating. 
The problem is is that even though I like her and I think she likes me a relationship probably isnt for the best. She has a really busy schedule, its tough for me to get time to hang out with her, and I am trying to focus a lot on my schoolwork. She's in my main friend group and if things dont work out its going to make stuff really really awkward.
I should also mention me and her are both in highschool, and I'll have her in a lot of my classes next year. If things go sour I don't want stuff to be awkward and ruin a great friendship.
With all things considered, it really drives me crazy not being able to tell her how I feel. I feel like being in a relationship will enable me to care for her and make her happy in a way that friends simply can't do. She's also someone with depression problems that she doesn't often express and I feel like I'll be able to help her deal with it much better after establishing the fact that I have feelings for her.(Dunno how to explain that, but hope that makes sense) I know she internalizes her feelings of low self worth and it makes her feel like people don't care about her which isn't true. I want to show her that I care.

What should I do? 
Side note: she has hella strict parents and I'm not the most socially adept guy, kind of gonna be an issue too xd I don't know what to do if her dad sits me down for a ""talk""or whatever

72,"My story is pretty convoluted so this may get long, apologies in advance, but thank you as well to anyone who is willing to read it.

I am a 2016 graduate of UC Berkeley with a BA in Integrative Biology (focused on wildlife biology/ecology). I chose this field thinking job opportunities would be pretty plentiful upon graduating, so I didn't think anything of it. Meanwhile, I slacked off when it came to studying, and I often skipped lectures that I didn't think were essential. Because of this, I did not cultivate a ton of relationships with professors or mentors, nor did I earn top grades (much of my transcript consists of low Bs and Cs...). I shot myself in the foot, I know...

However, I did participate in an internship in the summer of 2014, doing scuba research as an undergraduate research assistant on octopuses in Southern California. This was an amazing experience, as I loved diving and the work was fantastic. Unfortunately, this also coincided with the onset of bad panic attacks, so I cut my internship short out of fear that something would happen to me on a dive. To this day, I still haven't dived more than a few times since due to that same fear.

In any case, the graduate candidate I worked for allowed me to continue as a lab assistant through the school year as she finished her work. After a year, though, we fell out of touch, and now I feel awkward about reaching out to her for help. That was the only internship I did while I was in school, and I feel as though it were a waste.

Cut to senior year, 2015-2016. I managed to land a summer job right after graduating as a lab assistant for an entomological research group. I held this job for 3 months before finding another opportunity, but I was friendly with my boss and I still feel like I can reach out to him, at least better than the grad student I interned for.

The job I held after this was for the USDA in the San Francisco Bay Area, also doing entomological research as a lab technician. While working there, I became well established as our lab's greenhouse manager, and I even helped to train interns and other technicians on the research methods and maintenance protocols, while also serving as a field assistant for our data collection trips. I was generally regarded as a hard worker, but I struggled to really form a solid relationship with my boss. He was very nice to me, but I am somewhat of a nervous employee so I act very subservient to my employers (which is probably not a good thing).

Due to a failing relationship and a feeling of desperation, like I **didn't know what the hell I was doing with my life**, I left my job, my girlfriend of 2.5 years, and all of my friends behind in California to move to South Florida to be with my family. My idea was to save money while working for about a year (or maybe two) and then move out when I had a solid rainy day fund, something I couldn't do in San Francisco with the cost of living there, and the fact that I constantly spent money with my girlfriend and our friends (who made much more than me, I should add, so it was hard to keep up...).

Long story short, I realize I had assumed to much when I thought I could easily find a job in my field of expertise (lab tech/wildlife bio research) once I made it here. But it turns out, I am **really bad at applying for jobs, selling myself, and staying motivated**, not to mention the place where I live (Jupiter, FL) is sort of a dead zone, but maybe that's just an excuse. I left in August, attempted to find work for about a month in my field, but settled for... working at Whole Foods in the deli department because they would hire me... which, after earning a degree from a prestigious university, is definitely not what I expected to be doing at this point.

So, my question is: How do I get my life back on track? I left what was pretty much my whole life back in California, and now I feel so lost, even helpless. I don't really know what I want to do anymore, whether it's lab research or going back to school or whatever, especially because my retail job is physically draining and leaves me too exhausted to be motivated at the end of the day. Not to mention, rejection after rejection from jobs that seem promising are very demoralizing, and make me feel like I can't achieve anything. I'm sure this sounds like quite a sob story, and it isn't meant to be. I just am wondering if anyone has gone through something similar and found a way to turn it around. I have no goals for myself other than trying to get out of this town and on to a major metropolitan area where maybe I will have better luck finding work, but I don't know how to get there (and I also feel dumb because I... was already in one).

If you have read all of that and can provide any advice to a complete stranger, you have my deepest gratitude. I know it was a lot, and was rather confusing so please let me know if I can provide any extrapolation. Thank you to those who read 'til the end.

**TL;DR: Graduated from a top university in a STEM field, with some internship and work experience, but I quit a decent job and left my life behind to start fresh. Now I feel like I've made a mistake in trying to restart my life, and that I've created a dead end for myself rather than an opportunity due to my impulse to leave. Any advice for someone with my knowledge, skills, and experience to try and turn this situation around?**",26Mar2018,5

I scroll through my friends instagram feed, some being officers in the Airforce having an amazing experience traveling the world and doing some pretty cool stuff.

Some are engineers trying to get into SpaceX or other businesses, learning how to code or build some amazing tech from whatever research they could scrounge up.

I look at those smiling faces and I tell myself: “Wow, These guys really have it figured out. Why can’t I have a purpose like them?”
To be short...
I see so many pieces of people that I want to be, but here I am trying to figure out what makes me happy or special.

Should I play it safe and go to school for something I know 100% will get me a job with decent pay?
Is it normal to not find a purpose yet?

I was also in long term relationship through most of that but we split up mid last year. I started working a job in my related field and it's been going pretty well. Outside of that I've been focusing on getting in shape. The issue is that outside of work and gym I feel pretty listless.

Knowing this, I’ve wanted to stop being friends with her because it’s too painful to not be loved back and yet spend a majority of my time with that person. But, I didn’t because she is going through a rough time in her life and needed me there. 

She is seeing seeing someone now (fairly serious) and I decided to confess my feelings (with no expectation of reciprocation) and told her I couldn’t be friends any more. There would never be a good time to do this but this was as good as it got because she had someone else to rely on. 

But she insists that what I’m doing is selfish. She says she needs me to help her get through life and help her overcome hurdles. She needs me around so she isn’t alone.

100,"Am 31.  I've lived in two places as an adult aside from being home with family for two years in the middle (one year AT their home, one year racking up debt on my own before getting a good job).

Last year, I had a nutcase stalk me and I pushed it through the legal channels.  It was exhausting and useless but she at least left me alone afterwards.  

Oh yeah, and the political thing happened -- can't forget that.  A lot of my, ""models"" and predictions started coming true but it was exhausting and the payday just hasn't come yet.  I was involved with a cult-like group that overlapped with all the protesting and their bullshit was easy to sniff out.

I went from enjoying being someone who was, somewhat ""interesting"" and interested in meeting new people to wanting to recluse and really not interact with people or even try to make myself look interesting to others.  I quit my social media account.  I had some blow-up's at my job and within my professional community.  I used to have small get-togethers/house parties and introduce people to each other and now I'd rather not even try.

My grouchiness really has been an effort to be more honest with myself and honest about not letting myself get ripped off/have my time wasted/be disrespected.  Friends come and go.  However, all of my ""authenticity"" has sunk all my ability to co-exist with the bullshit it seems like relationships sometimes requires.

I don't want superficial friends, but I also can't really keep painting the past onto the present.  Drama that happened a year or two ago just isn't that big a deal.

I've been trying to date to meet someone in conjunction with getting all of my shit together/being truer to who I am, but I'm striking out.  It's like earning in the top 4% and paying your bills doesn't mean shit.  I'm not interesting because I'm focused on having my shit together, and even though I can sometimes get into interesting topics of conversation I'm usually not initiating it and it takes me a bit to warm up my brain cells to remember, ""oh yea I remember that cool thing.""  I think the town I live in gets blamed often for being weird and not having a large young adult population (just a younger university population).  I can move to freshen this stale taste.  Then again, fighting to stay in one place instead of move around has seemed to be useful for getting to know myself more.

Likewise, I think deny it or admit it, people go onto the internet and search people they meet.  I don't think there's anything terrible about me, but I just think my profiles make me sound possibly boring.  My new Facebook account has very few friends, and well that's embarrassing I guess.

I'm just burnt out and don't know what to do on these days/times when work just isn't that fulfilling.  I keep hobbies but don't meet very many people doing them and none of the hobbies are hobbies I'm truly ""passionate"" about.

But about six or so months ago I started talking to this girl whom I know from me being okay friends with her best friend.

Eventually my friends noticed how close me and this girl got and I’ve been playfully teased and downright told that I should ask her out. Fast forward about a week of some super touchy flirting and nervousness and at the end of my class as she was waiting for me to give her a hug and walk out with her I send her a text with the gist being, “hey, I think we should date.” And I instantly regretted it. It’s been about a year and a half since I asked out a girl and I knew that probably wasn’t the best way to do it but I knew that if she was interested she wouldn’t mind the cringey text proposal.

Financially: 
Right now, I’m 19 year old female living with my parents. I’m not eager to move out cause I’m “hate parental supervision” or something but in be future I plan to apply for transfer. If it takes me out of my area, I’m moving. Not commuting. My parents may have a problem (they are strict and want me to conform to their beliefs which is another story) with this but either way what I’d like to know is how could I build up a savings.

I’m not allowed to work. I take a full load and they don’t allow me to either. I do get an allowance (childish and I feel guilty bc I don’t want to freeload) and I was thinking of just putting half of it into savings and working out a budget.

If not, I’d just like advice on how to build a savings. (Or maybe get a job without their knowledge).

Relationships:

I don’t want to admit it but I think I depend on romantic endeavors way too much. I’m not in and out of romantic relationships but I think I strive to find them without even thinking. I don’t think it’s a bad thing to like someone but still I just need a good way to curve any romantic feelings (a current situation also has caused me to curve my feelings as well). When I like someone, I take it seriously so it’s difficult for me to move on if I don’t have a clear cut rejection. I know I don’t need anyone but I really need help conditioning myself to be confident about that and accept the situation without setbacks.

I've already seen the aftermath of drug dependancy and grew a strong hate toward narcotics because of this, but at the same time im starting to feel like shit for not doing what is considered normal today and im thinking that throwing away the last of my sanity to fit with the world and survive, will not be a bad idea after all. It seems that i can't do anything else. I fucking hate this world.",26Mar2018,2
116,"Hello all! This might get a little long, but please bear with me if you can.

I'm currently in college for firefighting/ems (Bachelors degree), and living in the not so great state of Illinois. I'm graduating next year and have my internship during the spring semester and i'm still looking for my internship location. Originally, I was going to stay in Illinois, but decided that with the lack of nature and ridiculous population (I live in Chicagoland) that I just can't see myself being happy here.

Basically, i'm going to list the types of thing i'm looking for, or what's important to me and i'm hoping some of you might have some insight on what states might be worth looking into, or even getting down to certain cities or towns that you know of.

To start, my major is basically dictating where I live to a certain extent. I have to be in a somewhat populated area so that I can find a job relating to my degree. This isn't to say that I want to live in a big city, because I don't, but populated suburbs are a must due to the fact that fire departments and EMS services don't hire very regularly, and I have to have different options. I typically lean more conservative on most financial things, and i'm pretty moderate on social things. I'm really looking for a state where I can get back to nature, as well as having a house with some land eventually. I love the North woods, mountains, lakes, and forest in general (I don't need all of these in the same place to be happy). Fishing is a massive hobby for me (Lakes and Rivers where I can eat what I catch without mutating from the pollution is a major plus), as is growing my own food to a certain extent (Just your basic vegetables and such, Knocking out desert states as well). I don't mind snow and winters as i've dealt with it all my life, but I absolutely hate hate hate high humidity... I suppose I could deal with it as long as I was able to go camping, and fishing on my weekends without getting attacked by a water moccasin, and had a lot of other things lined up regarding employment and things to do, etc..etc... On top of all of this, i'm also a single 19 year old with no family or friends in any other states. I'd at least like to go to a place where I have the option of meeting friendly new people, and having the potential to find relationships and night life within an hour driving distance. I could realistically probably be comfortable with home prices (With at least 2+ acres minimum) in the low 300k range.

I know I can't get everything, and obviously I've made a ton of demands for this new state, but all in all i'm really interested in seeing what states you guys recommend, even if it doesn't have everything listed here. I've already done a lot of research and was originally thinking Minnesota up until today when I learned that St. Paul-Minneapolis has some of the worse crime in the country ranking above Chicago in most cases (Can anyone weigh in regarding whether or not St. Paul-Minneapolis and its suburbs within half an hour are really that dangerous?). Thanks in advance for anyone who took the time to read through that mess! Anything helps!

Edit - I should also include that I'm ridiculously tired of the Illinois landscape! Please, no states that are completely flat grasslands and farm fields. ",26Mar2018,1
117,"For a bit of context, i'm not a heavy drinker. In fact, i VERY rarely drinks.

But on the occasion that friends or co worker do invite me to go drinking with them i usually obliged.

Last time i went drinking, i drank 2 glass of apple cider and a bottle of beer. 

After that, i quickly feel like my airways beginning to narrow down which causes me to have some difficulty breathing.

I was hoping you guys could provide me with some medication or substance that could lessen the effect of my allergy or perhaps even lessen the effect of the alcohol

122,i can’t have any privacy when it comes to him he needs to know everything i’m doing and will just humiliate me in broad daylight in front of other people just so people think he’s funny and put a pretty shitty and loser-like rep on my name. My friend group is pretty small and i’m excluded quite a few times and not quite as “tight” as they are together. i have a lot of other side friends that i talk to but not really hang out with or sit with at lunch etc. but most of the times my friends are pretty cool and not terrible. he’s almost the favorite one in the group and him and i are quite close but recently he acts like he goes above and beyond and stretches his schedule to fit mine if we were to ever hangout or play video games. he has quite a few more friends than me and whenever i try to join in on something he pushes me out sometimes closing the gaps and exclusion. if i try to confront him about this i already know he’s just going to laugh at me and tell everyone in the friend group again putting a bad rep on my name. Ik  my other friends wont really take it seriously even if it’s super embarrassing or whatever but it’s still not pleasant if that makes sense.  i do have the potential to make closer friends with my side friends but i don’t really feel like trying that because they’re all friends with him to and it would just be a big mess.  Don’t know if i’m overthinking this or should i try to take action in sometime but any advice will help.,26Mar2018,1
123,"Since the day she started working where I work, I wanted to ask her out. I was able to get her number but never texted her because I had nothing to say. Eventually my boss caught on to me liking her, he told me to be careful with my actions. The next few months I went out of my way to ignore her, we only talked work stuff when she had a question, I turned down any form of advances she made at starting a friendship.

I could not stop thinking of her. In the hallways when we passed each other instead of talking we would stare each other down for an extended period of time. Then go about our business. 

After a while I decided: I don't care what people at work might think, I want her to be a friend then something more. I tried to invite her out on multiple occasions but she always turned me down. The damage had been done and I could not mend it alone.

Eventually I made friends with a friend of hers(also a coworker,) Friend B is a wild party girl with a past that's too long to get into, point is we became friends on accident and I also became friends with Friend A just by association. She would only go out if A and B were going out. 

Altogether we 4 have gone out eating, drinking, and singing after work for the past month. 

I felt the time was right to ask her out so I did when I had an opportunity to do so when we were alone after dinner.

I asked her to go dancing. She said ""I'll see."" Which I know to be code for 'no.'

She's off tomorrow so I'm safe 'till Tuesday. What do I do?
Continue to ask her out until we decide a date, or let her decide when she's ready.

125,"Hello Reddit!
I am a 21-year-old woman with two siblings, one 17f and another 19m. First, I will talk about the sexual abuse. My siblings and I were sexually abused by a cousin when we were very little, each of us at around 3-8 years old, and my brother was physically and sexually abused by our father. Despite finding out about the abuse by my cousin (the fact that my father abused my brother didn’t surface until recently) my mother did very little to stop it from happening again. We went to therapy a few times and were kept away from him and his immediate family, but after that our mother began to bring us around him again. She blamed us for not being able see her sister and nieces (our cousin’s mom and sisters). We were not supervised, and he was alone with us several times after that, and we were in danger of being raped again. She was even kind to him after she brought us around him again, offering him whatever he needed when he attempted to steal food from our pantry. 

My cousin’s sisters are two older girls who were in their 20s at the time that these incidents occurred. They were the ones who were supposed to be watching my cousins, my siblings and me. However, they were lazy and did nothing but watch TV and treat each of us like we were a bother. They were very neglectful and verbally abusive towards us, often calling my brother “retarded”, as he has learning disabilities. The two of them deny the abuse that their brother put as through, believing us to be liars, and have treated us even worse since they found out about the abuse. My aunt also denies the abuse, treating my siblings and I horribly because she believes us to be liars. In a nutshell, these people are no good. 

Despite believing us about the abuse that our cousin put us through, my mother currently continues to keep in friendly contact with my cousin’s sisters and my aunt. I have expressed to her many times how much this hurts me, and I’ve reminded her about how she did little to protect us in the past. To this, she always breaks down crying and apologizes for hurting us, promising not to do it again. But she never changes, she still remains in contact with them. She says that the solution is not to hate others, but I do not understand why she cannot cut these people out of her life as they have hurt her children. I do believe that she loves us, as she dropped everything to start a new life with us again after leaving our father (he was physically abusive to her) and she always makes sure we have everything we need. On the surface she is a very affectionate and loving mother, but I’m beginning to doubt whether or not she truly cares about us if she could neglect us the way she did and keep in contact with the people who tormented her children in their childhood. 

--Emotional abuse by my mother and stepfather--

We left our father with our mother when I was 8, and the allegations of sexual abuse by my cousin came about when I was 9 a few months after. When I was 10, my mother remarried to my stepfather. He was a very nice man at first but became very angry and aggressive with me and my siblings very quickly. He would explode at the tiniest things, like a few crumbs left on the counter, and call me and my siblings stupid. My mother would always side with him when I stood up to him, and I was labeled as a disrespectful child with attitude problems. She made sure to let our entire family know this as well, so everyone around me thinks this about me. My stepsister was also given preferential treatment over me and my siblings, never yelled at or treated the way we were. 

My self-esteem has been whittled away at since I was a child. My family believes me to be an evil person, even a sociopath. My mother always seemed to care more about her relationship with my stepdad, which made me feel even more worthless. I’ve also been very sheltered all my life and do not know how to make friends. Due to the constant loneliness, anxiety, depression and trauma, I have considered committing suicide many times since I was 11 years old. The only things keeping me alive is the fact that I may be the only one truly there for my brother and sister my will to find something better.

I have tried to maintain a good relationship with my mom. She tells me all the time that she loves me and my siblings more than anyone or anything and that she would give her life for me. I rely on her heavily, both emotionally and financially. And it is a very loving and good relationship, when I ignore the things that she does and everything that happened in the past. It hurts me to think about leaving her as I love her with all my heart, and I would be devastated to leave her. It is a very complicated relationship. But I believe that for me to be able to heal and begin to lead a healthy life, I must leave her. 

I am currently a junior in college. My mother won’t let me have a job, as she believes that I should just focus on school. She pays for everything and takes care of all of us.  I have no money to my name. I have no friends either, and I mean zero. None at all. Never had a boyfriend either. I have absolutely no support system or anyone to help me or guide me. I am stuck at home under my parent’s roof and I am desperate to get out. How do I make this happen? And what is wrong with my mother, is she a narcissist or just neglectful? Any advice is appreciated and thank you for reading this.

TL,DR: Abused as a child, have neglectful and emotionally abusive parents, have no support system, trapped at home with no job and desperately need to get out and live on my own.

126,"Im reaching out because I'm lost, have been sinking for many months and need help, please. Here's my story;

It's been 2 and a bit years since I've had a permanent job in what I thought was my 'profession'. I left the recruitment industry for the 3rd and final time in 14 years at the beginning of 2016 after coming to the conclusion I'm 'not suited' to the industry. Since then, I've had one short contract in administration but left that due to the anxiety and sleep deprivation it was causing me. Fast forward 2.3 years, I've gone from independent to dependent on family and welfare with real self-esteem problems. I'm so overwhelmed and depressed by the rut I am in, I've lost all direction, motivation, self belief and am so ashamed by who I've become. I don't know how to fix my predicament with regards to starting on a new career or life direction. I've looked at new paths of study (started a science degree 6yrs ago, after leaving recruitment a 2nd time, but never finished) but am indecisive, uninspired and reluctant to undertake a course due to fear of not completing (as per my degree). 

In the 4 pillars of Health, Wealth, Love and Happiness, none of it is working in my current life. I am ashamed of who I am. I struggle to get out of bed before 11am because I can't face reality. I used to be fit and lean, but I'm now the heaviest I've ever been due inactivity caused through injury (I used to swim regularly but retorn rotator cuffs, bilaterally - post rehab/recovery prevents me). I feel distant from the circle of friends I once considered close and feel like I have nothing in common with them anymore. I also feel sadness after spending time with the 'closest' two or three of these because they all seem to be 'ahead' of me in life and I feel like a failure who has fallen behind. I've disconnected from social media because i find myself comparing my life to peers, similarly to how I feel after spending time with friends 'underachiever, failure, inferior, loser, lazy, no-hoper', weak'. I find myself not trying new things or having new experiences for the fear of looking like a fool (or failing) so instead I do nothing. My existence has become one of severe avoidance and procrastination and I am just fulfilling the 'i am a failure' mantra through my complete inactivity and constant dwelling. 

This has been a long time coming and writing this down has been a burden relieved. I have my first psychologist appointment in over a year in a few days, but would be really grateful and appreciative of any insights, suggestions or advice from this sub. Thankyou so much. ",26Mar2018,4
127,"I don’t have a passion to do anything, absolutely nothing. For choosing a degree/career may say “huh, that’s different.” But I can’t bring myself to pursue it, because if I do and I don’t like it I will just put all my energy into getting out. For example, I have failed a semester at community, then i PAY money for another semester and never even show up. I am late for trying to apply to a university for a degree and might not even get in with the nowhere to go. Yet I am not affected by the consequences of what I’m doing. I don’t maintain friendships, or care what happens anymore. I could become homeless and as long as I’m alive I don’t care. I don’t even feel axiety towards these actions, I only get anxiety over little things like, how I need to get a hat for work, but I plan to do drugs the next day and I can’t do both. but either way I push it down and run away from what causes it. I delve into drugs because I NEED to feel something else besides nothingness. I use my phone to constantly distract me whenever possible.

128,"I met a guy in person tonight that I talked to on pof. He was such a cool guy and we just clicked. It felt like we had been friends forever even though we just met. He told me he wasn't really looking for a relationship and was just looking for friends which I was fine with. We drove around and smoked cigarettes and he sang lol. We went to a parking lot and talked a little while longer and he grabbed my hand and held it and was like, ""you need to gain confidence. You're too hard on yourself. You're too tense."" We held hands for a while which was nice.

He put my hand toward his penis and wanted me to touch it. I felt very awkward but I told him I would touch his dick if he kissed me. At first he didn't want to because he wanted me to get kissed from someone that was going to be with me and have a relationship with me. However we kissed twice. He guided my hand toward his dick and I touched it and he pulled it out. When he pulled it out I got freaked out and he was like, ""just calm down. It's just a dick. You're 23. You need to get out more and experience this. Do you want me to touch you?"" I ended up giving him a handjob and it was just extremely awkward. When I dropped him off he acted like he was trying to get me to kiss him but I just gave him a high five type thing. He was stoned the entire time. I don't feel grossed out by it but everything just happened so quickly. I have never hugged, kissed, touched, or held hands with a guy and all 4 of those things happened within an hour.

Well, even during homework, I'll be browsing YouTube for extended periods of time until I get tired and go try to focus. Whenever I do focus, I get off track and distract myself (looking up word definitions, reading unassigned pages of a textbook, etc.). For example, a 30-minute study guide would be an hour or two.

I could ask about whether my parents are cool with it, but there's still a possibility of damaging trust. They may think my questions are signs f rebellion. Also I do really hope that I could secure my main entertainment source, my computer, by ensuring that they trust me.

When I first met her, I didn't really click with her. I knew of her and I kind of had an idea of what type of person socially she was. She was the kind that laughed a lot. Not the most personable in a big group of complete strangers, but she would have the time of her life with her friends - and she was good at making friends.

We exchanged words occasionally for the first half of the year. We worked on a one minor project together and then seldom traded words. Usually her questioning me whenever I was doing something stupid on the computers or when she was doing something stupid on the computers. And then, I don't know how it happened but it somehow did.

I got feelings for her around Halloween. I don't know why at all. Maybe I had subconsciously found out more about her or maybe I was just changed by some wacky candy, but I got feelings for her. At this point, we didn't talk at all. So, I pushed her into the back of my head. I had more important and more plausible things to pursue than this one girl I suddenly liked but had no chemistry with.

It wasn't until Christmas when I talked with her again. It was on Instagram. I saw one of her posts and impulsively shot her a message. She responded. At this point, I decided to be the smooth guy I was (sarcasm) and be a nice guy. I wished her Merry Christmas and then we didn't speak again for another few months.

But two months ago, I found out she had a Skype account. Again being the smooth and charismatic guy I am, I kept on bugging her until she added me. We started text messaging each other more. And fast forward to now, I don't know how it happened so quickly.

We've become really good friends now. We talk with each other online almost on a daily basis and we talk whenever we can in school. We have the same dark humor in common and we've gone to spend time together. But that's where I meet a crossroad.

I'm absolutely contempt with my current situation. I've never been the social or confident type and this has been the highest point I've been in for a while (or maybe even ever). Choosing to seek to talk to her has opened me up to many new experiences. But I don't want to ruin anything by trying to take it to the next level.

Sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough for her. I'm some nerd who plays the drums and listens to Nirvana. She's athletic and enjoys Netflix sessions. I've introduced her to my friends and it seems like sometimes she has a much better time with them. I don't want to risk anything.

So Reddit, I know it seems dumb to ask you all when you're not in my shoes, but what should I do? Any advice will greatly help.

138,"So, last night I was in Nando’s reading the menu on the countertop while waiting for a server. Someone approached and I glanced up, but my eyes stopped for 6 full Millenia to stare at the absolute rack that was suddenly in front of me. It was unintentional, by the time I realised I was looking at her boobs my eyes flicked up to her face, where I locked eyes with an intense look. She knew what I just did but upon meeting her gaze all I could think was “aw fuck, she’s cute as hell too!”
I’m not the kind of dude that really does that, and I immediately flushed and looked down long enough to take a deep breath, rattled as hell, and say sorry into my shirt before I stammered out my order. She left straight after that so I couldn’t do anything else.

Problem is she has to leave at 7 sharp so we kinda flirt in bed a bit then about 6ish we get down to it. I wasn’t feeling super horny that day but didn’t think much of it. I had an erection during foreplay then went for a wee a few mins in &amp; when I came back I just couldn’t get it going again. I was mortified, tried most things but I was really stressing about the clock. In the end it just didn’t happen. I did my best to satisfy her  but I just feel low truth be told.

She was cool about it, said we could hookup again soon for another bout &amp; that it was no biggy but its really eating away at me. We message like everyday but I feel the conversations a bit awkward now. Any advice?

145,"My dad (58) has had snoring problems for as long as I (22) can remember, but it came to my mind that it could actually be dangerous. Whenever he sleeps at night, his snores are really loud and there are long interruptions that make it sound like he's choking. My mom won't even sleep in the same room as him anymore. He also takes several naps throughout the day and barely ever exercises. He is on medication for high blood pressure and his father passed away from a heart attack so I am especiallt concerned.

I've tried telling him over and over to find a solution to his sleep apnea, but he just shrugs it off (his main reason is probably cause the machine is uncomfortable). Any recommendations?",26Mar2018,2
146,"Hey Reddit!

I'm a community college student studying engineering and being in this major got me to notice certain aspects of myself that I don't like. I've always been extremely lazy and undisciplined and as a college student, those aren't the traits I need in order to excel in life.

I have no problems studying, I actually enjoy it but I can never force myself to start studying. My peers are graduating this year and the more I think about it, the more rushed I feel.

I'm an only child with no one to really confide in because my parents are extremely strict and did not attend college. My peers also moved so I'm isolated most of the time. If the road to success is a lonely one, I don't think I'll succeed.

How can I overcome this barrier and become a better student and a more disciplined individual? What requirement is needed in order for me to succeed every task I plan? How can I build great habits?",26Mar2018,2

158,"I'm an undergradutate - a few weeks into the first of three years of the Bachelor of Music degree, focusing on guitar performance, and digital production. I blindly went along with my family's idea of entering university to persure music after high school (I feel like a fucking idiot for not considering the pros and cons before I started the course). The total cost of the Bachelor over the three years is somewhere in the ballpark of $20,000 - $3,300 per semester (2 semesters annually). I'm wondering if you can really find employment in music, with a Bachelor degree. I don't want to go through a univeristy course that will lead me nowhere. I am really regretting not researching the benefits of a music Bachelor degree, and imagine I will for the forseeable future if the chances of employment post-graduation are small. 
To make it short, I'm thinking about what career path will put me in a comfortable position financially. I'm willing to do a degree, or apprenticeship, that is not music related if it means there are greater employment prospects. If there really is no realistic future that comes out of a Bachelor of Music degree, I'd prefer to accept that hard truth before I'm deep in student debt.

167,"Hi,

I have a good friend who I speak to a lot online, and on occasion, the cynical side, the paranoid side of myself will think that this person is avoiding/ignoring me.

Whenever I see it, it stews and makes me sad and angry, if I see they're online and they are talking elsewhere but haven't responded to me for instance.

I've had 3-4 ""outbursts"", where I rant to them about what they're doing being unfair, but in the end, they can perfectly explain it and I end up looking completely stupid.

They've coped with it before, but I did it again last night, after I thought that they ditched me and went to speak to someone else, but lied about why they were going first in order to get away.

Turns out (of course) this wasn't the case, and they've made it clear they're sick of my outbursts.

I realised my mistake instantly, and all day have been feeling the regret and guilt, its like a horrible weight. I've apologised to them, but there's no reply, and I think they are online talking to someone else right now, could be about this.

I just want to make amends, but what should I do?",26Mar2018,2
168,"I've been sitting in my room reflecting about my life, the good and the bad. I think it's time I see a therapist.

At the age of 16 I made a friend and she was funny, loud, very stubborn but struggled with a lot. We became more than friends but not official because both our families hated the idea (our families have been friends since I was 5). 

They told me not to go down the road that she will only cause heartache and pain. I was young, dumb and blinded by ""love"" and ignored all of it. She did just that and more, she tried to take her life multiple times and was very very close to succeeding the second to last time. She really only trust a handful of people (me being one of them) and to try and be that support and help her was overwhelming but I did the best I could. I decided thought I was best we just be friends and went separate ways. 

Please note I did not abandon her she actually moved to a different guy and I was just a supporting friend like always. 

Two years ago one of my best friends and I started dating and it was so amazing. We laughed, cried, the whole circle of emotions, and I still look back today and don't know how I managed to get her to say yes haha. I was a Senior and she was Junior and when I went off to college it crushed our relationship. I never experienced so much freedom and I neglected my friends and family at home. Hardly called home, hardly texted her it wasn't intentional I just got lost in the crowd. We broke up but got back together last summer, now she's off to college and it's long distance. 

We really thought we could make it, like this was it, we can do it, we'll be that couple that's made it from high school. I went on a four day retreat and the night I got back we broke up, and for good. I'm currently a sophomore in college, well was. 

Now before I tell this next part please forgive me if this was a long read and you can stop above. It's just something I've had inside me for such a long time and I know I can tell it here. 

From October to December I put very little effort into school. I played online with my virtual friends because they never brought me pain. We just gamed and had a good time, I gave up on school, life and was planning to take my life before the New Year. 

It's crazy to say that because from the outside people thought I had it all. I traveled to cities for concerts, I was FOH for a college worship team, rigged for concerts and met different bands and production managers (even offered a summer job in Tennessee).

What they didn't see was what was inside. The dark storm raging inside me, how I was slowly counting my days down. The notes I wrote on my phone and laptop to apologize for my wrongs. Before the end of the semester I made four friends and even though they were very indecisive (we sat in a car for forty-five minutes try to decide what we should do lol) they brought life to a dying soul. I left college this semester to do a missions program and try to figure out what to do what life. 

I may never see them again but I want to tell them this without freaking them out. Or maybe I shouldn't? I have five days left to decide. ",26Mar2018,2
169,"Edit: 14 year old Male 

Some background: We don't have the best medical access so I'd like some input. Our son is almost 15 years, he has a developmental and cognitive delay. He does understand basic speech and basic concepts, but no understanding in complex ideas or ordinance or logic. He walks and passes motor and follows a free will, but he is highly dependent on a scale of 3.5/5. He is usually calm but will have spontaneous periods where he loses temper and will act out, and has very free will. We do home therapy since he is not equipped for public schooling, and he attends sensory and motor therapy three days. Husband doesn't not help, does not have a good understanding. Husband is negative but he does not have a part in his daily life and has little impact on him.

It's another one of his bad days. Sometimes it lasts a few days and I just pull him out of therapy and try getting him to sleep. This morning has been a lot, technically since last night. I sometimes have to carry him around. Last night, I had to hoist him into his room at bedtime, had to hoist him back into his room after he decided to get out of bed and play in the sink, had to roll him because he didn't want to get changed after a wet nappy (because he didn't want to go to the bathroom before bed). I tried soothing him so he would get tired, and he sobbed whenever I stopped talking to him or stopped touching him, and in the end he cried himself to sleep. This morning, I dressed him in his day clothes while he was still asleep to avoid any trouble, and bridal carried him to the couch, and he threw a fit upon waking up. He threw a little fit because he ran in and tried to eat a piece of candy  (with the wrapper on it) for breakfast, and I got in his way. I buckled him into his eating seat and made him cry by just quietly setting a sippy cup of juice in front of him. I calmed him down and he stopped crying by running my fingers through his hair, but then I made him cry again by walking away from the table to wetten the cloth I use to wash his hands. I sat at the table to feed him his malt meal and to make sure he wouldn't choke on bananas. I got up to wet the cloth and he threw banana everywhere. I let him out of his eating seat  (because he can't be restrained for his circulation). He put his sippy cup in the trash can, then went for the bathroom and grabbed my pot plant and started pouring the soil in the toilet. He's probably going to get dismissed from therapy early today. I'm glad it's not motor therapy or gym today because he'd absolutely lose it. 

Today has been very bad, it's usually not this intense. I don'tfreaking know how to handle him or help this. I just tough through it and tolerate him. He does not understand negotiation and has a bad communication block. I don't know if I can reason with him or do anything to control him. I don't know if I should stick by and comfort him and do what keeps him calm or if I should try controlling him or if I should not give in to it and let him cry it out.  I feel like I abandon him when he cries himself to sleep or when he loses his temper and I just watch him do it and I don't do anything about it. I don't even know what the deal is, or what he's wanting, or really why he's doing it. My husband left for work this morning laughing about it. Last night husband woke up when I was in son's room and son was hysterically whining and sobbing, and husband told me to physically punish him for acting out. I do not physically punish. If son misbehaves, I move son from the situation or remove objects from him, because he does not understand punishment. ",26Mar2018,13

171,"As I was training for writing home studies for potential foster parents, my supervisor resigned. I’m very home study fluent as I have done them for 15 years and was even a regional manager over a program. I haven’t disclosed this bc my days of being responsible for everyone else’s work pushed me to a brink of no return. Any way, I’m in a different state and the style and what is to be covered is different. I’m ok with that. However, my now resigned supervisor was either laid back about about our writing or was going through her own crap not meeting audits and knowing the heat was on her, causing her not to effectively train me. My 1st review of a monster of a home study went well with her. Now I have a different reviewer who totally demolished my recent extremely easy home study. I can tell this reviewer is either trying to be relevant or is “correction happy.” I have covered the information she is telling me to cover, but maybe perhaps not in the areas of the template she would like. I’m following an example they gave me which is supposed to be the best most perfect one, right? However, I’m being asked to add things that are not in the example model and told not to say things that are also in the model. The old supervisor in me wants to shake her and tell her inconsistent and differing views by management make employees aggravated and starts a problem with retention. And I do see a problem with retention. Has anyone else gone from the stressful top of a job back to the bottom, by choice,  and find you have a hard time because you may know too much? How do I stop feeling this way? I even know how to fix their audit problems but remind myself it’s not why I’m here. I’m here to be responsible for me and that’s all. Will I feel satisfied and how can I? Do I just shut up and do what they say or point out inconsistent training when I see the problem with their retention, employee satisfaction and audit issues?

174,"**For TL;DR I bolded the sections and italicized the specific advice I desire. Thank you in advance!**

My partner has been diagnosed with ADHD and until recently had been self medicating with alcohol and weed, but on lower levels. He’s stopped self medicating for a period, but I believe it was due to his limited funds and means (no job, under 21). BF is aware that he has an addictive personality. His father is borderline alcoholic.


Recently he’s been prescribed daily adderall, which I was hoping would help reduce self-medication but as he’s just turned 21, he’s recently drunk 3+ servings of alcohol on a Sunday, nursing the alcohol til tipsy until he went to sleep (9PM-2:30AM, 5 hour span). I am extremely afraid that he will increase his drinking and drink every day; he’s unwilling to set a weekly limit because he doesn’t want me to monitor his drinking and “throw a fit” when he goes over the limit. I was hoping for 14 drinks a week, but he at this rate, he may be drinking 21+ drinks a week. His past behavior has shown he will probably continue to drink at this rate, especially with a new source of income+legal drinking age backing this behavior.


I’m concerned about his long term health but also deeply saddened that he drinks to get tipsy, which (I think) makes many of our interactions less genuine— he is a lot sillier and fun, but I also prefer his sober self because he is more analytical and grounded. He is himself. I’ve communicated a lot of this to him before, but aggressively/suspiciously, and **I am tired of feeling like I am unreasonable/nagging/paranoid that he is:**

-**destroying his liver (long term)**

-**messing up his medication**

-**going to build a tolerance to alcohol**

-**is not his true self in the hours after 7PM: he is his tipsy, silly, unthinking self**

-**drinking alone and speaks about his habits defensively— “I’m not smashed, I’m not hammered, I’m just tipsy” for 5 hours+ at night **

-**history of getting smashed in previous semesters/getting very high or needing weed to regulate his sleeping/eating/enjoyment in activities+addictive personality**


***Advice: I want someone to reassure me about his habits, or how to approach him about his habits without being aggressive or accusatory.*** I have no frame of reference when it comes to drinking. We are both young adults, so drinking is more normalized but I have a hard time accepting 3+ drinks in a night. I have been passive aggressive/terse this morning because he has not been compliant with my desire for a weekly limit and I think justifiably paranoid based on his past history. ***I do not want to be passive aggressive and I want advice on how to stay calm, civil, and loving as I wait and watch his drinking habits unfold so I can get a clearer picture of his substance use.*** 


Extra background:
I know he has anxiety and ADHD and I helped him get off weed but now it seems that weed is better than adderall and a potential anti-anxiety med (messes with your brain chemistry big time) or alcohol. 


He has a lot of obligations now  (job, demanding school work) that I hope will curb his drinking but he is very good at masking inebriation/being coordinated, I’m worried he will continue despite being able to recently cut down on weed and stay sober for longer periods of time. 


He definitely has proven himself capable but I think being sober is hard for him.

When I began at this place they had a group messaging app and a thread they used to communicate. One day, in a bit of a tantrum my manager sent out a message asking answers to some questions. And reiterated that she wanted answers. I responded. The other employees responded as well. I addressed some things they mentioned in their responses and the entire thread was immediately deleted by management (allegedly because of something I said, though when I asked my question was not answered).

She is at college and wants to be a beautician, she always said he is looking for a job. 

I have started noticing a few things recently which are too boring and long winded to share now, but it feels like she was lying for him a lot, and he always was borrowing her pocket money and not giving it back and a lot of other minor things that started to bother me.

She splits up with him about two weeks ago. I ask why she said he has been smoking a lot of weed and has no ambition. I thought this was very sensible of her and was happy. Until Friday. 

I’m looking after my two younger sisters while my mum has gone to see my nana who’s not very well. On Friday my sister tells me she is staying with her boyfriend/ ex boyfriend. I couldn’t really do much about it but I just warned her to be careful and to come straight home the next day. I spoke to his mother who assured me she would be ok.

She came back as promised safe and well. Her phone breaks on Saturday night, she asks to borrow mine which is fine. I don’t use my phone very often. She gave it back to me when I asked just so I could check my messages etc. I looked at my notifications this morning and there are some from him (obviously to my sister through her social media accounts).

2.swear on your mums life you are not with lads
3. Tell me where you are

I am being biased but she is a good girl, not perfect by any means but she wouldn’t be with another guy.

190,"I would like to take myself as an example here.

I will admit that I do believe that I have some form of intellect or ability that makes me proficient in something *(for example, my 20 years of playing video games made me more proficient in hand-eye coordination, or my psychology classes helped me how to think about human behaviour)*

But I also admit that I am not as gifted or as proficient in many other things in my life, no matter how many times I think I am as good as I think I am *(for example, there were many times I thought that I was good at something or understood something correctly or perfectly but I was proven wrong before or my intuition told me that it is not the case and I was later proven to be wrong)*

I have encountered this confusing dilemma in my entire life. 

While there were times where I was able to be confident enough in my own abilities *(at least confidence enough at the right level)*, there were many times in my life where I slightly go over that scale of balance.

There were times where I grow so fond of my own abilities or intellect and so on that I grew to be arrogant or perhaps too fond of myself *(for example, I remember once to think that I knew a lot about philosophy by only a few moments of reading but I later realised that I required more reading than I thought)*

In other times *(mostly after I learned the uncomfortable conclusion)* I mostly felt deprived of my own confidence in my own abilities that I mostly lost interest and sometimes even my own self-image were mostly close to turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Bear in mind that both of these two concepts that I mentioned above do not happen often and despite that I am well-aware of that I know no matter how I much I know, I know that there is a lot more stuff that I do not know and I know that no more how much I know or how knowledgeable I am, I am still ignorant by default *(even in subjects that I became familiar with or proficient at for a long time)*

*(In fact, there are times that even though it would be an exhilarating feeling to know that what I think or what I say is proven to be right, I would be just as happy, or even more happy, if I am proven wrong so that I would at least be aware enough that I should not behave in ways that prove my confirmation bias)*

But I will admit that these experiences are often uncomfortable or even confusing because there is this feeling that I want to achieve a form of balance or harmony within myself and my own perception about my own abilities

In fact, even some of the most well-known figures are also prone to this idea or feeling that just because they are intellectuals or proficient in something, they feel that they may be proficient in everything 

*(the idea that if you are scientist in one thing, you are a scientist in everything which is very false considering that different scientists are trained differently)*

For example, Richard Dawkins is often criticised by philosophers and philosophy students about his arguments and claims about the philosophy of religion ( [link 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/6wi6bx/why_do_philosophers_hate_on_richard_dawkins/), [link 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/5esaii/has_richard_dawkins_almost_completely_disproved/?st=j6w81gfi&amp;sh=049ed1b2), [link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/4ihx5e/someone_told_me_to_come_here_and_ask_for_an/?st=j6w81a1t&amp;sh=a71979a8) ), or Neil Degrasse Tyson, who is basically an icon of scientific thought, was disproven many times by other scientists for making comments about scientific facts that are not a part of his scientific background [link 1](http://www.grunge.com/14813/basic-facts-neil-degrasse-tyson-gotten-wrong/) and [link 2](https://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/13/tech/neil-degrasse-tyson-wrong-sex-twitter/index.html) and [link 3](http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7052952/12-times-neil-degrasse-tyson-was-an-annoying-neckbeard-on-twitter), or even Bill Nye, the famous guy on the educational science TV show and his views on climate change, was also wrong in some areas [link 1](http://www.grunge.com/47128/science-facts-bill-nye-gotten-wrong/) and [link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtNgtRrXa3A)

So how can I, or even anyone else for that matter, be able to be comfortable or confident enough in their own abilities without taking it too far *(such as being arrogant, too confident, think that things are too easy for them)* while still able to be just as open-minded for other things, whether they are things that contradict their claims, their mistakes and flaws or even entirely new concepts *(without thinking that you are full of it)*?",26Mar2018,2

I can't really explain how this happened. I became extremely anxious and self-doubting and it just grew. I didn't enjoy the time I spent not doing work - I just stared at the screen, worrying, badly. It made me sick just thinking about it. I started oversleeping and talking to myself way too much as a way of blocking out thinking about it. I even developed a touch of echolalia.

I'm prone to anxiety and depression... but work is one area of my life which I'm actually pretty happy with. I like my work - it's a consultant-type thing. The only thing I don't like is the worry about future work and ongoing employabilty.

I don't know what I can possibly say to sort this out. I've got out of the anxiety, somehow... but I don't want to embarass myself and - more importantly - others by saying, ""I went mad."" But that's what happened.

What can I possibly say to minimise embarrasment? Obviously, it's a major black mark against me and I may well have fucked myself for future work. That's a grim thought in itself.

Reason for this shitty mindset is because I’m a bit of a realist. I prefer to focus on the worst possible outcomes so that when they do happen, I’ll be better prepared. When this translates to people however, everyone is full of shit. I always prefer to work alone for this reason, however most professors don’t give you that option in group work and I always get stuck with group members who are either too passive or just want to be difficult and never be available or wish to go against every idea I have..

Start walking so I start to get out of the car and I say you told me to get out.

204,"Preface: My mom and dad bought a house together when I was young.  When they divorced, my dad paid off half of what was owed on the house to make payments easier for my mom to make alone.  As a result, there is a line item in the divorce decree that states he would get half of the proceeds should she sell the house.


Story: My mom started the process of selling her house a few months ago.  She gets a buyer and starts the closing process, expecting to get 100% of the proceeds since my dad died 5 years ago.  Her escrow agent informs her that his half will go to his living heirs, me (as an only child) and potentially my stepmom, Lisa, as his common law wife at the time of death.  My mom saw this as a technicality and wanted Lisa and I to sign our proceeds over to her.  Initially, we agreed.  As I got to thinking about it, I started to feel wrong.  My mom and I are doing fine financially, but Lisa is on the verge of losing her home after being laid off from her 20+ year job and having trouble finding solid work for the last few years.  In my mind, if my dad was still alive to get his half, he would take care of Lisa.  I just couldn't imagine asking the woman who cared for my dad so dutifully to his last breath signing over a check that could save her home.  So I call my mom and this exchange happens... (somewhat paraphrased)


Me: ""I've been thinking about the other half of the house sale.""
Mom: ""Why?  We have it worked out already.""
Me: ""Yeah, but I just can't help but think about what dad would do if he was alive. He would help and take care of Lisa.  You can still have my portion, but I think she should keep hers because she really really needs it.  I'm just thinking about what dad would want done with the money.""
Mom: ""... Your dad would want you to have it.""
Me: ""Well, then I want Lisa to have her part.""
Mom: ""Fine.  You both keep your fucking money.""


And then she hangs up.


A few hours later, my mom texts me... ""You know, your dad actually wanted me to have it all, but I forced him to put that line in the divorce decree because I wasn't comfortable with it.""  At no point has my dad ever mentioned anything like that to Lisa or I.  I respond to my mom, ""You can't really expect me to believe that.  Two hours ago, you said he would want me to have it.""  She then flew off about me calling her a liar and how I've hurt her deeper than anyone has and how our relationship is forever changed because I think she's lying.


Fast forward to this week.  She hasn't talked to me since that day.  She's coming to town on Saturday to talk about all of this.  I got an email from her this morning.  She has two questions she wants me to think about before our meeting.


1. What have I ever done to make you think I would lie to you?  Why would you think I would lie to you?
2. Straight up... do you still think I'm lying?


The first question is leading and just isn't fair.  The second question is where I'm struggling.  I don't believe her.  I can't believe her because I will only truly have her side.  I can't ask my dad how that item in the divorce decree came to be.  If I tell her that, I know our relationship won't get any better.  If I lie and say I believe her, I worry that our relationship will be rebuilt on dishonesty and I'll wind up resenting her.  But as her only child, do I just suck it up for the sake of keeping things together?",26Mar2018,2
206,"*Just a heads-up, English is not my first language*

I'm 15 years old and I met people in Overwatch that I enjoyed playing with. Most of them were aged 23-25, don't worry, nothing about pedophilia happened. 
For the sake of convenience I'll give them nicknames.

JD - 25 Male
JT - 15 Male
JM - ?? Female (working-class age)
LR - 24 Female
GN - 23 Female

By the time I met them, I was 14 and fairly new to Overwatch. I met LR first in a custom game, and she introduced me to GN. One day, I went with GN to another custom game, where I met JD, who I found out was also friends with LR, JD in turn, introduced me to JM and JT. After meeting them, I made a Discord server and invited LR, GN and JD, JD invited JM and JT. Note that **I** made the server, originally for 3-4 (there's one more person, but she's not important right now), and JD invited two more people without my consent, I allowed him anyway, they were friends as well.
Over time, I played more and more with them, and we all became close enough to tell each other our problems (except for LR, she was pretty inactive). I told them about my problems as a high-schooler, mainly stress plus strict Asian parenting, along with minor instances of depression, and they listened, and that made me happy. 
However, one day, something happened, I guess. By then, it has already been months since we all met, and over those months I observed some behaviors from them that I wasn't very comfortable with. I noticed how mostly everyone who knows JD seemingly...worship him?
    I don't know if my wording is correct, please forgive me.    
To everyone, except for a few people, he seemed to be a model person, but to me, he still had flaws that disturb me in ways. Most notably, JT and JM follow him like disciples. 
I didn't really feel comfortable every time they praised him for something almost all the time, and practically ignored other people's achievements, it was around this time that I noticed that LR has been avoiding us as well. 
Being the naive and foolish teenager that I am, I decided to call them out on this behavior, as well as JD's behaviors, in a message I sent in Discord. I typed long paragraphs, and then, when I mentioned that I suggested that JD should try and seek therapy, JD and JM lashed out on me. It's safe to say, I was terrified. It was scary to see adults that I didn't personally know get angry at me in a way that seemed like they were condescending, they didn't hold back, they went all out. In a panic, I gave the ownership of the server to GN and left the server, my heart racing, and I could barely breathe, I was sobbing as well. 
I contacted GN and another friend countless times, seeking for support, and eventually they both came online to help me.
I unfriended them on Battle.net and I've blocked them on Discord to their advice.
At that time, LR contacted me, and I learned that she was avoiding us because of JD, JM and JT because she felt uncomfortable, or at least that's what I understood from her.
Months pass, and I turn 15. I'm playing OW with GN, when suddenly, JT joins us. I was nervous, but I didn't leave. I was quite comfortable around JT, knowing that he is my age and that he was really concerned for me when I left the server. I felt guilty, because I said a lot of bad things about JT in those messages in Discord, but he was friendly. Everything was going well until JD joined us as well. I panicked, and left the game, and old memories just kept coming up after that.

*TL;DR:I met these group of people online that I trusted after a long time of communicating. We all played online games together when we were all available, and generally just had fun. Although, over time, I gradually noticed behaviors that I believed were a little wrong and tried to tell them about it, only to be lashed out on, causing me to leave them and remember those events almost all the time.*

I can't stop thinking about those memories, and now it's like everything I do became linked to them, and eventually I felt even more lonely and depressed, even if I had GN with me, and I love GN dearly as a sister, she's supported me through so many tough times.
I want to move on. I so **desperately** want to move on and forgot about them, because those events caused my own emotional and mental state to decline, and I clinged to friends desperately. I don't want to remember those events, and I never want to think about them, but I can't stop, I keep sobbing every time I remember, and I hate. I hate it so much. Please help me, what do I do?

208,"For back story: I'm 26/f and he's a 27/m and we live together. I've worked really hard for what I've had despite not having a family to help me with anything, in a way that's why I've been successful. Mind you successful for me right now is making less than 50k a year with a $455 car payment and $750 worth of rent. I do okay, but I barely have enough money at the end of the month to tuck some into savings. I would attribute most of my success to being ""on things."" Like when I hunt for jobs I apply consistently and attend all interviews. I also decided to have a practical career along with my creative career. 

He's pretty different than me, and in some ways that's why I love him. As it stands he only has a part time job(he had a full time when we moved in but switched and they have only been giving him part time hours). He only applies for a few places per week and has only gone to 1/3 or the interviews offered to him. He struggles to pay his half of rent and the only way he can is if he gets his family's help. I fear they will not help him much longer. On top of that he uses the car I pay $455 a month for as it's his own and his car has been sitting in the lot broken for pretty much ever. He actually got several tickets because he ""didn't know"" he was driving without insurance..which seems like bs to me. 

On top of all of this just yesterday he lost the credit card his dad gave him(It's pretty much free money his dad pays off) and that card was used for things like groceries which we split, gas which we split. 

I am so worried I am just going to end up taking care of him. My savings will dwindle, and he will be even more dependent on me than he is now. 

He likes to say I knew what type of job he had when we started dating but the difference is it was full time and now he only works 20 hours a paycheck. He only makes 300 every two weeks. 

To add to everything he has dreams to be a actor, which I fear are very unrealistic because he hasn't gone to a single audition since I met him and only seems to get work when people message him. 

Anyways, I do love him but I'm losing my mind with worry over our financial differences which unfortunaly cause issues and friction because we live together. Can someone give me advice on how to overcome this worry? Another fear of mine is that he's not trying hard to find more work or fix his car because he thinks I will just pay for everything.

I am a sophomore, and I am currently in a relationship with a freshman. On my schoolbus there is this 7th grader who keeps making fun of me and this relationship.

Just a few days ago I heard that he walked up to my gf in public (when she was with her friends) with his friends, and they made fun of her, asking embarrassing questions and telling them we made out, etc. Worst of all, he comes on the bus and keeps bothering me about certain aspects of my relationship (eg. You only got a relationship at 15? Why dont you like having pictures taking of you/Why dont you like to kiss in public? Thats a sign of an insecure relationship). Then he asks me embarrassing sexual questions - thing is, I dont know how to react to such questions, so naturally he assumes the worst. When I try to meet her in the school cafe, he often comes with his friends and harasses me. 

If I report him to someone, he just calls me a pussy for not handling it ""like a 10th grader"" and ""being bullied by a 7th grader"". Once he got wind of how many pushups I did, and he never stopped talking about it.

I’m told the child asks to not see me before I walk in the door (the mom tells me this) and she’s constantly talking about putting her kid in daycare.. things are not always bad with this family.. they bought me a very nice watch and they ask my opinion about important things.. I know that doesn’t make up for their behavior but I don’t know.. after this week I plan on leaving, things keep getting worse here. Advice?",26Mar2018,1

223,"I think something is wrong with me. I feel mentally unhealthy in a way. In not quite sure what's wrong with me and I think I need a mental evaluation. 

The problem is I currently don't have the ability to see a therapist or a psychiatrist. I lack the funds and insurance for a decent one. Or one at all. I was wondering if there was an online test I could do but that seems silly and unreliable. 

So the next best thing I can think of is to post how I'm feeling on Reddit 

I feel both physically and mentally sluggish. 

I lack motivation and whenever I start a personal project I rarely finish it. 

I put on a face whenever I interact with people. 

I don't really have any close friends but I feel ""ok"" about that (i.e. I don't feel the need to be popular and I don't get sad when I'm alone.) 

I get these thoughts of another life. They give me comfort but I get that that's not realty. (in this alternative realty I'm happy) 

I don't think I feel sad. Just lost and stuck. 

I never talk to strangers, I avoid social situations. Anytime I'm in a social situation I put on a face. After I'm done with any social situation I am mentally tired. 

I'm very self critical 

Feel free to ask any questions. If anyone can help me that'll be great. ",26Mar2018,1
224,"So I applied for work through Careerbuilder.com, and have gotten great prospects from it. One though, has me wary.

The job offers most benefits one can want and pays great. But the email doesn't contain the best english and how fuckin' conspicuous is ""Mr. Peter Johnson""?

228,"Hello everyone, I'm not really sure how to start this. I guess for some background I am 21, my mother is in her 50's, and we live in upstate New York. I have 3 siblings, 2 of which have children. 
My mother has not had a job since she was pregnant with me. My father's presence was very spotty growing up, and hasn't actually been apart of it since I was about 10, so we were depending on my siblings and my uncle to feed us and clothe us. This has been hard on their wallets as none of them are well off and as I said, two of my siblings have kids. The third sibling moved away nearly a decade ago to get away from all of us. So, growing up both myself and my mother have just been a burden on everyone. 

Not once since I was born has my mother looked for a job, and I don't even think she knows how (when I started looking for jobs I asked her to help with my resume and she said she knows nothing about making them). She's never gotten a phonecall or an interview either so it's pretty telling after all these years. There was one point when I was upset with her for not working (I was pretty young at this point, not old enough to work) and she said ""nobody's going to hire a woman my age!"". This, of course is bullshit considering whenever we go to the grocery store half the people working there are women visibly older than her. I really doubt age discrimination is the culprit, when most applications don't even ask for your exact age. She won't get a new ID because she doesn't have enough proof of identity (a lie, she does. She just thinks I'll believe at face value that her last name being different on her birth certificate is some impassible obstacle lol). 

She's turned down every offer anyone's given her to get her a car, including mine. She then continuously says she doesn't want to walk to work or waste her money on cabs (we don't live near one of the scarce bus stations, and cabs are cheaper than say, Lyft). I find this especially humorous considering I have to use a good chunk of my paycheck on cabs because I can't drive for personal reasons. It's ok if I have to but not her I guess. 

Something else she does is claim that she can't move from this house because this is my uncle's house, and he's become old and increasingly senile. She says that she takes care of him but she does not. She takes out his garbage and that's about it. She does not even accompany him when he goes out, which is dangerous as he's been found wandering on the street in the middle of summer because he decided he was going to walk home instead of taking a cab. I believe his insurance covers an at-home nurse and I know there are programs to help seniors with getting around and such so, I'm sure something could get worked out.

All of this culminates in a terrible situation where I want to leave but I cannot. She says that she wants me to live my own life but then won't do a single thing to make it so that I can. She even yelled and screamed at me when I got into my college of choice because it was too far away for her liking. I ended up taking online classes which I dropped out of because being here makes me too depressed and anxious, and quite frankly, suicidal, to focus. I really need some inkling on how to get out of this situation because it feels really hopeless. Thank you for reading.",26Mar2018,1
229,"  Hey guys, I'm debating asking this girl out. I've vaguely known her for years, but we've never been friends. She's my cousins best female friend and as a result I hear alot about her life, and she hears alot about me.

  I want to ask her out, but I'm hesitant for a few reasons. 1) I'm becoming friends with her ex, her ex is my cousins roommate and I've been hanging with him more frequently recently. 2) She used to be best friends with a girl I've hooked up with recently. And she's aware that I hooked up with her, but given that the two of them aren't friends anymore maybe that's a non-issue. The same girl I hooked up with I was good friends with for months, and part of me doesn't want to repeat that situation.

  The reason me and her have connected recently is that she was looking to apply for a job at a comic shop I used to work at, so I put in a good word for her and she got the job. But she ended up quiting on the first day. So as a result, she ruined my chances of giving recommendations at the shop in the future, so I told her she owes me a drink. She agreed to it.

  She randomly tagged me and my cousin in a Facebook post about a concert coming up in a few months and asked if we wanted to go, with another of her girlfriends. This was intetesting to me, as me and her never do anything together. I haven't even seen her in over a year. If she's inviting me to a concert it seems she doesn't mind having me around, I'm thinking of asking her out for that drink she agreed too.

230,"Basically I'm currently on a year out from uni, but I have exams in a month which I got delayed a year because my mum died last May. 

I recently moved back home so I don't have to worry about rent anymore, but I've gone from living with my best friend to being alone in my room nearly everyday and it's making me so fucking miserable. 

I feel like all I've got to live for right now is doing well on my exams, but I've been doing next to no work because I feel so crap all the time. 

I can't really find work to pay for visiting friends because I don't wanna jeopardise my exams (really need to rescue my degree) and nobody's gonna hire me anyway if I need time off for exams and have uni to go back to. 

I don't really know what to do. I actually did a bit of sex work for quick money last year, which I can manage, but I don't want to do that anymore because I'm dating a guy when I can. Ideally I should have had a job for most of the past year but I was just too depressed.

231,"Ok I'll try to keep this very complicated story short, I'm in my mid 20s, I have a sister  in her late 20s who is a single mom to a 4 year old and I have a brother in his early 30 and was raised my single father. I see my dad in a mostly good light and love him to death, even though he is an alcoholic, sex addict biker. He is also extremely mentally and emotionally abusive to everyone he's close with. I live in a city about 3 hours away from them, he's been letting my sister and brother live with him in a very rural area, about a 45 minute drive to any town. My sister and brother don't have vehicles so they can't really get jobs where they are being so far in the country. My sister pulled her weight at my dad's house by cleaning, cooking, catering to my dad. Well my brothers a bit of shit, long criminal history bit of dead beat. My dad's been suspecting my brothers on meth for a few months and last night that suspicion boiled over. My dad went into a fit of rage(this happens often and it is absolutely terrifying,  he's 6'5 and solid muscle just old gritty biker) well my brother wasn't around so he was taking it out on my sister, telling her my brother will get them all locked up and get her daughter taken away for having meth around them(Me or my sister do not know if my bro is on drugs) told her shes worthless and doesn't care about her daughter and  came at her with balled up fist screaming with her daughter right by her, did not hit her but in a way threatened it, so my sister, niece and brother left, in the middle of the night to be with a friend. My dad calls me in the middle of the night worried and pissed asking if I'd heard from them(at this point I had not) told me sis and bro are dope heads and he's done with them. I freak out and blow my sister up she finally calls me in the morning and explains to me what happened and says she's safe with a friend and will be seeking state help for housing etc. But that she hates my dad and never wants to see him again. I, regardless of how horrible he is love my dad. He was raised in a very fucked abusive environment so I know he's this way because he was taught that. He took us in when my mom literally abandoned me in a Walmart and he was just my best friend as a teenager and when he's not mad he is the coolest most wise person I know. I get where all sides are coming from but I'm caught in the middle of it because I'm the only one with a good relationship with all sides because I love from a distance. I have to let my dad know I heard from her or he might file missing person and my sister doesn't need all that rn, but how do I tell him she never wants to see him again? If I tell him he's scary and mentally abusive he'll tell me I'm just a dramatic soap opera watching snow flake, it's just not something I can talk to him about. He's very paranoid that we all think he's a horrible father and that I see him in the same light I see my (extremely abusive) mother, which I don't. He's not a perfect parent but no one is overall I think he's a good dad, he's just a nut case. So my question is what do I tell him when he asks what she said? Without telling him he's crazy, without making him feel the need to call the cops or start drama with her, without him thinking she's on dope? I'm just so stuck in the middle of it

tl;dr- I have to let my mentally abusive dad know my sister, who left his house because he scared her, is ok without telling him he's scary and not a great person to have around my niece",26Mar2018,2

233,"So I work in retail. I'm kind of an assistant manager in that I have special responsibilities but as with a lot of retail positions these responsibilities don't come with authority.

Unfortunately we rotate through a lot of new employees and they quickly pick up on the fact that my boss is really chill and that I have no authority. To make matters worse these new employees have had little to no training so they make lots of mistakes, ask lots of dumb questions, etc. Should I bother talking to my boss about this? He's certainly not gonna train them, there's a manager under him who ""trained"" them so if anything he'll just ask her to go over stuff with them but if she did such a bad job training them the first time why should I have faith that it'll be better the second time or that she'll even bother to retrain them? I feel like I'm in a totally futile situation.

234,"So about a year ago I got a dog, and during the potty training stages, she tended to go in and around a certain empty room in the house that I'm renting. We tried to manage it with potty pads which did work to an extent, but she doesn't exactly have the best aim. Once we got her trained I set to working on the room to get the piss smell out. I rented a rig doctor and when went to the extend of buying my own (not a rug Doctor but a nice quality carpet steamer) and was never able to get the smell out . I ripped the carpet out and discoevered more stains than I expected. Even some bloody looking ones! (will post pics upon request).  Anyway, the carpet had to go because the smell was just too much and I had a roommate moving in to that same room. He's since left and now I am almost done laying laminate tile throughout the room. Its been a bit tricky due to the abnormal shape and lack of perfection to the true squareness of the walls, but I would like to think it's looking pretty decent. I'm almost done so I suppose I'm just looking to hopefully get some peace of mind knowing that maybe my landlord won't be upset since I technically upgraded the status of his room? Or maybe you can agree with my suspicion that even though I improved the room he will come into the house complaining that I tampered with the buildings asthetic integrity or something along those lines, and not give me my huge deposit back.  What do you think? Also I'm new to reddit, well not really but this is the first time I've posted instead of lurking like I have been for a year or two. Thanks!

Edit: If you are wondering why I didn't bother asking my landlord first, it's because the past three or four times I tried to get in touch with him over things such as my sink or garbage disposal unit he has neglected me and ignored my phone calls he is only part of a property managing firm, and I've never actually seen him in person.",26Mar2018,1
237,"This issue has been going on for a couple months now and at this point I am just unsure what to do next.

I have played online games for as long as I can remember (Diablo, Halo, Counter Strike, WoW etc.) A lot of people look at me funny when I say some of my best friends I have I met online. I ended up meeting a friend while playing WoW last year (we will call them Jenn). Jenn and I used to run around and do everything from the time we logged in to the time we logged out. One day a friend of Jenn's came back to the game after a break (we will call them Amanda). Amanda ended up hanging around with us all the time as well and things were very enjoyable, we always were hanging out and doing things in game and generally becoming much better friends. One day we were getting ready to go do something and I asked Amanda if she wanted to join and as I asked Jenn brought someone else along (Not uncommon for that to happen. We always made sure whoever wansnt along for that activity was along for the next). When I asked if she wanted to come along for the next on she said no. Ok I thought, wasn't the first time she got upset about this kind of thing. Later the next day however I get a message basically saying I'm the biggest piece of shit in the world and to never speak to her again. Confused, I sat there all night trying to figure out what happened. End up finding out a little later that she wasn't mad at me but for something Jenn did (well didn't do, she was asked a question by Amanda but ignored it) and it the frustration was taken out on me. We all have a chat about what happened and apologies were said. The following day and for the next 2 weeks I was basically ignored by the both of them. Told they didn't want to do anything or even talk like we did. Everything was pretty unprovoked on my end but I just said whatever and rolled with it for 2 weeks. After that however I tried to figure out what had been going on so I asked and all I was told was they were trying to change, which doesn't really answer much. I start doing my own thing again and start getting messages like ""if you don't want to be around anymore just say so, I won't bother you anymore"" which confused the hell out of me because they just stopped talking with me in the first place. I get told by both separately that they want to go back to how things were but have been doing the exact same thing that caused issues in the first place. Plot twist, I find on a few days after I asked what's been going on that the two of them started dating. I am happy for the both of them, I want my friends to be happy, selfish to not want that for your friends imo, but their personalities changed drastically since this all happened and I just get told to do 1 thing a week with them at this point when it used to be an all day everyday thing. It has been about 2 months since this all started but at this point I don't know if I'm just wasting my time waiting for my friends to say they want to start being friends again like we used to be. Super long post and comes off as a bit whiney but at this point in just more confused than anything, any advice would be helpful at the point :D

TL;DR Had a group of friends online where we did everything together, one of them snapped off on me for something she said I didn't do and now neither speak with me and haven't given me a reason why other than ""I'm trying to change"" but still tell me they want to go back to how things were

241,"I have been a waiter forever. I have worked for the best and worst across numerous concepts. I like the company I work for now, but they only have 60 locations and if I took a management job I would have to move. I live in a dirt cheap apartment outside of Manhattan, and I pay less rent than probably anywhere I would go to. I might get more space or a nicer space, but it wouldn't be cheaper. 

The pay would probably be only slightly above minimum wage based on 60 hours, or about $42k plus a performance bonus I would never actually get (restaurants generally don't pay them or make excuses or rules to prevent from paying)

On the flip side, I am not really doing anything else with my life, and I have always wanted to go into the management side for the better credit and potential to get a house one day. 

I guess I feel as though restaurants in general, make a huge deal in who they hire and yet are super quick to fire people. I don't want to give up my amazing apartment right outside of NYC to move to Omaha or some other place I might not like just for shit pay. I think if it was a happening place like Vegas or Charlotte or something then I would be possibly down, but again the pay is barely enough to cover a lifestyle.

Last Friday me, my friend, a guy that likes me and the guy I used to like were on a volleyball team together so we were waiting on the bench for intervals while other teams played and got talking.

I love my friend, I'll call her Molly. She's so funny and lively but she's a bit of a cockblock n copycat.

She copies everything I do but I don't wanna call her out on it cos I feel like she'd get all defensive but anyway.

The guy I like, Jake always tried to sit next to me. I'd be coming off the courts and sit down on the bench and then Molly would sit in between Jake and me but Jake would move and sit next to me.

Molly can be an attention seeker whereas I let the people come talk to me cos then it's their choice.


Most of the time I act like I hate Jake just cos I'm annoyed that he'll never like me and we were talking and he asked me why I hate him and I just said ""you're annoying and you always stretch on my test (pet peeve)"" and he just said ""okay i won't do that anymore if we can be friends"" and I was like okay

I went to the bathroom and Jake looked super annoyed when I left and Molly started talking to him.

He complimented me on my hair which was super nice.

He's friends with a guy that likes me and I caught them both staring at me when I was talking to Molly.

Jake was joking around with me, he stole my shoe and made me chase after him. He pulled me off the bench(hurt my bum lmao) but he helped me up after.

250,"Hello! My first reddit post :) 

I've known reddit for quite a few years and I enjoy reading some posts especially funny ones. I never thought I would actually become a redditor.

Anyway, I am currently a 4th-year student at a university. I'll be staying 5th year due to major change. My goal is to become an athletic trainer which requires me to attend a 2-year grad school since the undergrad doesn't have athletic training specific program. Right now I'm in a situation where I felt the need to make a huge decision and been having mixed feelings lately. 

I recently came back from Japan for Spring Break about two weeks ago and I loved it. I made many new friends thru a friend I already know, she used to attend my college as an international student. I loved it there, especially that the culture fits with my personality and the food is so amazing. I had a great time there.

When I got on the plane to return back home in America, I started to have mixed feelings that I never had before. I was in panic, sad, happy, and all. I suddenly started to think about dropping school and move to Japan because it's so hard for me to make friends here and I don't really have a family because I'm the only one who is deaf and my family tried to make me become a 'hearing' person with the hearing device. I never felt so happy in my life while I was in Japan. I was never called a 'sister' or a 'friend' by someone else. I even suddenly stopped feeling depressed.

It's a tough decision, as much as I want to become an athletic trainer, my gut feeling is telling me to drop school and move there. But my gut feeling is also telling me to stay in school and graduation so I don't owe as much money that covered the tuition. I used mostly scholarships and support from the vocational rehibition for deaf people. If I drop school or fail, I have to pay back all the money. If I graduate with good GPA, I only have to worry about the student loan which I used once. If I do move to Japan, I won't be alone. I have friends who will help me move in.

Has anyone else ever been in this similar situation? If so, how did you figure out?",26Mar2018,2

254,"I went to this doctor for a free consultation and ended up doing several visits where I got my back “readjusted”. The visits became more spaced out until they were once a month. I kinda wanted to end visits because I was doing better, but my chiro told me that not coming every month would undo all the progress on my back. He said that I just need to keep showing up every month forever for maintenance. I’m paying out of pocket so it’s kinda expensive and I thought that the visits would eventually stop. Is this normal for chiropractors? Also is there something else I can do to keep my back sturdy? For info, I’m in my young 20’s and haven’t been injured, I just had muscle tightness in my back.

Sorry it took so long to write an update, it’s been sort of hectic and dreamy all at the same time. 

So we’ve been texting back and forth for a couple of days now, having normal conversation that two normal, *non-special* people would have. Even though I followed him on Instagram and was incredibly attracted to him, I didn’t lose my head over how he is a celebrity. Fast forward that he proves he is who he says he is, asks me out. 

We meet up down the city by a known theater. I was a little late having to drive in rush hour. He was there with his phone in his hands and probably freezing a little bit. I parked a couple of blocks aways so I had to walk to the meeting spot. I walk up to him (he’s huge compared to me, I’m only 5’5”) and say **Hey, sorry I’m a little late! I’m (insert my name here) nice to meet you!** - then he proceeded to introduce himself as well (I though that was a really cute and down to earth thing to do since there’s no way you wouldn’t know his name) we shook hand and then talked about what bar we should hit up. 

We went to this bar near by, I was amazed by how chill I was and how I chose to not label him as **omg this celebrity is drinking with me** type guy. I decided I’m going to judge him by his taste beer. Must say, phenomenal taste so there’s that. Really nice guy. Respectful and warm. Had a couple of drinks, nice entertaining conversation, lots of sassiness and sarcasm, witty replies and *those looks*. I got tipsy pretty quickly and I think he did too. 
At some point he said *I really want to kiss you right now* so we just sort of went for in the bar lol. We were a little bit hidden from the rest of the people in the bar so he groped my thighs underneath the table. *oh my god...*

Pretty obvious what he was going for here, he invited me to his hotel room but I politely declined and said I would be down for drinks again. I would never forget the look on his face - something like “Do you know how many chicks want to suck my dick?” Haha - and then left. 
An hour after I got home he texts and says *Pretty sassy, I like it. ;)* 

I didn’t reply for a couple of days. He texts again asks me out. I accept. We go out, have a fun time again, make out, I go home. 

So pretty much this for like the 4 *dates* we’ve had. 

No sex. I sometimes stop and think how many women would love to fuck him and realize that I am in that position I just don’t want to. It feels fucking great.

Will post updates if there are going to be any more. ",26Mar2018,10
256,"Currently I’m a high school junior. I’m a straight boy. I’m 5 9 and I’m slightly thicc, but not so much that you could even really notice that much with my clothes on. I have a lot of close female friends and sometimes I find myself in the “gay bff” role with them, which is fine most of the time. Sometimes people outright ask me if I’m gay, but I’m 100% straight. I’m a feminist and a liberal. I think I have pretty good facial features and I dress well, even if not completely mainstream. Most days I wear joggers or skinnyish jeans and a floral hoodie. I got a “6/10 slightly above average” on a /r/rateme PM one time. I think I’m relatively outgoing and funny, and I’m a little adventurous. I’ve smoked pot once, but I never get invited to parties and I’ve never gotten drunk. I love podcasts and video games and Star Wars, but I’m not the kind of person who talks about that stuff a lot.
Anyway, I’m getting frustrated. I want a girlfriend, but I feel like I know everyone in my dating pool, and I’m not interested. Last year when I felt like this, at least I could think to myself, “well next year there will be new freshman girls, maybe I’ll hit it off with one of them.” But now, next year I’ll be a senior, and I don’t think seniors dating freshmen is great. I know a lot of girls in my year, seniors, sophomores, and freshmen, but all of them are either not single, out of my league, do not have personalities that I like, or I’m not attracted to. I usually find myself attracted to girls with small boobs, nice asses, cute facial features, and good fashion who are at least a couple inches shorter than me. Normally I wouldn’t speak about women this way but whatever.
There is one girl who I went on a school trip to Costa Rica with last summer. I think she’s super hot, and we became pretty close pretty quickly as part of a small friend group that formed on the trip. I was super attracted to her, and she seemed like she was being flirty with me, so in September, a couple months after the trip, I asked her if she wanted to go to the Homecoming dance with me. She said yes, but I could tell it seemed reluctant, and then she made up excuses about why she might not be able to go until I finally said “If you don’t want to go to the dance with me, that’s fine, just please tell me.” She agreed and we didn’t go but I was mad at her for not just saying no and making everything awkward, and we didn’t talk for several months. Then, we talked it over, and we went back to being friends. Now, she acts super excited to see me every time we pass in the hall. It was this kind of behavior that made me think she was interested in the first place, but now I just try to remind myself that it must just be her personality. We have classes together this semester which we didn’t last semester, and we joke around a lot. I’m usually a quiet student, but even my stone cold spanish teacher commented on me being hyper in the past month in classes with her. It’s kind of intoxicating for me to be around her, fun, but also somewhat painful. Our relationship is kinda weird, we mostly jokingly insult each other. For example this was our exchange today when she wasn’t in class. Then last night, she FaceTimed me and went on to talk about how hot the freshman boy who sits at our table in one of our classes is and how she wishes he was single. Then on Valentine’s Day she invited me and my other friend to lunch at a burrito place with one of her friends and she told us about how she had her first couple kisses with a boy who moved away 2 months ago. He is tall, olive skinned, muscly but lean, and even did some modeling. He was my friend, but I felt sad and jealous about that conversation even though I know I shouldn’t. I’m just frustrated with how she always seems so flirty, only to rub it in my face that she doesn’t like me every couple days.
I’m frustrated that I don’t feel like I have any other good options, and won’t for 2 more years until I go to college. Then, suddenly, a couple weeks ago, she suddenly kind of shut down around me and stopped joking around or really talking to me at all. I asked her what I did wrong but she insists I didn’t do anything. I just want a smart, funny, cute/sexy, compassionate girl who will sit on my face yknow",26Mar2018,2

Should I just focus on saving money and planning a future career right now, and worry about education in a year or two? It just feels so much more efficient to get the basics of my education out of the way now, while I'm working, and be able to just go straight into university.

264,"This is going to be a rather long winded post, sorry in advance.

My friend and I, I'll call him Paul, met online through a mutual friend and we've been talking on and off and playing video games with each other for about 5 years now. Paul is very easy going and communicates well. We get along great and we can go months without talking and pick right back up where we left off. We had been talking about the possibility of meeting in person for a while and I recently started working a new job that offers me a reasonable pay with a fair amount of off days so I thought why not. So we book him a flight to come visit and we spend a few days together. At this point I should probably mention a few things. I'm currently in the process of a divorce, we've been separated for a couple months, and are just waiting for a judge to review the petition and finalize it. I married young, we were incompatible and it's just never worked out. We stayed together more out of convenience than anything, and my marriage has really taken a toll on my self-esteem and ability to trust and communicate with people. I'm honestly an emotional wreck and really don't have any business even thinking about pursuing another relationship now or in the near future. Paul has been with me through the majority of the relationship, he's been a stable person I can talk with when I need support, and he's always been an emotional rock for me. I like Paul, he's a great person and I feel like we have a lot in common, I would be lying if I said I wasn't attracted to him and interested in seeking a relationship, but frankly he's out of my league, and I feel like part of me is trying to rush something with him because I'm so emotionally detached after my marriage that I need some kind of validation and reassurance. Paul and I have discussed the potential for dating before and we both seem to be mutually interested in the prospect of potentially pursuing a relationship once my divorce finalizes if the situation seems right. He's always been very upfront with me about how he feels and it's something I've always appreciated and found comfort in.

When he came to visit things were a little awkward at first, but after a few hours of being together things were easier. This was the guy I had been friends with for years, it felt natural, and after that initial awkwardness was over it was just like our usual conversations. It's hard to explain, but seeing him in person was kind of a relief. We hung out, traveled across my home state, ate at various restaurants, watched movies, played video games, and even shared a few intimate moments. We had a lot of fun, and I could easily see myself falling for Paul. Saying goodbye to him at the airport before he boarded his flight was really difficult. My anxiety was really bad, and I was having a hard time trying to process the whole situation. We hugged and he told me not to be so stressed, that we would see each other again and that he would come back. We shared a brief kiss and then he went through TSA and I went back out to my car and headed home.

This whole situation has been a roller-coaster of emotions, being with a guy that I had known and been so comfortable with for so long felt weird but comforting. I've been so unhappy for so long in my marriage that connecting with another person on both an intimate and emotional level seems so foreign. I'm struggling to process the situation and what I need to do going forward.",26Mar2018,3

She now lives in a small apartment by herself and, while she’s thankful she has a job now, works extremely long hours. Altho she lives extremely frugally, she faces mounting bills and recently had a bit of a breakdown over it. 

She’s been through so much and as a broke 20 year old it doesn’t seem like there’s anything concrete I can do. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can help her? I hate seeing her like this and know that my very existence is just a further drain on her resources. ",26Mar2018,1
269,"My mother and I have had an off-on relationship for years. We've never outright fought, but our personalities aren't exactly compatible anymore. We usually go in cycles where I'll bite my tounge and try to be a good son for a while before I get burnt out, she starts over-stepping boundaries, reverting back to old habits, and I have to walk away. 

To provide examples of our relationship over the last few years...

* She invited me and kids over one Christmas and she wasn't even home. I waited in the driveway with 2x kids before eventually leaving. 

* She went into the hospital one time and, during withdrawals from booze, guilt tripped that the staff were trying to kill her and that I needed to break her out.
* She's on oxygen, but still smokes and drinks.

* She has quit smoking and drinking about 4 times now, yet never stays with it.

* She has unplugged things from her television just so that I have to go over her house and fix them, then she'll give me chores and shopping lists. 

* When we're talking she assumes that I can taxi her anywhere, anytime (I can't).

* When we're talking she assumes that I can afford to pay for her medical supplies/medication (I can't).

* If you have to say no to something she becomes passive-aggressive.

I work full-time, have joint custody of my kids, and live 30 minutes away. Every time I let her back into my life she tries to takea advantage of me. Part of me knows that it's my job to take care of her, but how am I supposed to manage my own life when she needs so much? If she had her way I'd spend 4 or 5 hours helping her every other day and the cost in gas would be tremendous, nevermind her groceries and prescriptions. I'm holding my own financially but there's not enough to go around like that. 

Now she's back in the hospital and the doctors are saying she may have cancer. I want to see her but I don't want to be taken advantage of or manipulated. I want her to know that I do care about her, but it's painful for me to see this decline and it's not practical to expect so much from me. 

How should I approach this? Part of me wants to go in there to see her again but I'm afraid of being emotionally abused into doing something I can't or don't want to do.",26Mar2018,2
270,"So I graduated from college about two years ago, and since then I've been living at home with my parents. I'd be remiss so say that the comfort, free rent, fear of the unknown, and my career indecisiveness weren't a factor, but primarily I think I'm staying here because I'm afraid of what will happen with my relationship with my mother if I leave. 

If she were to die right at this moment, I feel like I would be haunted by her for the rest of my life, and as selfish as it sounds, I don't want to have that cloud hanging over me. I feel like somehow I'm letting her down, not doing enough. Our relationship is strained at best, especially since she still sees me as a child, and I never try to assert my independence because she'll pull financial rank on me and that's also a sore spot for me. 

If she keeps living the way she is, she won't live long. For one, she's an alcoholic with serious physical and (undiagnosed) mental issues to boot, but she doesn't like going to doctors (I think more out of shame than anything) and never follows their advice. I think she could benefit greatly from going to a therapist, but she just doesn't seem interested in actually getting help. Or when she does, it only lasts for a few weeks at most and then it's back into the wallowing and defensiveness. She's clearly depressed and has a number of other issues I'm simply not qualified to handle, but she won't see anyone qualified. 

In part I've been playing house maid/ caretaker. She can't even do basic around-the house tasks like taking out the trash, and with my dad often travelling for work, I've become the one who takes care of all those things. I clean the house, run errands, cook meals, make sure she can make it in and out of the bath without falling, drive her places when she needs me to, etc. However, at this point I can't even tell if I'm helping her or just perpetuating her illness. 

I know that I need to break out of this. It's not healthy for me, and it feels like each day I spend here is a day of my life I'm wasting. But I don't want my little sister, who's currently in college, to feel any responsibility to care for my mom the way I have, especially since she has an actual career path and life forming in a way that I simply don't. And I also feel that if I leave it will be too easy for me to just shut my mom out entirely until it's too late to do anything about it. If she keeps living the way she is, she won't live much longer. 

I don't know if I really love my mother. As it is, she's rarely more than a source of negativity in my life and I want her to get better mainly so that I can move on emotionally. If she weren't related to me, I'd have nothing to do with her and I think she knows it which is why she likes keeping me close. It sounds horrible, but I repressed most feelings of affection I had for her years ago.  

I spend my entire life trying to avoid conflict with her. If she says ""don't you agree?"" I've learned to nod my head even if I don't, because even on the most mundane matters, disagreement is not tolerated. She was once a smart woman, but I think the years of alcohol have affected her mind's ability to retain information and make logical arguments, so confrontation never works. The more she knows she's wrong about something, the more she digs her heels into the ground. I can't remember the last time I had an honest conversation with her, because I know she won't like what I have to say.

I think that it's time for me to leave and start my own life. I want nothing more than to cut her out entirely, but I know that physically banishing her won't make her get out of my head. I'm not really helping her or myself, but I can't seem to even take the first steps forward. Every time I think about leaving, I feel helpless. I get overwhelmed by thoughts of finding a job and paying the bills and needing a car, and I don't even know where to start. I'm also afraid that I'll end up living a life just like this one, where each day is just another step on a treadmill going nowhere. 

I don't just want a life outside of this house, but I want a life worth living. Years of over-protectiveness and people making decisions for me has left me feeling powerless to find this for myself without someone holding my hand, which is both frustrating and embarrassing. 

I apologize for the novel. I know that true progress won't be easy and I probably won't like it, but I can't keep living like this much longer. I've done a really good job of keeping myself mentally healthy over the past year, but lately those feelings of worthlessness are getting harder to push out as I feel like I'm just going in circles. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",26Mar2018,2
271,"I have a weird dilemma, and it's honestly a good one to have, but it's stressing me out. 

Option 1:
I'm studying abroad right now, and I have the option to stay for the summer and get funding from my university. This is the option that would be better for my career by far, but I'm starting to feel a bit homesick and I know it won't be the same once every one leaves for the summer. I know a few people who will be staying for the summer, so maybe being lonely and homesick is a concern for nothing. It's also only 10 weeks and would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and the city I'm in is dirt cheap to live in with a lot to do. 

Option 2:
Go back and do an internship in the state where my college is and live on campus for the summer with my friends. I haven't seen a lot of them in several months, and it would be very cool to see them again. This option would also be funded by my college, but it's worse for my career prospects post-graduation tbh. A lot of the job involves going to concerts for free, and I think that the experience I would get is transferable to other jobs, but it doesn't look as good quite frankly and locks me into a specific path. 

What would you do in this situation? Is the short term fun I would have more valuable than the long term benefits I think I could get? Life is long and maybe I'm just not able to predict how things will turn out.

276,"Backstory:

Friends for 4-5 months, had a good time, made lots of plans and shared a lot. Promised to be there to support each other.

Until some plans started getting canceled and I grew worried if they would happen - but still didn't push it too much. Or so I think. We were talking about seeing every now and then and it seemed like that would have been fine, until I explained one more time why I would like to see a bit more often for a while (but not necessarily as they were understandably busy) after waiting for 3 weeks. Before this we had been chatting every second day. I started having a few doubts, but nothing I wouldn't have talked about over time.

I only made that explanation because I wanted to say that while it is important that we see every now and then (in the time window we thought was fine), it was not necessary every time.

But as I made the explanation, I think it was understood as another reminder and I did not receive a reply for long. I contacted asking them if I said something badly and that I didn't mean to hurt them. Later on my friend left the group chat of our friend group and said it would be better for both of us to end the friendship and that my friend simply does not have time to socialize with anyone.

I said I would still like to continue being friends with them after everything else was going well, but they did not reply for long and went on to remove me from their friendlist.

I would try to contact them later, saying I'm sorry if I upset them, but they said I didn't and they simply didn't have time. It all came so suddenly that I couldn't believe it, so I explained that and gave my final message where I told how I felt about losing the friendship after everything was going well.

Today I saw the same friend and asked them in person why it had to happen this way and they said it's not my fault... they said that they were stressed and asked if i would like to continue the friendship in the near future. I said yeah. We talked some more and I explained that it's hard for me to get over a loss of a friend when it happens like this after feeling like I was left. She said she didn't mean to say that the friendship should end, but that it needs a break instead. I said it felt different over text and talked some more, after which we talked about adding each other back. Over this discussion I tried to hold my cry the whole time, so only tears and rather short answers came out.

So I got home, relieved that I have the chance to get my friend back and go over these issues once so that we can continue from where we left off. However... I noticed that I was blocked on 1 platform (most likely after my final message) and that they did not accept my friend requests on two other platforms.

I thought it would be extremely important for them to add me so that we can be friends again, so I sent them a few messages over time today asking if they would like to add me back or not, tried calling and said over text that i'm ready to talk through all these things and that i also need to apologize for something i've said (or thought) before.

From what I understand, the friend might have been busy today, but as you can probably understand.. it's a bad time to be busy :(

So my question is (with this limited information) that what would you do or feel like in this kind of a situation?",26Mar2018,2
277,"My niece is 7 years old and has some mild autism (although my sister hasn't ever had it formally assessed, we all assume that's what it is), and she poops her pants every day. 

She goes to school and is not in special education or anything like that, she's a very bright child. Her mom often has to go to the school to change her, and every time I watch her she will probably poop in her pants twice. 

I know that my niece is quite capable of being potty-trained, she is not that severely handicapped, and although I'm not really sure what goes on at their house, I know my sister has told me she has tried everything. Also, I'm not sure if this has affected it although it might have, but my sister has a pretty bad drinking problem. (Divorce and depression being some obvious reasons for said problem)...i believe it has affected the potty training immensely but I have no proof of that. Just assumptions based on a lot of facts. Anyway...

I have discussed this with my sister and have suggested she take her to the doctor. My niece has to be sedated when she goes because of her social issues, I offered to go with and do whatever I can to help get this problem taken care of.

Meanwhile my poor niece is going to continue soiling herself (she's very embarrassed about it every time), and it's only a matter of time before kids at school start to notice and she's known as the kid who has accidents all the time. 

I'm not sure what to do and need advice on this. Any thoughts?",26Mar2018,1

280,"I broke the lcd/digitizer on my S7 and was going to get it fixed last week. Then i remembered that my battery life was getting pretty bad before it broke. So, instead of paying roughly $200, itd be closer to $300-325. I could use something more powerful than the J3 that I'm using now. I then considered getting the S8 thru cricket for $349 and unlocking it to use on MintSIM bringing my total closer to $500-550 depending on taxes and choice of plan. I changed my mind based on reports of the phone being really fragile.

My current situation is causing me to seriously consider just getting my S7 fixed. I haven't worked in awhile (did just get a new job), although I do have enough in savings that I'd be ok to fix it or buy a new phone outright. However, I want to go with the most cost effective option. If I don't decide to get the S7 fixed I'd want something that is either new or won't become obsolete in 18 months. I'd also like a phone that either doesn't have a ton of bloatware, something i can remove google and other preloaded apps that track you, and preferably is unlockable,

So, I got a lead in the school play we are preparing. I never auditioned, thy just needed someone and my teacher recommended me for whatever reason. I though about acting though never tried and though it would be nice to get some new experiences. Turns out I love it.
There is this girl who is basically the play director. At first, I didn't really think much about her, I just kinda liked that she was bubbly and friendly. Then I noticed I actually like her (maybe just infatuation) and I though that this time I'd man up and ask a girl out properly.

282,"Hey,

I feel so ashamed having to type this. But I don't have anyone in m life I can ask for advice or support. I just feel so alone right now. I'll try to keep it fairly short cause I just don't want to make it a novel. 

Basically I'm 24m female living with roommates. 
I come from an abusive home (Dad is a narcissist; mom is an enabler; sister young got pregnant probably bipolar). I finally left my abusive home after saving as much money as I could. It was probably the best thing I've ever done; but very difficult as I've never made an ideal amount of money. I saved and switched jobs so I could move out. Fast forward to Jan of this year I get fired after coming down with a chest infection. I didn't get any notice either so since then I've been struggling to make ends meet. But on my days applying for jobs (That haven't got back to me) it's been tough to not be down on myself.

Ive had interstitial cystitis my whole life and for the past 8 or some years I pretty much forfeited my own schooling etc. because I was always in so much pain and knew I couldnt attend classes. I also didn't get taught how to drive y my family because they're crazy and only do their own thing. 

Basically I'm 24, jobless, no car, no support system, running low on savings and feeling miserable. I have no idea where to go from here. And I feel helpless. I don't even know what I want to do in life career-wise. I have no passions... no amazing talents... no dreams really. 

I just feel like a blob of a person. If any of that makes sense. I guess I would just love to hear any helpful advice from some more experienced people.

288,"So, to give you some backstory, I took a class last semester called CAD (Computer-Aided Drawing) where we would create assigned drawings on one a school computer throught the year. All of our drawings were stored under our accounts that were locked with a username and password. I passed with a fairly good grade.

Today, a friend (kind of) that is currently taking the class asked me if I could let him download one copy of a drawing that I did because he didn’t understand it. Me being the nice fucking guy I am, I gave him my username / student ID in order for him to sign in and download that one drawing. Well, about 10 minutes later I visited the classroom to see if it had worked out for him. I find out that he decided to download every single drawing I had made throughout the semester (100+) and sent them to most of his classmates as well (15 maybe?) through G-Mail. They are planning on just turning in my copies rather than doing their own. Keep in mind that the teacher who teaches the class is very against cheating, but sometimes won’t notice it. When she does, she gets furious.

Is their anything I can do about this? How do I handle a situation like this? At the time I decided to just play it off and laugh, but now im extremely angry. Thanks in advance.",26Mar2018,2
289,"Hey guys, 1st post here. I really need some outside advice and don't know where else to turn. Long time lurker , 1st time poster.

Growing up, my parents were always there for us. I do remember my dad hurting my feelings quite a bit as a child..in lots of ways. Blaming me for vandalism that happened to his vehicle (I didn't do it, and felt so hurt he would keep accusing me) As time went on (my late teens) their relationship started to diminish. My mom wanted nothing more than to be a family , but my dad was pushing us away . Still, I loved him.

After they divorced , his attitude was very sour towards me and the rest of the family. He even went so far as to one day telling me he wants nothing to do with me , no relationship. That he's 'done'  I took that as the last straw. It took me a while, but I came to peace with myself that if he passed, I'd be fine with that. I didn't want anything to do with him after the day he told me he wants nothing to do with me.

I am now in my mid to late 20's, I haven't talked to him for quite some time now. New city , new job, loving everything right now. 

A few weeks ago he dropped a letter off to a family member who read it to me , saying how he wants to have a relationship now.

I don't really care for him now .. Too much time has passed. I figured he would pass away and that would be it. Please understand how hurtful it was to hear your dad say he wants nothing to do with you..and now he wants to try to fix it 

I know life is short , and to forgive is good. And family this family that. But at the end of the day, HE broke the relationship...and I came to terms with it. 

Am I being a jerk? I feel like my feelings matter , and what he did was extremely sad for a father to say to child. I don't really want to talk to him, as there's nothing to talk about.. besides the fact he told me he wants nothing to do with me.

Hope this all made sense. Really hoping for some advice here...I know life is short , but he wasn't thinking about how short life was when he told me that..He wanted no relationship, now he has exactly what he wants.",26Mar2018,4

In addition, they wanted test work before I freelanced with them.

They had prescribed me a Valium before the procedure, so when I went I was under the influence of the drugs they gave me. I signed some papers. They went to go take my teeth out and gave me the sedation drugs but I was still very awake and very aware of my surroundings so they canceled the procedure since I was ""a danger to myself, them, and the procedure"" as I was waiting for them to release me to my mom, one of the women who worked there started talking about me while I was still sitting there, under the influence of the drugs they had just given me! She was saying how I was a danger and couldn't get over my fear of dentists and how I ignored them since October (which I didn't?! I called them multiple times trying to make an appointment!) and afterward released me to my mom and told me they were going to charge me for the 20 minutes of sedation they pumped into me.

298,"I guess a little background is needed. 

I was working in phone sales for a small business AT&amp;T in a small city. My manager decided to get my coworkers together to try and sue the business owners over unpaid overtime, not paying us correctly for commissions, and for imposing new rules that could hurt our monthly pay significantly if we didnt sell DirecTV for a month (Directv in my area doesnt include local channels, so it was very challenging for us to get any sales).

After initially being apart of the lawsuit, and paying the lawyer several hundred dollars I realized that some/most of the class action lawsuit wasnt really effecting my pay and it was mostly effecting my managers pay (in my opinion). The owners gave me paperwork from their lawyer to sign saying that I would drop the lawsuit, which I signed and they seemed to be alright with me after that. But being the 23 year I was and feeling pressure from the owners and my coworkers after starting and dropping my end of the lawsuit I decided to just quit my job a couple weeks later.

I was just feeling extremely stressed out, and felt like everyone was my enemy when they used to be my friends. I had even started drinking during work time which was just out of character for me. I knew something had to change.

 I know i shouldnt have just quit my job. But my life was becoming a burden and I was making bad decisions. I guess I took the easy way out :(

Anyways, I returned my company clothes to the owners, and talked to them and apologized about everything. To which they didnt say a lot, but seemed to sympathize with me.

That was 9 months ago. Since then ive been going through technology training with CompTIA (a+ exams, networking exam). Living with my parents to save money (have spent almost all of it paying off my car loan) And now I need to get a decent job again. 

Problem is I dont know if I can use my former employer as a reference because maybe he is still mad about me just quitting, and would give a negative review of me. But what else can I put on my resume since that was my only job of the last 4 years.

I worked hard for the 3.5 years I was there and I never was a trouble employee. I hope the owners can see what happened to me and not hold a grudge against me.

Can I call the owner and somehow ask him if he is going to give me a good reference?",26Mar2018,1

My roommate was assigned randomly, and this girl has serious behavioral, anger and mental problems. In a nutshell, she is rude to my friends, complains about me to her parents on the phone while I am in the room, curses me out to others when she thinks I am sleeping, spreads rumors, yells to wake me up, talks extremely late and loudly on the phone and brings over her boyfriend for days and nights upon end. I am a very easy person to live with, but I reached a cracking point around two months ago when she tried to wake me up with blaring music and all the lights on at 3AM because she was frustrated that she failed a biology quiz. I requested a meeting with the dean and as a result, she verbally assaulted me twice, once over text and once in person. These were the most stressful two weeks of my life, despite the fact that she has made our room a living hell since October this past year. 

We had a mediation with the dean, who refused to take any disciplinary action against this girl, even though I communicated that I feared being in the room alone with her because of her anger problems. I considered filing harassment charges, but ultimately decided against it because I didn't have enough time to commit to a full-blown investigation. After our mediation, in which she spread lots of false rumors and made horrible allegations against me to the dean, the situation got better for a little bit. We didn't talk at all, but she stopped spreading rumors and quieted her tv shows and talking on the phone late at night. 

We still haven't talked in person, two months later, but she's started up these unacceptable behaviors again, been complaining to my RA about me again, and wants to have a sit-down conversation, where I'm confident she will complain endlessly about me. I am an extremely understanding and kind person, but never before have I met somebody so void of human decency and respect. However, I am sick and tired of her horrible and humiliating behaviors. Quite frankly, I do not want to waste my time and meet with her person, so that I can listen to a list of illogical and ad hominem complaints.

I have no thirst for life or anything, seeing how excited my classmates and friends are to graduate and move on really highlights how negative and pessimistic I am about the future. I think I want to attend grad school because it is within my comfort zone and means my routine won't drastically change next year, but I cannot be motivated to even begin the application process. It seems like such a huge mountainous task to do that I simply cannot be bothered to do. I'm scared of asking tutors for academic references. I'm scared of being interviewed.

Looking back, I'm starting to question whether or not I forced the making out. I never really asked or got consent, despite making out multiple times. I initiated it.

On the other hand, she seemed really into it. I mean we were both using lots of tongue, and rubbing each other's faces, etc. She didn't seem upset at all by it, although she eventually pulled away every time. I never stopped her or anything.

Honestly, I never would have done if I'd realized she was uncomfortable while it was happening and if I'd that vibe I would have backed off...

318,"I'll start out by saying that I don't have many people in my life that I would actually consider friends so would just ask people to keep that in mind if they are kind enough to give me any advice.

My best friend and I are good about 70% of the time, but the other 30% I worry about upsetting her, and I tread on egg shells a lot with her. We met at university and instantly clicked and we were in a small group of friends (to which nobody really keeps in contact with each other since we left uni apart from me and my bff.) I became very unwell during my 2nd year and found it hard to get in to university and our friendship struggled through that a bit but we got over it and became close again during our final year. However during the last few weeks which were very stressful, we had a massive bust up in the middle of the street walking home from uni one day, something which had never happened before as I usually just go along with her to make life easier and because I don't want her to fall out with me. It took a long time for our friendship to feel similar to how it did before again even though nothing too bad had been said. She spent several weeks being very blunt and cold towards me and it left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and anxious so I made up my mind to never be in a situation like that with her again and whenever something went wrong just appease her rather than argue my own viewpoint even if I felt I was in the right.

Recently we haven't spoken in a while because we both have a lot going on in our lives, but I messaged her and she read it and didn't respond for a week and then sent me a long, quite cold message saying I could've messaged her before and just letting me know how she's been in general and what she's been up to. I apologised profusely, but deep down felt quite annoyed at the fact she could've easily messaged me too. I'm the type that gets easily overwhelmed by social media and she knows this, so I tend to go into myself for a little while until I feel able to cope with the online world again. (We don't live close enough to just meet up on a whim since we came from different areas going to our uni)
I've been trying to talk to her and tag her in things so she feels like I am making an effort but she seems so cold with me that it's just making me feel down and I'm wondering why I'm bothering.

Am I being overly sensitive about our friendship or is my friend's behaviour out of order?",26Mar2018,1

So anyway we met up today for brunch. And she told me that her partner has moved out as they were earning too much money together so she stopped getting help after going back to work after maternity leave. So In order to get more money and help financially he's left basically. 
Which makes no sense to me what so ever because surely there earning more than enough money together to keep the house and pay bills etc. Even if they are paying out more surely there still have more money between them giving the fact that they both work enough hours and could pick up more work if they wanted to. 
So I'm worried that either he has actually left her and not actually told her. 
Or that they've broke up and she's too ashamed to tell me. 
Which seems very silly considering how close we are and I'd still be there and support her as much as she needed me too. And she knows this. 
So what are your opinions? How would you approach this? Would you just leave it? 
I am trying to forget it, but it upsets me. That for some reason she can't confine in me.
I really hope that she could talk to me about this, which ever the truth may be.

321,"Hey guys,

So I got my B.S. in Biology, but I didn't realize that I was really only doing it because I knew that I'd have a job upon graduating and it seemed practical, rather than studying a field in the arts and humanities, which I am far more interested in (and more talented honestly). I used to try to fool myself into thinking that I was passionate about research and medicine and, while I think it's interesting, it's certainly nothing that I feel passionate about. 

Anyway, I recently got a job in a clinical lab and as I meet more people, I anticipate them asking me what I want to do with my future. People have asked me that before and I usually act like I undecided and sometimes I even flat out lie that I'll be going on to grad school even though I'd absolutely hate that. I want to be seen as dedicated and competent at my job (especially being new) but I don't want to lie and be something that I'm not. How do I word a response that indicates that I'm not trying to continue on in he field of medicine or research while not seeming like a confused, irresponsible or misguided millennial? 

Btw I am intensively working toward erecting some creative projects, but they're just taking a while. I feel like having that would give some credibility to me if I want to say that I'm going in a different direction. The issue is that I just don't have them now. ",26Mar2018,3

This raised a big ole' red flag especially having previously worked in finance/insurance, so I ignored the message.  He called back the next day and left another voicemail not saying where he's from, which I also ignored.  I did not get any other messages the rest of the week so I figured the guy had moved on.

To make things simple, because they are, my mom doesn't like the ""culture"" of the country, but that's basically a lie, she only doesn't like the accent of the people. If you know how chilean spanish sounds you could understand more.

That, combined with the typical marriage problems makes my mom live in a lie where she thinks that here the people don't have value as persons.

And yes, my stepdad has discussed this with her but she is very very stubborn and she doesn't listen to explanations. I tried to talk with her as well but since I'm ""only a teenager"" my opinion doesn't count. 

I find that her being an foreigner here as all of us, it's a very bad behavior, disrespectful. 

She says when we get more stable economically, she wants to go to Brazil. She *loves* Brazil but I found that country super dangerous and she isn't aware of this I guess, because she is knows only the idealized Brazil. Sorry if you are brazilian and this offends you, but we come from a super dangerous country as well and I don't like to us being in that situation again. 

As I said I'm ""only a teenager"" to her and basically cannot change her mind. As I also said my stepdad didn't achieve anything trying to explain to her why this country is the best (in south america). She only sees the bad side of the things. But she doesn't see bad things casually in other things.

She only knows Brazil by telenovelas (I don't know a word for that in english sorry).

She wants to us moving from here as soon as I finish high school, by that time I will be 18 and maybe more listened by her. Also in this period of time I can do something.

Any alternatives to change her mind that is not only speaking to her? I would appreciate if you know an answer.

336,"Hi everyone! Sorry for the wall of text.

I currently live at my childhood home in the DC metro area with my mother, currently paying her rent (~$1k/month). See, after I graduated college in 2013, I returned home in order to help my mother with my terminally ill father. My father passed away in 2015 and she and I have continued living together ever since. We have never had a problem living together and enjoy each others company. Unfortunately, an issue is coming to a head that is going to require us to move. My parents had to take out a second mortgage on the house in order to cover my fathers medical costs (he has had medical issues for my entire life). This second mortgage payment is draining my mother of all of her cash and she doesn't make much to begin with (even with widows benefits). I have asked her to let me pay her more but she refuses to take it. This, on top of having too many memories in the house, is making us consider housing options around northern VA.

I'm currently 28, overweight, minimal friends, no dating life (ever) and diagnosed with depression. I started seeing a therapist about a year ago and, as of December, have been making great strides in recovering from depression. I have started losing weight (30 lbs in the past 3 months, ~60 lbs overall), going to the gym, taking classes at a local makerspace and even doing some volunteer work. Just generally getting out more and taking better care of myself. I still have bad depression episodes, but am generally going in the right direction. With these improvements in mind, the thought of getting my own place has been coming up. I would like to think that I would start dating soon and gaining the independence that having my own place would grant would help. That said, my mother is lonely and would be hard pressed to make ends meet on her own in northern VA (she doesn't want to leave the area quite yet). My bouts of depression also make me a little leery about living on my own. If she and I bought a place together, I would be an equal owner. On my own, I would probably just rent an apartment. 

From a financial point of view, going in with her to buy a place makes the most sense. It would also be a relief to my mother. On the other hand, I want to do right be me. Very few people are impressed by a 30 y/o who lives with his mother and gaining a greater independence is very enticing. I'm just very conflicted as to what I should do and would love to hear other peoples opinion on the matter. 

tl;dr: 28 y/o wants to know if he should buy a new place with his mother or rent on his own.",26Mar2018,2

He absolutely destroyed my confidence and self esteem to the point where he would take my money right in front of me and I just stood there and said nothing. He ruined me with years of emotional abuse all because of his jealously. Well after roughly 4 years of his crap I quit hearing from him for about 6 months or so.

358,"There’s been a teacher at my school for the past m 3 years. I’ve been in his class twice, with bad outcomes:

* GCSE - kicked out after he changed the syllabus and went on a purge, kicking out everyone who got below a C to hide the fact people were failing (only 3 of the remaining 8 people got a pass in the end)

* A-Level - dropped the subject after he was being a generally bad teacher, telling me off for “not doing” homework that I had already done. Apparently half of the class also dropped soon after.

These issues were only had with him, no other teacher.

I am planning to get a new A-level at the local college (I live on a small island), and it turns out he’s part-time teaching in the subject I want to take, starting the term I also begin.

This is terrible news. This is pretty much my last chance to get an advanced qualification relevant to what I want to do (I turned down uni), and he’s going to mess it up. 

A key reason for him being a bad teacher in the A-level subject I dropped was that other pupils from other schools that offered this topic for GCSE were present, and so had advanced knowledge.

359,"My lease is ending soon, and my partner lives with his dad. He said I could move in with him after my lease ends and that his dad is cool with it - especially bc I'd be helping with rent. His dad is really easygoing and seems to like me, so I think it would work out great.

Ideally, I'd like to live with only my partner, but money is tight for everyone bc I'm finishing up school, and he and his dad just opened a new business.

I've been too nervous to bring up the topic with him or his dad. I liked feeling financially independent and having his dad know that I have my own place and can support myself or something.

-(pays about $1600 after tax)

-I will have to leave home at 2 pm and I'll be home at 2 am

*Job B is only 8-10 mins away (6 miles)*

-Commuting is not a big deal at all


Which job would be the better choice to make? Benefits are the same for both of them, the big issue is just having to choose. The cost of living in job A is too high, which is why I'm living close to Job B. Any advice would be appreciate. Need to make a decision in 2 weeks.

367,"So there’s this girl who I happen to have a crush on but I also want to ask to prom. I’d say our friendship status is just “friends” rather than good friends due to the small amount of time I’ve had to socialize. Prom is coming up but I don’t want to go without asking someone or I won’t go at all. How should I ask her to prom while being in this friendship state?

370,"Throwaway because people IRL know my reddit name. Please excuse any crappy formatting, on mobile right now. TL;DR at bottom.

So, out of the blue yesterday night (like 1AM on March 26) my friend messaged me saying that he attempted suicide three days ago. Needless to say, I was *really* taken aback; this person is currently dealing with some relationship problems and he has a history with mental health issues (anxiety/depression problems cropped up ~4 years ago, he hasn't talked about it since), but he has never shown suicidal tendencies before. This person is also a compulsive liar, usually making things up in order to get out of doing things they don't want to do. I still had a chat with him after the message, extending my support and asking how he had been doing. He's hanging out with another friend today; nothing too out of the ordinary.

Now, I understand that people with depression or suicidal thoughts can be very good at hiding both of those things, and I'm not trying to discourage anyone with those thoughts from seeking help. Your mental health is one of the most important things to take care of. However, with this specific person, I thought it over and the whole thing is just fishy to me.

First, his behaviour patterns suggest that it was literally impossible for him to have attempted it three days before he told me; I went and checked one of our mutual Discord servers, and he was highly active every single day for the past 6+ days. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and thought that maybe he misremebered the date, but he also told me that he's been going to therapy for two days now, so I don't think that's it. He's been sending messages and talking to people basically all-day every-day, so when could he have attempted? He also has been going to work as usual for the past couple days, though I don't remember if he went to work on the day he said he attempted. Either way, I doubt that he'd be allowed to work in those conditions by his therapist.  

Apparently his parents and doctor both recommended him to therapy (which is why he said he'd been attending for 2 days), but there isn't any sign of being admitted to a hospital before that or anything. I can't say I know all the procedures after a suicide attempt, but it's odd to me that he would just immediately get assigned to therapy *the next day* without having a hospital visit or anything else. I don't know the method he used (I didn't ask), so maybe he didn't get admitted because he didn't physically harm himself too much? I don't know.

Lastly, like I said earlier, this person is a compulsive liar. I won't go into a ton of detail here (that'd be too long) but he lies a lot as an excuse if he doesn't want to do something, that something usually being hanging out with our other friends. For instance, he said that he had a sudden family emergency that required an ER visit a few weeks ago so he cancelled our lunch plans last minute, only to have that ""emergency"" solved in less than 45 minutes (which makes no sense, the closest hospital to us is already 20+ minutes away). He also over-exaggerates a lot of stories and makes shit up on the spot to fit with whatever we're talking about (ex. we were talking about going for coffee a little while ago, he randomly said that his sister bought him 5 cups the other day and he got ""high"" off of it. Like what?) I just brush these lies off, but this situation feels a lot more serious whether it is a lie or not.

The reason it might be true is because there isn't any reason for him to lie about something like this. He lies a lot, yes, but he's not exactly an attention-seeker; I can't imagine he's doing it to garner sympathy, as I don't think he told any of our other friends. If it's true, the only people that know are me, his parents, and his therapist/doctor.

So here I am, deciding whether or not my friend is lying about something so serious. Again, I know that these are complicated subjects, and I absolutely do not want to discredit anyone who dealt with these things in the past. However, with the way my friend has been acting about it, everything feels very contrived. Obviously I don't want to confront him unless I'm 100% certain that it is a lie because if it is true, the consequences of me doing so are not good. Does it sound like a lie to you? Should I tell him that I don't believe him, or is it better to support him? Sorry for the long post, thanks for reading. I also hope I didn't come across as insensitive or rude when talking about these subjects, I know they're sensitive issues. Apologies if so.

**TL;DR: My friend, who is a compulsive liar, claimed that he tried killing himself a few days ago. He was not admitted to a hospital, and his constant activity online suggests that it was impossible for him to have done it. He said that he was immediately given therapy the next day after the attempt, and that he has been attending for 2 days now. I can't decide whether I should call him out or believe him and continue supporting him. I can't think of any good reasons for him to lie about something like this, but everything points to it being untrue.**",26Mar2018,1

375,"Okay so I’ve been friends with this girl for over 5 years and we’ve been really close until the beginning of this school year. She made new friends (which is obviously okay) but she seems to be ditching me a lot more. I confronted her about this and we made up because she told I was just assuming everything she did. So we make up, and everything seems great. But of course, it doesn’t last too long. Lately she’s been flat out ditching me and every time I try to walk with my other friends she comes in and takes them with her? 

I usually walk with her and my other close friend but she ends up beating me to her and leaves. Also, when we’re having lunch, she doesn’t make eye contact with me and doesn’t even acknowledge my existence. I’m so damn sick of it.

376,"I’m currently in a class and struggling with it. The date to withdraw the class (I get a W on my transcript but it won’t affect my GPA) is this Thursday, so I need to make a decision fairly quickly. 

It’s a writing class. I consider myself a fairly good writer but I’m doing terribly in this class. However, I’ve left things too long for me to repair my performance. 

I have (according to my estimated calculations) about a 53 in the course, maybe a little bit higher. There are a few small assignments left worth 1% each, a big essay due worth 20%, and a presentation on my essay worth 10%. So, around 30% left. The prof is an INSANELY hard marker. I know I should have contacted him and asked how to improve earlier, but he took so long to mark everything that I basically got a whole bunch of marks back recently and I’m now realizing I’m in a bit of a pickle. 

I am unsure what to do. Should I withdraw from the class and take it again with a better outlook on it? Should I struggle through? I genuinely don’t know if I will pass the few remaining assignments - he marks super hard on presentations and has really disliked my writing thus far. 

I’ve contacted the prof to meet so I could come to a decision, but he hasn’t emailed me back and I’m trying to prep in case he never responds to me. What do you think I should do? ",26Mar2018,4
377,"my girlfriend and i both have a history with depression and suicidal thoughts. we made a pact back in january that if i were to seek treatment for my illness she would as well. 

my girlfriend told the guidance counselor at my school about my self harm and depression that same month, a day before i planned on asking my mother for a psychiatrist. the situation made my illness spiral out of control due to my mothers disgust towards my mental health. i understand that she wanted what was best for me, but she made the wrong move and the situation has escalated my suicidal ideations. but i put up with my mothers shit, put up with the emotional pain the situation stirred up, all because i wanted the best for my girlfriends wellbeing. i was eagerly waiting for her to fulfill her side of the deal and could not wait to assist her in her journey of treatment. 

here’s the part i am most angry about- my girlfriend didn’t keep her promise. she never told her parents about her struggle with depression, and never asked for treatment. 

her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer in february. she asked me to wait until the “family problems”, as she called them, were “taken care of”. this is terribly ironic as i was also going through family problems during the time she ratted me out to the school. but i completely understood the matter at hand and gave her an ample amount of time after her grandmothers diagnosis. 

her grandmother died a few days ago. i was ready to give her all of the time she needed in order to cope with her loss. i didn’t want to mention the pact until after the funeral (tomorrow), but it came up during a heated emotional conversation two nights ago. 

when i brought it up, she told me that it was highly unlikely that she would tell her parents about herself, even after recovering from her grandmothers death. she believes her parents will be disappointed in her, and that confessing would cause more problems to arise (ironic, yet again!) she tells me that she will keep her promise and that she WILL tell her parents sooner or later. but i am sick and tired of waiting. my girlfriends mental health is slowly worsening and she told me during the conversation we had that she didn’t want to exist. drawing this out won’t benefit her health whatso fucking ever

i don’t know what to do now. i want to tell her that i will wait but i am fucking tired of her shit. i was too much of a pussy to go to the school after she told me about her plan (didn’t mention specifics), but if telling the school is the only way out of this then I WILL take that route (however i want it to be the last resort). i feel as if, with a thorough examination of the situation, one more month is more than enough for her to find the courage to tell her parents. after then, i would have to tell the school myself.

379,"I have to begin with my first memory, because this isn't something that began 2 months, or even 3 years. I don't know how to do this so I'm just doing it simple. 

Age 8+ i was bitten by a bunch of ants, alot of them, and I'm pretty sure it hurt because i can't remember much. 
Age 8+ My dad used to get high in front of us, he would wander around the house looking dazed. I've also have had a nightmare about him. 
Age 8+ my mother abused me, physically and verbally. 
Age 8+ i was bullied by a kid, he punched me in the face and i ran home to my mom, she punched me and forced me to to fight i don't remember much after that. 
Age 10+ i started to stomp butterflies and rip their wings apart, and I've started to stomp on bees. If the bees were barley alive id remove their stingers 
Age 11+ my father went to the hospital, maybe an overdose? 
Age 11+ my mother and father argued more now, my mother trashed the house alot when they argued 
Age 11+ middle school was the definition of social isolation. 
Age 11+ my mom beat me harder then before, later in the years she stopped. She used verbal abuse instead 
Age 13+ fuzzy memories, i remember that I beat my cat, nothing to major though. I mainly scarred it. We caught two mices, and i stared at then while they were bleeding in the trap, trying to get out. I beat the mice while they were in a bag.
Age 13+ my parents divorced, i don't remember much else. 
Age 14 i stared making ""friends, but it never felt good to me""
Age 15 i was still socially isolated, but i could talk to people i guess? 
Age 16 i sat at tables alone for junior year. I've realized that i am a complete dipshit, and that math is at 2nd grade level. I am good at nothing at this point other then English. 
Age 17 i have a therapist that is no help to me, especially since when i talk about my past i seem fake. I've blacked out for an hour in my bathtub after realizing something, but i can't tell on what it was. I hit my self in the head when i get angry. 

With all of this, I'm paranoid sometimes, i look at people as sex objects. I don't trust people, i can't keep a relationship. I have to pretend I'm interested im anything they say. 
I also can't even talk about my emotions right, i just don't know anymore.

I have been dating my boyfriend for about 2 years+ now~ in this time we have gone through a lot together but I feel like there's more out there for me.

Aside from him saying good morning and good night telling me he loves me and vice Versa (and of course the fact we have sex) he just feels like a really close friend now and I feel like I have other options.

That being said I'm scared of breaking his or my own heart I love Him but I love my friends the same way (not saying I want to date someone else) should I stay? End it? And if I end it how do I outline it's not his fault and I want us to stay friends?

381,"Let me tell you what happened to lead me in this situation. Last Friday in my English class my class was assigned, as a warm up, to write an argumentative paragraph on which is better, late days or early out days in school. Me being the edge-lord I am decided to make a joke out of it. I usually joke around with my friends about school shooters and such so I decided to make it about that and thought the joke would kill. Basically what I wrote was that early outs were better because if a school shooter were to plan on killing kids they would have more time to prepare on a later day than an early out (the humorous aspect of the paragraph was supposed to be the absurdity of me taking a completely normal subject and turning it into a conversation on school shootings). As I predicted, the kids in my class started cracking up and were dead laughing when I was done sharing it (we volunteered to by the way). To my surprise (looking back on it I should have seen this coming) my p*ssy teacher told me to wait outside the hall so I could talk to her. However I never got to talking to my teacher and explaining that what I wrote was a joke and was sent to the office because me and my friend who was also out in the hall for misbehaving were being loud because we were laughing and joking around (you can probably tell by now that I am quite the comedian). I ended up in the office and straight up talked to the principal and then a cop who was stationed at the school. 
          This is where things get shitty. I got suspended, and now me and my mom have to attend a meeting with my f*ggot principal AND I have to talk with a district psychologist beforehand. My principal called my mom and said that he was concerned because when I was talking with the cop he claimed that my responses were ""cold."" I think that they think I am disturbed or something because in the notebook that I wrote my paragraph in they found other things that I wrote that were also consisting of dark and edgy humor involving rape, suicide, murder, mass murder, and a disturbed child with super powers (I know that sounds bad but if you were to read it and were an edgy 14 year old like me you would probably understand why they're funny).
          Im just worried that I might be forced to take pills, get expelled, or go to a therapist or something like that. In my head the worst possible scenario this could possibly end in is me going to jail for threatening to shoot the school (which is not what I did). My mom told me that the principal told her the psychiatrist is going to do some test on me. I think they're trying to find out if I might be one of those odd balls that come up every now and then. 
          So yeah that's whats going to happen. Can someone please tell me what kind of test I might be taking, and what to expect? Also what should I do when I talk to the psychiatrist? I know I am not a would-be-murderer or anything but I am feeling really anxious right now and some pointers could help. It would suck if I got expelled and couldn't see my friends again.

382,"Honestly, I don't even know where to begin. I've written this three times and deleted it. 

My grandmother died Dec 2016, leaving my 87 y/o grandfather alone for the first time in his ENTIRE life (married for 65 years). She was highly intelligent and left him well off money wise. As a family we all got together and hired a home health person for him, we will call her Mary - she is 48. Mary was hired in Jan 2017 through a local home health provider. This last year with Mary has been a nightmare to put it lightly. She does not report for work on time which is dangerous to my grandfather's health because he must take certain medications at certain times. The big kicker was when my grandfather did not answer the door for Mary one day. Mary sat in my grandfather's drive way for TWO HOURS. A neighbor finally got a hold of me and 9-1-1 was contacted. He was fine but I found it very disturbing that his HOME HEALTH provider sat idly by instead of taking immediate action. I documented this and contacted her employer. My grandfather feels some sort of connection with Mary and refuses to fire her. He defends her to the very end of the universe. He even skipped Christmas with us to spend it with her. I have tried to get him to fire her or to get her assigned elsewhere to no avail. 

Now, my grandfather is telling my aunts that Mary is going to move in with him. I am outraged and hurt. There is no doubt in my mind this woman is manipulating my grandfather - I assume for the money. What can I do? How can I help him not get taken advantage of? I am genuinely concerned that she would do something to hurt him. 

Or am I being an asshole who cant let my grandfather be happy with a new woman?

TL;DR My grandfather is moving a much younger woman into his house and I am worried she will let him die so she can have his money. How do I stop this?",26Mar2018,1
