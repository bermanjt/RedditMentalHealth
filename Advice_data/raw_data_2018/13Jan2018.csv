4,"Hey /r/Advice,

I'm a junior and attend a information technology class where we work with computers, networking, some coding, service, suppprt and pretty much everything related to computers. We're 7-ish people in our class, very high demand, but very few spaces, so you've got to have good grades to come in. 

Anyways, I'm considered the best in class both in the practical bit and the documentation and was asked if I wanted to travel across the state to attend a competition against another school. Everything will be covered and taken care of and will happen during on a Tuesday. The competition is based on what we're doing in class. That's pretty much all I know for now.

So, here's where I'm unsure what to do. Should I attend, or let someone else go? Am I likely to gain experience from this or waste time?

I can't imagine it bring a huge deal with a large crowd and lots of stuff going on, but I'm not sure. Gonna try to dig for more information. Any inputs? Thanks!",13Jan2018,2

new here asking advice on a girl I was on a date with yesterday, I thought the date went very well (went bowling) and she seemed to enjoy it, we had similar interests and liked the same music. I message her today and she's been replying really slowly.

12,"So, before I continue, I am sharing this because I am looking for some sort of advice on this interaction. So please, read the first 2 paragraphs and click on the link to read the conversation between my friend and I.

So the link below shows a conversation between me and my buddy Jeremy from today. It started because I made a Facebook post talking about my bad day yesterday and how I was in a bad mood. The thing he was talking about was my number 4 comment: 4. I found out that I have to pay a co-pay on everything because the idiots at the department of social services decided it was a good idea to switch my healthcare plan to something else that I did not want.

Little bit of a back story: I have been on disability for 5 years. I suffer from major depressive disorder severe recurring, anxiety, insomnia, OCD, odd, and ADHD, which is why I am on it. I have suffered with the alphabet disorders my entire life, and the depression, anxiety, and insomnia are all within the past 6 years (it will be 6 years come labor day). I have had problems with Medicaid and Medicare for about 4 years. More details can be found in my conversation.

Am I wrong to complain? Am I wrong to not want to have to deal with the bullshit anymore from social services? Did I do something wrong? I feel in my mind that I didn't do anything wrong, but at the same time I feel he is correct. So what should I do or what should I say in response to this?

16,"Alright, so I go to a small predominately white private school and they require you to do a certain amount of service hours to graduate. I get called in to the office two months in a row because of this. Over the summer I completed almost double the amount of hours you need but they wont accept them. They won't accept them because I was not ""directly helping a person"". I told them I completed the hours but the director wanted me to redo all the hours in 4 months during school. I asked if he could help me find a place to do my hours because I don't care where I do them at. He agreed and I also started looking for places to volunteer. He gave me a list of volunteer jobs and I e-mailed every single one. I never got an answer from any of them except one. The one that replied said that I couldn't volunteer until after the hours where due. So I get called in the office today and the director tells me that I am procrastinating 
and he wanted to know why I didn't want to volunteer. I told him that if I didn't want to volunteer than I wouldn't of done double the hours I needed. I ask him if he has found a volunteer job I can do but he said he called someone but he never answered. Suddenly he takes out his phone and threatens to call the guy who helps me get scholarships so I can go to this school. So I said ok go for it I want to talk to him anyway. He calls him and goes on about how I don't want to volunteer at all and pretty much calls me lazy. So I ask the director if I can talk to him and he agrees. I tell him that I want to talk to him in person and find out a plan to get my hours. He agrees and I hang up. After this the director says he has been calling the guy that helps me get scholarships for a couple months now. I was confused because I have not been in trouble at all. The director says he's been telling him that i've been breaking dress code and wouldn't comply no matter how many times they told me. This made me even more confused. I tell the director I have no idea what he's talking about. Apparently he's been confusing me with another student about the dress code and he has been screwing me over with scholarships. We are the only two hispanic students in my grade level. I found this hard to believe because we look nothing alike. After this I decided to reach out to the leader of a camp that I volunteered at over the summer to ask him to sign a paper that says I volunteered. 10 minutes later I get an email that he resigned from his position today and is no longer able to sign. So today I lost scholarship money and I am back to square one with my service hours that I have to complete. I have no Idea what to do.

TL;DR- The director of my school wont accept my service hours and mixed me up with the only other Mexican in my grade costing me scholarships. Shortly after I ask for a signature for 60 service hours that I did at a camp but the guy In charge resigned the same day I asked him and can no longer sign. Im not really sure how to respond to this series of unfortunate events that all happened in one day. ",13Jan2018,14
17,"I've been been looking for a job for the past year. Everytime I call for openings, they always tell me to apply online.

This includes AMC, Tutti Fruitti (yogurt shop) and JCPenney to name a few and for some of them I've physically showed up to ask but I always get redirected to go apply on their website. Today I decided why not try Gamestop, and I tried my best to insist that I'd really like to ask a manager if I could come by and drop my resume but I'm given the same response. I'm pretty sure it'd come off as rude and would make a horrible first impression if I went ahead and did it anyways, even if I explained my situation. I'm not sure what to do.

18,"Ok so my husband and I have been married for about three years and we have two small children. From the moment that we combined households and finances our lives have been a wreck. At first I didn’t mind and even thought it was kind of romantic like we were “living on love”, but after three years things have lost their gleam and it’s so depressing. I want to start working again now that we are done having children and I am ready to start making some life changing financial habits and investments. My husband on the other hand thinks he is going above and beyond his obligations by working the standard 40 hours a week and feels that any extra money we set aside should be for things like Xbox and other costly gadgets. He also refuses to budget his money so we often don’t have enough for food or other necessities. I am looking forward to being an adult capable of things like running a business and owning my own home. I feel like he is still stuck in kid mode and I have grown into a confident adult. 
We were recently given the opportunity to make a large financial investment that would be the beginning of a new life for us. I was completely on board and I began planning out exactly what we would need to do in order to get the ball rolling. We sat down and had a long conversation and my husband decided that he wanted to keep our investment money for “other things”. I was furious especially since I had recently emptied out my IRA in order to pay off his bad debts so that we could qualify for the investment. 
For me this feels like the final straw. I love him so much but I have big plans for my family and it doesn’t include barely scraping by. So my question is this, does anyone else have a relationship like this? If so is it successful and what do you attribute to that success. If there is a way to better our lives and keep my family together that is what I want to do but I can’t sit back and watch him blow through another large sum of money leaving us with nothing but more debt.


P.S. I should add a disclaimer that my husband has many good and lovely qualities in addition to his childishness and is in no way a horrible person or anything like that. Just a childish one.",13Jan2018,1

26,"Hi everyone, I think I need help. I'll try to be brief because nobody wants a novel.

22/M. Growing up, I was sensitive, bullied a little bit, but otherwise pretty smart and very lucky. Raised by two very supportive parents, and afforded great opportunities at school. Quite adept in a few areas and did well academically. Not trying to boast; just telling you how it is.

These days, I'm a disaster.

I know almost nothing about myself. I've always felt I was 'off' and didn't fit in, so I change my personality to fit the people around me. I was quite popular in university, but I was playing a character. There's an image in my head of what I should be like, so I try to act that way. It's not me though.

I'm nervous, sad and angry a lot of the time. I don't really feel much other than that, and I can't relate to anyone, although I always manage to pretend to. I possess very little empathy. My moral compass is off - I usually only know certain things are bad when I've already made the mistake and spend months feeling guilty about it. 

I deliberately shut out my parents emotionally. They're good people and they don't deserve it. I wonder if I'm doing it to build up a shield so I won't feel as bad when they die.

My sexuality is a mystery to me. I'm into women, although I had sex with a guy once and felt a bit gross, don't know why. I'm into some pretty weird porn. Additionally, every few years I seem to think I'm transgender. I know I'm probably not - it's just escapism. I've never had a SO or anything; people only ever seem to like me as a friend. I wish I knew what I was doing wrong.

I don't know what my desires are. I wanted to be a musician from about 16 but took an employable degree as a plan B. Now I've graduated, music things are taking their time to manifest (i.e. I'm earning practically nothing), I'm miserable and living with my parents again, and every day my degree diminishes in value. I know everyone is disappointed in me for not getting a 'real job' yet. Now I don't even know if I want to do music full-time anymore, or whether just having an independent life and successful career would be enough. I know I have talents, but if I do the wrong thing I'll waste them.

I'm so scared of making the wrong decisions and losing opportunities. I sometimes think it would be better if I offed myself - that way, people would remember me as a young person with a lot of prospects who died too soon, rather than as someone who never quite managed to make it in spite of all the opportunities that were afforded to him.

I hate the overly-emotional kid that I was - I've gone too far in the other direction on the outside, but I'm just as confused and lonely as I've always been.

I have a crap ton of problems with this place (which I will list here, just because I don't want to spend the whole advice question just ranting, but someone might want to see them for something? I don't know):
- Forced to babysit an insanely annoying three year old and four month old sister
- Treated like I'm 8
- Make me very uncomfortable about my dead relatives and kind of force me to talk about it
- Just a very uncomfortable past in general with this place and these people
- A step-""mom"" that irks me
- No. Alone. Time.
- Forced to sleep with a three year old (it gets extremely annoying)
- Step-""mom"" and Dad argue a lot about stupid repetitive crap
- Pictures! Pictures! Pictures! We need more pictures! Oh, you're on a slide with your sister? P i c t u r e s!
- No technology, it seems (not really allowed to use my phone or my laptop for much except check my grades, google questions and look at pictures)
- Incredibly boring, not really allowed to watch their TV
- I don't feel like I'm at home, I'm at a strangers house
- I get homesick after like 2 seconds at this place.

I have a full time job in an office, I have a good relationship with my boss that I think she wouldn't hold it against me for having greasy hair but I don't want to ask her for help in the magnitude of a place to stay. Point is I have the means to earn money, I just don't have anything saved and wasn't prepared for this. Atm I've got just over $100, ill be earning about $850 every 1st and 15th(I just got paid early bec of the bank holiday and the $100 is what's left after paying my bills and doing some emergency shopping), luckily a full tank of gas, my insurance and phone bills are utd until Feb 28. Again luckily I just quit smoking cigarettes 9 days ago so that's something I no longer have to account for. I've got too keep my mom in dog and cat food for my dog and her 4 dogs and her 11 cats in exchange for her letting my dog stay there, it's about one 13lb bag of food per animal type a week aka $30. I have no one less than a 40M drive away I can stay with/ask for a shower and commuting is wise to avoid, my truck runs despite a multitude of mechanical issues, I do nooooot want her on the highway. Right now I'm set up in a Walmart parking lot, which I read was legal. I've seen RVS parked here before so I *think* no one will bother me. That said I'm anxious as hell and could use advice/tips/encouragement. I can use my works facilities during the week for hygeine, and there is a park/the Walmart also. The park has several picnic tables with outlets I could use to charge my laptop and phone but I don't want to be there at night so for now I am where I'm going to be until morning(I am not an adventurous spirit if you can't tell). 

If anyone's been in a similar position or has some advice to help me make this a bit easier, please give. I at first thought I must get an apartment asap but I really want to go back to my hometown.

I am very inexperienced with this whole having roommate thing, so your advice is very much appreciated. Thank you in advance! Having spent many years of my life living with my ex, I recently moved into an apartment and became roommates with the owner of the apartment. I am a female in my early 30s, and my roommate is a male in his mid 30s. We are complete strangers.

Before I moved in, he said his girlfriend lives in a different state. I was thinking to myself - ""great. no random strangers at my house then"". However, the other day my roommate informed me that he and his gf are in an open relationship, and today girl No. 2 came to my apartment and they hang out etc.

My roommate is respectful and doesn't invade my persona space. However, I am having a really hard time with this because:

1) I am not sure how many girls he is seeing, and feeling a bit uncomfortable to share my bathroom with these people. 2) I have a bit of a quirk with sanitation (especially when it comes to STDs). Since it appears that my roommate has quite a colorful sex life, I feel very uncomfortable sharing my toilet and shower (bathtub shower. Sometimes the drainage gets clogged so you are technically showing standing in water) with random strangers whose STD (health) status I don't know of.

I'm having a really hard time with this. What should I do? My roommate is very respectful, and I know this is none of my business, but I just can't quite come to terms with the situation. If it stops at girl No. 2, I think I would be fine with it, but somehow I have a feeling that there are also girl no 3., 4., etc...

What should I do in this situation? Please be honest and call me out on it if I am being immature and unreasonable.",13Jan2018,7

54,"Usually I get a good 6 - 8 hours of sleep every night. Yesterday, after a party and a little bit of driving people home with work early in the morning, I woke up today feeling not rested- but relaxed. Not tense. Generally I wake up and go through my day with a ridiculous amount of tension, not only tension in my body but in my thoughts, in my voice, in the pace I walk, its speed. It's fast. I'm always thinking. Today, I feel great. I feel like I can dialogue, I am not stressed about anything even though I had an extremely busy day.

What's the answer?


Is it meditation, maybe? The music I listen to? I like feeling this way. I like feeling relaxed. I like not having this weight on me at all times, and not overthinking every individual thing I say and do. I want to have to build up to that energy and have it in the right settings, not carry it with me everywhere I go.


Once, in an all-nighter I pulled at the end of finals week because I couldn't sleep, I had the most productive day of my entire life. I  was moving that day, I reset my entire computer, I worked, I wrote, and I felt so good at the end- because I was relaxed the entire time. I didn't have the energy to hold the tension because I had no sleep. I was running on ""fumes"" and ""fumes"" for me is enough energy to do everything that I want to, calm down, and focus. Can anyone help me? I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the energy, the misplaced energy, consuming my life and thoughts even when I'm just walking to uni, walking to work. Sitting down in class, and overthinking the work I present. Over energizing it. Tensing. 


Please help.

57,"Hi there. Short summary- I go to university abroad. The schedule was to come in for a few days after holidays before having more holidays before the semester starts. (Few weeks holidays- a week of lecture- more weeks of holidays). So I just went to a random doctor with faked pain and got a sick note to cover those days. This is because I am an international student and it would cost me $1000 to fly in for those few days. The university’s office has responded with a email asking me to meet with someone and submit my flight cancellation documents (which I obviously don’t have) so how much trouble am I in? They obviously suspect something or they wouldn’t ask this right? The plan is to say I hadnt gotten around to booking the flight yet (not too believable) since I got the injury a week before the start date. The dates were released over a month before the holidays started though so it is suspicious that I didnt even book my flight. I’m very scared- what could they do? The sick note if anyone asks- it is real. I didn’t know the doctor nor did I forge one. They could call the place- however would they want to speak to the doctor? I was VERY insistent on the sick note obviously, could he tell them stuff like that? 

* I know this is unethical. Honestly I didn’t know any otherway for save a $1000. I did consider staying in the first few weeks of holidays but it is christmas + family birthdays and I’d have to spend them alone so I decided not to. ",13Jan2018,2

Emma moves to a different city, and develops a fwb relationship with Bill who is also my friend. In conversations I have had with Bill he has implied his fwb is Emma. Tonight he sent me a snap from her place which almost confirms my suspicions. Bill is also in a relationship, his gf lives in a different city.

64,"I put this in r/Relationships but only got a few responses, so I'd like to expand my horizon here. 

To put some context to this:

I met this girl in September at one of my school's clubs and we've been friends ever since. At first, I just thought she was attractive and had no intention of trying to date her. One day I saw on her Facebook she shared something about DDLC and I messaged her about it, so we talked and we've just been talking ever since. As time goes on, we get closer and she starts talking about things to me that I shouldn't normally know. She talked to me about how to ask her out, date her, etc. and how she just isn't ready for a relationship right now and only having one ex.

Then things start picking up when she starts doing things like subtly flirting with me, changing our nicknames in chat, etc. I'm not picking up the signals, but one time I messaged her in the middle of the night due to doing some homework and she was like ""Ooh, look at you trying to slide into my DM's"" and I just went along with it from there. Then, we start talking everyday, hanging out often (just the two of us) and start getting closer.

There was one big thing I noticed: I found out she's a cosplayer, and one day she dressed up as my favorite character in front of me just to mess with me because she knew I liked that character. I really thought nothing of it, but that was quite a way to get my attention.

Then, I notice that we always talk for hours over the phone and we're always around each other when we're in our friend group. They all said that we act like a married couple around each other, with how much we just make fun of and tease each other. This goes on when we talk in text too. Eventually, I start getting feelings for her and her flirting becomes a lot more obvious. I talk to my friends, my roommates (because she's been over on a few occasions to hang out with me), and my therapist, tell them all these things here, and they tell me it's pretty obvious that she likes me. I'm just sort of in shock, because for the past two years, I've been really insecure and unhappy with myself that I never really sought out a relationship or anything like that. So I'm thinking I could have a chance at someone here.

One day, she asked me to talk while I walked her to work and she asked me ""So what do you see me as?"" and everything got confirmed from there. I told her I'd love to date her, but she gave me what I knew before: that she can't commit to anything right now, and dates she goes on aren't anything serious to her. She told me it's better we remain as friends, because if she committed right now she would've disappeared on me.

I've been asking many of my close friends what to do, and they've all said different things, but most of them are telling me just to wait it out, be her friend, and don't treat her any differently, but show her you still care (which I'm doing). The most frustrating part is just waiting on this, because I know we have feelings there, but I can't act on them because I want to respect what she says.

I don't exactly know why she isn't ready, but one of my friends said maybe it's because she's insecure or doesn't know what she wants, or because she doesn't want to ruin what we have. She's about ~2 years younger than me (I turn 22 in a few months) and has had only one relationship, to where her ex did something to her that hurt her (unknown what it is to me) and she's told me all this before.

I just, am really frustrated right now. Sometimes it's hard for me to tell if she's still interested or not, but I care about her a lot and I would still like to try and date her. She's what I look for in a partner. We still talk everyday and we still hang out, but it does eat away at me ever since this happened that I can't act on the feelings I have for her.

**TL;DR** I met a girl back in September with the intention of just being friends. We start getting close and we get feelings for each other. She isn't ready to take it to the next level right now and wants to remain friends. Unsure what to do other than what I'm doing now (waiting on her).",13Jan2018,1

67,"Long story short: I have beef with one of my sister’s best friends and I don’t speak to her and she doesn’t speak to me. I have tried fixing the problem because I don’t like holding grudges but to be honest I would be perfectly fine with never speaking to her again but I somehow forgot she comes 5x a week to our house. When I tried squashing the beef she merely looked the other way and said “is someone speaking?”
She has a tendency of saying “who’s that. That’s a nobody” each time my siblings bring me up and they have the audacity to laugh at her joke. This all started after I called her a racist for wrapping a scarf around her head saying she was going to bomb a school. She told me I was nobody to be saying what racism is and after that incident it’s been a reoccurring joke of hers. Each time she comes to my house I just stay in my room and watch Fear The Walking Dead which is fine because I’m trying to finish the series and my free trial is almost up. I stay in my room because I get very uncomfortable when I know someone doesn’t like. Each time I go into my room she laughs or smirks, which I don’t really know if she’s mocking me or what her problem is. I don’t like being confrontational so I just stay in my room. I also feel like a pussy because I shouldn’t be hiding in my house lol but everything she does annoys the hell out of me now, so I rather stay in my room by myself rather than getting in an argument or feeling unwanted. To make matters even worse, she’s part of my posse and if I get into he conversation she just stays quiet and look the other way.

68,"I work night shift, and most of the time I get somewhat depressed and frustrated before the game, because I am so bloody tired. However, I know that all I need to do is listen to some loud music, or move around, or have some coffee to fix it. That is great and all, but that seems somewhat dehumanising. 

Even during the game, my mood and attitude towards my work is so heavily dependent on whether or not I have had caffeine that day. I can be the best on the team, absolutely tearing through my targets, covering half the bloody floor and getting more shifts et cetera, but I have to remind myself that the only reason I am doing so well is because I have had the caffeine.

Injuries and general soreness make me depressed, but I know that is just a mental reflection of my physical health, or rather lack thereof. 

This kind of makes emotions seem somewhat vulnerable, I mean you can get sick all of a sudden. Could you develop a mental illness, could you be diminished in your demeanor, or just become sensitive to trauma at any time?

It also means that there is always an answer to solve what is ailing you, and so your recovery seems somewhat less worthy of pride or applause. 

It just reminds me of the phrase that some people with mental illnesses use to describe medications: happy pills (because mental health is so closely tied to physical responses).",13Jan2018,1
69,"Some background: My best friend of 14 years and I are going on a trip to Japan in a few months. We went once before together about 10 years ago as a part of a study abroad trip and it was incredible (my first time going, her 3rd time going). We're both really interested in Japanese culture and have a great deal of respect for the country, so the trip was a huge deal for us. After we came back from that trip 10 years ago, I promised her I'd go back again once I was successful enough to afford it on my own.

Well, it took me 10 years but I am finally able to afford it, and I can't imagine going without her. I don't know anyone else I'd like to travel with, and I'd have much more fun going with someone. I really do care about my friend a lot, and I was hoping this would reignite her interest in career stuff (our trip 10 years ago was for vocational things related to Japanese culture and art) or at least give her a nice escape for a little while.

Now, my friend and I both have anxiety and deal with depression, but it's something that affects her very badly (to the point where she's never really started her career and makes peanuts...some of it is her fault, some of it is due to her depression, but she never really makes any moves to improve her situation and won't get therapy) and I've had ups and downs at managing it myself. Another issue is that my friend's mother died during a childhood trip to Japan, but she had been back since then on our school trip. 

I'm getting frustrated, because it took me a few months to convince her to actually go with me (I'm paying for all of it, not asking for a cent from her) and then she started to act more excited about it. I just booked our plane tickets and have been doing my research. I told her that I got our tickets and she's being really glum about it. When I asked her what was wrong, she said ""nothing I'm just tired"" but it was obvious that the announcement about the tickets changed her tone and mood entirely. I'm really trying not to get angry at her because I understand all of the baggage, but I did say to her earlier today that I would really appreciate it if she could try to at least tell me outright if she's upset about something. She refuses to help plan the trip and keeps saying stuff like ""Whatever you want."" But then she hems and haws if I tell her about a hotel I've booked. She's been supportive of my career goals and knows I worked hard to get to this point, through some really hard times. Now I'm just so discouraged that after 10 years of working towards this goal, she's acting like it's the worst thing that ever happened to her.

...is my friend an ungrateful jerk, or am I being obtuse and unsympathetic? 
Should I prepare to go with her and just not expect the same level of excitement?
Can you think of any other reasons why she might be acting this way? Thanks in advance.",13Jan2018,1
70,"My school just recently started an app and one of the features is where you can upload pictures showing school spirit or “fun times with friends.” I have a class with one of the teachers that runs the app and she says that some student keeps sending “inappropriate pictures.” It’s not sexual pictures or anything it’s just pictures that don’t follow what the app was intended to do. And students are supposed to make recognizable usernames, but this student called himself “littleJamal” even though no one at the school is named Jamal.

Turns out that “littleJamal” is one of my good friends who just started going to that school. And I can’t tell the teacher it’s him because only 5 of us know that it’s him, meaning that it wouldn’t be too hard to find out which one of us ratted him out. The teacher said the student would be in serious trouble if she found “littleJamal.” If this persists and the teacher doesn’t find out who it is, the app might be taken down, even though many others enjoy the app. Should I just tell the teacher or keep it a secret?

TLDR: Friend is causing trouble on school app. His name makes him anonymous. Teachers don’t know who he is. What should I do?

78,"I am currently wanting to seek out anyone with prior managing experience. I have had a dilemma for the last little bit. I have recently been promoted to a management position and am responsible for about 20 agents. I have prior managing experience but it was in Law Enforcement. I had a very easy time as for most of the time I would tell someone to do something and it was done. We also had a chain of command. Certain items would be handled by myself and was all to my discrepancy.  Things are a little different now. I came from a small town agency to a large corporation. 


I now manage agents that are technical support for an accounting program. I had never worked any type of customer support but the corporation cares about the customers and strives to not only make money but satisfy the customer. The agents either take phone calls or take chats to assist the customers. It was all free for the customer and they can contact us for support on the product. We strive for good service, unlike AT&amp;T or Comcast. That being said, it is easy to motive the agents because they know they are making a difference when the company cares. The calls has no real call flow, so when someone calls in it could be any issue and requires troubleshooting. There really isn’t a script of do this and you get this. You just have to try to mess around with it until you find a way to fix it. 

I started as an agent and moved to the next level between an agent and a manager. I was then promoted to the manager position. As an agent I had the ability to make a bonus from my surveys. So in my business, everything is based off of stats. Think of like a football player, he is judged on how well in the games he does by his yards or passes or tackles. Same goes for my agents, you can’t judge an agent solely on the scores though because it is the customer answering them and they think that it is a survey for the company when really it’s my agents. We aren’t allowed to survey pitch though because that pads the numbers. The agents can make almost 1,700 dollars extra every month in bonuses for getting good scores. My agents make 12.50 an hour in a low income area that it is hard to find a job. When I was an agent I strived to get my bonus. I was proud of having good numbers and showed it off. These agents are almost like they don’t care if they make bonus or not. They are there to get a check and that’s it.


It is currently tax season, this is our most busy season and stressful. Our agents are required to work an hour of overtime throughout the season and drives our moral down. We have a lot of “pussy” agents. They act like the world is owed to them and don’t want to work for anything. I have explained to my team that if they want to move up I need to see gains. I have to see numbers, they can’t interview with me and say “I’m really good at what I do and am the best employee you have” and me look at there scores and not meet standards. I honestly want these guys to work hard for a bonus. I mean you can come to work and make 12.50 an hour but why not make more?? I harp to my agents to try to make more. Have the gumption to work for something but they won’t. I have tried sitting on the floor with them and helping them with there daily work to buddy with them. I have gave threats to them. But they will not change, my company is not very big on terms and wants to keep agents not replace and retrain.


I am seeking advice in how I can motive this team to make scores, to improve morale, and have a good attitude. I tell all my employees that I require only three things; Come to work, do your job, and have a good attitude. These are the core things and I can mold you after that. I need tips or tricks on how to get people to see the bigger picture and get off their ass and do some work. I manage people from 18-50. I have people with bachelors in accounting, software design, business, and communications. I try to buddy with my employees as much as possible and want to see them prosper.

Hello everyone, I have encountered a situation today where I can only ask you guys to help me. To start, today, I was called up to the dean and was spoken to. Never in my life have I been called up to the dean for all 10 years in my school career.

The dean, lets call him Mr. F, called me up and asked me some general questions about ""group chats"". As a high school student, group chats are used as a source of communication and the bonding of students. Of course I reply,as I am in many. To this point where he jumps straight into the question of ""if you have ever said anything inappropriate or racial on the internet"", by any means, I replied yes because I did and I believe many kids my age have used social media to express their emotions as well and at the time I was really shocked that I actually got called up for once in my life to speak to a dean. I also replied that sometimes people say those things to others as some a joke. Here is where it gets controversial, he asked me that if someone said something mean about my parents and said it was a joke, would I be offended? And of course, I said yes, still at the moment of a shock of why I been called up.

 He then takes out his files of records starting my face on the front and ""screenshots"" of group chats indicating what I have said. Although there were many sheets, he only showed me one, I have gone back to this group chat and marked down the whole conversation.

https://imgur.com/gallery/aeABs Orange is my close friend that we made up even after the event that we spoke about. Yellow is another person in the group chat. And black ink is unnecessary context and of course, blue text is me, OP

(believe me that this is the only real controversial thing I have said in the group chat, other than this, other things I have said include no radical slur or just a reply to someone else comment.

Mr F asks me why I have said certain things, I was confused, just a toss of guilt on me even though this was months ago and I have no memory. I took the blame for it because why else would he call me up if I didn't do something wrong and continued let him preach me about respect. He questioned me what ""I give bj to ____ every day"", obviously that is inappropriate but that was only directed at my friend. And what ""Szechuan sauce"" was, I had to explain it to him yet he feels no empathy for what he is acting on me. 

After a long preach about respect as I respectfully listen to him, I was given a task to have my parents come up and meet with him, a suspension might be a punishment.

Here is my question and my statements. It was only IN that group chat, (since other people were fooling around) that I also decided to fool around,but unlike them, I didn't say any racial surls or offensive jokes.Furthermore, the group chat is also filled with many other funny pictures, memes, so I did not take into consideration that there might be other people offended by this even though my comments are only targeted to people that I know won't be offended, aka my friends. Is there a way I can ""fight"" this, I find this socially unfair, that the dean of my school just decide to pressure me in the guilt of something that (after I reviewed it) didn't seem to be wrong. I do not mind pleading and apologizing to the person that got offended and ""ratted"" me out because I genuniually feel I didn't do anything wrong.

If anyone knows me personally, I should be one of the last people to be taught respect. In other groupchats that are more formatted for homework questions, I always end my comments in thank you and courtesy. In my generation, I feel like this type of social norm is lacking and I try my best to show people that our generation isn't that bad, that there are still people that want to have a better future. I have had people look at me as a alien when I offer a seat on the subway to elderlies, I have had elderlies who thought I was robbing them because I offered to help carry their luggage up the stairs. (Note: not all the people I help acted in this way, many people were actually really grateful for my work and thanked me, I'm taking certain scenarios to clarify my point) 

I have some pictures that show that I show my respect and gratitude for people in my school in other group chats, I want to show it to the dean during my meeting yet I don't want to be punished for things I didn't do. Even in the school, I always greet my teachers with good mornings and have a nice day, I can ask any of them and they would say I  do say that to them every day which is more reason that I am not to be seen as the bad kids unlike other kids who does way worst things that I do. How the dean just decided to guilt me for one event I have done (that I don't even see anything offensive), without checking my background history, what kind of person I am and the things I do.  it really irritates me that I'm the one being put on the spot for literally acting ""wrong"" for once and might suffer a punishment. This social injustice really makes me upset and I want to make things right. Thank you for your time reading this and please give me your opinion/advice.

tl;dr  I got called up to the dean today first time in my life after 10+ years of school, as a respectful person I try to be, I am preached about being disrespectful just because of some things I said in a group chat (which I observe to be not offensive at all to other people but that's an opinion; check the link above).Yet he guilts me with evidence against me without understanding any of my background information, what kind of person I am and the other things I say. I am to show up to a meeting with the dean with my parents to confess the things I said, but I observed my other group chat activities that show I am respectful and teachers that know I am a respectful kid, should I bring it to the table and comfort the dean for punishing wrong? Incorrect social justice?",13Jan2018,2

when i was younger i moved around a lot and it summed up to me having no friends

i lost a lot of my personality because i was judged and bullied in middle school. 
i have been cold hearted and robotic ever since, 

until i met a great friend online. ive hurt her by lying to her about who i was because i didnt think i could have genuine friends. recently, 2017 of september i told her the truth because of the guilt that built up inside me, after FOUR years of LYING. i hate myself for it everyday i have to live with myself. ive hurt her so much and i love her the most and she is one of the most important people in my life, and im so contradicting im a constant confusion to her and i USED to always remind her that she can leave me if she is hurt by me more than she desires to be my friend.

but she insists to stay. i love her so much. two months ago she told me she loved me (romantically?) and i was really shocked, in a good way. i was so confused on how she could love someone like me. she was afraid that i wouldnt want to  be her friend anymore because she had feelings for me, i reassured her that i wouldnt abandon her for such a dumb reason haha but i never responded to her feelings bc:

1) shes 2 years younger than me, but its not a maturity thing?? ive known her for so long and she dreams about being in an ideal relationship which she DESERVES but im afraid shes acting on a whim and doesnt love me. i truly love her and it would hurt me if it was just her going through a phase. 

and then the SECOND time she told me she had feelings for me, she had been replying to me less and less and stopped spending time with me so much so i reached out to her with my worries (which i never do, i hate talking about MY emotions and shit with how reserved i am but i love her because she is the only person in the world who has gotten me to be vulnerable) she told me she stopped talking to me so often because she has feelings for me and she doesnt know what to do with herself

i was so cold hearted and angry and frustrated that i replied, like the asshole that i am,

""okay. but loving me, will that fix your depression? (shes diagnosed to be clinically depressed, and in the past shes claimed WILD and UNTRUE things like i can cure her depression by simply talking to her, which i knew wasnt true but i believed her because im an idiot.) will that fix your ambition issues? i love you, but i cant fix the fact you constantly worry about your family, that on some days you feel like shit regardless if its a good day or not.""

 she replied with a short text saying,

""Youre right."" 

AND BEING OF THE FEMALE GENDER I KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT

I HAVE UPSET HER AND I HATE MYSELF AAAAAAA

SHE HAS CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND U WANT TO BRING THAT UP 2 HER FACE???? SHE HAS TO LIVE WITH HERSELF EVERYDAY U INSENSITIVE FUCK 

ok anyway

now she is dating a man that im p sure she has known for 2 weeks, that she met online and he lives in england which is rad

tbh he sounds like a nice guy and when she told me this great news she said, 

""I have a bf. Its CRAZY.""

if i wrote the english language i wouldnt define it as crazy haha but thats one way to put it!!!!!!!

anyway i was beginning to open up to her for the past two months i have been falling in love with her more and more hahah wellshiiiit, 

and yeah she does not feel the same anymore and i was right

i guess i was a whim

which is cool, i never wanted her to stoop down to my level to be with me 

she deserves so much better and now she has her disney prince xd

i just never realized how much it would hurt u kno

the end

i am a loser, please reach out to me if u give.any fucks or if u want to laugh at me because im laughing at myself tbh

any advice on what to do with my mess of emotions and how to stop existing thanks

any comments or questions please kill me

thanks if u actually read all of this

100,"Sorry long idk how much info is needed...
Hello I have two cats that are very cute. Unfortunately one (shamu) is very mean to my other cat (hosoon or *taiga*) . They were both stray cats. 
B.G...
Shamu was found by my friend and when they took her to the humane society she was about to be put down for being too aggressive. But my friend called me and I took her in. It took several weeks but she ended up being a very loving and loyal cat to me. 
Almost a year later I took in hosoon.
She is the complete opposite. Hosoon was found by a jogger that lives in my complex and she was following her and meowing. So we decided to take her in because she was cute and very vocal. She is also claustrophobic.

So their personality is opposite and shamu would bully hosoon a lot and hiss at her and stuff. While hosoon is just running away , meowing, and trying to be friendly to shamu. But after few months they got used to each other and shamu would tolerate hosoon, only bullying her once a while. Which I would scold shamu for. 

But recently I moved and they went from indoor —&gt; outdoor cats. Hosoon escaped their enclosure several times after few days so I would let her out and in everyday. Later shamu got used to her surrounding so I left the door open. Shamu is always around property while hosoon goes off somewhere else but comes back everyday. 

PROBLEM:
after the move in shamu became super aggressive to hosoon and became very needy. Just by the sound of my voice in the House shamu would meow and stuff. And when I would leave and play with both of them she would hit hosoon just because she’s walking past her. Hosoon is always running away whenever shamu makes eye contact. But that’s sad because I want hosoon to feel comfortable when she’s at “home”. And I thought it would be better because now they would have more space. 

So idk what’s causing my cat’s larger aggression to my other cat and how to fix it. 

TLDR: my cat hates my other cat even more despite moving them from an enclosure to outdoors. Pls help me fix this and tell me why. ",13Jan2018,5

At first glance I thought it was one of my friends pulling a prank on me, but after I took a closer look I could see that it was a middle-aged, probably Turkish man. I couldn't stand seeing him there, so I decided to help him back on his feet.

He thanked me and asked me to roll him a cigarette for him, because it would 'sober him up'. ""No problem"", I said, and I rolled the worst cigarette I could. He told me it was wrong and he tried to fix it, but after a minute or two he said he didn't need it as much.

I told him he should walk back home to get some sleep, he could lean on his bicycle so he wouldn't fall. After two or three steps I saw he couldn't walk straight at all, so I joined him in his journey ahead.

I kept talking to him to try and get him to stick with me. He fell a couple of times and I helped him back on his feet. When we got to his house he thanked and hugged me and asked me for my name, and I asked him about his. He told me he is depressed and that the Jack Daniels helped him forget about it. I said that I hoped he wouldn't need it as much in the future. I kept repeating that he had to lock his doors so he wouldn't forget it, and I left after I heard he entered him home.

So now I have his address and name, he is indeed Turkish. I'm not sure if I should go back at all, maybe he won't remember me and think that I'm trying to ridicule him or something. What should I do?

112,"I'm a Taiwanese Canadian that graduated with a BA from a university in Japan. Through all my life I'd had to manage between choosing the option that still meets some of my parent's expectations, which has thus caused me to feel really hopeless and lost. The thing is, now that I have a BA my parents told me that I could go do what I want. This has created two major problems: 
First, my dream was always to study in America, in a state with minor asian influences. Right now I feel like I'm still not prepared for a Masters as the Japanese university's classes did not go in depth at all. I honestly felt like I learned nothing besides social skills there. However I am also told by family acquaintances that since I already have a BA from Japan, I can no longer get a VISA to study for another bachelor or even an associate degree. How true is this? Did I get screwed over?
Second: I don't really know what I want to do with my life. All this time I feel like I've been just wearing a mask, doing what I am told. Part of the reason why I am so dead set on America is because I see it as a land of opprotunities. A chance to get away from these Asian influences that tell me who I am and rediscover myself. Any ideas how I can get started on this? I'm honestly partially hoping that I'd discover it once I get away from these influences.

For those wondering: Why not study in Canada? I suppose that would also be an option. I guess I'd be willing to go back there (my parents moved back to Taiwan immediatly after we got Canadian citizenship) but I am kind of more attached to America as my elementary school -&gt; highschool education was at an international American school.

116,"So quite a bit has happened recently. I had been talking with a girl and at this point we were borderline dating. I was happy. Well, until this past week. 

Now there are other boys, who she claims to be only friends with. These days i feel like she’s disregarded me for them. We began to not talk that much, though communication should be an important part of a relationship. I began to worry, seeing as she was really enthusiastic - almost flirty - with them, while i was being met with 1 word answers or general nothingness. 

Recently we had an argument about this. Though it began as a talk, it quickly spiralled down. She had a go at me for not really trusting her, while emphasising that they were just friends. She also said that the communication problem was because she wasn’t open or the type of person to talk about there problems or be talkative. It didn’t quite make sense, seeing as she’d happily talk with these other boys. She’s also extremely emotionally sensitive from what i’ve gathered, and this whole argument put our relationship on the line. She’s just ignoring me, while posting so called “indirects” on other social media which made me feel pretty guilty about having confronted her about this. I’m pretty annoyed at myself for having started all of this, even though i was getting worried and a little stressed before so about that lack of communication and those boys.

I don't lack confidence, I don't feel like there is fear that is holding me back, I just feel like I never have the correct response to keep a conversation flowing. I tend to either not have a reply at all, or have a reply that just doesn't add anything new, as I feel nothing I have to say is worth saying.

This didn't used to be much of a problem to me, I basically lost almost all of my friends years ago and the couple I still have are fairly understanding and expect this, as do my parents. However, since starting a new job my new colleague have regularly pointed out how quiet I am, and I get the feeling that they find working with me tedious due to how uninteresting I am to be around. I'm often working away from home so I have long drives to try and fill with talking, and evening meals with co-workers. Not to mention the actual work days.

It's gotten to the point that recently, I won't initiate a conversation with anyone if I can avoid it and I am actively avoiding social situations just to avoid the awkward silences and blank stare I tend to give people when I've got no idea what they're talking about or what to say next. I can feel myself getting distant from my friends, family and colleagues, yet I'm not sure whether I even care or not anymore.

I was considering seeing some kind of therapist or counselor about this (among other things) but I'm not sure how successful that would be since I don't feel that my problem is rooted in anxiety or nerves.

They did not have a list of their members, did not have up-to-date contact information, their website hadn’t been updated in two years and contained inaccurate information, and many local businesses had zero interest in joining the group because they did not see value to their membership. 

I started at the job in earnest at the beginning of this week. First I used the information I had to create a list of who I thought might be members. I also created a second list of potential members. I then got to work calling each person on the list to update contact information - in about a quarter of the cases I was using google to find a phone number and going from there. Next I redesigned the registration form and list of benefits so that I could send these forms out to the current and potential members as 2018 fees are now due. As part of the same document (and on the request of the board) I also included a three page survey with some fairly general questions designed to help us understand the needs and wants of the membership. I uploaded this document to a closed Facebook group for the board and asked for feedback, and I texted my friend to call it to her attention.  This was Monday

On Tuesday my friend replied with some feedback. She made three points, one was helpful but the other two didn’t make sense to me so I called her. We both agreed on that conversation that the second point was a misunderstanding on her part and that left the third item. This was that I had listed as a benefit that local businesses would have a link on our website. She didn’t want me to include this as I hadn’t yet updated the site and “what if I couldn’t really do it”.   I thought it was an important point to include so I suggested that I take a few hours to spend on the website and make sure I could do what I was claiming. She agreed. A few hours later I contacted her to let her know I had learned how to do this and already created a new page with links to ten of the businesses. I asked if I now had her go ahead to say we could link to local businesses and she replied saying “you don’t need my go-ahead”. 

I continued to update contact information on Wednesday and to improve the website while I waited to give board members a chance to look over the membership benefit list, registration form, and survey I’d posted on the Facebook group. During this time I texted my friend and commented that I hadn’t received any input on the survey. She did not reply. She also did not reply when I sent her a message asking her to please look over the member list and provide any contact info she may know for those businesses that I could not find by using google. She also did not reply when I texted her to say that one of the local business owners had a promotional idea. 

Thursday I sent an email to all current and potential members with the registration package. 

Friday morning I received a text from my friend asking if I had sent out the survey. I replied that I had. Her reply was “what??? You weren’t supposed to send that out without showing me!!!!”  Now I found this quite confusing as the survey had been available for her to see for 4 days, she had given me feedback on the document but hadn’t expressed any reserves about the survey portion despite my specifically calling it to her attention, and the last thing I’d heard from her was that I didn’t need her go-ahead. I said I thought she’d seen the survey as she’d given me feedback on the first few pages of the document. 

She then replied that she had called me and told me not to proceed without her go ahead. At this point I was getting frustrated with both her refusal to be accountable for what was clearly her own error in either not actually noticing the survey in the first place or not communicating that she had any reserves whatsoever and also with the tone she was taking with me, which I did not find was appropriate for a professional colleague. I told her I had not proceeded without her approval and that I didn’t like the attitude she was taking with me. 

I didn’t hear from her for the rest of the day but when I did it was a text saying that I am not to proceed any further with my work and that I also should not meet with the local business person as scheduled on Monday to work on her promotional idea, and that I am to communicate with another member of the board from now on. She later stated that I would be instructed on my “parameters” by the other board member. 

I told her that I thought this was a terrible way to treat a friend and she replied that she was trying to save our friendship by not talking to me about this further. 

But. Right now I really don’t know that I want to continue with either the job OR the friendship.  I am so angry at what I perceive to be my friend’s inability to admit her own error and her insistence on blaming me, her hostile tone, and her action in choosing to speak to other board members rather than calling me to hash things out. On the other hand, until now she has always been a good friend and has been someone that has been kind and generous in the past. I’ve trusted her through some difficult recent times in my life and I hate to lose that. 

I’m not sure what to do. Thoughts? Anyone?",13Jan2018,6
126,"Hello, I'm 15 and currently in 9th grade, I live in Philippines and I'm an A student, studying feels like I'm not feeling happy about it, it feels more like you're controlled, and not free, until you grow old, I just want to drop out of school and go to work instead, rather than going to school, plus working, and you're not happy about it, and this cycle repeats itself to other people. I feel like I just want to break that cycle and be successful that I want to be but using another method to be like that, why I feel this? Because school system is slowly tearing down, not all things are being taught in there, the system was based on memorization and high grading standards, schools only teach history, and other stuff that aren't needed when you work (depends on the course you went into) and not living independently such as how to pay the bills, and how the government works, I remain curious about stuff like that but it slowly disappears because of the pressure and force learning happening inside the school (such as exams), I just want to drop out real good and be homeschooled into the subjects that I want to learn rather than learning the stuff I don't needed, plus, you need to increase your creativity, that's the point school's been lacking of, you need creativity to live, and survive, the school is lacking of creativity since their system is going down and basing on to memorization and wants us to be controlled by the government or companies like robots, that's what I wanted to say, do I need high grades and finish schooling to be successful?",13Jan2018,1

Because I took the job knowing I wouldn't stay I would like to give them as much notice as possible so I don't leave them in the lurch, but given that there are only 8 months until I go I also want to have been here long enough that it doesn't feel like I only just got here (so the training hasn't been wasted) or that I clearly never planned to stay in the first place. I want a good reference from them and I don't want me colleagues to feel like I've been lying to them about my long-term plans (even though I have).

132,"Hi. I'm 22 years old graduated in Diploma in Multimedia Design a year ago. I'm living with my parents and have a designer job in an ad agency near my home in which I began to work straight after I graduated. The university that I graduated with Diploma is also not far away from my home. The job doesn't pay a lot but It's challenging, I get to learn stuffs working there. The pay is enough for me to covering up some basic expenses of the house and also saving up some money. Beside working, I'm constantly trying to improve myself in learning 3D visualization and music production in which I have serious interests in.

Last month, I have a wild thought of leaving the job to get a design degree in a city 300 miles from home because I think that having a degree will help me to get a better job prospect in the future, and also I'll be able to learn everything I want in the free time. My parents are also supportive about this decision.

Yesterday, I tried to go to the university to inquire about the program (Degree in Interactive Media Design) to know that the fees for the degree program is very expensive and my current saving doesn't help but to use my parents hard earn money. I also tried to walk around the city but I just couldn't cope with the strangeness of the city and feeling lonely and lost. I keep telling myself before I will be able to adapt if I study here. But I'm constantly telling myself to go home when I was there. Also if i get to study there I'll go into the second year of degree which I join students who are already there for a year or two. I don't know if I will adapt if I get the chance to study here... 

Does it worth it to get the degree? Or should I just stay where I'm comfortable and continue pursuing what I like (3D visualization and Music production) while working as a designer full time? 

When I'm on the bus travelling home I teared up a little looking out at the bus window thinking of my parents, I don't want to waste their money and looking them working tirelessly just to support my wild decision. I'm also fear of going to an unfamiliar city in which I've no friends or relatives. I know it's silly and I'm already 22 years old. But these things are really hard for me. 

When I back home I got slightly regretted telling this decision to my parents and friends because they assume I'll go and study for degree in the near future. I don't know what can I do...

138,"Picture this, it's one of the coldest day of the year so far, the bus driver is 18 minutes late. Finally it arrives, the asshole clearly sees me waving my card, bu still drives past me. I tried running on the unplowed sidewalk to catch up to it but he refuses to stop. Things fell out of my pocket while running, I lost many of the object I bought and I broke my iPod screen after it fell out. The bus was practically empty as well, so he had no excuse to do this.

This is far from the first time this has happened. This black dude was running full speed to catch a bus, it wasn't mine but I walked toward it, pretending to want to get on so that the driver would stop the bus.  Once he realized what I was doing, he started moving again, so I ran towards the door again, prompting the driver to stop, and the black guy managed to get on this time. The bastard would have kept going had I taken no action.

On an unrelated note, these buses are terrible quality.  They are rarely cleaned, if ever, there are questionable stains on most of the seats, everything smells like piss, so its also a health safety problem. For all of these reasons and more,  I want to take action against them. I don't know what I should do, I don't think a couple or reviews will change anything.

But i really, really hate it every day and i don't know what to do about it.  
I worked in retail for some years and it was the same then. So i figured i need to find a new job, maybe things get better then. I started working at my new job last August. I am technical support working in the hotline for a big company.  
My colleagues are very nice and funny (well, most of them), our shifts aren't that bad and the job isn't that bad either. I like that i can sit on my chair the whole day and just talk on the telephone rather than dealing with customers in a shop.  
But starting sunday afternoon i dread going there, having to get up and do things i really don't wanna do. And every morning the pattern repeats itself.  
Sometimes i wish i had just a minor accident, maybe breaking a leg or so, just that i don't have to work for a while.  
And it's not like i got so much stuff to do in my free time, mostly i sit on the couch, knitting while watching series. Or playing computer games and stuff.  
I have been depressed for most of my life and i know it's maybe that. Although i think i got my depression under control the last years and i really am better than some years ago. I tried medication again two years ago but it just doesn't help me. Why should it, as it doesn't help with the root of my problems?  

I think i really need to find something that i *really* like to do. I have started multiple apprenticeships and several jobs i just kinda slipped into. But nothing excites me, not at one of those jobs i thought ""well, i could do this until i die"".  
I would love to work with animals and i am thinking about getting an education on physical therapy for dogs and/or horses. But i have to pay for the education and money is a big problem of mine. Also it takes some time to learn it and after that start a career out of it but i am soooo in need for a change *now*.  

I really don't know what to do about this whole ordeal. My bf is getting really annoyed with me, too, as i start whining about my job every sunday. I can understand him though, i can't stand myself either in that case.

Sorry about that wall of text, i think i had to get it off my chest a bit. Maybe you guys have some advice for me. How do you deal with your jobs and daily routine?

144,"I recently bought a very expensive pair of designer glasses ($450) from the shop that my family has been going to for over 20 years.

They are titanium frames, and are very high quality, essentially indistinguishable from the actual thing.

There are a few reasons I suspect they are fake.

1. The authentication card says that it was produced in Marcolin, Italy, but the glasses say Made in Japan on the inside of the arm.

2. The print/font of the card is thinner than the authentic ones.

3. The most damnning piece of evidence: The barcode / serial number that was on the side of the box that the glasses came in does not correspond to the glasses I purchased. In fact I managed to find the exact same barcode / serial number on a designer eyeglass review/unboxing video on youtube: I presume that whoever made these very high quality fakes copied the barcode/serial off this video.

Like the title says, I’ve been with my boyfriend for just under 4 years (he’s 24 I’m 23). At the beginning we were earning the same (both crappy retail jobs barely paying anything) and we split most stuff, and he paid for some extras and bits. He passed his driving test and we got a car (both 50-50 paying for it), but it was a banger and needed a lot of work. He paid for a lot, a bit more than me as I had a lot of debt (he wasn’t 100% aware), and it made him quite tight with money so I started paying for stuff more, since he barely had any money. 


Fast forward a couple of years, he’s had a different crappy car where he lost money on again so he was still tight on money, but now he has a better car so it’s not draining money, he has a better job than me (£200 or so more a month) and yet I still feel like I’m paying for everything. I work away from home, so I’m there 3 nights a week, I generally buy food for those nights. He obviously pays for his food the rest of the week but he’s quite frugal and won’t spend much. He also doesn’t budget or watch his spending too much, and doesn’t want to meal plan or anything like that. 


He’s never not given me anything if I’ve asked for it, and I know if I ever needed money I could ask him and he’s always borrowing money to his family and everything, but after looking at my budget and working out that I’m spending £50 odd a week on food when there’s only two of us is making me feel slightly crazy.

I recently moved into a new apartment two/three days ago, I'm renting a single room in the apartment and there's another girl who lives here too. Since I'm only going to be here until may, no deposit was required and I paid the 500 rent on my moving in date.

 I noticed after the first night that there's a smell of smoke in the apartment quite a lot, and I can feel it in my chest too.

157,"Me and my wife have been together for 8 years. Since then any vacation we have taken centered around visiting her family. I made a comment around 5 years ago mentioning that I'd like to take a vacation that doesn't include family for once, she agreed and we moved on (never happened). About 3 years ago we moved about 2,000 miles away from the closest relative. Since then various family members (on my side only) made the trip to come see us and the kids (my mother 1 time, my sister 3 times,my father 2 times). Not a single member of her family has made any effort to make plans to come.  Within the first year that we moved we made the trip back with 3 children to go see her family. We didn't take any vacation the year after, and now a year later she has just told me shes making plans for our vacation to go visit with her family. So out of 8 years together all 6 of the vacations that we have taken have all centered around her relatives...

I told her last night that I'm not staying quiet anymore and that I wanted to take a family vacation with just us and the kids to somewhere of my choosing that would not involve either of out family's. She instantly walked away from me, I followed and said I really want to talk about this. She began to cry and raised her voice saying I wasn't allowing her to see her family. I told her that's obviously not the truth and she was putting words in my mouth. For the first time in 8 years I simply wanted to go somewhere to relax and do some sight seeing at a location I had never been to. Then she just clammed up and wouldn't speak.

Now her family isn't warm and loving to me at all, only her grandmother and father will even speak to me. I don't know why but everyone else just likes to ignore my presence, I've mentioned this to her numerous times. I remember one instance where we walked in the door and her mother said ""Hi kids!"" I followed behind and said ""hello"" and silence from her... My wife walks in and she shouts ""hi Sue"". Not a big deal but my mother in law has talked to me maybe 5 times in 8 years, not exactly the kind of thing I like to travel 2000 miles for.

Now with all that aside, I just want to go on a vacation with my kids and wife for the first time to somewhere special. I feel like she's putting the stress of her family not visiting on my shoulders instead of theirs where it belongs. It's not like they're incapable of taking vacations either. Last time we were there 4 of her family members left to go to the neighboring state from us 3 days after we arrived... I feel like she's being unreasonable and trying to make me feel like an asshole for wanting something of my own.

What should I do?

I really don't want to take separate vacations. We can't really afford to do 2 vacations in a year.

158,"I am a 21 year old single lesbian and I have always wanted to be a mother. I don't think I could feel fulfilled in life without having kids. I'd like to have a child between the ages of 28-33. This gives me time to get my finances/career in order (which is a must because apparently the fertility testing that comes with artificial insemination can be upwards of $10k) and figure out my living situation.

 It seems my best bet would be artificial insemination as opposed to adoption, because the loopholes I'd have to jump through to adopt and the financial burden of adoption seem too daunting. It's not that I am opposed to adopting, but I think I'd like to have a biological child and then foster in the future.

I don't care much about finding a partner. I've been researching Single Mothers By Choice and it seems entirely more plausible than searching for my soul mate. Of course, my child would not be expected to make up for a lack of that sort of love. I just have a desire to nurture, and I would love to help another human being grow and develop to come into their own personhood.

162,"2018 started poorly for me. Poorly is a bad word, it started HORRIBLY. Anxiety from inferiority complex finally hitted hard and I've thought about suicide more than ever to the point that should I steal a cartridge from shooting practise or cut my wrists with my jaeger knife. I decided otherwise and finally got me some help.

I'm currently in military service so I told about my thoughts to my  companys commander, who got the wheels rolling. Next week I'm going to talk about to few doctors and I'm going to push them to change my class from A to E (in my country your eligibilityclass is A (normal/perfect), B (minor helth issues) C (no military service in peace time), E (interruption in militaryservice for a set time) T (danger to yourself and to people around you)). This means that I'll get home almost half a year earlier as my service was set to one year. 

I got into a university to study CS before army. You usually start in autumn but you can also start in january. This means that I have almost nine months before my freshman year starts. 

To the question: I'm not sure what to do during the nine months. My top 1 priority is to get my head straight to I can focus on studies in the future. But I'm not sure what else to do. Should I try to work, even with the risk of anxiety etc or just try to focus on myself to get everything straight. I don't really know. Maybe work can help, maybe not. If you have been in a similiart situation please tell me your story, it might give me so thoughts on how to proceed.

165,"I’m 14 years old. In the last three-quarter year, I’ve managed to turn my life
around for better. I’ve lost almost 30lbs (from 5’3” 155 lbs. to 5’8” 125 lbs.)
and changed my attitude towards a lot of people. But one thing stayed, my social
anxiety. I am terrible at choosing topics to talk to people and it takes me a
long time to open up to others, but I’m very social with my friends. Also, I’ve
gotten depressed because I thought girls, whom I’ve previously known would
magically start to like me (spoiler: didn’t happen) and since changing so
severely, I don’t have an accurate self-image. I still think of myself as a fat
and in not any way attractive guy.

And there’s a girl from the other class. She’s not the typical attention-seeking
teen. She’s not seen as attractive by my mates, but I have a crush on her. We
rarely talk (and if we do, it ends soon or stalls), but she seems nice. I’ve
noticed her checking me out. She noticed my backpack not being zipped in,
although we didn’t pay attention to each other. Today we both went to an event,
I saw her alone quite a few times but I had no idea how to start a conversation
with her so I chickened out. But when I left, although she was speaking to her
friends, said bye. Only she has noticed me leaving. Also, she glanced towards me
multiple times.

I missed my best opportunity in a long time. I want to befriend her (at least)
since we have quite a lot in common. But I’m also worried about misreading her
signs, she might be just attentive and too kind. And I’m not brave enough to
make the first move. What should I do? How can I get her to make the first move?
How can I start? How can I get comfortable and brave around her? I know we could have a really good friendship and relationship.
She’s just so perfect and similar in most ways to me.

Edit: not introverted,socially anxious

169,"I’m aware that there are countless amounts of posts that are similar to the one I’m creating but I feel as if I should make one personal to me. I think it’ll also be beneficial for me to put my thoughts into writing (or at least attempt to). Props to anyone who actually reads this mess 

I’m a junior in high school and the year is about halfway over. I’m a fairly introverted and reserved person but I still have managed to become a pretty popular kid with a good amount of friends. My friend group changes every so often but I always kinda figure it. The part of socializing where my social awkwardness and my shyness really take a toll on me is when I actually have to/want to meet new people. I’m aware that I am not alone in this issue and that my problem is in no way unique. 

Moving on

So in one of my classes there’s this girl that I’m dying to at least just get to know. She’s a senior and the school year is already halfway over so I’m really running low on time to do this. She’s very attractive in my eyes and incredibly smart.  She doesn’t have any friends in the class (English if anyone was wondering) so she usually just keeps to herself unless we’re having a class discussion or something. She is by no means “popular” (not that it matters to me) and many of my friends would be completely shocked if they found out I was obsessing over her (which again does not matter to me to a certain extent). I’m honestly in awe of her intelligence and if I were to create conversation with her I’d assume I would use that as a conversation topic. But the problem I have is I that cannot bring myself to talk to her

I only see her a couple times a week and for the past four months I’ve just been waiting for an opportunity where we are forced to talk to each other (like being paired up on an assignment) and it’s driving me crazy. I’ve come to realize that this is a horrible way to approach this and that I’m most likely going to have to take the initiative. However, I feel like there are so many things in the way of me doing this (I struggle with anxiety shit and honestly I could just be creating this in my head but I don’t know). First off, we have assigned seats in this class and we are basically sitting as far away from each other as possible. Second, this class is the only time throughout the entire day I can see her and often times she doesn’t show up (I’m not sure as to why especially because of how smart she is). Third, she either stays after class to talk to the teacher or she leaves immediately (she sits by the door) and by the time I get out of the class (even if I avoid conversation with my friends and stuff) she’s gone. This obviously isn’t the case all the time and there are perfect opportunities to talk to her I just can’t bring my awkward ass to going up to her and getting her attention and fumbling around with words to create somewhat of a conversation and getting her number. She doesn’t have social media by the way so I can’t just dm her or something.

There is probably much more to this that I’m leaving out because I’m so anxious to put this post out on reddit but I don’t knows what to do here. My absolute biggest fear is just never taking the opportunity to talk and having the school year end and me never seeing this girl again. Makes me sick thinking about. This shit is seriously taking a toll on my life. It’s making me miserable and I’m pushing aside everything for this one girl I haven’t talked to before.",13Jan2018,1

Now, she is my girlfriend of 3 months and her lack of trust is me is just ridiculous.

Last week she saw some phone calls at my cell phone and got crazy about it. I said the truth, told her that I didnt know who was calling me, that it was some mistaken calls but she didnt believed me.

She knows my cellphone password and keep roaming trhough my phone in order to find some proof that I am a cheater, but I am not.

She does not treat me as an equal. I tried to hold her hand while we were walking across the mall and she dodged my hand.

186,"Looking for advice on how to kick a sociopath/psychopath from house and cut off as much contact as possible. If anyone has any similar experiences of any advice on this, it would be really appreciated!

So the ASPD person in question is my brother in law who is in his mid 40s. He used have a very highly successful job but about 10 years ago, he quit his job and moved back home to his mother’s house claiming to have MS and a host of other illnesses over time. He has made his rounds at the top hospitals across the country, spoke to multiple doctors about his “condition” but all have said he is in perfect health. He still maintains that he is ill and continues to live at his mother’s house. During the 10 years or so that he has been there, he got himself a GF and has had a child with her (after claiming to my husband, his younger brother, that he has an urgent need to pass on his genes...so real creepy) who now both live in his mother’s house as well. He doesn’t have a steady job and does not contribute to any sort of house bills or help with anything at all for his mother. 

In fact all he does is terrorize the family and try to gain control of every situation possible. His mother is terrified to be home most of the time and is extremely stressed out, and has been having health issues from this. He is destroying the relationships he has with his other siblings and their spouses. He tries to gain control and manipulate people to dominate. There are countless examples of this (10 years worth!!!) but I won’t get into the details here, but feel free to ask me if you feel like the details are necessary to hear to give me adequate advice. 

My husband and I live about two hours away from his mother’s and because of the distance we can remove ourselves a bit from the situation and stay safe. The rest of his siblings all live in the same small town as their mother and ASPD brother so they get the brunt of the abuse. Most of them do not realize or do not accept that he could have something like ASPD which would explain his actions. 

My question is this: does anybody have any advice on what steps we can take to get him out of his mother’s house? The mother is weak both physically and mentally and it is hard to get her to stand up to him and be firm but she is getting to the end of her rope, so we’re hoping she’ll be able to stick to a plan if we can come up with something. Getting the police involved or anything like that is very unlikely. We’ve obviously already told him ourselves to move out and get on with his life but he just fights back claiming that lots of people live at home with their mothers (?!?). I’m hoping for a more cunning solution where we can somehow manipulate him into moving out without him realizing that we’re putting this idea in his head or that we have set these things in to motion. Is this impossible? Does anybody have any good ideas? We’re getting quite desperate here as we fear for the mother’s health.

187,"Well, this is going to be a long post, but I appreciate anyone who sticks it out to the end.  There are 3 major characters besides me in this story: A (My ""ex""-girlfriend), E (Her first boyfriend after me), and J (Her current boyfriend).  A and I started dating February 16, 2016, and those years were the happiest either of us had been in a long time.  We started dating because we were lonely, but over time we gradually became more attached to one another.  Things were great for the first few months, but I had to go to college about 4 hours away, I am a year older than her, so she was still finishing high school.

I was sure college was going to be the end of us, but we persevered.  But not without a cost, we grew more distant, and hit something of a rut.  We'd been dating about a year at that point and I started to become complacent: I took her for granted.  Summer came and with it I started becoming a bad boyfriend.  I neglected her, and was very selfish.  But I was too stupid to notice anything was wrong, so I didn't.

September comes.

She goes to a college not far from our hometown so the drive isn't much worse.  I go to visit her on labor day, we spend a few nights together and blind as I was everything seemed fine.  I went back on a Tuesday, and was single by Wednesday.  She called me to tell me she wanted to ""take a break"", that come winter we could decide what we wanted to do.  I really didn't have a say in the matter, so it happened.

Immediately she started dating E, this hurt.  I felt cheated on, emotionally at least, and I was lied to.  When we talked about this break I asked her if there was someone else.  She said no.  The next few weeks I spiraled into a depression, I called the suicide hotline, I resumed therapy, I got help.  I did not recover though.

It's an obsessive thing, not A, but knowing that maybe I could've prevented this by being better.  So I obsessed, I began changing in every way I could think of, working out, better hygiene, more mature style, hair, you name it.  It wasn't about A anymore, it was about me, an obsession needs a compulsion, and mine was to do anything I could to hedge my bets come December.

It had been 3 weeks, E just dumped A.  I was on vacation with some friends, and she called me.  She told me she regretted breaking up with me, that she made a mistake, and that she was sorry.  I forgave her, and offered to get back together, she declined.  I asked her if there was someone else, she said no.

She lied.

Some context needs to be said about both of us.  Neither of us are the healthiest of people, I have OCD (mostly obsessive about uncertainty), and she has depression and anxiety.  She admits to dating people because she can't stand being alone.  She admits to dating me because her life was a mess, few friends, and a turbulent home.  She also never developed emotional awareness, she has a very hard time understanding, and articulating her thoughts and feelings.  Therefore, when she needs to make a decision she stalls until something else comes along forcing her to choose.

A couple weeks pass, it's November.  After speaking with my therapist I ask A a series of short questions, because of how much trouble she has answering broad questions.  This is when I learn about J, fool me once...  This hurt me so much that I just stopped talking to her for a couple weeks.  Those weeks were not any easier or harder than before, they were just lonely.  But my thoughts got the best of me, and around Thanksgiving I texted her.

Things were simple again, at least as simple as they were, and it stayed that way until mid-December.  I get a call at night, it's A.  She had seen pictures of my sister's graduation on Facebook and it made her start crying.  I asked her if this happens often, and she says she cries when she thinks of me or my family.  This is when things got complicated.  She told me that she isn't sure if she made the right decision to leave me, which I told her I think she did given how awful I was to her.  She then told me of all the reasons she still cares about me, and how she still isn't sure how she feels about me.  This conversation lasts a few hours without much progress.

December 21, her winter break starts, she comes to my house to return some books.  I ask her if we can talk and we do.  4 hours later, with all sorts of things discussed, ranging from our situation how she feels about me, how she feels about J, her mental health, her parents divorce, the future, school, jobs, just everything.  We cried for some of it, and it felt good to cry with her after all this time.  At the end though, it seems that once again it was all for nothing.  A couple days later she texts me saying that she came to my house to break up with me once and for all, but after we talked she had seen how I've changed, and now she's more conflicted than ever.

The next week or so we talk back and forth, asking questions and answering them.  It feels like we are getting closer, and for the first time in a while I have hope.  New Years Eve comes around, and she's having a party.  Through our relationship we built a lot of mutual friends so all of them are coming.  But given how hard it is for me to be around her I decided not to go.

She texts me, ""I was kinda hoping to see you"".  I can't say no to that.  I go, it's fun, but I feel a somber weight in the air, something was going to happen that night.  A drinks, she gets decently drunk, nobody joins her.  Around 10:30 A and I had been texting each other throughout the night.  She admits to me that she had considered cheating on J that night (it should be made clear that she means kissing, she has very strict morals about romantic exclusivity).  I told her that she shouldn't, she'd regret it if she did.  So midnight comes and goes, nothing happens.  People trickle out slowly, and I deliberately stay, I want to talk again.  We talk more, same as always, we cry, but nothing seems to change.  I can't stop thinking about this, I needed to do something, anything.

I kissed her.

She didn't pull away, but she didn't kiss back, it was truly neutral.  The rest of the night wasn't too awkward considering that was one of the last things I did there.  I went home, and she texted me saying that she needed some time to think about that.  I wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing, and I'm still not.  Later that week, she writes everything down so it's organized.  6 pages later and it's all there.  There is one problem though, considering how much of an analytical person A is we both expected her to make the decision based on the logical pros and cons.  It was overwhelmingly in my favor.

But she still hasn't decided, there is something holding her back, and she doesn't know what it is.  She has confessed to not having strong feelings for J or me, but she has trouble still.  It comes up that I was leaving for school soon (within the week), so she suggests we spend the weekend together as a couple.  I excitedly accept, but I am cautious as this feels out of character for her, and at this point I'm very paranoid and insecure.

The weekend went great, we cuddled, kissed, watched Netflix, got breakfast.  It couldn't have been long enough to satisfy me, but I'm happy that I have that memory.  She also had a good time, I am slightly worried that she's lying to spare my feelings, but I have no choice but to trust her.  She at the very least didn't have anything bad to say about it, and she's been very busy this week.  We're going to talk tonight (January 13) and I'll bring that up.

Here is the crux of this post reddit.  There are 2 major issues.

1:  J does not know any of this, and I feel that that is unethical, and that it is A's responsibility to inform him.  This decision will affect him just as much as it does me, therefore I feel that he should know what's going on.  I have told A to at least consider this, and as far as I know she has been thinking about it.  I'll know more tonight.

2:  I have an obsession with this, and as such I have been trying to make plans in any outcome.  The first outcome is that we date again and things work out.  Great, no foreseeable problems there.  Second outcome is we date and it does not work out.  While this will hurt a little bit I am fairly confident that it will break my obsession.  I obsess over not knowing if things would work out if I had changed.  I have changed so if things don't work out then I will have given it my all, and the uncertainty will go away.  The last outcome is that we do not date again.  Historically, unresolved obsessions have destroyed my life, in the past whenever I became obsessive about something and unable to do anything about it I would just stop functioning.  I failed classes, I lost friends, I stopped eating, I tried to die.  I am not going to let that happen again.  If I don't get my second chance, I will seek more intensive therapy, medication, psychiatry, etc.  If that doesn't help as much as I need it to then I might move back home so that I am under less stress.

Regardless, I am determined not to let this destroy me, but as it stands I see some warning signs.  Motivation is hard, I don't find pleasure in things I like, and life is just hard.  I want to give her all the time she needs, but I am afraid that I don't have the mental strength to give her much more.  I feel like I have a couple weeks, maybe a month left in me before it all comes crashing down.

Place A calls me and uses language that makes me believe I had gotten the position, ( ""we think you're a great fit"", we agree on a wage, ""we are going to bring you in to meet everyone and look around"") and in my stupid ass excitement I emailed Place B immediately saying that I had accepted another offer, and thanks so much for their time. 

Fast forward to Monday. I show up to place A and it is basically another interview! I sat down with three different people in three different rooms and went over the basic face to face interview steps. They thanked me for my time, and told me I would hear back from them next Monday. And now, I'm in a panic.

My question:

Is it possible to reach back out to Place B and try to rekindle things? Or is that bridge burned and I now have to start over somewhere else if Place A doesn't come through?!

If you can't advise me on the above, but know a great hole for me to crawl into and die in, that would also be appreciated.",13Jan2018,1
190,"So it’s a bit of a long story.

I work with somebody who started a few months ago. She was a bit shy and conservative when she started (as most people are). I’ve been with the company for almost five years. Over time, she’s started picking up things I say, using “catch phrases” of mine if you will (I have fun at work and make jokes to keep the mood good all the time). She and I share looks when funny things happen at work that only we observe. We text and email a bit, but I can’t say she’s ever shown explicit interest. She comes from a very Christian family and is not very talkative about dating and whatnot, and she’s very professional despite her age. I want to ask her out because I don’t want to miss out or delay too long. 

I actually applied for a new job within the company so getting it would alleviate most of my concerns, but here is the important caveat; I’ve dated coworkers before and people know it. I kind of have this weird perception that I try to bang all my coworkers, even though I only had any kind of relations with two and in both scenarios they initiated it. I believe she knows at least of this perception, and I don’t want to come across like some guy just trying to put a notch on my belt. I genuinely like her and would like to try and see where a relationship would go.

Thoughts? Should I just back off and let it go? My idea was to try and be as low key as I can, but I don’t want that to then come across on the flip side like I’m just trying to bang her.",13Jan2018,1
191,"I don't know where to start really... went to private school which was filled with rich brats and was bullied for being smarter than them, afterwards bullied by a completely different group of people in a regular high school for being a kid that got there from a private school (imagine that, dat prejudice and shitluck)... anyway after a decade of that bullshit I was soul crushed, with a very limited set of social skills since my life was house-school-house every day, probably went out like 2 times in total due to having no real friends... So anyway when I finally became an engineering student things got kinda better. My social skills practically changed overnight due to being surrounded by 'better' people (that's when I finally realized that there was nothing wrong with me, it was just that I had shitluck due to being surrounded by assholes for over a decade).
Unfortunately things didn't turn out as I hoped they would. Even though I completely changed as a person and all that stuff(I was pretty popular at my university), I didn't feel happy since I was still often alone in my thoughts. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed other people's company, but we weren't exactly friends that go out every weekend or are ready to see each other at a moment's notice. It's amazing that each and every one of them had their 'own lives' and this university stuff was like a sidekick for them. Sure we helped each other as students and all of that, but every time there was a period of 'free time' they would crawl back into their holes and spend time with their older friends/girlfriends/families.

So yeah, I figured that once again I got handed the wrong end of a shitstick. I mean, these people weren't as 'bad' as the people in my past, but it was clear that there was no room for me in their lives ('every man for himself' mantra). 
You may notice I haven't said a thing about girls... well I really tried hard at developing such skills, meeting people and stuff - but in reality, someone like me who had no friends prior to university, and then entered a 'guys only' club with just a few girls, had no opportunity to meet anyone. All the people I knew and was popular among were guys, and their friends were also guys, so there was little chance to meet females. Moreover, my closest friends were all in long relationships dating back to high school so they didn't even understand the gravity of my situation. Due to the lack of time on university I had little time to meet new people anywhere else, especially alone.

I'm a graduate now and have plans for the future, most of which involve me leaving the country, so I don't give a flying fuck about my recent social circle which was crap anyway but I feel so bitter and mad about everything that I would like to hear your thoughts about some of my examples in dealings with people, maybe some perspectives I have missed on, or stories you have to share.

See as time went by I got bitter for being so 'left out' cos I was surrounded by people who had girlfriends who gave them support and good time, while I had nothing apart from video games or a good book. My childhood was horrible, and even though my student life was a giant leap forward, in retrospective it was bad.

I remember having a conversation with a close friend of mine when he told me how bad he felt after he failed one exam, so he called his GF to meet him at home and wait for him naked... I laughed cause I vividly remembered that day since I also failed that same exam and unlike him when I came home all I did was close the door of my room cause my parents were undergoing another argument that was typical for our household - that was my reality, whereas his was a roller coaster of good fortune. The fool doesn't even realize how lucky he is to have person that loves him for so many years by his side(classic lucky high school relationship that survived). Don't get me wrong, I'm not jealous, I'm just very bitter, since he always acts so smart and confident, so he feels like he can give out an advice about everything, yet what he does is 'bad guessing'. We simply live in different worlds.

Another example is another close friend of mine who never has time to see me, yet tends to call me only when he is in a process of doing something(i.e waiting in line @ the bank) and then asks me why I never call him... well maybe because you're an asshole that only calls me when he is bored. I really don't know whether it's just bad luck to be surrounded by such selfish and reserved people, or is it just me. I could go on with such examples, but the post is already getting too long to read.

As far as my girls experience goes... I made a move I never thought I would make. I slept with a fat girl for the sake of getting experience. Twice. She was sweet and had a cute face, but that's all basically. By experience I mean kissing(since I never kissed a girl before) and everything else. I'm not bad looking at all actually, but like I've already mentioned, I was never ever surrounded with girls, and I didn't want to go through the next chapter of my life without knowing at least some of the basic skills. The sex was pretty bad too since it felt like I was the one who was experienced and not her..., but I don't really care, since after what I've been through, I have the guts for everything.

To conclude, all of the above makes me so bitter and mad, I really feel like I just had bad luck with people overall, and despite my successes and good quality education, I don't feel happy at all as a young man. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, just deeply disappointed. Even now, when I go look for some of the assholes from my past on facebook or instagram, they are still the same old losers, but their lives took a natural path. They had sex, girlfriends, love, normal friends - especially the rich kids I knew, and they never felt the taste of despair or lack of anything. I had to fight for every shitty thing, and I know that I still have a long way to go for the things that I want. What pisses me off is that while I did my best to get myself back together, they partied on yachts and never went to college cause they are loaded with money and everything. And people find that attractive.

I basically seek answers regarding people and their behavior. Are they all so clueless and reserved? I mean why the fck do decent people like me get ruined if they don't intervene and do their utmost best - while the bad ones just triumph.

TLDR: Bullied for a decade of my life (early childhood+teens); managed to pull myself together when I became a student; now a graduate engineer, still feel very bitter and mad about that since I feel like I missed a lot but also the fact that I encounter problems and obstacles at almost every corner; all my social circles are trash with clueless and reserved people who only have room in their lives for themselves; slept with a fat girl to get experience since I was never surrounded by girls in the first place so I couldn't even meet them; seek advice about future relations with people and your stories of people in general regarding real friends in life.

This guy and I have only been dating for 2 1/2 months or so, things have been going great! 
When we first started going out, he really got me into Lorde which we listen to a lot now. I bought 2 tickets for his bday which is Friday. I want to give him his present when we go out for dinner Thursday. The concert isn’t until end of March.
I was thinking I could print the tickets, fold them in a card, tell him at dinner that I forgot his gift but he could still open his card. Any other thoughts?

193,"I'll try to be brief. I am not a very social person. That being said, I am very open minded and like to hear differing opinions &amp; thoughts. I feel people are offended when I don't open up, but I honestly have nothing to say...that I don't share. I typically work things out internally or throw them out if I feel they have no use. When I explain this, I feel psychoanalyzed or judged. I've ""got walls up."" Once I do have a moment of frustration that I end up letting out or slip (because I really try not to involve others in my issues)...they get offended. Basically, I am judged for not being ""human"" enough, but once I have a human moment...I get dropped. I am honestly confused. My husband gets me, but he is the ONLY one. I just don't talk very much...and when I do, I tend to want to open mouth insert foot. Maybe this is why I don't talk very much. I thought I had a friend, and I voiced some frustration over a text (not about her, but a situation)...she continues to tell me to calm down and breathe deep (which I found a bit insulting) and then doesn't reply to me. I apologized for sounding rude, but reminded her I was frustrated with my current situation. I still haven't heard back. Is this normal? Why do people do this? I may have been deflecting in the moment, but after letting her deflect to me for about 6 months...I don't get a turn to be upset?

198,"I met this girl online along with a group of other friends. We got really close and became the best of friends that would talk everyday. That was until a year later when they would start arguing with each other, it when on and on until finally they hated her. All she would would say would be met with aggressive responses, so she left. No one spoke to her for 8 months till finally, someone started chatting her and brought her back. This time the same thing happened but me and her became close friends, after the chat stopped responding to her she would always talk to me and etc. Finally she left again and she became someone I really liked, it was as if they all misunderstood her... or so I thought.

--------------------

So during that year me and her became closer and closer, even got to see what she looked like and... she was more beautiful than I ever imagined. And honestly I really started falling in love with her... (I know it's across the internet but...) Finally it was as if she started to like me too because we went from SC, the texting, to calling, it got better and better till I finally got to met her in person.

Now take it in that I was in love with this girl, but I should have really paid more attention to the things she said. She would always comment about how there was a bug around, she told me she doesn't actually take baths everyday, who she is recently fucking or sucking, and other things I really should have paid attention to. But that's enough of the past, let me tell you the reason the title is the title.

------------------------

&gt; Why the long story about how you met her...? It's just so you can see her from my pov, before I saw her in person. I don't want you to read the next part and instantly say leave...

&gt; Also for the people who want to skip and go right to why I made this start here.

She told me a while back she got her own apartment, I got invited to visit finally so I drove a whole state away to see her and... well. The first thing I saw was her, she was as cute as she was in her pictures but she was wearing A LOT of make-up. That's fine I mean... she hugged me and I came into a wall of the worst smell ever... it stunk. Her house smelled like shit but she didn't say anything about it. I also noticed a lot of roaches and flies around... even her food in the kitchen it looked like she was eating had flies on it. She also ignored the bugs and we sat on the couch and talked all day. Eventually, the smell wore off and it was just like the chats. We did go out to eat which was really fun. We talked till I finally left. I had my thoughts but I tucked them in and just thought maybe it was a bad day for her.

So I came the next day and somehow her house smelled even worse. But same thing, this time we watched a movie and she tried flirting with me... the smell was turning me off but I played along. She was pretty hot but it was like with the roaches and just being in this house was not working for me... so I said maybe we should go out to eat again. Sadly she said she cooked, so I went to her bathroom to wash my hands... same bad smell and I kind of saw why. Her toilet and bathtub was so dirty... it was pretty gross to even look at, despite her cute pink shower curtains it wasn't pleasing to look at at all. But I just washed my hands, (she didn't have any hand soap and I didn't want to go through her cabinets to look). I came back and she had pulled out some chicken from the microwave, she left to the bathroom and I got a few pieces, it didn't taste that good but it was chicken. She came back smelling like perfume so I assumed the smell got to her too, so we ate. She was still trying to be sexy and flirt but seeing flies on the table and on the chicken she pulled out of the microwave made me say I was full. She on the other hand despite the flies got a few more pieces and we went back to the couch to talk. I wasn't to into the conversation so I made an excuse to leave and just bailed out.

Now I was beginning to worry deeply... I was extremely grossed out but I started remembering the old days and how we would always talk. How she wanted the chat to see her, everything. So the next morning I came unannounced and apologized for leaving so abruptly.

She was a bit surprised to me but was upset with a phone call. She didn't have any make up on and was looking as hot as her pictures with out it. It really made me feel like I could be with her. I sat on the couch while she argued on the phone, she was wearing a short white top with no bra and some pretty nice pajama pants that made her ass look big. She went to another room and started cussing then ended with don't hang up on me. But came back completely pissed off. I told her I could leave if it wasn't a good time, but she immediately told me about her ex or friend w/e he is. That went on about an hour until she finally calmed down. We talk a little and my eyes keep going down to her nippled top because of how she isn't wearing a bra. She responds with my eyes are up here, but it seemed to turn her on so we start flirting. I cut her off after a while by telling her there was a roach on her thigh. She smacked it off and looked completely off guard. She started saying, she has been trying to get rid of them and etc, I commented I could buy her bug spray and she looked off guard again. I noticed her armpits were getting wet through her top so I was going to shut up about it. But she said she had some and went and got a can of it. She sprayed the entire living room and kitchen and I went into a coughing fit so she brought me to her room.

Somehow her room smelt even worse than her house did. But I ignored that because she immediately dismissed the pile of clothes and underwear on the floor as clothes she needed to hang up. She tossed them into her closet and I just looked around, cans, water bottles, trash, old wrappers, even a old condom that she kicked under her bed. She tried to distract me by flirting again and when she was this close I could smell her breath which was also bad. I started stuttering... I was actually worried. She realized it I guess because she turned on music and said let's dance. We did, we danced till I fell on top of her on the bed. She then kissed me and I started kissing her. She took off her top, so I took off mine. And well... she started smelling bad again.

I was about to leave but she pulled me back. She whispered in my ear and said, it's fine as if I was talking about the kissing that was bothering me. But as she unzipped my panties and jerked off my dick, I decided why not... so I pulled her pants off and her vagina smelled godawful, she was bushy, and this was way too soon, but because I only had sex with one other girl that was also a virgin. I went for it. I saw she was already wet so I just put it in and her. Somehow she went from hot to horse face, she started making a sound that sounded like a gorilla, definitely wasn't moaning and well she creamed my dick within a few seconds of me putting it in. We went at it though for a while, I turned her around and did doggy-style and she became a truck engine with all of her queefing because why not I guess. I turned her back over to stop that and immediately as I put it in she passed gas, she claimed she queefed... but I just agreed and picked her up so she could ride me. Her face was still contorted or twisted so I just started bouncing her on my dick. She started drooling and I wondered if she was lying about fucking so often because even my ex that was a virgin did better than this.

Eventually I came on her stomach and the demon possessing her was gone. She said that was amazing and questioned if I really only fucked once. I wanted to ask her the same thing but I just laid in bed and fake laughed at everything. It was around 10 minutes later that she started giving me head and I was actually enjoying it but I fucked up because I should have known she'd want me to eat her out. And just like that, she whipped her leg over me and wanted to 69... It smelt bad tbh, but I did it... after what felt like a minute, I turned her back over. Turned the must high as hell to drown her out and went back at it. We finished again. She wanted more... after that I was tired... I wanted to go home but she begged me to stay the night. So I did... 

All I know is I took a bath later that night and when she was supposed to, she came back out naked with the water running saying she couldn't stop thinking about me, we had sex again without her bathing. And I fell asleep, when I woke up early in the morning she was beside me naked. I went to the bathroom to see she left her pajamas on the floor but she turned the water off. I looked for a toothbrush to use but she didn't have any extra ones nor did I want to use hers... She didn't have mouth wash so I just put toothpaste in my mouth, some water, and rinsed it around. I came back and laid in bed, she woke up and kissed me on the lips. And as you can imagine we had more sex... this time she actually took the lead, riding me in what would be good if she was fanning flies away from her... it was even landing on her. Worse when she spun around for reverse cowgirl, about two flies landed on her back or ass. I think I actually got soft inside of her. I lied to her and told her that I think I'm all sexed out but, she pulled me on top of her and wanted me to finish. So I did and this time with no music... I was left wondering if this really was the girl I loved all along. If I could even deal with this, if this is really good... She said something that I couldn't understand and when I was about to pull out to cum, she wrapped her legs around me and I accidentally came inside of her... She still wouldn't let me leave, she hugged me and my dick slowly retracted and poofed out of her as she queefed out the cum. And there's also her breath as she's trying to be sexy... I just. I pulled away from her, went to go to the store and buy her plan b... then I came back gave it too her and told her I have to go back and get ready for work tonight. So I left.

And that is that. I can't believe she didn't noticed any of herself or her house... but jeez. I actually haven't spoken to her since and she has left at least 17 calls and messages. I don't know what to do... I know she thinks of me as a close friend but I was just completely turned off by her. I don't even know what to say... I know she enjoyed it but should I just lie and say it was great? Because honestly that was the worst sex I have ever had... I'd rather remember sex with my virgin ex rather than this... I mean. Wow... Even then her whole house was disgusting... and she's just living in that shit. I can't even... so I don't know what I'm asking really... maybe I need a break away from her... maybe I need to talk to her... maybe I should just pretend she never existed. Any advice?

202,"Hello reddit! A year ago me and this girl started talking and becoming friends, she seemed normal in the first few months. Not red flags. But now she's obsessed with claiming everything is ""cultural appropriation"" or disrespectful. Example: we saw a kimono-like dress on display in a store, and she was quick to say that we shouldn't ever buy in that store because it's ""appropriating asian culture"" and that we should research the history of that clothing style to wear it. 

She keeps getting triggered with pointless things, i'm asian and i honestly didn't mind the clothing, it was just a dress with a different style, nothing else. It wasn't offensive for me at all. If she wanted to wear it, she would not trigger me nor anyone. I don't think anybody else cares?

And its not like i'm going to research the history of america just to buy an american flag shirt, there's no point in that!!!! 

The most embarrassing moment for me was a few days ago when she confronted a popular store's employee asking him if he knew the history behind some foreign writing in a jeans shorts, and was implying HE was disrespectful. he didn't even make the clothing. She left the store upset, and i apologized to the employee.

And every time i try to call her out saying what she's doing is unnecessary or wrong, she tells me i don't understand.

TLDR: 23y old male with too many hereditary issues, vasectomy yay or nay?


For context, I am a 23y old single guy, which is why I feel it may be too soon to make such a decision.

The reason for this is not that I do not want children (I'm very in favor of adoption), but because I have many hereditary issues that have made my life hard, and sometimes downright scary.


First of all, I have very severe allergies, the kind that cannot be treated. Both me and my father have tried year long treatments, amongst other things, but it never goes away. Some nights I have to stay awake because breathing takes too much effort.

I also have an hernia, same as my father (don't know the exact term since english is not my first language). I know it's treatable, but until then it can be very painful at times.

Then I have a thyroids problem which I discovered because of dumb luck, and it once caused me a ""mini heart attack"" (I am not even thirty, this is very scary for me). Again, treatable, but it took too long to find it for my comfort.

I also have many other things, like back problems (all of my cousins suffer from it, all younger than 30), and high risks of diabetes, hypertension and probably cancer, all very common on both sides of the family.


Sorry if this all sounds like a rant of problems that can be easily fixed, but none of this has made my life easier, and if I ever have a child, I do not want them to spend years of their life contantly going to doctors to know whether or not they got one problem or another, and having to take multiple kinds of medicine for months or even years so they will be able to fix some of them eventually.


I know I am young, and medicine makes progress fast, but the same could have been told to my parents. I just don't want a child of mine to go through the pain I have gone through.

Sorry for the long post, but this is a big decision for me and I really need some advice.",13Jan2018,2
210,"So the story is like this. 

I've been working for a company at a store for just over a month, at 0,75 capacity. At first I was promised everything. But it turns out the boss is shit. I work like a horse. Nobody supports me. Nobody takes into consideration the days I NEED to be off work and the days I can work. They make my shift exactly the way I can't work. I've voiced my issue plenty of times.

I've been thinking about switching to part-time. I get a smaller paycheck, which is quite small but I could spare my nerves.

I don't know why I'm asking Reddit, probably because I need people from the outside put my thoughts into perspective. 

Do I still work 0,75-time and be miserable but still get a semi-decent paycheck, or do I go part-time and spare my nerves and get less money, but be happier? 

What do you guys? ",13Jan2018,1
211,"TL;DR Lost my best friend after an argument about whether he should Facebook livestream himself playing music while I was just out of camera tripping on LSD. 

I live across the country from my best friend, and I’m home on winter break. He’s been in a real bad place the last few months. Everyday I get a barrage of text messages from him telling me how much he hates his life and wants to kill himself. These long texts usually end with him asking to come hangout with him. There’s a few problems with seeing him. He lives 40 minutes away and my parents hate him due to his well-known history of major drug use (he’s banned from their house). My favorite place to hangout while I’m home is in my parents basement - we have a really cozy set up and friends usually come visit and stay a few days. That’s not an option for him. 

He lives in a drug house, and through those connections, I was able to do LSD last week. I found it really helpful in looking objectively at my flaws, one of which I thought was that I wasn’t doing enough to hangout with my best friend. One thing he said to me was dead on: I’ve made more of an attempt to see random Tinder girls than I have made to see him. This made me really sad, and as a result, I made a commitment to visit him more. 

Yesterday, I got my usual barrage of text messages from him telling me how much he hates life. He told me he needed to get out of his house, a place where his roommates smoke crack in the basement, and detach from the world for a day. He is currently detoxing from kratom, so we both agreed getting away from that scenery for the night would be a good thing. I suggested that I come up to him and we get a hotel room in his area and we can spend the night there. He mentioned in passing that he wanted to livestream himself playing music in Facebook, something he usually does, and I really didn’t think much of it. 

When we got to the hotel, I took three hits of LSD given the positive experience I had the week prior. I figured that I was in a safe and calm environment where I could do some self-reflection. The night was going great. I hadn’t seen my friend that happy in such a long time. He was beaming. Eventually, he turns on his computer, takes out his guitar, and starts livestreaming on Facebook. 

While I was not in front of the camera at all, it suddenly dawned on me that I was tripping and could very easily forget he was livestreaming and walk in front of the camera and say something incriminating as if the camera weren’t there. He’s Facebook friends with my sister, so even if I didn’t say anything incriminating and all it would look like to a normal person was that I was just hanging out in the background while he played music in a hotel, anyone who knows us and his reputation would question why I was in a hotel room with a known drug addict in the middle of the night. The implications of that alone would have been pretty clear, and that is not even considering the possibility of me having a bad trip and accidently doing something stupid or incriminating on camera. 

He was sitting a few feet away from me, and I motioned and whispered for him to turn off the camera. I wasn’t necessarily opposed to him livestreaming in any fashion, but I did want to talk to him about my concerns so that we could ensure that there was no way I would end up on camera. At the time, nobody was watching his livestream, he had just started and it was almost midnight. For three minutes we argued, while he was livestreaming, about whether he would stop for a second so we could talk. He couldn’t understand why I couldn’t just say it when the camera was running. Eventually, he turned it off. I explained to him the situation and he got pissed that he had to stop livestreaming to talk about it. At that point we got into an argument that led to me asking him to leave the hotel room. I brought up various points. I was paying for the hotel room and his food, so at the very least he should show me some courtesy. He was doing something that made his close friend feel uncomfortable, so he should have stopped and talked it out no matter how silly it seemed to him at first. Rather than being together in the hotel room, he instead focused his attention on Facebook people, except that literally nobody was watching his livestream in the first place. He didn’t take all of this well. 

We haven’t talked since. Did I do anything remotely wrong? Should I try to smooth things over?

I have only been attracted to girls up until I saw a picture of my friend and her cousin posing together in a picture on social media. I thought her cousin was pretty cute. While my friend and I were hanging out, I brought it up as a joke and she told me her cousin was actually a guy. She teased me and told me that he was around my age and he was gay. I was shocked because I was very much convinced that he was a girl. He has a very feminine facial structure and slim, feminine body. He has relatively long hair, nice lips, and pretty eyes and eyelashes. It’s clear that he takes very good care of himself. He wasn’t cross dressing or anything. He wore clothes that both guys and girls wear (sweatshirt, ripped jeans, sneakers). His clothes fit to the extent that it made him look like a girl, kind of like a tumblr tomboy. What bothers me is that even after I was informed that he was actually a guy, I am still attracted to him. I am not attracted to any guys and I have never really fantasized about other guys except for him. I find myself fantasizing about him pretty often.

214,"Yesterday evening, my deaf dog that I adopted about 6 months ago ran out of the house when my roommate came home. Normally, my dog won't leave my side and will obey her commands like sit, lay down, come. This time, she ran down the street and didn't pay attention to any of her commands. I managed to keep her in the area by playing with sticks and throwing rocks, but every time I tried to grab her collar, she ran further away. I tried to go back towards the house and let her follow me, but that only prompted her to run further down the street.  I was so terrified that she would be hit by a car if I left her alone because more than once I had to wave my arms at cars and tell them to drive carefully because she was running in the road. 


This went on for about an hour until we more than a mile from my house. A random person offered me a piece of ham, which I ended up using to get my dog close enough so I could grab her collar. I then used my shoelace as a leash and took her home. 


I was so upset and worried from this that I cried for about two hours when I got home. I put my dog in her crate during that time (with food and water) because I couldn't be near her. I feel like she hates me because she wouldn't come to me, and like I can't trust her. I should feel grateful that she wasn't hit by a car, but I am really just angry and frustrated. 


I let her out of the crate before I went to bed and she slept at the foot of my bed. This morning, she is sleeping on my bed and I just can't bring myself to play with her, pet her, or anything. 


I know this is ridiculous, but I feel like we aren't bonded anymore. What can I do to fix the bond with my dog? I don't want to give her away or back to the adoption agency, as she is my responsibility and I want to make sure she has a good home. However right now, I can't stand her.

216,"I’m fifteen and I’ve been talking to this girl (we’ll call her Anna) for a couple of days, not long at all. Anna told a mutual friend (we’ll call her Sarah) that she thought I was cute and Sarah texted me and asked what I thought of Anna. I didn’t know much about her, but we had talked some before. From what I saw, she seemed nice and cool. 

This would be my first real girlfriend, and the one thing I didn’t want to do was rush it. But, it has definitely been rushed and made me uncomfortable. After I had her number for a day, Anna texted me saying “Sarah said you liked me- is that true?”, I replied saying “I like talking to you and I’d really like to get to know you better.” That was awkward, because I wanted to talk to her to get to know her. Not to get to know her before we start dating, I wanted to get to know her IF we start dating. 

The next day, I talked to Sarah about it and told her how awkward it made me feel. She said something along the lines of “How is that awkward? It’s only awkward when you make it.” Which, kinda pissed me off. 

On top of all of this, in a class that all three of us have together, Anna took some selfies with us. She posted one with me in it and asked Sarah what she should caption it. Sarah said “Put ‘Something new’ with a wink.” This might sound stupid, but now we’re on Instagram as a couple? Before Anna posted it, she asked me if it made me uncomfortable, but what am I supposed to say? Maybe I could’ve prevented this, but I told myself that I was just overreacting. Then, Sarah comments on the picture something implying that Anna and I are already a couple. We’re not. 

After texting Anna for a few days, I realized that we never really have anything to talk about. At first I thought it was because ‘I make things awkward’, but now I think it’s just because we don’t have anything in common. Any advice?",13Jan2018,3

219,"  My school is having our whole grade go on a big, five day and nights trip in the Everglades this Tuesday. I need to figure it how to make myself sick enough to avoid it.

  I’ll preface this by saying, this is a big deal to the school. They’ve done this for decades, it’s the school tradition. If you skip it, they legitimately fail you. It’s a private school, so they reserve the right to flunk a kid who doesn’t attend. So to get out of it, I’d have to be beyond *faking* sick. I’d need to be legitimately in a condition where I am not able to go.

  And for reference, the grade is split up into two weeks, Wave 1 and Wave 2. I’m in Wave 1, but if I were to be too sick just on Tuesday, they’d just make me go to school that week, and go on the trip with the Wave 2 group. I need to be sick enough to miss school, to make sure I don’t end up with the second group either. 

 So how do I make myself injured/sick enough to get out of it?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

And before you give me the advice of “Just go, you’ll have fun”, I have a more detailed description below.

  It’s 5 days and nights out rowing, sleeping outside, etc. It’ll either be in the heat, around 80 degrees, with bugs and mosquitoes everywhere. No showers or changes of clothes, so sweat is everywhere. No deodorant allowed on the trip either.



 They have us drink water directly from the lake, and the food is disgusting, at least according to everyone who’s done it already. Almost everyone who goes spends a considerable amount of time vomiting, and I have a particularly sensitive stomach.

 And, in addition to all that, Hey very specifically make sure you aren’t with your friends. They split us up so that you won’t have anyone to talk to. No books or cards allowed either.

 I’m sure to some of you it still sounds like a great time. That’s fine, being an active, outdoorsy person is great! But I’m very aware that I am not someone who would enjoy this, or reap any real benefit. ",13Jan2018,1

23 years old. currently doing a year course that'll get me into uni again (dropped out in 2016), but I feel trapped in my house. I wanted to go out and socialise almost every day of the Winter holidays, but only ended up leaving my house once because my friends have girlfriends. 

My best friend only talks to me when he's bored, and when he has plans he has a really horrible bullying attitude. 

My father is a verbally abusive, alcoholic and white nationalist. If someone is downstairs with, he drones on about politics and minorities, even if I have my hears plugged. I dislike his views, yet his excuse to keep talking is, ""the dog is listening"". Not agreeing with his views brings horrible abuse, including racist comments to my mother (ironically a minority). I pretty much hate my dad's guts.

I don't know what to do any more.
I live about a 30 minute drive from the centre, so there's not much I can do outside of the house, other than walk the dog. 
excuses: walking can become painful because of my flat feet and achilles tendon.

I'm afraid of going out to clubs and stuff on my own, because I used to share my dad's views and I know a lot of people saw the bullshit I was commenting over a year ago. My classmates aren't very social and some of them can't go drinking for religious reasons.

I feel so isolated. I don't know what to do and it's bothering me. I have a lot of assignments to do, yet all this stress is making me smoke more weed and procrastinate. I was raised pretty anti-drug, so I also have to deal with my mother being pissed off at me for smoking.

I'm hoping to move out next year when I go to a new uni, but I'm not sure how finance is going to work as I have already used up 3 years of student finance from when I previously studied, so I may not even be able to study.

I'm just fed up of having so much anxiety because of how isolated I am. ",13Jan2018,9

Just the other day I had a tray and metal donation box thrown at me from across the counter by one of my co-worker's boyfriends. It sucks. I dont feel safe working there anymore.

And on top of my coworker's violent affiliations, are my own medical issues. I have EXTREME IBS and panic disorder.

I cant speak Spanish, but I can understand it enough to know theyre talking about me in Spanish while they think I'm oblivious to it. It's humiliating Theyve even gone so far so as to change my schedule and forge my managers signature, which resulted in me showing up at the wrong times.

233,"Hi guys! 
I'm graduating university in May as a premed/bio major, but I'm taking a gap year to apply to medical school but also work a job in order to start to pay off my loans but gain some valuable clinical experience. I've been commuting to the city for school the past few years (which is a lot of money in itself), but now I realize to save money it's better to work closer to home. Issue is, I live in suburbia and I don't know how to drive- furthermore, my family has only one car and my dad is unemployed so I definitely can't ask him for money. Any work I have done while in school has gone towards my college education instead of saving up for a car. 

I've gotten a lot of scrutiny for not driving in a relatively middle-class community- but I've also lost a lot of friends from high school because I was unable to drive to meet up with them. My dad is extremely strict and doesn't let me drive because he thinks I'm a rebel. As I'm applying for medical scribe jobs, there are some located in towns near me, but I need a car to get there. I went on Google Maps, looked at the total time to get there by car and it was 15 minutes. Public transit? A bus which only operates on a few weekdays and only from 7am-8am (but it apparently has not come near my apartment complex since 2008), and then walking for another 30 minutes- total time is 1.5 hours for something that is the next town over. The only other scribe jobs are in the larger city within NJ (Newark), but spending $200 on a monthly pass when it could be put towards my student loans/costs associated with medical school seems unreasonable, especially since this scribe job is minimum wage $9.25/hour. 

Is there any way to combat this? I'm trying to come to terms with not blaming myself for my dad's unemployment, not sticking up for myself to learn how to drive, but also not being born into a family where I generally would've gotten a car at 16 (like everyone at my high school did).

I am currently in my late 30s and I graduated back in 2007 with a BA in History, I started on my degree back in 2003. I feel like that was a terrible mistake because that degree has not helped me at all. My family comes from another country and I am first generation here, so the advice, ""get a degree, any degree will help"" was constantly said growing up.

After 10 years out of school now, not much has changed, I only work in customer service, and I hate it. Right now I am volunteering with a non profit as a social media coordinator, but thats about it. I thought about going back to school for a BS in Corporate Communications..thinking that this might help. I also refuse to ask my school for advice because I already know what they will say.

Over 10 years ago, if someone would have told me that I would been working the same jobs that I was working before I got my degree, I wouldn't have done it. i also currently work with people that have a BA in Spanish, Sociology, English and a degree in IT.

A part of me wants to go back to school, I have 10 classes that I would need to take, and now with student loan debt, another part of me tells me to just save the money and keep working. Problem is, without this volunteering gig, I would still be doing the same thing that I was doing before. I plan to list it as actual experience instead of just ""volunteering"". I do know one thing for sure, I don't want to be on the phones in a call center for the rest of my life...help!",13Jan2018,4
252,"I’m a kid, And I was playing with my “outside dog” (Stupid parents always force the dog to live outside, Away from any other dogs or humans, Even they don’t go into contact with her, Dad just ignores her and doesn’t give a damn at all. Mom would feed it and give it food but she’d still argue that she’s an “Outside dog”. I try to tell her the dog plays outside and lives outside and mom is just as arrogant as ever. ), The dog was kinda lazy and not playful or energetic, She’s about 8 months and always lays down outside having nothing to do, Even when I try to play tag with her or play fetch, She just stays by my side watching me throw the sticks and getting confused what I mean when I said “catch”. 
As I lifted her up, I attempted to do a hip throw but the poor dog managed to land in a split position on its back leg, Seemingly breaking it. I was “oh shit”ing and trying to help it (Nobody was home in that time of the day bc parents have a restaurant they have to work in, And they wouldn’t care about the dog at all and left it all to me to take care of. There’s no leash so I can’t take her outside, though I repeatedly reminded my dad that we have to get the dog a collar and leash. ). The dog is just laying in the garage and I seem to have nothing I can do, Parents won’t help, The dog can’t walk by itself, Because of that the dog can’t get the food and water. Keep in mind the dog is young and pretty stupid, Due to it not being socialized and taught tricks and how to behave, So whenever I tried to feed her and give her water manually, she just turned her head obviously saying she didn’t want it. What the hell do I do?

253,"Like the topic says I have a very annoying coworker who thinks I'm his best friend when I can't stand him!

I really just want to tell him to **** off and leave me alone, but that's not a very professional way to deal with someone! I did used to kind of like him but now I don't.

How do I get him to leave me alone without being rude about it? Any advice would be appreciated. I'm so angry at him but I don't know how to deal with it nicely/politely.

I do need his help at work sometimes so i don't want to upset him!

Thanks.",13Jan2018,2
254,"Hey everyone!

So this post isn't about me it's about my girlfriend. Last August 2017 she couldn't attend school because of lack of funds so she took a semester off so that she could work and make enough money to afford the tuition. After 2 months of working two jobs she realised that she will not be able to afford to save money for tuition because she can barely cover her rent and regular expenses. (she's cut back on everything she can and still can only save about $200 a month).

We decided that she would just take out a school loan because her dad earns ""so much"" money she is not applicable for financial aid and also isn't prepared to give her any money (which is his choice but it pisses me off). But when she wen't to take out a loan for school she was unable to, her Dad couldn't cosign for her because he has bad credit. She has great credit and works 2 jobs but is only 19.

I don't know what to do she has literally been busting her ass working two jobs in one day to save enough money to afford rent next semester so she can cut back on work to save time for school. I want to start a gofundme but she keeps telling me no and I know it wont get anything if she doesn't share it. She only has 4 more days to get the money or she will be dropped from all her classes.

What should we do? She's just crying because she wants to go to school and I feel like shit I'm just lost can someone help?

255,"My best friend (whose name happens to also start with a B) is super understanding with how I feel about my sister. My sister can be a raging beyotch &amp; always has to be in the spotlight. Her most recent fad is that she wants to be social media famous. She is married w two kids and is constantly posting. Anyway, she created another instagram so that she could post more. I was attempting to text my friend, when I texted my sister “tell me my sister didn’t create another instagram”. I tried to cover, but it was a failed attempt - she knows I was talking smack. My intention was never to hurt her, no matter how much I hate her social media habits. I’m not perfect by any means and I know I have things to work on on my end, but I’m not sure how to rectify this situation. I admitted that it was an accident to her, but i’m not sure where to go from here. 
I know an apology needs to be in there somewhere, but that’s about it",13Jan2018,9
256,"So, I'm brazillian native (my nickname is just an inside joke) but my family basically came from Europe from both sides of my family tree (mostly Italy).
I'm starting uni and I want to learn another language so I can move to Europe after I graduate. Keep in mind that I'm an Italian citizen because of my family, so I can just move to any country in the EU like I live there.

The thing is: I'm thinking of living in europe in some years but I can't choose between learning italian and going to Italy or learning german and going to Germany/Austria etc...
I'd really like some advice in this, it's going to be a big step in my life

259,"I've consistently distanced myself from anything competitive my whole life for these reasons:

-The whole mentality of competitive activities in which seriousness, careful planning, and excellent execution are key. I don't fit that bill in any way. I don't take anything very seriously unless it pertains to academics or personal issues. I'm also not the best with strategy planning and execution.

-High amounts of judgment. If you're not good at it, you're screwed and ridiculed. I fear that if I jump the shark, I'll lose more dignity and pride than when I didn't. I've already been distanced by some classmates for not playing a competitive sport, but I feel like they're baiting me into playing so that they can show the world how terrible of a player I am.

-Little to no skill. When it comes to any sport, I am straight-up GARBAGE. Everyone around me on the basketball court is making shots while I haven't even scored a single point in PE Basketball. I'm overweight, and my lungs can't take any more than two sprints across the gym floor (I can still run normally), My aim when attempting to shoot is way off, and I'm not familiar with many of the rules of any sport you name to me. Nobody has ever given me any tips as to what you need to do and how to adapt to different situations.

Any advice or tips?",13Jan2018,1
263,"Okay, so I've got a choice between two jobs. I would like to see what you guys think on this matter. I'm a struggling artist. I went to school, and graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Art. I have done a lot of freelance work, but nothing stable. So, in order to pay the bills I got a job as an Event Coordinator making $14 an hour. I also make a little commission which ranges anywhere from $300 to $700 in addition to my $14 an hour paycheck (once a quarter). The commute is 30 min. So, I spend close to $140 on gas and tolls in 1 week. However, this job has benefits with health, vision, dental, etc. I also really like my coworkers. I can honestly say that I have met some great people, and would be very sad to leave them. However, this job is not my passion. I want to be doing something creative, and actually put my degree to good use. Now, the other job is working as a graphic designer for a very small T-Shirt &amp; merchandise company. The pay is $14.50 an hour (slight increase). No benefits. No commission check. But, it's literally 5 minutes away from my house, and would be saving me a ton on gas. And, it's actually something creative where I will be creating designs, and learning production work &amp; screen printing.

So, the conundrum is should I quite my job that I have now, and start this other job?

Current job pros: commission check, benefits, amazing co-workers
Current job cons: more gas mileage, not a career I'm passionate about

New job pros: close to home, stepping stone for artistic experience, 50 cent pay raise

New job cons: no benefits, no commission check, don't know these new co-workers &amp; if we will get along

266,"I'm definitely more of the introverted type. I work Monday through Friday and have the weekends off. I have a few friends I can make plans with, but I never feel like doing anything with them and I'd rather just keep to myself and find something to do at home. 

For example, today, I woke up, read a few chapters of my book, watched a movie, did some chores around the house, and now I'm watching football. My 3 roommates have come and gone throughout the day and now they're all out with friends for the evening. Part of me wishes I were out doing something, but the other part of me wants to just sit here in the comfort of my home. Sometimes even when I do have plans with a friend, I end up cancelling and make up some reason because I literally just want to sit at home. 

Has anyone else ever felt like this? I sort of feel like I'm in the wrong for being this way, even though I feel content for the most part. It has been really difficult for me to deal with lately. I'm not sure if I should continue my ways or try to change them.",13Jan2018,7
268,"I'm 21, and the only job I ever had was at Walmart back in 2015. I worked a few months, but when my job was complete (I was working remodel crew) they moved me to a cashier position. This was the only position in the store I didn't want, and I hated every moment of it, and I wanted to be able to spend more time with my girlfriend. One night after clocking out I just never came back. I never heard from Walmart again, and Walmart never heard from me. This was immature &amp; stupid, I know. I'm assuming this counts as me being fired and not quitting, since I never told anyone I was finished working there. 

Because I was terminated form the job, is it better to leave off of job applications now? 

The only other work experience I have is sealing driveways with my dad, but we never did it under a company or anything, it was just the two of us doing whatever jobs we could get through word of mouth. That's what I've been doing for the past couple years, but i'm not sure whether or not I should include it on applications. ",13Jan2018,4
270,"So my ex and I dated for 4 years. Even after breaking up we still texted and called 24/7 Until he was asked out by another girl. She goes to college an hour away now and me and him commute to the same college. He blocked me when he started dating her, but we have gotten back in touch this week. He borrowed a textbook from me and we talked for an hour. Later I texted him if he wanted to catch up over coffee sometime, and he responded yes and how he enjoyed talking to me, almost as fast as I sent it to him. He also said it was nice to talk to me since he doesn't know anyone at the school. Why would he agree to catch up if he has a girlfriend? Am I possibly getting a second chance? Does he just want to be friends or more than that? It's been almost a year he's been with this other girl. What could this mean?",13Jan2018,1

272,"Background: Recently, I had just confessed to a guy I recently started talking to that I was interested in him. His response was that he wasn't ready for a relationship, he didn't feel mentally stable enough. He hasnt dated anyone in two years for his inability to love himself therefore not being able to love others. He said he didn't feel empty inside and he has been improving his grades, art, and social life which made me realize... 

I feel empty inside. All the time. I can be empty and happy at the same time but I never not felt void. I knew I needed to improve my mental state but never thought that I should just lay off of the dating game and intensely focus on myself.

How do I do that? How do not let myself stray into the interests of crushes? How do I focus on myself without losing motivation or being frustrated with myself? Where do I start loving myself? Improving myself?",13Jan2018,1
