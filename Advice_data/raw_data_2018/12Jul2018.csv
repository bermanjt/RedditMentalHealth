0,"I am an incoming high school junior this year. My gpa is around 3.9 and I have yet to take the SAT/ACT. It has been my sole dream that when I get out of high school with my diploma that I can go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and majoring in theoretical physics/astrophysics. The problem is that no one really believes I can actually achieve such a mountainous goal. If you don’t know, the average acceptance rate for MIT is just over 8%. This means that it is one of the most prestigious schools in the United States and I have never in my life been more passionate about a goal of mine until I knew I wanted to go there. Personally, I believe I can because I have already put in the effort of trying to get there, step by step. I already am trying to get into SAT prep classes and other classes to try and ramp up my chances of being accepted. But this doesn’t take away from the fact that I feel like I’m the only one who thinks I can actually do it, and the people who have believed in me the most (family, friends, etc.) who have never led me wrong don’t seem to think I can do it. I know it’s pretty naive of me to go to the internet of all places to look for advice and such but I don’t know where to turn. Should I try to pursue my dream or leave it as a lost cause?

3,"this kind of turned into a rant and for that I'm sorry so basically only read if you want to hear me complain. 

So basically two months into my junior year my parents had me drop out of school because they wanted to move out of state, I was freshly 16 at the time.  

The plan was for me to watch my two younger brothers while they got a place sorted, and I would be back in school by feburary.  It was October when we left. 

We lived in a hotel from October to January. Sure, 3 months doesnt sound bad. But 2 adults, me, 2 babies, and a dog, was very stressful in a hotel with one bed and one very uncomfortable couch. 

Turns out my parents overestimated their success because they couldnt afford daycare for my brothers. 

So I continued taking care of them while they both worked. I tried doing online school, but let's be honest, I couldnt spend 6+ hours on a computer every day while watching them! (6 days a week, usually 6am to 7pm) 

So I was an official dropout. Being away from school really did a ding on my mental health, I used to be an insanely social person, and now I'm just terrified of seeing my neighbors when o take the dog out for a piss. 

October of 17' I got a job and I started to get a lot happier because I had my own money, and I had somewhere else to be besides that stupid apartment. 

It went great, and then may of this year we had to move out of our apartment. And instead of staying in the general area, we went about an hour away.

So I had to quit my job and spend my 18th birthday moving boxes. Boohoo, right? Suck it up, right? I know these are minor things and I sound stuck up but they bother me. 

During this whole time from when we moved til now I still haven't hung out with or even made a friend, I've gotten depressed and gained 50 pounds, and it just sucks.

 I dont want to take care of my brothers anymore, I want a ged! And I want to learn how to drive and I want to be on my own. I know I'm 18 and I know I'm legally obligated to leave when I want to without consequences. But if I did it would screw my parents over, we're already low on money and if one of them had to quit their job to watch the kids, they wouldnt have a place to live and I can't do that to them but I want to leave SO badly..

Even the other day I was considering killing myself but then I realized it would just be a huge inconvenience for them if I did leave in anyway shape or form. 

My only purpose is to take care of my brothers and I'm beyond miserable. 
What do I do? 
How do I get through this? 

Because I'm on my last straw. I want to be on my own and I have all this built up anger and emotion inside of me, I have no outlet and I dont know what'll happen when I finally burst, I'm scared of it. 

I feel selfish for thinking this way. They keep a roof on my head and keep me fed and they love me, but they ripped away the most precious and what was supposed to be a memorable time in my life.

5,"Hey, first time posting in reddit. Basically i need some advice or guidance. I'm 23 and have just finished a BSc Hons Degree in Audio Production. Now reality is really setting in and i feel i'm looking down the barrell of a long road of depression finding a way to make a living. I have an interest in Sound Design for film and televison as well as Radio. An INTEREST but not a passion. I believe i am talented at some aspects of sound design such as layering sounds but due to being in quite a bad headspace throughout my 3 years at Uni i have a very basic understanding of the other aspects involved in Sound production. mixing, Editing etc. I have heard it is very hard getting into this form of work professionally and you really need a passion for it which i don't have. The only thing that drives me in life is meaning. I want to live my life as meaningful as possible. Without meaning or purpose i just don't seem to get a lot out of things. I enjoy helping people as it makes my life feel purposeful. I must admit that i have also been addicted to porn for 3 years now and i'm trying to quit that shit to get me into a better mind frame. I also would love to travel around for a bit as i feel it would benefit me in ""finding myself"" which is cliche but i really believe it's something i must do. Hmmm i'm in a rut really sorry if this is so long. My parents expect me to pursue this career ive chosen for myself and not live a life in retail for the rest of my days which to be honest i dont want that for me either.

9,"Need some advice on how to help my girlfriend. I’m moving out of my girlfriend’s apartment in three weeks to attend graduate school for 4 years. The school is 2 hours away from here so commuting would be difficult.  My girlfriend cannot move with me because she is finishing school herself and has another 3 years left. 

Our relationship has no rifts, and we are extremely happy in our relationship, which is why it’s making things very difficult on my girlfriend. She is very stressed at school (she’s getting her PhD) and is very sad that I am leaving her. Of course I’m also extremely upset knowing I will only see her on weekends and holidays for the next few years, however she is more open with her emotions and will constantly make herself upset about the situation. 

What are some ways that I can help ease her mind about this move. I’ve already expressed to her that we will be able to video chat on a regular basis and will make the most of the time we spend together on weekends and holidays. T

Thanks in advance, I really do love her and it makes me sad when I see her this upset about it because I feel like there’s nothing I can do about the situation. ",12Jul2018,1
10,"Okay so here's the situation.

I just finished my 2nd year of college, and I signed a lease to live with three of my friends and one of their old roommates, Jan (fake name). When we were deciding to sign the lease, she was making everything very difficult because she wanted to live somewhere else and her parents said the apartment we wanted to live in was not nice enough blah blah blah. The rest of us said, ""Okay no biggy. You don't have to live with us."" A week later she randomly contacted us and signed a lease. Since then, I've had a really bad feeling about living with her, but I ignored it as we were now already legally required to live together.

Flash forward to the current date and I am literally unable to sleep at night thinking about moving in with her. She has not offered to bring literally anything for the common space, not even a cup. Even though she hasn't offered, I know she's still going to judge whatever furniture and decorations my other roommates and I bring as she is very \~particular\~. She comes from a very wealthy family, and she is very used to getting what she wants no matter what. This has just recently come about since the rest of us are all interning full time in our respective apartments near school and have run into a big problem. All of our leases run out on the 31st of July, yet we can't move into our new apartment until the 17th of August. In order for us to be able to keep working full time and not have to pay for temporary furniture storage while renting an Air BnB or sleeping on other peoples couches, we all wanted to sign an ""as in"" form which releases our apartment from cleaning and doing any necessary maintenance on our apartment so we can move in on the 1st of August. We are already required to pay a whole months worth of rent, so there's no reason we shouldn't move in! Just to make sure our apartment wasn't completely disgusting, I knocked on the door and asked the current residents if I could look around. They were super nice and had done an amazing job taking care of the apartment; it was literally spotless. I sent everyone photos and a description of how everything looked, but she still refused because she thought the grout in her bathroom was dirty... the apartment complex is 15 years old... grout gets gross... that's why we have cleaning brushes... As a result, she is refusing to sign the form. The rest of us were offering to deep clean as soon as we move in and have everything great for when she was planning on moving in (August 24th), but she still refused literally because of the grout. We explained that we would all have to find a temporary living situation and pay to store our stuff (all of which will be common space items i.e. she will also be using everything), and she suggested that we just stop working for two weeks and go home instead. Ahh yes. I sometimes forget how simple missing out on an entire paycheck is along with paying for all these other things that will definitely cause me another full pacheck.

One of my other roommates, Sammy, is Arabic and says we should give her some slack as she has very strict and controlling Arabic parents, and we, all white, can't relate to that. I understand I'll never understand her specific relationship, especially since my parents were very hands off and made sure to always put a lot of responsibility on me, but I just feel as though it is so incredibly unfair that the rest of us live independently of our own parents, but are still being controlled by hers (who have never met us).

I already know I'm not living with her next year whether I leave or she does, but I really don't know how I'm going to keep it together this school year. I want to be patient and understanding, but this is the second time she has put herself above the rest of us for things that will not even affect her. 

WHAT DO I DOOOOOOOOOOO????? HOW DO I MAINTAIN CONSTANT COMPOSURE????

11,"Sometimes I feel really depressed about something, and it feels like it will consume me whole. Earlier today it set in how lonely I am and how I will just drink my whole life away. It hurt terribly and then a little later it went away completely. 

I try to experience the emotion again but it's like it is no longer there. One consequence of this is I lose all the negative emotions. I don't feel insecure about my usual things, but I also don't care about anything. 

It's not a bad feeling, I just feel content with what I am. But where did the insecurities go? I also get pretty cold on people, I just don't really care about anyone but myself at that point. Eventually, I revert back and feel insecure again, but not right now.",12Jul2018,1

13,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, just not sure where else I could post this.

So a long time ago I realized that I share more physical features with my uncle than I do with my father. I have rather light brown, kinda wavy hair, blue eyes, kinda wide nostrils, longer ears, the list goes on, most just like my uncle. My father had (passed away in 2010) pretty much jet black straight hair, thinner nose, green eyes, etc. These similarities are becoming more apparent as time passes. I think you see where I'm going with this. My cousins share a lot of the same similarities with my father.

The thing I find most obvious is that my uncle and I cant grow facial hair very much. Mostly thin wispy patches. Meanwhile my cousins and my father could grow thick dark beards like lumberjacks.

Anyways my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through my uncles facebook and found some pictures of when he was around 30 (hes about 45 now while I'm 23, father would be 49). Dude looks fucking exactly like me. So now I'm kinda freaking out and didn't know where else I could post about this. I don't want to ask my mother about it because I almost don't want to find out that my suspicions are true. I know that I could have just gotten more of my apparent genes from my grandmother and my mother, but its just the thought that there could have been some weird swinging going on in the 90s and my dad and uncle just ended up raising each others kids freaks me the fuck out. Either way he raised me so in the end he's still my dad.

Should I talk to my mother about this or just let the past go? 
Any advice would be appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read.",12Jul2018,1
14,"As the title says, I'm in quite a predicament. My stepson is buddies with the neighbor. Stepson is 4 and the neighbor kid is6 or 7 years old. He is at our house almost every day. It's to the point where it's annoying because we can't go in our back yard without this kid inviting himself over.  Yesterday I witnessed him try to do some pretty inappropriate and Concerning things to my stepson.  Concerning enough for me to question how or where a kid that age could learn this behavior. So... I looked at the sex offender registry and sure enough,  his father has been convicted of 2nd degree sexual assault of a child in the late 90's.I had no idea, so I've been completely friendly with him. Now I'm thinking he may be trying to befriend me just because we are the only house on the block with a small child besides his. 
1. How do I deal with telling them to basically stay the hell away from us without a confrontation and potentially pissing the guy off? I'm worried about my wife and stepson being home alone if this guy develops a grudge. Obviously he's capable of some pretty disgusting things. 
2. Should I report what I saw? I'm worried that the poor neighbor kid is being abused sexually or otherwise. I'm also worried that nothing will happen to the father and the abuse could become worse. 
3. Are there any laws about how close to an elementary school a child molesters can live? He is 4 or 5 houses from one. I'm assuming that since the sex offender registry lists his address that it's perfectly legal?
 Part of me says to just tell the neighbor's dad like it is, ""just stay away from my family, you shouldn't have to ask me why.""   Another part of me says, this guy isn't going to handle the situation rationally and I'll have even more to fear. Help!

20,"My parents never took us to the doctor for an annual checkup, we never had a family doctor and never went to the hospital for treatment, mostly because my parents don't have health insurance for their two kids and my mom is a narcissist. 

So far, I've survived a dog bite, 103 fever that lasted all night, a mastisis, a dislocated shoulder for two years and four years of knotted muscles in my shoulder. And a lot more. 

I could tell you how many times I've been to a hospital, like 10 times and three of those were to visit sick family members. 

Today, after 8months of dealing with abdominal pain and heartburn, my mother finally took me to the doctor. I went to the doctor for the same problem 8 months ago and they did the same thing as this time- refer us to a gastroenterologist. My mother never followed up 8months ago, I doubt she'll follow up now. 

Anyway, while I was with the doctor, I felt like I didn't need to be there at the hospital as I went over the symptoms. I don't want to remain in this mentality, where I feel like if I let myself rest for a few more days, a few more weeks, I'll get better on my own.

That's what my parents did to me, just let it rest until I stopped complaining. 

During the visit, I felt like I was wasting that doctor's time cause my symptoms didn't feel serious, I felt like I was just overreacting and I know that I probably wasn't. 

I don't want to do this/be like this because one day, I might have someone else's life in my hand and I don't want to be like 'oh it's just a small fever, you'll get over it' cause what if it's serious?

22,"I've worked with this girl for a couple of years now without incident, but  after going to work at another location for a while and then coming back  a few months ago, I've ended up developed strong feelings for her. We started hanging out outside of work about two months ago, but only with a few other coworkers there.

The other week I (half-jokingly) asked her to dinner and she accepted. She told me she'd ask a few of the guys from work if they wanted to come along too,  but when the night came she showed up alone and seemed a little caught  off-guard when I asked her if anyone else was coming (when we first went  into the restaurant she led me straight to a small booth). As nervous  as I was being one on one with her (I'm typically pretty quiet), it went  really well and we talked for something like two hours after the table  was cleared (she even brought up the subject of dating), and the waitress had even assumed we were together when she brought the cheque.

Body  language is something I'm still working on, but I noticed during the  night that she started playing with her hair a lot. While we work  together she regularly teases me (playfully oc) or might poke my back or side as she's walking by. I low-key called out her teasing during a  chat the other day and I think she started blushing, but I'm not totally  sure. I haven't really seen her behave this way around anyone else  (some others we work with think she's kind of mean/blunt but I've never  had a problem with her).

After our dinner  I asked if she'd like to go out again and she accepted; we're looking  at the upcoming week for that. On top of that we're planning on having  another group outing, so it looks like we're having our own separate  nights out now. Should I tell her that I like her then (thinking toward  the end of the night)? I have a nasty habit of overthinking and I'm  pretty cautious on stuff like this. I really like her as a friend too  and I don't want to risk messing that up or making work awkward, but I  feel like I can't sit on my feelings anymore. I don't wanna end up  mistaking friendliness for flirting, and I feel like I may just be  projecting a more hopeful scenario on what's been happening (but again, **huge** overthinker).

FWIW  her sister (also works with us) mentioned that she's pretty reserved  and doesn't often show interest in general. Also, I mentioned above that  she brought up the subject of dating while we were out: She told me  this story about how *she'd* once sat on  feelings for a friend of hers and ended up regretting not confronting  it and telling him sooner (he didn't like her back) and the hopeful part  of me wants to take that as a hint. She was also wondering whether I  was dating a female friend she'd seen me with back while I was working  on my transfer, and in retrospect it feels like she may have been scouting for info.

24,"So I was letting out this dog for the first time alone (I had met him once before in the owner’s home with the family and he was fine with me then). I think he didn’t recognize me and went into panic mode, since he’s usually super sweet. He is a Rottweiler mix (100+ lbs), but very calm tempered, lives in a home with children, etc. 

When I walked through the door he immediately started barking and growling, almost hissing. I have a dog at home and I could tell by his body language that he was on attack mode. This wasn’t “someone’s at the door” barking. He was about 6-7 feet from me and had his shoulders back and tail stiff.

My predicament is whether I should buy a slightly used 2018 Honda Accord for around $22,000 and only have a couple thousand left over, or a 2016/17 Mazda 6 with about 30,000 miles for around $14,000 and pocket about $11,000.  I could invest the excess money throughout college.  Would the Mazda last me long enough to be used for years after I graduate?  Or would the newish Honda be a better long term deal?",12Jul2018,1

31,"I have recently turned 18 years old. My mom and I fight constantly and it usually results in me getting kicked out for the night. She is extremely toxic and mean. Today she told me that she wished I were dead and that she can't wait till she never has to see me again. I'm at my wits end. I just can't take living in this house. 

I want to just pack my things but it isn't that simple. I do have a place to go which is great! I plan on getting my own phone and pay for service because she will not let me pay the one I have now. 

The only thing that is keeping me at this house is my car. When I was 16 I gave my mom the money to buy a car off of a friend. My mom put the title in her name. She will not let me take my car and says that if I leave with it she will report it stolen. I have even offered to pay for the car again if she would give me the title. 

What can I do? I am terrified to not have a car and to be living on my own. I would not have a way to get to my job or college.

33,"I'm writing this down here because I don't know what else to do. I get irrationally nervous around black people, and I don't know how to stop it. I do have a lot of anxiety so I get nervous around all people, but I would be lying if I said that my nervousness wasn't worse around (especially groups of young and male) black people. This does not happen with any other group of people and I don't think it was always the case with me either. 

What makes it especially terrible is that it's not ignorance, the rational part of my brain knows better. There have always been black people in my life ever since I was young growing up in a pretty diverse area. I have had  role-models,  teachers and friends who are black. In spite of this, around particularly new people, I still have a level of nervousness that is completely unjustified. I will be hanging out with a friend who is black and we will pass a black stranger on the street and I will notice an involuntary visceral response I have and I am disgusted with myself.

I just don't know what to do. I took an implicit bias test and it said if anything I had a positive bias towards black people, but I was obviously consciously trying to sway the results. I have gone out of my way to put myself in majority black situations, to consciously make myself a minority but nothing I do seems to make it go away. It gets better for a while but then it comes back.

I do struggle with mental health issues, and it's definitely possible that it is a component of the problem. I get trapped in these loops where I can't control my thoughts and they run away from me, there was a three year period of my life where I went to the bathroom every 15 minutes because I was so afraid of not being able to control my bladder. This obsessiveness might be related. The only plausible psychological explanation I can think of is that my family was robbed by a group of black men when I was younger, but that is no excuse for my modern day behavior. I need to be better.

It's my biggest fucking shame in the world and it's keeping me from being a person I can be proud of. I am so desperate to change, to be better, and I honestly don't know how I could possibly live with myself if I can't. To the black friends and acquaintances in my life, I am so sorry. You deserve better.

Sometimes I remind myself that this is probably true of way more (especially white) people than are willing to admit to themselves, but I know deep inside that's a terrible excuse. It needs to stop, and I wish I knew how to make it.",12Jul2018,11
34,"I'm graduating from university this December. However, I only have two classes. They are both Monday/Wednesday classes back-to-back. My SO lives 2 hours away, so I will most likely be going to my college town Monday morning and returning to his town Wednesday afternoon/evening. Which means I'm only going to be spending 2 nights and 3 days in my college town for the next few months.

I find renting an apartment for an entire year a waste of money and I don't want to deal with struggling to find a subleaser. I can't seem to find any subleases that end in December, they all end in July/August of 2019. Does anyone have advice on what I should do?

35,"I'm a little hesitant to post something on here, because it seems so many people have such higher stakes and far less selfish things to ask. Not to mention I'm a decent amount younger than a bunch of the OPs on this sub, but I want help and Reddit has been a good place so far.

To keep it brief, I'm an incoming senior in high school, and summer vacation has always been one of the worst times for me. I grew up in a weird school (K-8) in which I would only talk to less than twenty kids my age in a whole schoolyear, before moving to a brand new town two weeks before my freshman year and attending a regular public high school. That year was rough, not knowing anyone as well as being completely socially impaired, but I adjusted yadda yadda.

As it turns out, I'm a fairly good vocalist, and my sophomore year I got into the Jazz group, which is kind of the 'highest honor' of vocal music at my school per se. I even got to be pretty popular, a decent amount of people like me since I, thanks mostly to genetics rather than hard work, managed to become what they want to be. On stage, I have managed to get over 90% of any fear of performing, but I still have trouble talking to people personally. Specifically, in the summer, when I don't see people every day, I get to feeling really alone.

You see, almost everyone in choir is a girl, I'm a dude. The whole 'gayboy' stuff doesn't get to me, in fact I've embraced a lot of it and joke about it, but the problem is everyone knows I'm still not gay, and almost all my friends are girls. I'm very timid about asking people to hang out, and I have no idea how to even do it, and my situation is that all my better friends are girls (a lot of the guys are obnoxious to me, they scream, belt out the latest meme song grandayy posted or something, or this one kid who straight up pushes me, chokes me, etc.), and I don't think I can ask any of them to hang out in the summer without coming across as flirty to girls that are single or as coming onto a girl that is in a relationship.

A lot of this was me rambling, and I should probably just take a lot of it out, but I haven't kept up with like anyone I know so this has been the first place I've been able to talk about this all summer.

TL;DR My question got practically drowned out, but what I wanted to know mainly was how should I ask some of my friends to hang out without being weird? If it's unavoidable that it *might* come across as flirty, how can I try to not give anyone the wrong idea? I'm not the best looking guy in class, so unfortunately girls aren't making a line... *yet*. lol",12Jul2018,1
37,"Im 22/f and my best friend (let’s call her Jane also a 22/f mostly described as a very attractive go-getter) had started talking to this trans-girl on tumblr (let’s call her Sam 22/f) which moves on to them talking on the phone, texting, etc. and they started to date.

 Sam lived in another state pretty far away from where me and Jane lived, so she bought a ticket to come visit Jane and meet me. Jane had let me see photos of Sam before, but meeting her in person was a complete and utter shock. To be blunt, Sam looks like a classic neck beard (to be clear I have nothing against the trans or lgbtq community) but I brushed it off and supported them the best i could. During this time, my friend had recently left another relationship and was in a bad apartment under a lot of stress. Sam of course went back home and I learned that Sam still lives with her parents. 

She had got her parents approval and had offered Jane to come live with her in the parents home. I immediately told Jane not to jump so quickly to live with someone especially someone you’ve been with only been with for 4 months. The situation itself seemed odd to me anyways but i told Jane if that's what she really wanted to do to go ahead. Out of what I feel was desperation, Jane decided to go ahead and move into Sam's house and drove 26 hrs there with her belongings. They have been together for almost a year now and Sam and Jane share Sams childhood bedroom and live with her parents still. 

While my best fiend works to save money because she wants them to live in their own apartment, Sam still doesn’t work, and plays video games all night and day.  Sam continuously makes wasteful purchases like fortnite emotes, a new gaming screen, a switch, games, taco bell, the list goes on… and Sam continues to do it despite Janes disapproval which eventually she just accepts. Eventually my friend got injured at work and was laid off so now they’re both unemployed. 

Jane doesn’t know a single person in the State they live in and had no friends at work so the only one she talks to is me, her friends online (Sams friends who she also introduced to Jane), and of course Sam. She constantly posts online how she’s lonely and misses having friends and I try my best to still talk to her as much as I can. I had asked Jane about coming back to my state, that I could help her find work and help her go back to college. She very much says she wants to move back here and live with sam to move back with Sam but currently doesn’t have the money. Sam doesn’t want to move to where i live, but rather in a State where only Sams online gaming friends live. 

She also had told Jane she doesn’t want to move because she hates the weather in this State despite never going outside anyways. Sam and Jane currently sit and play video games all day and night living at Sam's parents while Jane has to drive Sam (Sam also does not know how to drive nor had a driver's license) to go get Taco Bell to eat which seems to be most of their meals. I’m horrified to see my friend so depressed and without a social life anymore. She is still a very fit, attractive woman and I can’t believe she’s living like this. I asked Jane if Sam is working, that way they could save money easier while jane is unemployed to move but she informed me that Sam doesn’t work because of her anxiety and that she gets money from Social Security disability. Sam also does not have a high school diploma, and had dropped out of high school...

My friend constantly gushes about how much she loves Sam and how perfect they are and how she wants to get married but I feel like this relationship is very unhealthy. She seems to genuinely enjoy Sam and i have been continually supportive to her with the relationship. I don’t know how I can convince her to get away from this situation since I know if I express how I feel about Sam she’ll shut me out as a friend. She has already stopped talking to me mostly and seems distant toward me and I really don’t want to make it worse by hating her so called “wife”. I know eventually she’ll realise how unhealthy this is for her but i hate to see her wasting her time and life. Am i being too judgemental or is this really messed up?

TLDR; best friend started dating &amp; moved in with this transgirl who still lives with her parents, refuses to work, dropped out of high school, on social security, games all day and night and wastes money. How can i help my friend leave?

38,"Long time lurker, first time poster. But I feel like this ""little"" dilemma warrants a post. 

So, to start off, I'll start from the beginning to where it started. So this best friend of mine, I met her in our first year of college in this class we were required to take. We sat next to each other and after breaking the ice, we instantly click and became best friend within the next few days. Honestly, this is the best friend that I have ever had. We would hang out a ton, more often just the two of us. We would do all kind of things like study together, go bowling, discover new places downtown. 

I initially talked to her because I though she was cute. But during the first week, when she took me to a park nearby to gaze upon the night lights downtown, she told me she had a boyfriend. They had been dating for about a month before we got there. I was kind of sad but I knew she would be soon my best friend so I didn't really care. 

Honestly, she's been a great friend. She always cheers me up, is always up to do something, just an all around joy to be around. She has definitely made me a better person. I constantly catch myself feeling shame whenever I know i do something she doesn't approve of. She always pushes me to do my best and for all of that I made it my mission to always see her smile.

Then her boyfriend broke up with her early spring quarter. I helped her through it the best I could and to this day she still misses him somewhat but continues to reject his efforts. Other guys have tried talking to her but she would typically only hang out with them as a friend, often stating that she wasn't looking for a relationship. I didn't try anything because at the beginning of the quarter I had started talking to this wonderful girl. 

This girl and I hit it off well and even had a few intimate nights together. But nothing ever came out of it. She began to revert to not wanting a relationship. But I foolishly continued my feeble attempts at dating her. It was working for a bit but then some other guy from her old high school came in and fought me for her heart. We ended in a draw at the end of spring quarter. She now is talking to neither of us and is taking the summer of from everything. Nonetheless, I was left heartbroken because we had grow so close but I am sure that she won't return.

A month into summer break and I now fear I feel something for my best friend. I feel like I may actually be interested in her. When I picked her up the other day to go swimming, I had butterflies in my stomach- a feeling I haven't felt since middle school. I have toyed with the idea of dating her and... it just made sense. But I fear that I may be feeling this way because of my recent heart break. I feel like in some way, my brain is reaching out to the nearest person to some type of pleasure again.

I'm not to sure on what to do. I want to ask her out but I feel like she's not ready for that. I want to tell her about how I feel but at the same time I don't want to ruin our friendship if it doesn't play out as I would wish it would. I am going off social media so we probably won't have much contact anyways which makes me want to just profess my feelings. 

Any ideas as to what I should do?",12Jul2018,1
40,"My mom was recently engaged to an abusive alcoholic for a couple years. During those years he secretly drank behind her back since she would of left him and he has done everything to isolate her from friends and family.

About 2-3 months ago he gets arrested for a dui while picking her up from work and she leaves him. He has 5 kids and moves into a hotel room with them. During his stay at the hotel the kids are taken by cps because of him fighting with everyone else and likely because of him abusing them too. We had previously planned on calling cps because the kids would honestly be better off, they were better off in foster homes before this. During the months they've been broken up he's been constantly up her ass or threatening her. 

Today my mom makes a post on Facebook saying ""if anything happens to me, my house or my kids then he(used his full name) did it"". She tells me that he will not leave her alone about trying to get one of their dogs, but he just moved in with some woman he barely knows so she doesn't want him to take him yet. He starts threatening her and also tells her that if anyone says anything about him or does anything like contact cps he will find me and my sister's and kill us. A couple hours later my mom comes home from work and the dog is gone. He broke into her yard and took the dog. She doesn't want to contact police for the dog, she's hoping that he'll leave her alone now and she has no other way to prove he took the dog other than the texts.

I want to contact the police but I'm terrified for my mom, her home and her other dogs. He's been violent with her before so I'm absolutely terrified of him hurting or even killing her. I feel soo lost because I feel like I can't just sit here while he threatens her and my sisters.

42,"I met my boyfriend almost one year ago through the internet. We started dating about 3 months after meeting and few weeks after, I encouraged him to have our first sexual experience through call. I have to admit I was (and sadly still am) very insecure about expressing my sexual desires. So I remember telling him I felt guilty about desiring him sexually and I felt so bad because I knew it was not ""appropiate"", but at the same time I wanted to do it. So since then I've been kinda uncomfortable with the fact that the day I confessed that I liked him I told him I had a wet dream with him and then I soon also encouraged him to have a sexual experience. He traveled to my country to meet me this year, we didn't have sex (my mother told me not to) but I felt rather guilty because we tried to do oral but it didn't go nicely. I'm so guilty also because I had the wonderful idea to tell it to my mother and she got disappointed back then and somehow it makes me feel uncomfortable that my mother knows I had oral sex with my bf in her house.... for some reason this fact makes me feel like I won't be able to enjoy sex in the future with him...

The thing is that sometimes I wonder if it was better to have waited more until confessing my sexual desires to him because somehow I feel our relationship cannot be ""serious"" because of that ""mistake"" of mine. Even though he's serious about our relationship and we're planning meeting again next year, somehow I feel... I ""ruined"" the inocence of the beginning and I wonder if it's okay to have sex with him next time we meet... even though I want to. But when I see other couples whenever is a movie or some inocent, cute and adorable couple I feel guilty ""why didn't I wait longer....??"" 

I know this is not normal. I just want to feel normal towards sex but I feel so guilty IDKW :((",12Jul2018,1
43,"That's my goal. I'm asking because from what I've heard, doing it too much can drain you of your testosterone and makes it more difficult to have sex, and well, I don't want that. There's really no other reason. Idk why I should even bother quitting when I know for a fact I'm not going to be having sex at all anytime soon, but I feel like I'll be able to respect myself just a little bit more if I quit. Plus, when sex *does* coming around (whatever fucking year that'll be), maybe it'll go much better than how it did last time. I can't afford to have what happened last time occur again, especially since I'm attending college later next month.

So, any advice on quitting? It's not so much a problem that I'll go out of my way or cancel plans to masturbate, but if there's nothing fucking going on, I'm like ""meh, maybe I'll rub one out real quick"". But once the idea comes to mind, it's harder to get it off than you think.",12Jul2018,1
46,"So, I'm a teenager, 14 (almost 15), female. I spend a lot of time online because I don't have many friends, and stay in my room drawing a lot.
I'm pretty quiet, don't like talking to people, and just generally enjoy being left alone.

My family doesn't understand this.
Yesterday, as I was drying my hair after a shower, my grandmother  came in, without knocking, while I was shirtless, and wouldn't leave or stop talking until I slammed the door.

Yesterday night, as I was watching a YouTube video and getting ready for bed, my aunt came in, once again, without knocking. She saw me with my shirt barely on, my laptop open, and panicking *because I was shirtless.* She immediately assumed I was sending nudes, and asked me why my laptop was open, barely letting me explain. 

Today, I was heading to my local cafe to do some sketching, and told my grandpa to let him know.
He asked me if I was meeting anyone. 
""You assume I have friends in this area.""
""Just checking if you're meeting up with anyone from the internet.""
Yes, grandfather. I am meeting my Craigslist drug dealer at 2 pm on a Wednesday, in broad daylight.
 
10 minutes ago, my grandfather came into my room, and I shut my laptop, hoping he wouldn't ask me what site I was on. (YouTube, but then he'd ask me who I watch, if they're appropriate for ""little girls"", and if he could see it. Alas, he asked me, once again, ""why do you always shut your laptop when I come in?"" and proceeded to give me his usual 5 minute lecture on how there's bad stuff on the internet, bad people, things that a ""little girl"" shouldn't see, not to share personal info, etc. 

It's super stressful, a huge cause of anxiety, makes me feel unsafe in my own room, invasive, disrespects boundaries, and makes me feel untrusted.

The worst part? There's this really cute girl my age who works at my local cafe. We share interests, she's super nice, and I think she's into me. The problem? I really, *really*, *REALLY* want to ask this girl out, but I'm terrified that my family wouldn't allow me to date, be alone with her for more than 5 minutes, call her without their permission, or even let me go to the cafe anymore.

47,"What I believe started as Food Poisoning from a bad burger on the fourth, has turned into almost a week of endless pain and sweats. There is pain to the point where I sometimes can't even get up to perform regular tasks. I am a 17 year old female, and I woke up last Thursday(?) night in an AWFUL cramping pain to the point where I was crying. It was the last day of my period so I just figured my cramps intensified for some unknown reason, until I got up and was hit with a massive headache, fever, and immediate dizziness. (TMI coming up) I went to the restroom and had watery diarrhea and could barely pass it. I looked up my symptoms and I came up with food poisoning. I didn't notice that the burger I bit into the other night was still a bit pink until I had already swallowed some. I figured 48 hours and I'll be ok, right? Wrong. The cramps turned into unbearable trapped gas that still causes occasional cramps and makes it to where I can barely walk. Headaches got more intense, I am sweating at night now and had a WHOLE day of sitting on the toilet with diarrhea. I can go all of the waking day without feeling sick, maybe the occasional gas. But at night, its like I go into sick mode and cant eat, cant sleep from the pain of trapped gas, and most recently, it hurts my ribs when i breathe in.

I don't blame them, but sometimes it does its part in making me feel very lonely and on my own.

51,"So my boyfriend had a fling with a girl who we’ll call Ivy. They hooked up a few times and she had more feelings for him that he did for her. He “rejected” her or whatever to date me. I’m not friends with her I’ve never met her, she lives in a city an hour and a half away. 

It’s been about a year and a half of dating. Ivys fb profile was recommended to add as a friend. I would never add her because that’d be super weird but I creeped a bit. She posted photos in just a bodysuit (like a bathing suit thing but it’s an actual article of clothing), in a super slutty Halloween outfit, and a few of her selfies have major cleavage and very obviously meant to be “sexy” photos. These were all posted within about three months after we started dating and he liked them. There’s about ten of these photos that show he liked them. 

I think she was changing her privacy settings because now the photos aren’t showing up when I look her up. So he liked them because he knew they were private which means I wouldn’t have ever seen that he did. 

Am I being dramatic or crazy for feeling super insecure about it? This past year I’ve gained a lot of weight and I’ve been feeling super insecure. He never posts photos of us...he says for privacy concerns but he posts so much on fb about everything else. Before we were official he had been hooking up with other girls but lied to me about them until maybe a month into our relationship where it all came out because of something a friend of mine found out from one of the girls (she’s a mutual friend). I just assume worst case scenario that he likes the attention of other girls and wants to give the illusion that he’s single.

59,"I hit a deer about a month ago when driving home and since then, I've been deeply traumatized. When it happened, two deer seemingly came out of nowhere and I hit one of them. The doe didn't die right away, so the police came and had to put it down. I've always been really cautious of deer, and I was even thinking about them during that drive home. I told myself to drive slow and to keep my eye out for one, but then I hit one anyways. I never thought this would happen to me, and I didn't think it would take so long to get over it. I'm such an animal lover, and to see that deer lying in the road (I had to drag it to the side) with it's leg broken, skin scraped down to the spine, making weird breathing noises, and it trying to get up to run away totally broke my heart.
I'm not sure what to do at this point. I thought that I would be over it by now, but it really affects my driving now. I specifically avoid driving at that time at night and I drive super slow in the area where I hit it.

66,"We had a school trip a month or 2 ago, and it has caused me a lot of pain. I was sent away on a plane home because I couldn't handle social stress, guilt, and other things I can't explain in public. This girl was a big part in my life for 3 years. I never went further than just close.friends, I liked it that way, I can't sustain a relationship, so why would I ever go further? However, during the trip, I've learned so much, especially about people. Because of my troubles I had to talk to a ton of people, it was my only way out of a breakdown (which in the end still happened, ironically because I talked to my closest friend), so I also had to tell people about how I liked that girl (she wasn't the primary reason, just a contributing factor, of my depression at the time). So everyone Ive talked to this year knows who I used to like. I'm almost over her, and I've let go of the past, but I can't let go off the secrets that keep hurting me.

I feel guilty because she's so unaware of anything, but she does want to know what happened to me during the trip, and why I got sent home. She dares not to ask, but I feel like It's unjust that everyone knows I liked her, but she still has no clue. Of course I wouldn't tell her about the whole trip, Id only tell her I liked her. 

I just need to know if it's the right move. I don't want to make anymore mistakes after the school trip, because that trip already psychologically destroyed me. It's just that I can't live with the guilt, every time I see her, the wound just opens back up, and it pains me that I can't get over it until she knows.

If I sound like I'm overexaggerating, I'm sorry, but I've had sleepless nights where I just can't think clearly because of the guilt I feel.

Should I tell her?

ps: I know if I'd tell her it'd be subtle and not too direct, I know my way around that sort of stuff, the question is not how, but if I should tell her.",12Jul2018,1

Situation: currently transitioning out of my current job to focus on other interests. 
My work requires a lot of fine tuned sensory functions that need to be developed. As well as critical thinking to efficiently handle the workload without getting overwhelmed. 

I'm struggling with the new employee not being able to grasp the ideas I'm presenting and also not following directions and attempting to do things his own ways without using my guidelines. It seems that I have to repeat myself constantly in order for something to happen. And I really absolutely hate micromanaging and hovering as I just think that's a very disrespectful way to manage a person. 

I will have to say that My method is a bit......not formed hahaha. My motto is to figure it out yourself (basically diy approach) And that's how I was able to get to my current standing. I wanted to instill that into the new employee but think that I am not supervising enough to allow the basic skills to develop. 

I plan to have a meeting with him to figure out the best way he can learn and the best way I can teach.

I live across the country from him and the rest of my family (I’m in Washington, they’re in the Midwest.). I moved about two years ago and have spent the last year working at my dream job at a library. My immediate thought was to move back, or at least somewhere closer, so that I could be there for my stepdad and my mom and sisters. But moving is a huge expense that I can’t spare now or soon and my family can’t help with, and I’m afraid of derailing my career when I’ve only just gotten started in my field. I don’t have enough experience in this field to have stand much of a chance getting comparable positions back home. Additionally, my mom is an incredibly toxic and irresponsible person (emotionally/verbally abusive, hasn’t worked for most of my life due to various “health issues,” completely financially inept to the point that she and my stepdad don’t even have a working phone because she always stops paying the bill, etc.), and is a lot of the reason I’ve always wanted to live so far away.

One year down and I am not doing well.  I am really struggling to make any real friends. Definitely no romantic relationships going on either.  I am extremely home sick. The area is great but tough. Everybody is competing for everything. 

I finally managed to get an awesome apartment that tons of people would love to have in this town. Great location. . All the goods.

I am desperately trying to find a higher paying job to justify my insane rent. 

Even if I was making more money though I still miss  my friends, family and just the east coast. I could probably find a job back home pretty easily and start making things happening. 

But I won’t be here anymore. I put a lot of effort into making this move happen. I sacrificed everything. I’ll be giving up this incredible lifestyle that many people are envious of.

Over the summer though she went on a three week trip to Spain, and as she finishes her 3rd week, has grown from the shy, timid girl with mental health issues last year into a bold, confident, young woman ready to take on the world.

I DO have a few friends back home, but I live quite a ways a way right now so I do not really get to see them. But where I am, I often go many days at a time without seeing anyone. In highschool, I never had this problem. I was not wildly popular, but I had quite a bit of friends, did theatre (which I no longer have time for, as I work to support myself), and was overall quite happy. Maybe worth mentioning is that I feel the culture where I currently live is very different than my home. I want to have friends and things here but Im unsure as to how. I work as a server, so my hours are late and unpredictable, so getting involved in any student organizations would not be possible at the moment.

She does not speak English and none of her caretakers speak her language, so she cannot ask for food, the bathroom, etc. She has been in this home for less than a month and already has bed sores and unexplained bruising. Her caretakers have admitted to being unable to communicate with her in a meaningful way and because they don't want to wait for her to use the bathroom, they  catheterized her. I don't speak her language but I could tell that she was begging me to empty her urine bag. When I went to ask a caretaker to help me, they told me that she had to wait 2 hours until it was time to be emptied so they could measure it. I know she isn't being fed well and she is left alone all day with no one to speak to.

99,"Thank you for coming here. This might be a bit long; I feel really lucky to have a platform where someone can read this and provide an unbiased opinion and I thank you \*so\* much for your time.

I'm sick of what's happening. I'm sick of it especially because it is incredibly dumb and I should not be letting this plague my head. I go to a top-ten college and there are a lot of...really self-centered people here. Not to say that people are bad, but specifically romantically, it tends to be hard to find someone who actually cares and someone who is genuine. I have had a history of dating and being in love with very toxic people - including someone in my college - and I genuinely think that that's over.

Maybe I know this because there is a guy I have had feelings for since the day I met him, and he is certainly not an asshole. I honestly tend to be incredibly hard on myself about my goals, plague my head with intrusive thoughts and compare myself to those around me, and my college is great but also  a boiling pot of stress. This guy is calm, kind, gifted, handsome, hardworking - incredibly shy about his emotions, but certainly one of the only truly nice guys I have liked. He is amazing, but he is a ""simple"" guy, and he cares about me. But I don't think he likes me. He is the first guy I have met who all my friends love and we apparently look like we're a perfect pair; I know beyond anything that we would make a great, sustainable relationship, and I don't just mean this emotionally but also objectively. I do think we definitely bring out the best in each other. He shares things with me about his life that he says he has never been able to share with anyone before, and whenever anything close to bad happens, he texts me about it. He feels guilty too - recently he got intoxicated and texted me saying he feels like he is exploiting my kindness or burdening me by telling me some very serious things about his life, and I obviously told him that's not the case. He generally doesn't want to ""burden"" anyone, but he does nothing but bring a smile to my face. Always.

Many of my friends by that point were convinced he likes me, but I did tell him I liked him. It was a day after we went for a little dinner and he ended up paying for us, and this was about 6-7 months ago. I am the opposite - very expressive - and I mayyyy have made it ill-timed as hell but I couldn't keep it from him anymore. he said he has a lot going on in his life and he can't treat me right at this point. That to me sounded like he perhaps just doesn't like me but cares too much to be harsh. Well we kept talking after a tiny break and it was alright - light conversations, very deep conversations, but no mention of anything love related. After a point we both kind of forgot about that confrontation and I even dated an asshole in the middle (he didn't know much about it till the asshole and I broke up bcs we just didnt talk beyond a snap streak in that period). 

Well, it's been a few months since that breakup and we have been talking a bit more again and he says really nice things to me about how much he trusts me and how he has not had a person he can trust like he trusts me - it warmed my heart to hear these things, but in the process it melted my heart too and well, at the same time it really sounds like he is friendzoning me. It was hard to get over him the first time...but did I ever truly get over him? I don't know. He doesn't discuss other girls with me or anything and truth be told when we do talk, it does sound more and more like he likes me too, in that he double texts and tries to engage me if he starts thinking I am not going to respond, so yes we talk a lot, but honestly I have to initiate everything. Last time we went for dinner before summer, he literally forgot about and missed a meeting with his water polo team to be with me a few more minutes - but again, I initiated. I was the one who asked him to dinner. He stays up to talk to me, but I always text first. He does not ever ask to take things forward, to call, to meet, but if he is drunk and sees me leaving the party, he would ask multiple times if I want him to drop me back home safely. He only texts me once he is done with his other work, but he tells me about his day...yeah. This is frustrating, and given that he is genuinely a nice guy, maybe he just sees me as a good friend. (oh and when he was drunk and saying nice things he called me unique and his ""friend for life""). I'm sick of initiating, hoping, coping, and I'm sick of uncertainty. I'm sick of not knowing what he feels.

Well, I somewhere thought he is like this out of shyness since I'm definitely far more expressive, but these things are making it more and more likely that's not the case in my head. And that hurts, but honestly, this is not just plain heartbreak. I'm not crying right now, and I'm not crushed - rather, I'm trying to figure out if this is because there are other ways he would and I would be happier; ways other than being together. This is confusion, certainly, and also disappointment. I'm not sad he doesn't like me back like I would maybe be with a crush. I'm losing faith in good because I know WE would be fantastic. I don't feel as magnetically for him as I have for my exes, who were toxic and terrible, but I think I feel something genuine for him. A connection, more love than attraction and...I'm just disappointed that we might not be all the things we could be. I'm sad that someone I cry for when he is feeling down may not want this, and that I could cry in my room when he went through a struggle in his life, but I still misunderstood him in this bond. And perhaps it is true that there are plenty other fish in the sea and that I have many more chances in my life, but with him, that's really not the point. I genuinely thought with him it's something else. but maybe I'm just crazy. Yeah. And maybe I'm still misinterpreting him, and maybe I am overthinking far too much but that's testament to how stuck I feel right now. And I don't know what I am asking of you, because I don't know what the question should be - maybe it would really help if you could blatantly say what's in your head. Any advice would really help me, and anything ( other than pity :/) would be so, so helpful. Thank you so much again for reading this!",12Jul2018,0
100,"Posting on mobile, sorry for formatting.

In November I was engaged to my high school sweetheart. We had been together for 8 years and I was overjoyed when he asked me to marry him. I agreed, of course, and we began planning a beautiful future together. I am both a domestic violence and a rape survivor and the balance and stability he brought to my life were amazing. I was so excited to have it forever. 

In May he left me. For a lot of reasons, primarily he thought I was putting too much effort into school (I’m trying to get into Medical School). I decided that as much as I loved him and felt like I needed him, I wanted my education more. I agreed to call off the wedding. 

Recently more and more of my friends are getting engaged and married. As much as I want to feel happy for them, all I feel is bitter. I have flat out told some of them to not invite me to their weddings. I’m jealous that they get to have what was taken away from me. I’m jealous of their happiness and as awful as it is to say, I want their engagements to fail too so that i’m not alone in the pain that I feel. 

I want to be supportive of my friends, but how do I get away from the pain that keeps me bitter?

TL;DR Fiancé left me and I can’t be happy for my friends getting married. ",12Jul2018,0
101,"I’m at the end of my rope, and I have been for years now. Since I was 14 or so I’ve always felt my life would end in suicide. Last year was the closest I’ve gotten, holding a toaster above the bathtub. The only reason I didn’t go through with it is because I wasn’t 100% sure it would kill me. It may have left me worse off.

I’m completely ostracized from my family - they are rabid trump supporters and resent everything I stand for. I grew up with their christianity and found my own way, but it has left me nothing but hopeless to know that I am evil in their eyes. Every little bit of news I here drives me insane, it feels like the country is collapsing around me. I have nowhere to go. Aside from family I have little, a dead end job that doesnt pay enough, a useless degree, one good friend, and a girlfriend of two years (who I love more than anything). I feel like an alien everywhere I go, I’ve never felt like I belonged anywhere.

I’m not looking for the fucking hotline. I’ve been to therapy and it didn’t do shit - because I’m not insane, things are just that bad. I’d be willing to try again, but I don’t make enough money (America) and our healthcare system is not there for anything but fucking us over more. In 3 more months I will start getting health insurance from my job and I’d be willing to try. But I don’t want to go on like this for that long.

For those wondering, I have struggled with depression most of my life. I don’t believe I have depression any longer, which is an unusual feeling I’m still coming to terms with, but that has only left more room for my explosive anxiety disorder to peel through.

The biggest problem is I don’t think I want anything to do with this society. America expects you to bleed yourself dry for those up top, or be condemned as some leech. I want to provide real value to the world and myself, and I do not see any possible way for me to achieve that. I’ve grown so hopeless that I don’t even know what I want any more. I just want to sleep.

103,"Ive come to the point where I value my cat more than my family (speaks miles about our relationships doesnt it?) And now they want to get rid if my cat because of hygiene issues and non of them are valid, I just turned 18 and now theyre just saying stuff like, ""Its time to grow up, learn to be an adult and get rid of it"" 

I just cant do it, my cats always been with me no mattee what, at times itd be my only friend (Im a very anti-social person) and now its just hurting me more and more. This more has to do with my relationships, with my friends and my girlfriend I could chat and talk for ages and have a good time but my relationship with my parents and family feels sterile, the most it goes is a ""How are you doing?"", ""What are you doing?"", ""Hey"". Hell I havent even talked to my brother who moved out 2 years ago.

Its odd everyone in the family gets a long woth each other yet I dont. I just feel like Im being cast aside because of things like my actions and different hobbies, Im a guy but I dont do sports because of disinterest. My tastes are a bit geeky (comics, games, tech, anime, manga). Im constantly blamed for not being masculine or strong enough to do things and it just undermines the other things I am good at, I love to write, I love to analyze, I love more dare I say, intellectual things and it just doesnt fit with them.

104,"hi there im a 19yo female. 
my dad was in jail for my whole childhood and my mom worked &amp; partied a lot so she became good friends with our neighbor (Mike) who spent a lot of time at the bar she worked at. he was old and i called him pappy because he reminded me of my moms dad who i never met but heard only good about him and that was my pappy mike! 
well my sister left for college when i was 3 so mike would get me on and off the bus to school. 
eventually mike started watching me on the regular. he taught me EVERYTHING and fed me my meals, taught me how to braid my hair, etc.  only because my mom wasnt there for me. 
he isnt a creepy old man or anything ik to some this would sound awkward.
i knew his entire family and went to their family parties and everything. 
sadly mike passed away when i was shy of 9. i was super young. but he took care of me for 7+ years and i just wont ever forget him for giving me a good influence. all my memories are with him. 

anyway i fell out of touch with his family and found old photos of him and me i want to show his granddaughter and to see if they remember me &amp; thank them. 
is that weird to do so when i havent spoken to his family since i was 11? i don't know why i want to. i know its crazy to appreciate someone who passed unrelated to you so young but i really never had an adult in my life but him.  should i just go for it? ",12Jul2018,19

I just don’t want the same thing. He won’t accept the break up. Crazy right? That means he’s still pretending like we’re together. I’m seriously worried.

I was absolutely disgusted that’s when I started losing feelings for him. I’m scared if he will do the same thing to me just because I don’t want to be with him anymore. Guys please help me.

115,"Sorry the post is long! (Deleting later) 

I also just want to say that I've tried therapy many times and it's just been thousands of dollars down the drain, so I'm not really up for trying that again any time soon.

Background: 

I'm 25 (F), and have had little to no friends throughout my life. When I did have ""friends"" back in grade school they typically always bullied me. My ""best friend"" and only ""friend"" in high school had borderline personality disorder, so she was a complete... There's not even a word to describe her other than saying that my mom still calls her Satan. In every relationship I've had, besides w/ my family, I get treated poorly. Every friendship is a bullying situation, and in every romantic relationship I've been beaten, raped, and/or sexually assaulted by them. Or one of their friends (this has happened 3 fucking times!) feels the need to grope my crotch when my date leaves my side for a couple minutes. I get no respect from people, b/c I have low self-esteem and people sense that. 

Current Situation:

I think I've finally made a couple friends? I feel in my heart that I can never be true friends with them though. I'm settling for less than ideal, b/c I know I will likely never attain any better with my ptsd, severe social anxiety, depression, and overall fear of being abused again.

The 1st friendship, let's call him Bruce, is just so wrong on SO many different levels! I really enjoy his company and we get along really well, but he's my high school boyfriend's friend (i know). This ex was sexually and physically abusive to me. On one occasion he punched me in the face until i was bleeding and Bruce witnessed it (along with others), and did nothing to stop it. I think everyone watching was frozen in shock, but I still harbor negative feelings that no one stepped in especially Bruce now that we're trying to be friends. Bruce did help me get back to my car by driving me though, which makes me feel a little better i guess. 

ON TOP OF THIS, around 5 years ago I went through a hyper-sexual period after one of my rapes, and I ended up sleeping with Bruce. Clearly we weren't going to be just friends after that. He had feelings for me but knew I didn't feel the same, so we've kept in contact on and off ever since either hanging out once a year, sending memes to each other, or helping each other get through difficult times. A few months ago we planned to hangout again. We were going out on dates. I wasn't ecstatic w/ that dynamic and told Bruce repeatedly that I just want friendship, but he kept paying for me for everything and wouldn't let me pay! I went along with it b/c I didn't want to lose him. I decided I was okay w/ it as long as it didn't become serious. But then he sent flowers! To my parent's house! Where I live! He knew I was living with them too. He kept asking for my address saying that he wanted to send me flowers for my birthday, and I kept telling him ""No, I really don't want flowers or a gift."" I thought once my birthday passed he would drop the idea. It embarrassed me in front of my whole family! They started asking me questions about my new boyfriend. I had to say I didn't have one. I was pissed, so I confronted him. He then confessed his undying love for me! He said he plans to wait for me b/c anyone else is just settling and he wants to eventually convince me to be with him! I told him to never talk to me again. That obviously didn't happen though. Bruce told me that he can stuff his feelings down, like he stuffs everything down, b/c he really wants me in his life even if it's as friends. I believe he'll actually try to be my friend this time, but I really don't know if we're sustainable, given all that's happened. He does truly make me a happier person, and I want him around permanently, because we really click and understand each other on a somewhat deeper level. It would be devastating to me to actually lose him, because he's always been there for me when I'm low in life. 

My 2nd friendship is with this guy, let's call him Bill, that I met here on reddit on a different account where I typically post stuff about my sexual assaults. Bill noticed a post and started messaging me. We eventually decided to share numbers and it led to what basically every encounter I have with a male that's greater than a two sentence conversation turns into. A sexual relationship. We live really far away from each other, so he called it off and I agreed that it was a good idea b/c realistically we'll never be together. Granted it was just phone sex, but it was meaningful to me. Bill is the only sexual partner I've had where things didn't go sour. He was caring and understanding about my ptsd. He actually cared if I enjoyed it, instead of being selfish like the majority of people I've been with. This is one of the reasons why I'm having trouble being his friend. I don't like Bill romantically anymore, and I know our personalities would clash in a relationship, but every time he talks about being with new people it kills me inside. I don't know if I'll ever get over it. It's this sentimental loss for me when he talks about dates he's going on. I feel like a jealous, possessive ex-girlfriend... but we've never dated or even met. I know it's just because of my low self esteem and lack of intimacy that I'm feeling this way. I really value him as a friend, so how can I stop this feeling? 

Another issue I've been having in my relationship with Bill is that he gives me unsolicited advice and acts like a parent towards me. It doesn't help me b/c I don't think his ideas for my life are fitting for me. The advice he gives me always seems so condescending. He revealed to me that he thought this was what his ex felt he was doing to her too, and that that is why she broke it off. It's really annoying and often infuriates me to the point that I want to break it off with him too! Like when I mention things I want to change in my life. I told him I didn't have a hobby and wanted one, and that I wanted a new job. He gave me unsolicited advice on what hobbies to take up and condescending advice on what type of job I should be going for. Now it's like every time I talk to him, he asks ""So, did you get a hobby yet?"" and ""So, did you update your resume yet? The way he does it reminds me of a parent asking their kid if they did their homework yet.

TLDR: One friend 10 yrs ago witnessed my ex beat me and didn't stop it, I slept with him 5 yrs ago, we just started hanging out again after years of off and on contact, he confessed his love for me so I stopped talking to him, and then he decided to stuff his feelings down so we can be friends. With the other friend I had phone sex with and that was the only decent sexual relationship I've ever had, he called it off but we decided to be friends, him moving on makes me feel possessive and like I'm not good enough, he also treats me like he's a parent and gives me bad unsolicited advice.

I declined attending university because of this reason, I don't know what to major in/what I want to do. I've had ideas, business, LEO, medical field, etc. but nothing concrete. 

Hopefully that context can allow for a little advice... I'm not depressed or anything, I just feel like I don't have a purpose at the moment and I wish I could see what I was working towards. I've thought about joining the military as an alternative, but I don't think that's the life for me. 

I want to be successful in life (financially, mentally, etc.) and I want to feel like I'm making a difference in the world/helping others through charitable donations, work, etc. My most common idea has been to get a business degree because they can be applied to a lot of different careers, but I'm still unsure.

I have been drinking the whole day prior to going to the party and I went to the party completely drunk when going to the party I drink even more and got shit face beyond comprehension and apparently was a little over the top 

Now at work most of them have been giving me a sort of cold shoulder or attitude when I talk to them and others don’t want me to come hang out when there is another social get together 

Is there a way to fix this in a way for them to consider me part of the group again or no

124,"Hey Reddit,

So I live in a place where the housing market is heavily impacted (top 10 most expensive in US) and where housing is at a shortage.

I was the one that spent a few months looking for the house and arranging everything for me to get the house. When I got the house, I obviously needed roommates so I was the one that gathered all the roommates.

Furthermore, I was also the one that had to deal with those that bailed, collecting money for deposit, driving back and forth from my current place (hour away) multiple times to meet with landlord, etc.

Anyways, ends up that one of the rooms that will be a single is like 1.25 (1.5 is really pushing it) times bigger than the others.

We are splitting the room prices evenly, and I legitimately feel that I deserve the larger room for all the work and effort I have put into getting the house and rounding everything and everyone up.

Is that unfair of me? Do I deserve it? Am i being entitled for no reason? Should I pay extra? I don’t feel like I should. I Just feel like I did tons of work and I get absolutely no reward while everyone would just respond to me when they get like it.

tl;dr - I found a house and got all the roommates so I think I should get biggest room. Yeah?",12Jul2018,2
125,"Guys, I've just read in the book from the Harvard Psychologist - Shawn Achor (Book:The Happiness Advantage)

One simple trick to become better in conversations with people.

And literally make yourself happier.

As odd, as it may seems according to the science, we can observe our own behavior in others people faces (the mirror neurons in our brains make us literally subconsciously copy the emotions of others).

YES, it is indeed so odd.

It was the essence. But, I went a bit further. 

So to explain all the idea to you, I've created a short  (3 min YouTube video) with all the references to sources.

I am a naturalized citizen of the US, but I don’t have a copy of my naturalization certificate because whoever told my dad that I was going to need it today neglected to tell him and they thought my passport would be enough. I’m not sure what happened since he passed away a while ago, so I can’t ask for his help. I tried using my certificate from my birth country since I thought that they needed my name on a certificate, but they need one that indicates that I am citizen from here.

130,"Its an unfairly daunting question to impose on someone who, at this stage in their life, are just learning who they are. College application season is upon us and soon I will have to decide where I want to go, what I want to study, and have a general idea of the direction I want to go. I am overwhelmed.

 I came here looking for advice on one of the most important decisions of my life, so I figure it'd be good if I set a foundation from which ideas can be built. I know that above all, I love the beauty of our world. A sunset over suburban streets, the grass being lit by shadow while the clouds above shin in thirty different colors.  I am fairly creative, and can create stories and scenarios very easily, so easily in fact that it astonishes my friends. However, when it comes to acting on my creativity, I have no motivation.  My most elaborate and intriguing stories come from lies I tell people in order to bend them to my way of thinking, another, if not darker, trait of mine. I like to think that I'm smart, and understand how people think. I enjoy medicine and biotechnology, but I feel as if I would get bored of it quickly, or any job I get would be incredibly menial or pointless.  Honestly, if I had one goal in life I would hope to accomplish, or one job that I would never grow tired of doing, it would be working towards recreating the feeling you get when watching the sun set and enjoying a cool summer breeze . Creativity, or the recreation of earths beauty, however, is a double edged sword. I can not create art and enjoy life at the same time. In my philosophy, you cannot influence the world unless you have some money, and creativity doesn't pay. I wouldn't mind going into business, trading stocks, or even managing finances. However, I'm unsure whether or not I would be successful, or feel fulfilled. 

I feel its important to mention my hobbies, which are basically gaming, a little bit of video editing, and some story telling. However, I only tell the stories to myself, I'm unwilling to write them down.  Once I start writing, I lose motivation. Saying it aloud or committing it to paper makes it real, and to make something real in this world is to corrupt it, and then there's no point in telling the story.  

I'm looking for college recommendations, degree, and career advice. I live in SoCal and have about a 3.2 GPA, but weighted its around a 4.0. I got a 1460 on the SAT, don't know if that helps. I'm sorry for poisoning my post with these numbers, but I feel like they are necessary. ",12Jul2018,0
131,"Alright, so I'll do my best to keep this as short as possible. Last October I took a Best Buy geek squad consultant job as my first job. I was told prior to being hired there were very small sales goals I had to reach but the main part of my job was helping people. Anyways, during my time at this job, i found out the sales goals were not only insanely high but most of the consultants weren't reaching them.

Over time this made my anxiety build up a lot, it was my first ever job and I felt rather clueless on everything I was doing. I felt like i wasn't trained very well and was still asking a lot of questions 6 months in. Because of this, every day at work felt miserable for me because I knew I'd be making a fool of myself.

134,"My SO and I have been dating for a year and  half now, and we are planing on moving in. We have been looking at different places, and we have finally brought it down to to options. One being cheaper than the other. He’s been living with his college friends for at least three years now, and his expenses are cheap af since his roommates dad owns the house they rent. Therefore, he has a lot of commodities that he is used to pay a really low price for. Today he sent me a text saying that he had made a decision in which place to go for, he sent me a price comparison table, and he still decided to go for the more expensive place since “it’s just a small price difference.” Anyway, I was ok with his choice (I was betting for the cheaper place, but I decided to let him make the decision.) and asked him to come hang at my place, and as soon as he got here I could sense that he was acting strange. I asked him about it, and he said he was worried about spending almost one of his two paychecks (of 900 dllrs each) in his future rent and expenses. I went ahead and explained that we should go for the cheaper place then, as well as letting him know that there are one time payments that made the first month living there more expensive. Also, he listed the internet as a $130 monthly charge as an estimate based off his current situation. He games, but he also lives with three other people who have friends over often so the internet is BOUND to be shitty if it’s a lower plan. I recommended looking up a cheaper internet package (which he agreed to) that we could stick to and recalculating our expenses just so we could have a more down to earth idea on what our REAL payments would be, to which he answered that he was gonna do it but that i was “nagging” him to much about it. Geee, I was HOT HEADED at this point. He had a really bad attitude for all of my recommendations. I let it pass after storming off for a minute, but then we started talking again and went back to planing. I need to mention that I am a huge believer that every penny counts, and he kept saying that pennies don’t make the difference. (THEY ACCUMULATE, DONT FIGHT ME ON THIS ONE.) Also, I am part of the green movement, and this has helped me cut down electricity expenses, therefore I recommended a bunch of go green options that could save us some coins in the long run (Drying clothes under the sun, taking not so hot showers, utilizing just one of our cars, etc...) He was okay with some of my recommendations, but boy was he upset when I said drying clothes in the sun. The point to this whole thing is that this huge fight made me realize that we have different priorities, and that he’d rather have a bad attitude instead of making simple changes that could make our life together more easy going money wise. This also made me realize that i don’t want to move in with someone who’s not willing to implement some of my ideas into our daily life. I get it, he games, he wants everything top notch, but sometimes you can’t have all those commodities without making a sacrifice. Idk, it also bothers me that he says no to all of my ideas. It makes me doubt our moving in together plan, and even our relationship. IM SORRY FOR THE LONG POST, but I really, really need some advice.

I have been talking to and seeing my current partner for 3 months. Things are going really well and I feel like I'm falling for her. I have generalised anxiety and she is extremely supportive with that. I enjoy spending time around her and I really don't have any complaints. The only problem is that recently I've started to get this anxious feeling in my stomach that something bad will happen. Whenever I think about good things like her smile or just being with her, my thoughts get overridden but this sudden fear. I don't know if you could call it a gut feeling. I can't seem to pinpoint the fear. Maybe I'm fearful that I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure at the moment and I don't want to hurt her by continuing the relationship if I'm unsure? Maybe I'm fearful that she's not 'the one' for me?

I don't want to break up with her at all and I feel like my routine and life has become a lot more positive with her in it. What should I do? I've briefly mentioned it to her but not as in-depth as this.

141,"Okay, I entered a new relationship in the summer of 2016. She, 18 at the time (20yo) moved in with me in my parents' house. I just turned 18 as well (20yo). We eventually lost the house in the summer of 2017. I moved in with her in her parent's house after my parents separated and moved up north. We were always really close, like best friend close. I never knew her until she hit me up on Facebook back in 2015, but she hit me up again because she forgot we talked before. I was comfortable with opening up to her as a total stranger and somehow trusted her with my life and words. Fast forward to November of 2017, all we did was argue (not enough space, financial issues, etc.), so she broke up with me because she didn't wanna treat me like that anymore, that's understandable. But at the time, I was pretty suicidal and heartbroken as you would expect. We visited my family in late November early December, we had sloppy drunk sex and we weren't even together. She had our ""best friend"" as a rebound, that went downhill like I told them, that was a whole issue of me getting kicked out of the house and having to call my family up north to come get me. A lot of tears and a lot of violence. I began drinking every night, doing every drug I could find. If you could imagine, everything just fucked me up bad. I cried for the longest time. I was N.C. with her until April 2018. I got drunk and sent her a text, she said she texted me back (3 pages long in screenshots) but my shit phone didn't get it. I unblocked her on Facebook May 2018. At one point she told me she should be the one kissing my ass instead of me kissing hers and it made her cry. Because I'm really sweet to her. I'm in a different state than she is. We talk every day, she's responsive to me. We FaceTime almost every hour of every day on a good day. She will ask me to fall asleep on FaceTime with her, for me to read to her so she could go to sleep. I still dream about her and the dreams are still sad. It's been 7 months, I should be over her, shouldn't I? Now she's talking to a new guy after she's been single for awhile after having a shit boyfriend (her new mantra is shit boyfriends who end up fucking with her heart and fucking her over). She's very cold to me now that she's open about it to me. She's tried to come get me from my state (in a car), told me she's gonna snuggle with me, was just so sweet to me and at one point, I felt as if my feelings were reciprocated. She told me she was gonna make my ex girlfriend get jealous as she gives me hickeys (my ex cheated on me, just broke up with her). I just literally can't get this girl out of my head. I would give her the moon. She's one of those ""independent"" types, ugh. But yet she can't stay out of shitty relationships since we broke up. I sent an Uber cab to her to deliver food she wanted, just to make her happy. I asked her if I could take her out when I'm in her state and she tells me ""yes take me on a date"", but then she's upset about dude yadda yadda. I'm just balancing between the fact that she either doesn't know what she wants and is scared to fully reciprocate my feelings or if she just wants attention and nothing more. I've been pretty damn near suicidal over this and have actually tied up nooses and got pills out, but she is always the one who stops me either knowingly or unconsciously. I wonder if it's me being too scared to tell her how I feel that kinda made her think she should just go another route with someone else. I just remember every little detail of her likes and dislikes, we have a cat together, we've lived together, went to school together, and just lived peacefully as one. I remember her favorite colors, her favorite flower, what she does when she needs a pick-me-up. I don't know. I hope somebody on here can help me, since being a total stranger with no previous knowledge about me, her, and the relationship is valued with no prejudices. I'm just stuck right now and I really need help. I hope this is the right subreddit.",12Jul2018,2
142,"Little bit about me: 16 years old, top of my class with A’s and B’s in Honor’s classes. Logical, brutally honest at times. I currently have a job and I’m very passionate about my career. I’ve already began looking into colleges. I follow the law/rules by the textbook, I’m a stickler. I have very strong, confusing morals. 

Situation: I’ll keep it short as possible. My parents were “waiting for a friend” outside, I got curious when they were outside for quite a bit of time. I walk outside, it’s very dark (10 at night). My parents emerge from our building which has no light in it, a place where I’ve caught them trying to smoke before. I immediately ask what they’re doing this time, again, I’ve caught them in a situation like this before. They dodge my questions and say they’re waiting for a friend. I go back inside, shut the door and immediately turn around to look through the door window. I see my parents hurry back towards the building. I grab my phone, turn on the flashlight, and head back out to investigate. I’m halfway to the building by the time my mom notices me. She noticeably talks to me loudly, my guess alerting my dad who’s still in the building at this time. She then “lets my dad know”that their friend just arrived. I turn around, no one is in the driveway or nearby. My mom sticks her arm out to stop me from passing her but I power by. I walk into the building to notice my dad scrambling, I shine my flashlight onto his hands and notice a lighter. I’m furious at this point. I don’t ask a lot out of my parents, but smoking is definitely something I can’t tolerate. I rush off to a friends house who is next door. The entire time, my parents are in denial. They said they weren’t smoking regardless of the evidence I’ve seen. The previous time(s) I’ve caught them, they also went into denial and tried to hide it. This tells me that they at least know how sensitive I am regarding this topic/action.

Morals: Something inside me says that smoking (marijuana, cigarettes, etc.) is bad. My guess is it’s because of my upbringing and what people have told me. I feel as if though I don’t ask a lot out of my parents so they owe me this one thing. I also understand that they are full grown adults who can make choices for themselves, regardless of the lack of logical sense it makes to me. I understand that stress and anxiety are in play, I’m also aware that my reaction was a bit childish. I guess what I’m asking is, am I overreacting? Could I had done something better? What’s next? 

TL;DR: I caught my parents smoking, something I’m not very fond of. I have strong morals against it. Despite the evidence, they are in denial claiming they were not smoking. I got angry and rushed off to a friends house. I’m aware that they are adults and my actions were a bit childish. Did I overreact? What should I have done instead? What’s next?

143,"So recently my moms been looking very closely at the bills and she felt that we were paying too much for our internet. At the time our provider was Comcast, if I remember her saying it was above $100, it did come with tv and some specialty tv networks and such. And the big plus for me was we were getting great download and upload speeds 70-100mb download and 10-25 upload. But she still felt we was paying too much so she looked for a cheaper option, that being frontier. 

Now friends of mine that have had frontier have only told me how bad it was. I didn’t remember this until after we made the purchase. At first I didn’t really notice a difference, but then I started downloading some games that I wanted to play with friends and I noticed I was getting 3-9mb download. I can’t imagine that’s what my mom was sold. I don’t even know what we’re paying but i don’t think any price can justify that. And the upload isn’t much better. Maybe it’s that we just switched and it’ll take a bit for the internet to get better. But logic tells me that wouldn’t make any sense. 

I can firmly say I use the internet the most but I don’t pay the bills so I don’t know how to tell her we’ve downgraded severely. And it makes things super difficult for me. I play games but I also upload content for friends (montages and all that cool gamer stuff). But in the end I don’t pay the bills. I’ve been wanting a job so maybe if I find one I’ll offer to pay the internet? 

To wrap things up and put a pretty bow on it, my moms mad at me and my dad or the world? I don’t know she’s just been unresponsive and ignoring us. Literally as I type this she went to the bathroom and said “so fucking pissed off” in the living room. Man I don’t know what to do. Timings definitely important though.

Thank you for reading, this sorry it got a bit long I tend to drag on. I’m not one to ask advice nor post on reddit (kinda just a lurker) but I’m really stuck on how to approach her. Any advice is welcome. 

TLDR; My mom switched from Comcast to Frontier because she felt we were paying too much. We paid a lot for Comcast but we got a good package and great internet. With Frontier we barely get 1/10 of what we had. I use the internet a lot and I don’t pay the bills but are willing to. Lastly my moms been pissed at the world it seems.",12Jul2018,2

But at the beginning of the year, I met this guy from outside of school. He’s an older guy (later thirties, let’s call him Z) who lives in a neighborhood on the other side of the city, and I had started hanging out with him more than with my friends in school (probably why my friends started to isolate me). I mean what can I say? My friends suck, I didn’t actually like how they only ever insulted everyone and talk about how stupid everything was. Plus, this guy gives me drugs for free so it was pretty cool. 

And because I’ve had nobody to hang out with, I’ve been spending more time with Z recently, and while he’s sometimes been a little odd, he’s mostly been a good friend and he’s been there for me this whole time. 

So anyway, I was at Z’s place on Sunday and we were gonna have some pizzas. I was telling him how I didn’t want to go back to school (I wanted to change schools, but my parents didn’t want me to attend a public school because it’d embarrass them). And that’s when it got weird. I was telling Z about how my neck was still sore after that sucker punch I’d gotten from school, and he said that it’s because the muscles around my neck was tight, and a good massage was gonna fix it. Then without asking he just sat next to me and started massaging my neck, and I was on his couch watching tv so I thought whatever and just continued to watch what was on tv. But then he started massaging my arms, I don’t even know for what, and he said it’d be better if I scooted over a little. So he had me sit on his lap and lay back on him, and this entire time I just sat there like an idiot staring at the tv. He started touching my thighs and by now I knew what he was doing, I mean I’m not stupid, and I knew he wasn’t supposed to touch me like this. But for some reason I just kept sitting there and let him touch me. It’s so dumb but I just felt like I was frozen because I didn’t want to say anything and make things weird. Anyways the the pizza guy came, I don’t even know how long it had been going on for, but when he went to see the pizza guy at the door I left by the back without saying anything to him. 

He’s sent me two messages asking why I left. I haven’t responded yet and earlier today he asked me to come back to his place this weekend to talk things through. I just don’t know what to say, or feel? I mean, I know what rape is obviously and he didn’t rape me. Technically nothing happened, but at the same time I’m not so naive as to not know what his intentions were. But at the same time he’s actually been nicer to me than my parents and any friend I’ve had, so behaving this way feels a little unfair for him. He didn’t do anything to me (whatever his intentions may have been had I stayed, I still left before anything happened), so I feel like I’m overreacting a little, kinda like I shouldn’t have responded this way because he doesn’t deserve it (not yet at least). What do you guys think?  ",12Jul2018,1
150,"I’m working on a Master’s degree as a path to teacher licensure. I’m currently employed as a paraprofessional in a school district ran preschool program. The preschool program classrooms are located in the elementary schools. We are very much a part of the school district and very different from a daycare. 

All lead teachers in the program must have a standard Arkansas teacher’s license. In 2015, Arkansas phased out preschool as a license area. Which means that colleges no longer offer a P-4 license and instead offer a K-6 license. This is what I am working towards. Our program hires people on a K-6 for lead positions in preschool. 

The problem comes with the last leg of this degree, which requires an internship. This *cannot* be done in preschool. It must be done in the content area of my license. I will have to quit my job to do this. 

The problem is with telling my current boss, who has been completely supportive of my education up to this point. This mostly stems from the fact that our program sees a ton of turnover and she recognizes that I want to stay with the program and move up as a lead. This was originally my goal. But because preschool is no longer recognized by the state as a license area, I *have* to leave the program to get my K-6. If I don’t leave, I will not get a license and be stuck living with my current salary, which does not allow me financial independence. I’m stuck living with my parents. 

I still have a whole year before I have to quit. Should I go ahead and tell my boss? We currently have a good relationship, but that relationship is based on my job performance and my contribution to the program. I’m basically taking all that away and telling her this is my last year. I’ve already signed a contract for the upcoming school year and am confident she won’t fire me just out of spite. But it’s still scary. 

Right now she is under the impression I’m working to stay in her program. I do not want her to plan for that, especially with what I know now. I could leave, do my internship and get my license, and the come back. But this is not something I’m promising her. As of right now, this is a final goodbye. 

What would you do? Tell her or sit on it a while?",12Jul2018,2

Of no particular consolation (but a bit of alarm) is the recent realisation that I can’t seem to derive any enjoyment from anything at all. Mobile games, music, books, podcasts, late night walks in the park, all of these I’ve thought I enjoyed. Lately they just feel so dull, so tiresome and pointless. I’ve been unable to do any chores, to eat or to fall asleep - all of which I’ve had no problems with in the past. How can I go about enjoying these activities again ?

160,"Background: There's this guy I knew since childhood, my friends used to bully him, I did nothing to stop it, but he always thought I was cool. He moved school, but we ended up going to the same highschool. He initiated friendship with me again, we became friends, but I always felt like I was only friends with him because I wanted to make up for all the bullying he went through.

We were friends in highschool up until this year, I was never popular but I had other friends and people generally like me. He always found it really hard to make friends, probably because of the bullying, and he has aspergers too. So I was always his best friend, he was mine for a while. We always hung out 1on1, as he was pretty awkward around anyone else, he never had great social skills and tends to interrupt and take over the conversation a lot.

Last year I made some of my best friends, they're just overall great people. I introduced him to these new friends, and they got on great for the first month or so! Then he started complaining to me about them pretty often, he always had a problem, and eventually he decided he didn't want to be friends with them anymore. So I was back to being his only friend. But, he does have close friends in other schools, and now that we've graduated and are going to different colleges I don't feel any need to stay friends.

Why I don't want to be friends: He's a very negative person, he complains constantly, and insults people a lot. We used to have stuff in common when we watched the same anime, but we have nothing to talk about anymore. Being around him makes me feel guilty, since the only reason I was friends with him in the first place was because of the guilt I felt from when we were kids.

I know this isn't the right thing to do, but I've been doing the ""fade away"" for the past year, I thought it was going well, but he still texts me asking how my summers going. I don't want to reply, because he's going to either ask to hang out, or ask if we're still friends. I don't feel like I can confront him because he's so sensitive. Should I confront him? Or should I keep ghosting until he gives up? I've been a huge ass with the whole fading out thing so far, I hate that someone still thinks I'm worth it after all that.

So at this point I really don't know who to choose, they are both really pretty and I'm just really scared I might make the wrong choice.

My best friend who I've known since kindergarten has always been there by my side and she's really concerned when I hang out with the bad kids at school, she was even the first person to scold me after getting a D.I.Y tattoo from a friend. She's really sweet and caring and I get a feeling I can't describe when I'm with her, but I feel like she just sees me as her older brother, we hang out a lot and everyone at school thinks we're cousins haha.

The other girl on the other hand who we'll call J is really pretty too. We listen to the same type of music and we both like FFDP. I met her when she slid into my DMs one evening and she seems really sweet and at times she can get really naughty which arouses me.

164,"It all started when I married someone from the other side of the country. She moved to my side of the country to be with me, and gave up all her friends, family, and life that she had before. At first she seemed fine with it, but over the years her resentment has built and built. On top of that, it turns out that she also suffers from crippling depression and anxiety, but doesn't want to get help because she says that that's just the way she is.

The only people she says she's comfortable being around are her immediate family members and a few friends that she grew up with, all of who still live on the other side of the country. Therefore, we hardly ever see anyone. I really miss my friends and my family, but I would be happy seeing just about anyone at this point.

My wife also uses the fact that she moved across the country to get anything she wants. There's nothing I can do that would be equivalent. One of the things she wanted was kids, because she said if she had her own family it would help her not miss her's and would help with the depression. 

So we had 2 kids. But as it turns out, having kids only makes your life more stressful, and it didn't help with her depression. Don't get me wrong though, I love my kids, and they are easily the happiest part of my life.

My wife doesn't work because she only has her high school, so if she did get a job she would actually make less than the cost of daycare where we live. I did go to college, so I managed to get a job making a pretty decent salary. But between the kids and the cost of living where we are, we are still always in debt, no matter how many raises I fight for. We have to budget everything, and there is zero room in the budget for any sort of entertainment.

Oh, and on top of the depression and anxiety, it turns out my wife has a temper problem and is incredibly prideful. So if I say anything that could come off as complaining, I get yelled at and then given the silent treatment for days. It's gotten to the point where if I don't like something, I just force myself to accept it, rather than being it up.

So my daily life consists of: getting up, going to work, coming home and taking care of 2 kids so my wife can have a break, putting the kids to bed, doing chores well the kids are sleeping, going to bed late, repeat. Over and over again. No time, or money, for any entertainment or free time. And no seeing anyone except my wife and kids, and the annoying people I work with.

165,"So my ex and I split maybe two and a half years ago. It was a strange break up, we both acted like we didn’t care much (at least I know I was pretending) but we were together 4 years. He was my “first love”. Though it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows throughout the relationship. I can’t even count the amount of times I have cried over him and the way he made me feel sometimes. He was stupidly narcissistic and treated me like a child.
But, we have stayed friends and still talk every now and then. I even still have all his family and friends on Facebook.

I moved on pretty quickly after we split up and I fell for someone else. We have been together just over two years now and have been engaged for a year.
Although recently, due to my partner having health issues, it has put a LOT of stress onto our relationship (I had to quit my job to look after him. He is also having issues with coping and will turn to alcohol sometimes) things have been so difficult lately.
Around this time I have also been having recurring dreams about my ex and getting a little upset over them.

I found out yesterday that my ex is having a baby with his partner who he’s been with for over a year. I can’t help but feel devastated and I know that this is stupid and I should be completely over him by now.

I would also like to note that whilst we were together, I did have a pregnancy scare and he made me feel terrible about it. Marching me to the supermarket to get a pregnancy test whilst telling me how it was better to have an abortion.
I cant help thinking that I wasn’t good enough for him to want to have a child with me. Seeing as we were together a lot longer than he is with his partner now.

He just wants me to ignore there letters and phone calls but that makes me wonder if they’ll sue me for that, he says “they won’t and they get their money anyway. All bill collectors do is use scare tactics to scare people into paying them” I even thought about paying them but now I don’t want to because I found out it won’t help your credit score at all but at the same time I don’t want them to file a lawsuit against me.

He said ""I would of only thought you were at least 23"" Then he randomly tells me how it reminds him of how James Franco met a girl outside a club that he thought was older but turned out to be only 17 (days away from my 18th).

TLDR: Miserable at my new job, want to start looking else where, how do I explain a short time of employment during an interview?



I started working this job 3 months. It's a simple data entry job. However, since I've started, it almost feels as if I'm being held to a different standard to everyone else. It first started off with cell phone usage. Like everyone else I figured it was ok to use my phone so long as my work was done and done correctly. Everyone in the office plays with the phones in between tasks when not busy. Well I got pulled aside and told that I always look like I'm looking down at my phone. I just apologized and put it away and watch as all the girls that I work with (I'm the only guy except for my managers) are allowed to use their phones as much as they like. It kinda felt like I was being singled out for some reason whether it be because I'm a guy or what ever.


Yesterday though is kinda what prompted me to make this post. All our work has to be reviewed and approved. Sometimes we make mistakes and my boss simply says hey fix this or that. Well yesterday he asked me to walk with him and we had a discussion about how hes concerned about my attention to detail. Over the span of 3 months I've learned a bunch of stuff that even people there before me were never shown. I had to go through my first monthly books close on my own. They are compounding stuff and making me learn more and more. This wouldnt be a bad thing if I had more practice with what I'm learning. My workload is completely dependent on getting stuff from another department so the less I send something the less hands on time I have with it. Plus everything has little exceptions where in a 50 page document 2 words can make a difference in how information gets entered into the system. 


I explained to him that I essentially don't know what I don't know, said about how there's inconsistencies with the process material and explained that i learn best by doing and such. His response was simply ""it's only going to get harder"" . I'm stressed and worn. I'm tired and miserable and I dread going to a job that at once I was excited to hopefully get into. I watch as people around me play on their phones and don't even get trained on any of the stuff I've been shown while I feel I'm legit under a microscope. I want to get out but I just need help explaining a good reason why I want to leave. Could really use some advice guys because I cant stay there anymore. 

I don't sleep well. I've had a break down in my car from the stress, I always feel depressed and uncomfortable  just being there. I really need help. ",12Jul2018,1
180,"Hi guys, we are a very small indie dev team, it’s just me and my friend, we want to create a new video game — my friend is just like me (just turned 18) and he got about 200$, he is a programmer and created a video game before and i am a writer and marketing/concept designer. We want to put all our efforts in this game. I will try to get 100$ from my dad and i will try to work to get 150$. We want to create a prototype and show it to investors, we want to hire a professional designer and maybe a very good voice actor for our game. It would cost us almost all what we have i guess. But do you think it’s worth it guys? To work so hard and put all your money on a project that may work-may get an investor but may get nothing too?

We didn’t talk about sharing the profit yet, but how much do you think we should split it? He is doing all the programming, his job is not easy but also writing everything about the game is not easy too, (story-dialogues-backstory-quests..etc). What do you think? Thanks everyone.",12Jul2018,1

I went through a very amicable breakup last week. I'm not super bothered during the day about it, but I have this aversion to sleep for some reason.

That being said, I haven't spiraled at all in this week because I'm not super torn up. How do I relax my mind to get over these fears?

185,"I'm 30+/F, my sister is 3 yrs older. Our mom died when we were teenagers, technically of a brain hemorrhage, but she had a long battle with alcoholism beforehand. It was pretty traumatic for both of us, but my sister, we'll call her Ellie, took it worse than I did. Ellie is now an alcoholic herself, and I suspect (and have heard rumors) she's on cocaine as well, and now possibly heroin. 

Before the worst of this, Ellie asked me for my pictures that I had of our mom because she wanted to scan them. I reluctantly gave them to her, then she moved, got a storage unit, and against my wishes, put the pictures in there. Now, she has lost her job, lost her housing, and ate up any money she had in hotels (and drugs, I'm assuming). During this period, she would call me at all hours of the night, drunk, and would act like she wanted to talk, but all she would do is yell at me. She wants help, but only in exactly the way that she specifies. She is belligerent, selfish, and totally unaware of how her behavior affects other people. Even most of her friends have disowned her.

She can't get a job because she has no transportation, looks like a trainwreck, and she can't keep  any job she gets because she can't ever make it on time. She always has three different boyfriends, and they're always arguing or in the middle of a fight. She got a DUI, and yet still wrecked her car afterward when she shouldn't have been driving, so she has no car, no license, and no money, but she never wants to do anything to fix that. She only wants to complain about everything that's going on in her life, and never seems to be able to do the right thing. I suggested women's shelters to her, and she said she would never go to a place like that. Instead, she was willing to live with a guy who she just met at rehab 3 days before, then later described him as a Satan worshipper. Now, the guy she's with, she says he tracks everything she does, goes through her emails, and it trying to kill her. And yet, when my dad and stepmom showed up at her insistence, she got mad at them for something and refused to go with them, slamming the door in their face. Even the cops didn't believe her.

I offered to pay her storage unit up to current and store everything at my house, just so that she would be sure she wouldn't lose anything. I told her that all I wanted was the pictures of my mom. She was so offended that I would even suggest that she wouldn't have the money to pay for the storage unit (she was living in a hotel at this point, still no job).  Finally in that conversation, she told me she didn't even have the pictures in the storage unit, that our dad had them. At that point I was so fed up with everything that she's been doing, I told her fine that's all I wanted to know and hung up on her. I haven't talked to her since, even though she's called me constantly from several different numbers trying to get me to talk to her. I have her blocked because she only calls me at weird hours when she's drunk and wants to yell at me. I cannot believe a single word she says anyway.

My dad does not have the pictures. He gave me a few that he did have, but they weren't the same ones that I had. I'm certain my pictures are still in her storage unit because I was the one who helped her move all her stuff in there, and she either doesn't remember or is lying.

Now the storage unit is going up for auction next month. It needs a few hundred dollars to bring it current, but I already know that if I pay it current, she will just default on it again. At this point, I would rather buy it at auction, own everything in there, and take over the payments of the storage unit. I would take my pictures out, and then I would save the rest of it for her for when she got sober. 

So, I'd like to know what you guys think about the storage unit, but also if you have any general advice on how to get help for her, when she's acting like she really doesn't want the help that she needs. I miss my real sister, but she's been on this downward spiral for years. It seems like, besides the obvious addiction issues, she also might have paranoid delusions or something similar. I don't know my mom's mental history except depression, but I suspect we have some schizotypal or schizophrenic tendencies in our family. I don't even know what I could do for her if that's the case, and it's really just a suspicion. I want to help her, but right now for my mental health I have to keep my distance.


TL;DR: My sister is an addict with lots of mental issues, and has a storage unit with the only pictures I own of my dead mother in there. Should I buy the unit at auction or let it go? And how to help my sister?",12Jul2018,1
186,"I graduated high school in 2011. When I was in the 8th grade I met a really nice girl that had a huge impact on me. By the time we got to high school we drifted apart.

Made a fake account on Skype using my full name, my email address, and my photo and contacted me on there. Sent me 3 emails to different emails of mine, sent me one email saying he loved me and I hurt him, sent me another email the next day saying he didn’t love me and that he uses a program that tracks whenever I open his emails,

Added me on 3 different Instagram accounts of his, makes anonymous Instagram accounts to try to follow me, got his ex-girlfriend to try to follow me on Instagram, made 3 different Skype accounts and tried to contact me on there, 

And he’s harassing me and typing in my last name on social media and contacting anyone that’s remotely related to me and ruining everything I have and telling them all my personal details 

I called the Swedish police but they were useless and said it isn’t a crime to harass me for my photos, should I call them again and report him for stalking? Or would they not be able to do anything. 
I live in USA so it’s really hard to get him to stop stalking me

Should I contact the police and get him to track down his IP address so that they can forward that to the Swedish authorities to find a way to handle him?

I’m so scared he’s been terrorizing my life for over two months since I’ve blocked him, the most recent of his stalking being yesterday.

209,"Hello,

My friend was assulted last night and due to her circumstances (she works abroad) she did not want to press charges and they were let off with a warning from police. I don't feel like this is enough and so I have taken it upon myself to be petty. Any suggestions of how I can inconvienece these peoples lives would be greatly appreciated. As I don't know these people personally I only have facebook accounts of them, all I have been able to do so far is get their emails and sign them up for subscriptions. Is there a way I can have them recieve large amounts of spam?

A little back story for those who want to know. We we're watching the world cup and after Croatia scored my friend asked a friend of ours how much time was left of the game. Overcome with sadness from the realisation it was infact not coming home, some girl took it upon herself to respond and told my friend to ""watch the f\*cking game instead of chatting and maybe you'd know"". My friend laughed at her, a bit taken a back that a stranger had been so rude, and simply said ""What a classy bird you are"". This clearly hit a nerve as said girl stood up and proceeded to throw her drink in my friends face. It all escalated very quickly from here, we are not confrontaional people and have never been in a fight so to be completely honest I didn't know what to do with myself. She threw another drink and then heartbreakingly, decided to throw an entire plate of chicken wings at us. These chicken wings had only just been brought out and looked delicious. They all landed on the floor and in all the comotion, there was no way for me to adopt the five second rule. RIP chicken wings, gone but not forgotten. A man, who I now know is chicken wing flingers dad, then got involved and punched my friend in the face, grabbed her purse off her and threw it across the pub garden. At this point many men got involved, outraged by what they had seen, and we managed to get away from this pyschopathic family. 

I'm sorry but a police warning is not enough in my opinion, who behaves like that? We're all upset that football isn't coming home, but throwing delicious chicken wings at strangers is not the way to deal with it. 

Anyway, any ideas of how I could anonymously terrorise these people when all I have is there facebook information would be great, please get creative. I also know where she works and will be trying my best to get her fired once I come up with a suitable plan. Also, is there a better subreddit I could post this on?

A little bit of background for you. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 months. We both grew up in Christian/religious families and both are still a part of our churches. We decided recently that we wanted to get married next summer, and subsequently decided that it would be a good idea to start planning wedding stuff so that we can get a venue and photographer etc. I'm not planning on proposing until the fall or early winter, but we are already if the mindset that we are basically engaged now. We are more than aware this is moving very fast. We are OK with that. Side note: Her parents started dating when they were 16 and dated until they were finished college at 23. 

I asked her when she thought would be a good time for me to have this chat with her parents. Her face lit up because she wasn't expecting me to do that. We have talked about it and she said that I should be ready for some pretty tough questions because thats just who her parents are. I've gotten to know them quite a bit over the last few months (met them a couple dozen times or so we are quite familiar with one another).

HOWEVER, my SO doesn't handle changes of plans well and I know he has shuffled commitments to free himself up. What do I do?  ",12Jul2018,1
217,"So my boyfriend and I have been friends with another couple for roughly 2 years or so. I'm closer to the girl and talk to her a bit more regularly and the guy is closer to my boyfriend but they don't talk as much as we do, but they do still chat now and then. Lately they've been having a lot of trouble relationship wise and have been contacting us individually to ask for advice.

The girl has told me repeatedly she wants to be with the guy, but that he can be very needy and whiny and makes her feel bad for having any sort of alone time or not having work schedules that line up. She says she feels very guilty that she can't devote more time to him and sometimes will actively ignore him because she's mad at him for how he makes her feel on occassion. She says ever since she's gotten a job he's been very moody and thinks she's lying to him about things and won't talk to him.

The guy tells my boyfriend he thinks she's lying to him and has asked my boyfriend if he's ever caught me lying to him or thought I was lying to him. My boyfriend told him no, because we have an understanding that we will always tell one another the truth, even if the truth is scary or bad. The guy said that's really admirable and he wishes they had that too. He asked my boyfriend if I ever did lie to him, would he forgive me. My boyfriend said yes, as long as I told the truth in the end and was truly sorry. The guy said my boyfriend was the only one of his friends to say so.

Now, this guy has a lot of crappy male friends in my opinion. They've repeatedly told him to break up with my friend because she's 'crappy' for not being available to him 24/7 when they deem she should be at his beck and call. In the past, they have snooped through his phone and taken her number and texted her horrible things about how she's crap and trapped him in a horrible relationship and she should feel bad for it. At that time they convinced him to end the relationship with her because she was being 'unfair' to him by not devoting 100% of her time to him. The breakup lasted maybe a week or so, during which they attempted to set him up with a girl they had been attempting to shove onto him for months as he dated my friend; generally being disrespectful to her.

My friend says when it's just them together or when they hang out with out for couples dates, they're great and happy; she says we're a good influence on them. But lately we haven't had the opportunity to meet up at all because of work and my boyfriend and I dealing with his mother absolutely loathing my very existence, so their relationship has been on a downward spiral. Obviously this is a combination of things and not just because we aren't there. If I'm being quite honest, I think the biggest issue is his crappy friends who are constantly interfering with his romantic life and the fact that he lets their words get to him so easily instead of evaluating his own relationship himself.

I'm trying to figure out a way to politely contact him and tell him that he needs to tell his friends to shove off and deal with his issues with her together, but he doesn't specifically talk to me outside of actually seeing me in person with his girlfriend present. I don't want to tell my boyfriend to, ""Hey, tell x this because he's being dumb."" because that's unfair for me to push that off onto him even if he feels that his friends should back off too and that the guy needs to grow a spine and talk to his girlfriend properly for once. He's said he doesn't want to get fully involved though outside of answering the questions he's asked or giving advice when asked. That makes sense to me, because technically, this doesn't have much to do with us aside from them being our friends.

We have asked them both if they want to break up and they've both said no, but that they wish things were better. It's not necessarily stressful for my boyfriend and I, but it's not exactly fun either. I'm obviously more inclined to side with the girl because she's my friend, but my boyfriend is more neutral in the situation and says they need to talk more because they're both avoiding the real issues. He's right about that and he's told the guy that exact statement more than once.

Should we just keep letting them vent from time to time and offer advice when asked, or should I tell the guy that I think his friends are kind of assholes and he really should just talk it out with her girlfriend?",12Jul2018,1
218,"So some background, I met this kid on some program we were on together. I saw he was left out a lot(not on purpose) and I would try to include him in activities and talk to him. At some point he decided to tell me his story, what was hurting him, and I listened. It was a lot of dark and heavy stuff I wasn’t capable of handling. I didn’t know what to say or do or if I should even do anything. 

Since getting back from the trip he’s texted me almost daily. Almost every conversation about how lonely he is or how I’m “pulling him out from the depression that’s slowly killing him”. How I’m helping him so much and it makes me feel terrible, horrible. In all honesty, I don’t want to talk to him. I don’t want to hear this stuff everyday. I try my best to be responsive and listen and be there, but I can’t handle it. It’s a lot of responsibility and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve suggested seeing a therapist once before, but I know he doesn’t want to. He’s said repeatedly he doesn’t want some random stranger therapist. I feel so horrible that I don’t want to talk to him even though he’s trusted me and decided to come to me for help. 

What do I do? What do I say? Is it wrong of me to stop talking to him? ",12Jul2018,1
220,"The 20th of June I contacted a local hamster breeder with good reviews to adopt a hamster that was at the time 6 weeks old. With 8 weeks they can leave mom so the breeder said I could come by the 8th of July to pick one up.

Since then, every day, she has messaged saying ‘I’m too sick to have you come by, please stop by another day’.

She has postponed 4 times so far and I’m getting pretty horrible feelings. All the messages are long, highly detailed about what’s wrong with her and how ill she is. Her main thing is migraine. When I asked her for pics of the hams she answers ‘My camera is broken and with my migraine I can’t stand flash photography so I can send you pics from a few weeks ago’. 

She then sent me the exact same pics he sent me when we first messaged about the hamsters.

222,"My boss is a man in his 50s, engineer-turned-executive; a very nice and polite gentleman normally, but he can get conversationally agressive if provoked. His browser home page and car satellite radio station is fox news (which I often walk by and find him reading), and he often has short rants or blurbs about conservative-leaning topics (to which I normally return uninterested but polite acknowledgements, and he drops it thinking I am just too busy to converse).

(A) ""Jim, I value our professional relationship and we need to keep a positive atmosphere in this office, so please keep your political discussions for more personal environments.""
(B) wait a week, and send both him and his wife anonymous emails with some kind of link to try to dissuade them from spreading uncited fud fake news links.

223,"I live in a large city, grew up in a small one about an hour away from me now where my mother and friends still live. My boyfriend is a 24 year old photographer(who hasn’t done any photography since we started dating a year ago, and shot boudoir naked girls) and I am 19. My friend asked me to participate in a photo shoot along side 7 other girls for a vintage clothing store she owns (no one is a real model jus some pretty girls!!) my boyfriend was automatically negative and critical asking if I was really going to do it, if there was going to be guys there, who the photographers were and that I can’t wear any body suits, bathing suits, or anything revealing. His reasoning is that I should be “private” and I don’t need to have my “ass anywhere on the internet” and so on. I told him since the beginning I wouldn’t do anything I was uncomfortable with, nothing HE SHOULD be uncomfortable with, and that me being in any type of clothing isn’t inappropriate or sexual, and he needs to relax about it. I went and did the shoot in the city I grew up in, and decided I wanted to stay over night at my mothers and come home the next day. He was upset with me saying I was already there all day and am “avoiding coming home” when I just wanted to see my mom and best friend. Fast track to today, a week later, every time a picture is posted of me modeling the clothing he starts an issue, gets all wound up and upset, saying I should have worn a bandeau under some, saying things like “you didn’t tell me you wore that shirt without a vest on so your a liar”, and when I showed him a picture of every outfit I got back (I sent him about 10 when I got around 20 pictures) and he was angry with me that I was “hiding some of them from him” and everyday he starts a new issue with me about it. He also factored in that apparently I never told the girl to use him as the photographer. (He worked that day, it was 30 degrees outside, and was unpaid) 

I am embarrassed because I had to tell my friends and the girls participating that I couldn’t wear a lot of the outfits chosen for me (they were picked according to size) because my boyfriend would be angry at me. I don’t think I should have to do this, nor walk around on eggshells about him, nor feel guilty for doing a photo shoot that was very innocent. He hasn’t said really anything nice about me in the photos, nor asked how it went or anything (I have bad anxiety and usually HATE taking photos at all).

He says he listens to how I feel ..”that you can do whatever you want with your body and don’t care” but am not listening to him. 

Not sure what to do at this point lol. Know he must be jealous of other people seeing the pictures, insecure that he’ll lose me some how or that he’s out of control of the situation and can’t deal, i brought these ideas up to him and he said no to all of them. Soooo........

224,"I'm very ambiverted. Lately though, I've been having a tough time with my social/extroverted side of me. I'm a twenty five year old guy, and I live near Paris. I'm having lots of difficulty with my life and career, so it's hard to relate to all these people (local or international) who have their life at least somewhat on track. A lot of people around my age range are into smoking, drugs, alcohol, and staying outside late at night. I don't do any of that and have zero interest in any of that and I always feel out of place. 

I have a hard time trying to make a real connection with most people and I feel like people are so busy with their work/school/relationships/close friends. Then so many people are moving in or out of the Paris region, and I have a hard time settling down too anywhere. 

On women, I haven't met any that don't smoke and are single. Everyone smokes. Instant turn off. On top of that, I've been having a hard time trusting women lately. It's too much work to try and even get one single date, then I can't imagine them living a life surrounded by aggressive males in everything they do, everywhere they go, and not cheat or be constantly tempted to leave. 

The way I see it; Women are chased by men from puberty and they have the entire population of men to choose from constantly, everyday everywhere. I see how men act around women (aged 18-30\~). We're attracted to them like flies. They light up the room (school, workplace, restaurants, etc) and we all want a piece of that glow. It's just a false hope, a dream that's out of reach for anyone who's not an alpha. 

A guy like me who's never dated or been in a relationship has zero value to any woman in the modern world. I'm just another expendable. 

Tinder isn't something I've used much, but just using it is proof at how easy women have dating and don't value men. After clocking in some nice hours reading tips, taking photos (new and old) making an averagely decent profile. Nothing woooow amaaazing but just normal and I'm.. or was a ""fun"" guy, and I used to have an amazing social circle but have since moved away and lost all that. I have so much unused potential of taking girls on dates and just having fun. But none of that is possible anymore. 

I used Tinder Gold and 5 boosts in Paris, France during the busiest times (18:00 thursday/friday/saturday etc), I've spammed likes and super likes on anyone and everyone and I haven't gotten a single match. Not one single match, but maybe like 7.87878787x more views. Have since deleted Tinder (and okcupid).

A part of me feels like making ""friends"", talking to people, meeting people, making a social network and connections. But at the same time a part of me feels like just dropping almost everything social. I'm a little bit lonely because I've never not been lonely but I can probably manage to live like this on a regular crappy job, just living alone, and seeing an escort on occasion if i need sex. That's been my life so far and I'm used to it. 

I feel like I'm at a crossroad and don't know how to proceed. I either just drop trying to talk to most people in general and I'm leaning towards this and more or less just disappearing, or hold onto this seemingly false idea that I'm supposed to make friends and a girlfriend and live a ""normal"" life, but it's not working out and it's just tiring me out to even try.

Since I’m a fresh grad and just wanted to impress, I told him, “anytime” (my bad), then he told me that I can start right away. I was kinda shocked since my workplace is really far from home (4–5hrs) and I haven’t found a place near it yet. I might not be able to get home since public transportaion is hard to find after our working hour which is 7pm.

Good thing I found an alibi - one of the workers there told me that I have to pass set of requirements which I don’t have. I then walked in to my boss’ office and asked him if it’s okay if I will be absent the next day (Thursday) just to prepare all the requirements first. He said okay though I was not able to tell him that I would be absent for two days since I will still find a place to stay, and will just go back to work on Monday.

Is it bad or am I overthinking? I’m hell of a pessimist so I really don’t know. :(

234,"25 YO female here.

In 2014 in my college, i was committed to a guy . Things were not going too well, and since we were graduating , we were not sure if we wanted to keep long distance. In 2015, when i joined my job in another city along with some other ppl from my same batch, I met this guy X. His behaviour was known to be a bit rude, selfish and flirt, but well i usually dont judge people on their past, so we became good friends. Soon the meetings became outings and we were spending lot of time with each other ( nothing romantically) , but he proposed me knowing i was committed. I said no, as I was still in relationship with my bf, and i wasn’t into him that way. With this rejection, he stopped talking to me. I somehow convinced him to stay friends.

Meanwhile, things worsened with my bf, and due to problems in long distance we mutually broke up. As the time passed X and I became close. We were inseparable, and so fit for each other. We started liking each other. He seemed this perfect guy where he would do things that would make other girls jealous as to why their bf aren’t like him. The whole one year afterwards he was like a prince charming in my life. The only clause in our relationship was I was not ready for sex ( oral or intercourse, screwed up morals probably). This obviously i had made clear initially and he dint have any problems with it. We had a very few conversations about this because I was firm in my mind of my age old customs of sex after marriage. He never really forced me either.But within a year , he changed. He stopped being intimate any time, even hugging or kissing was off the table. Whenever I would initiate anything he would shut himself down , later which i learnt was because , he knew this wont lead to sex. So he stopped almost everything he did previously. It started affecting our love, our intimacy, somedays i would feel like a rapist trying to kiss him because would stay unmoved like a corpse. He wont hold hands much if we go out, neither say I love you , no trips, no surprises, nothing which he used to do to keep us happy. This carried on for another full year.

All this while i would try to talk him out of it, tell him that our relationship is going to ruins , ask him to do something about it. Hint him many ways, that if anything goes wrong, its just his inaction to save it. Every night we would fight, i would cry myself to sleep, he will eventually try to pull me close , which i believe was still okay rather than 0 flying fucks given. But then Not a word, not a single line of communication the next day. The unavailability of sex that turned him into a different man. He had this fear that if he would ask me for sex, i would leave him and then he would become a bad guy in front of my friends, given sex is taboo in our country. I still believe he tried to talk once or twice to talk and gave up knowing i was still firm. But i believe He basically gave up on us, because it felt right to him to shut himself down, almost in all verticals.

After a year of trying so much to understand the issues in vain, being depleted emotionally, i finally left. The fight itself was on a petty issue, but i just couldn’t stand it any more. For him it wasn’t even a breakup. Not sure why, maybe he took it for granted or he was himself tired. I waited for one month to make things right, but he din’t come to make it up because he thought its another fight. He would text me some off topic things, but nothing regarding the fight.

All this time i was harbouring a lot of pain of rejection emotionally and physically. I was sad , depressed and confused why this has happened to me. And this is where i erred. This is where I made a mistake and I got into a rebound with another guy who i was sharing things with, it was a one off things that got a bit physical , but nothing which involved touching of private parts or sex ( oral or physical). Only kissing and attempt at dry humping. That's my fault, my blames. when i think of it, Although i broke up and went, i was so insecure and vulnerable about myself, that I was filling a void. There can be no excuse anyhow, but i wish i was strong enough to make better decisions when i left. I AM TO THIS DAY GUILTY THAT I WASN'T.

Well I stopped myself before any more damage could be done . When X finally came back, I thought I should tell him .Not all the details , but came clean that I had a rebound. He left in anger that day instead of talking any further. When he came back after one week, i thought he did want us to work finally after so many problems, but he later told me that it was just that he forgot overtime about it.

I thought this was my second chance at redemption and I would make him the happiest man on earth. Maybe because I was in guilt, I had my share of regrets and hence I din’t want to leave any stone unturned to make him happy. So i gave up my morals to please him, engaged in oral sex with him. I continued hard to work for us, and in the meantime, i felt i don’t want to start my relationship on set of lies or dishonesty and told him everything that happened in rebound. FUCKING HONESTY, all details. What followed afterwards was 6 months, of me saying my sorry, he slut shaming me, abusing me, calling me names, emotionally torturing me, me begging for mercy and forgiveness. I am not proud but I fell on his feet to stop him from going away, but in the end he dumped me and walked away.

All these months when I first came clean, I did so much on the hope of second chance, from arranging trips, to helping him in his illness, to changing my behaviour which I felt he must have felt irrational during our initital courtship, and obviously giving him more in bed. But he dumped me, blamed all on my rebound and left. He told me he can’t get past with what I did with the other guy during rebound. From the day he finally dumped me , I dont know how much I have cried and when there were no more tears left, so many suicidal thoughts have ran across me, doctors have put me on anti depressants. Again not proud I have even hurt myself physically, and today I am in deep despair and pain.

I also got to know that when the things first started going south after that one year of romance, he would jerk off everynight as well, while i would put myself to sleep crying . I never knew this was happening and i would still wake up everyday and kiss him good morning thinking today would be a new day. When i first came out honest about my rebound, all i asked him to give was 1&amp;#37; and i would give my 99&amp;#37; . I ran day and night, to help him in his bad times, to love him, to satisfy him, everything, but at the very end , he called me names and moved on.

Today when i look back , all i feel is deep regret about myself. I obviously agree that rebound should never have happened and it was my mistake but what I doubt more if i should have been honest about my rebound, or should that I should never have broken up in first place and continued on. I die a death everyday to this day, and I am held back in the tides of pain sweeping over me. Maybe it was all my fault, but I did everything to set it right, and that took away everything from me. I am just Sorry to this day and always will be. I dont know what to do now.",12Jul2018,2

239,"So today my sister and I were play-fighting. It was something really random but I’ll explain it real quick.

Basically, I asked her to hand me something and she threw it across the room, and that pissed me off but I laughed it off and I told her I’ll something just as annoying to get her back. And I thought of putting some of her money in her money bank (which she’ll have to break to get out). An innocent joke, she still had other money and its not impossible to break.

At this point I thought we were still play-fighting, and she chased me out of my room and locked me out. I come back 30 mins later to find my bed COVERED in pieces of the money bank (its made out of pottery). So i still laugh about it, cause i thought we were still play fighting, and i throw some of the big pieces on her bed. She starts grabbing those pieces and aims them at my face......

Keep in mind dry pottery is freaking heavy and super sharp (like ceramic or glass) it could literally blind, and she keep throwing one after another and i’m telling her to stop cause it cut me in the face. But she wasnt joking, she was pissed and trying to hurt me. My mom told her it could get in my eye and blind me, and shes like « let it, she deserves it »(????)

So at this point i get pissed cause she cut my freaking face and lip, and I tell her shes a crazy psycho for freaking out cause its a joke, she started accusing me of stealing her money and snooping through her stuff (??? Her bag was wide open, and we close so she goes through my stuff too i never say shit)


And then immediately after the fight she writes on her instagram story « if you mock me for my depression/anxiety, i hope you get it in the worst way possible «

J quickly became a good friend of mine as he had the same sense of humor as I did. He got good grades and all ways did the right thing. The day the got a phone, he sent me his number through discord and we immediately began texting each other.

A few weeks back, I copy and pasted J a funny Reddit comment I found, (which can be found as the last photo in the Imgur Album provided below)

This morning I woke to find some very anxiety inducing text messages from both his Mom &amp; Step-Dad threatening to call the police because they assumed that I was making bombs, when I’ve never even touched a gun before. 

The Mom said that I could continue texting J, while the Step-Dad said that I’m not even allowed to speak to J.

Yesterday my gf basically said she’d rather bring her sister as her +1 than have me show up late, so I might as well just not come at all. I thought we had made a good compromise but suddenly now it’s not good enough. Would I be an asshole for sticking to my original plan and competing? 

She texted me later to say “it’s ok we can do the original plan” but she’s done this at least twice before, where she says it’s ok to do something I think is right instead of something she wants me to do, and then gets upset when I do what I want. I’ve been preparing for this competition for months. I’ve lifted weights, I’ve trained 4-6 days per week, I’ve dieted to make weight, and now three weeks away I’m supposed to throw away all my preparation because a compromise we previously agreed on is suddenly not good enough. If I cave in and skip my tournament, am I setting a precedent where her needs always supersede my own? If I’m having this difficult a time with this decision, am I too immature or too selfish for a relationship?",12Jul2018,1

248,"I've known this guy since 9th grade of high school up until now. 9 close to 10 years. Were both male, mid 20's. We see each other weekly. Maybe even twice a week.

The story goes like this: About 7 years ago I met a pretty chill dude in freshman comp 2, lets call him Fonso. Fonso sat next to me and we would chat throughout the whole semester. Semester ended and we had each other on social media but we never chatted afterwards.

Fast forward 3-4 years ago and my friend starts dating a girl, whose baby daddy is non other than Fonso. I tell my friend I actually know him and my friend says how Fonso disrespects him and acts like his girlfriend is still his property. Then says something along the line of ""If you fuck with him, you dont fuck with me"".

Being on my friends side and not really talking to Fonso, I removed him from facebook and that was that. However, soonafter (maybe a month or 2), i realized I still had him on instagram but i decided to just leave it be since he's never done anything to me and I wasnt planning on being buddy buddy with him.

Fast forward to 2 months ago (mid feb), my friend and the girl break up. Everything is pretty normal in the group of friends for the next two months up until about 2 weeks ago.

My friend calls me up one night and immediately asks ""Why were you talking to Fonso?"", which I did just the day before through instagram messaging. He had posted a video of him going to an event and making out with girls, which he posts on a weekly basis, and I asked him how does he do that. Pick up girls.

I told my friend ""uuuh... I was talking to him about the event"". Followed by him saying ""No you werent, I know exactly what you said dont lie to me!"". Me:""Bro, I asked him how does he pick up girls at the event, im not lying to you"". Him: ""I told you if you fuck with him, you dont fuck me with. You ruined 9 years of friendship blah blah blah. I hope it was worth it."" Follow by me saying ""You two have beef with each other, not us. I didnt talk to this guy for 4 years out of respect for you. But because I asked a simple question you want to act like this? That's on you."" Then i just hung up because I was upset.

A few days later I apologized saying that it wasn't my intention to make him feel betrayed. I didnt go into that conversation thinking i'd lose my friend. I didnt go into that conversation thinking at all.

I understand why he's upset and have given him time to cool down, but I truly believe he is blowing this out of proportion. It's been like 3 weeks since we've talked.

P.S The way my friend found out is because Fonso called my friends ex girl and taunted her saying I messaged him over my friend on the topic of girls. Turns out Fonso really isn't that chill of a dude, twisting the scenario for his own gain. From there friend's ex girl calls my friend. And that's how all of this happens.

They live in the suburbs of London, maybe around a 40 minute train ride to the center, and have a small 3 bedroom house that my sister and brother live in too. 

I am currently staying in my brothers room and he is staying in my parent's room. Basically there really isn't enough room with me as an addition. They are happy to have me there but I do not have the best relationship with them, my parents are very smothering and I feel very restricted and ultimately unhappy. I am thinking of moving out and renting a room somewhere else for my sanity and so I can focus on my business as well as have a social life. 

A big part of me however feels guilty as this is money that I am wasting, that could be saved so that I could try and get a mortgage. But living with them will ultimately cause me a lot of stress and unhappiness.

I have saved up enough that I feel I could live off for one year so I'm not too worried about money, but I just don't know if it's the smartest decision.

254,"*I don’t think this counts as asking for medical advice, so I’m hoping this post is allowed. Sorry if it isn’t.*



Yesterday, I had a surgical procedure at the hospital. When the anesthesiologist came in for his consultation with me, he began by asking for my height and weight. Upon hearing my weight (which is on the lower end of a healthy BMI, but still perfectly healthy), he commented that I should “eat a sandwich sometime” and laughed.   I didn’t feel that it was appropriate for him to comment on my weight outside of a medical context, but whatever. I fake laughed and we moved on, me already a little on edge. 

Then he asked where I worked, trying to be friendly. This is where the real trouble began. I work in marketing for a vacation rental company in a resort town. This man, apparently, owns a million dollar home in between two of our rental homes. Upon hearing the name of my employer, he very aggressively started to yell at me, harassing me about my company’s failure to enforce local noise ordinances, saying he was being forced to sell his home because of us. This was not a quick comment, nor was his presentation of the matter mild. This was a long- winded, aggressive tirade. 

For the most part, I just took it. I explained that this wasn’t anything I dealt with, but that I would pass along his frustrations. I did not want to risk further upsetting him, as he was in a position to really, really hurt me if he wanted to (or even if he was distracted due to adrenaline or anger). My short replies and silence did not sate him, and he continued for quite a while. Finally, he finished ranting, asked a few more medical questions and left (once again, throwing in a few jabs on his way out). 

At this point, I considered canceling the procedure or asking for a new doctor, but it had taken me a long time to get to this stage and I really just wanted to move forward and get it all done and over with. I had my doubts though, and texted a few people that they should look to him, should something go wrong with my surgery.... probably excessive, but I wanted something in writing. 

I have my procedure, everything goes fine. 

Twice in the first hour after waking back up, he comes back into my room. The first time, he asks if I am feeling okay, to which I respond that I am. He then makes a few more ugly comments of the same nature. The second time, he does not ask about my well-being at all, but comes in to tell the nurse who was helping me that I worked for the company responsible for his having to sell his house, launching into the story again. The nurse did not engage with him at all and clearly felt uncomfortable, but he did not stop. 

I probably don’t need to say this, but post-procedure, I was still feeling groggy, confused and extremely vulnerable. Not the time to be yelled at by someone who is supposed to be helping take care of me and make me feel comfortable and confident in my medical care. 

I’m home now and would like to do something to address what happened. Any advice on how I should do this? 

I’m debating if I want to send a letter to the hospital higher ups and make an official report and all of that... or if I should just write a letter to him, directly, explaining how uncomfortable and scared he made me feel. Thoughts? ",12Jul2018,5

256,"I'm 31 - I need some advice on why i feel how i feel. 

I don't even know how to word this right so bare with me. 

I met my now husband in 2011 and married him in 2014. 

Timeline of 2011 to 2014 has been rocky finding new friendships since i was new to the city and knew no one at all and i'm not a very go getter person. 

My wedding party included his lady friends as my bridesmaids and maid of honor  (worst mistake is to have people in your party that didn't 100&amp;#37; like you) My wedding from planning it to the end was horrible, I just wanted to go home and be with my husband and cat. My fault for not having a spine back then and not saying NO more. 

2015 - was the worst year - I befriended a very interesting person with so many mental health issues, she would be your friends one moment and then text you saying to stop talking shit about her ( which i never had since no one talks to me oh but she has proof) people started to unfriend me on facebook, IG and then ghost me completely. They treat people like gold when they have wronged me in the past by spreading rumours about me, making me feel like a piece of shit. 

Now its 2018 and I am so done with how i went from having friends to having no friends - I get texts from some of them as to why i don't like their IG posts, Or that they feel like i'm distancing myself from them.  we are all in our 30's some of them are in there late 30's early 40s!!!

258,"I (21 M) matched with this girl (19 F) on Tinder about a two weeks ago and we hit it off almost instantly. We're both awkward and super introverted, enjoy spending our free time binging TV shows and movies, and generally don't get out too much (mostly since we both prefer our alone time). 

We've been talking to each other every day—although mostly at night when she's not busy—since we matched. We initially hit it off after talking about Game of Thrones for a bit. 

It didn't take long for me to muster up the courage and ask her if she wanted to go out sometime. We eventually ended up agreeing on making dinner and staying in and watching a movie or two together. 

Problem is, we're both pretty busy and don't have the time to meet up until the semester starts (we both attend the same University). 

A few days ago she apologized for replying slowly since she works so often (first time she actually mentioned her schedule and gave a reason for mostly only replying at night). I told her not to sweat it and we all have to make money somehow. 

She hasn't replied since and I don't know how to handle the situation. I've been out of the dating game for 3 years and my self-confidence has hit an all time low. I've struggle with generalized and social anxiety my entire life but have generally been able to get myself to do something regardless of my comfort level. Within the last 4 or 5 years I've also struggled with depression. It's nice to talk to someone that feels the same about the world as I do, but I don't want to seem clingy or anything by striking up a conversation again. My depression makes me tell myself that if someone doesn't reply then they're done with me and have lost interest, so I usually don't go out of my way to start up the conversation again. 

I've been overanalyzing all this and no matter how much I tell myself to calm down and to not get worked up over something that's not fully in my control, I can't help but stay hung up on it. 

I was really looking forward to our dinner and movie night and don't want that to slip away for 1) her losing interest in me out of the blue or 2) me seeming too needy by trying to jumpstart the convo or 3) never striking back up the convo to begin with and waiting it out too long.

We've only talked for about 10 days but I honestly miss our simple conversations. I felt comfortable in them for the first time in years and got butterflies in my stomach just seeing that she'd respond to something a few hour later. Other girls that I've talked to or tried to put myself out there for within the last 3 years never made me feel like this, even with months of talking and hanging out. Not to sound weird, but she's just genuinely beautiful in every way. I know I'm overthinking a lot of this, but I'm pretty clueless at this stage and would appreciate any guidance. 

And not to toot my own horn, but I know I'm not ugly by any means. I've never struggled with getting matches on Tinder, it's just I'd rather keep trying for her than move on right away. I get the whole ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"" but sometimes that one fish is the only catch you want. ",12Jul2018,1

261,"My Dad and my Uncle have had a... complex relationship. They were incredibly, incredibly close growing up, and remained so in young adulthood. However, there were always difficulties and sometimes just plain 'weirdness' , often involving my Uncle's various failed relationships, not all of which I know, and that which I do I feel is probably not my place to share with strangers. Suffice to say, one could summarise the relationship between the two of them as 'intense.' 

A couple of years ago we were all on holiday together, myself, parents, brother, Uncle, his wife, cousin, and it was one of the most unpleasant weeks of my life. My Uncle essentially bullied my Dad over the course of that week. I don't know if you've ever seen a parent being bullied, but like seeing them drunk or crying, it's a pretty disturbing thing to see. After that, he made clear, first implicitly then explicitly that he wanted to have no contact with us, and it's been a long time since I've seen him. He also claims that my Dad and their Mum, my grandmother, bullied him as a child. Now I only know what Dad and Grandma have told me about their childhood, but it is a claim so wildly out of kilter with what I know I have to think he has either created a false memory, or he is deliberately trying to hurt them.

As I say, when I was young, they were very close, and he was almost something of a second father figure, so it has been sad for me. But it has been hardest on my Dad and Grandma. 

Anyway, so I recently completed my undergraduate course and the graduation ceremony will be just over a week's time. My Grandma lives less than an hour from my university, so myself and my parents were going to spend the weekend there, all go to the ceremony together, sounds like a nice plan. And then last night we get a phone call to say that my Uncle, his wife and my cousin will also be there. We knew he'd be back in the country at the beginning of the week to attend my cousin's graduation but had no indication he'd be there. 

So now I feel we have a dilemma. I don't so much mind myself what happens. However, my Dad who has done so much for me deserves to be able to enjoy this weekend, and I know if my Uncle is there it will be at best deeply uncomfortable, at worst break out into something outright hostile. But if we say we don't want him there, that pretty much scuppers any chance of being able to repair the bridge to him. Not to mention the effect it could have on his relationship with my Grandma. So what should I do?

I hope this makes sense, as I said, my family is in some ways an oddly close and open one with each other, and the good side of this is when things have been good amongst us, they've been really good. But the flip side of this is that when things turned weird between my Dad and Uncle, they have been intense and very upsetting, and I'm not quite sure if I've been able to put that into words.

Anyway, strangers of Reddit, does anyone have any advice?",12Jul2018,3

I remember 2 mexican teens i wanna say they were 14 -15 years olds. Maybe younger. They were brothers too. 

They took me and my brother into the forest, showed us to like do fake anal i wanna say. Because there was never any penetration between us. Since we were kids we didnt know what we were doing.

Ive always been hypersexual since i was a kid. Maybe this is what kick started that. 

I just dont know why i would remember this now...

She started yelling at me to figure out how to pay for it on my own. I feel so lost and hopeless. I’m just laying in bed feeling lazy and stupid. ",12Jul2018,1
271,"Hi everyone,

First post here in r/Advice. Where to begin. Well, let's just say that around 6 years ago, when I was about to begin college, I was going in with the starry eyed naivety of becoming a doctor, and majored in a hard science (B.S. in Biochemistry). I attended an in-state university, and in order to make things more affordable, I was a commuter student for all four years, but during that time, real life, life at home, managed to interfere at the worst possible time with typically an annual catastrophe, the worst being my junior year when I was going through the heaviest portion of classes with pneumonia for 6 months. (19 credits per quarter, along with multiple labs, when I probably should have been in the hospital). My grades were impacted pretty severely, and by the time I was healthy, it was far too late to change majors. Though the spring quarter of my junior year was an improvement over the first two. Senior year, I hardly had to touch any classes for my major (as coursework was mostly wrapped up the previous year), and everything I took outside of my major I enjoyed far more. Graduation was very anti-climatic, and I have been job searching ever since. 

My current frustrations are: 1) I simply cannot find any interest in the jobs that are in the science sector 2) they hardly pay anything (had I known this fact alone I never would have ""majored"" in a hard science, on top of living in a city that has unfortunately exploded in growth), and if they do pay, one needs an advanced degree and what seems like a second lifetime of experience.  3) I also feel like I've painted myself in a corner, I was so hell bent on going to medical school even my minors cannot liberate me \[B.S. Biochemistry, minors in physics and biology, with nearly enough biology coursework for a second major.\] 

I don't really want to go back to school for a second bachelors, and getting an advanced degree in a major that I happened to graduate with, but no longer care about, I think is off the table. I want to jump ship, but I don't know how to market myself. Starting salary is a tremendous hangup of mine,  I know that's a shallow statement, but I accept it anymore. In my city, we do have some large names with investment firms (J.P. Morgan, Janus) and they are on my list. I've read that STEM backgrounds can be used for equity research. On occasion, some legal firms search for those who have been involved in STEM, and even political groups. All of which I find more substantially interesting than some scientific research job, and all pay at least double. 

Simply put, how can someone with a STEM degree market themselves, preferably being successful, to job sectors that are not in STEM? Going into a lab is something I can only dread anymore, and I'm tired of wasting my time applying for jobs I have no real interest in, other than they happen to fit my educational background.

Thank you for your time ",12Jul2018,1

273,"A little background, I started showing signs of depression early December of 2017. I remember walking into to work one day and taking down everything personal from my desk (pictures, thank you cards etc.). One of my coworkers asked me if I was redecorating my desk and I lied and said yes. Truthfully at the time I had no idea why I felt the urge to do it. In retrospect it was just the depression. 

In late January I met a man through a video game streaming platform (yeah that one) and before I knew it we were PMing and gaming every day. We messaged from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed. I have a boyfriend that I have been with for 4 years. I really enjoyed having this new friend because he told me that he had also struggled with depression and that I could talk to him about it whenever I wanted. He was married and even though we did flirt A LOT we were both very honest to our significant others about the role we had in each other’s lives. I have spent countless hours messaging him and watching him stream and he has always been there for me no matter what. His wife has always hinted at being annoyed by my presence in his life but she accepted it because she could tell he was happy. This went on for 6+ months. 

Last week he asked me what I would think of him inviting her to our discord server (that we mostly used for the game we played that she has no interest in playing). I told him I would never tell him that he couldn’t invite his WIFE to the server. So she joined and we were all getting along great. I posted a selfie to one of my socials and he PMed me and told me how pretty I was and how great I looked. He had constantly asked for pictures of me behind his wife’s back this whole time. I shut him down again and again because I had a boyfriend. When he DMed me about my selfie I just snapped. Prior to this I shut down his advances by explaining that the dynamic of our relationship changed since I was communicating with his wife on a daily basis and it was no longer harmless flirting but it felt disrespectful to do it in front of her face. The reason she had accepted it in the past was because she didn’t have to know all the details, just that her husband was no longer depressed all the time. I told him he was being disrespectful to both of us and that I wanted no part in this anymore. He said he understood and that he would still be there for me if I needed him. I made the decision to leave the server for my mental health due to it being a toxic environment full of “bad vibes”. I also blocked him on all social media, basically leaving him no way to contact me. 

Literally an hour after I left he got on his stream and started talking shit about me. He said I was needy and that I constantly begged him to leave his wife for me. She jumped in and starting insulting me as well. Before I knew it all the people in our server were in stream chat calling me psycho and crazy. He brought up most of the things I had confided in him on stream in front of everybody. I was watching in an incognito browser so none of them knew I was watching or reading chat. Hearing the way these people were talking about me really fucked with my head. I didn’t have any serious attachment to them but they were all airing grievances that I had no idea existed. None of these people have never been anything but nice before so I was very shocked to read all of their thoughts on me. I closed out the browsers immediately and I haven’t watched any of his streams since.  

I feel so betrayed that he would turn so quickly especially since our last communication was him saying he understood and supported my decision to leave his little toxic community. It seemed like he was taking all of the things he had communicated that he was insecure about when we talked and projected them onto me as a scape goat for his behavior over the last 6 months. He had personally messaged me multiple times complaining about all the people he was now encouraging to attack me. They even accused me of being a catfish and pretending I had a bf this whole time. None of these people actually know me (only my screen name) and I’m not looking to get any one in trouble (not that I could). 

I’m not sure if I should confront him or his wife about blatantly lying about me and our interactions or just tell him that I am hurt that he told personal details about my mental illness and other things. 

I want to just ignore it and cut any communication with those people all together but it feels open ended. My concern is my mental health and I want to move past this but I don’t know how. ",12Jul2018,1
274,"Hello guys, I am at a real dilemma here.   


[https://ibb.co/iQ4aK8](https://ibb.co/iQ4aK8)

I'm building a coffee cart with an added bar feature that can retract and extend. The total height of the cart with bar extended is 2m. I am wondering whether the bar will look weird on the cart and for the people standing behind it. As in if the cart is viewed from the front, will the bar make the cart look weird or the people behind it?

The bar is mainly to put our branding and to put up signages telling people where to queue and collect.

276,"A little background to that question. I [24F] dated my ex [24F] for a year (long distance, but same country) before we broke up - I had gotten admission into a university in another continent, and we were rocky about the longer distance. We decided to go ahead with it, but I found out that she’s been two timing me with another girl who she moved in with, for a few months. (She just started dating this new girl, and moved in immediately)

While I’m now sort of over it and dating someone else, I’ve been somewhat careful in my new relationship about ‘red flags’ in her behaviour. However, my ex is still dating the girl she cheated on me with. The other girl had my ex cheat on her like a month into their relationship- had her use her emotionally, perhaps financially (as she had difficulty finding a place to stay in the city), and after we all found out about the two timing, my ex even suggested a poly amorous relationship.

I had been dating my ex for a year so I did know her and I loved her very much, so I did consider forgiving her. But this other girl had just been dating her for like a month- and kept doing so after. During this time I know my ex was extremely emotionally unstable, had anger issues, took an overdose of sleeping pills. After an initially rocky period where my ex would contact me saying she still loves me and is unhappy in her new relationship, she now says that she’s happy in this relationship and appreciates her current GF for her patience in dealing with her, that she’s changed as a person in the relationship, that she’s communicating better with her and with her family, and that she may consider marrying her in the next few years.

I’m at the point where I’m happy for her (or at least not angry), but I can’t help but marvel at how her current GF handled all that shit, and apparently they now have a happy ending. The usual advice in such situations is to run away from such obvious red flags. But the current GF seems to have powered through it all, and it has worked out. I’m a little confused about my idea of how things work, and would like some clarity/opinions on this.",12Jul2018,0
277,"I have a job and can make car payments but my credit is poor and I don't have a lot of cash on hand. I got a preapproved credit offer for a car loan at a local dealership from my credit card company. I do not have a driver's license, but my GF does and if I bought the car it would be her doing the driving. I am very sensitive (i.e. embarrassed) about my bad credit. I am thinking of buying an inexpensive car that is cheaper than my approval amount so that there won't be an out-of-pocket cost.

I have three fears: 

1, I'll walk in with my preapproval, find a car I like, start signing the paperwork, and then they'll say ""ok, so we just need to run a credit check first"" and it will come back with sirens blaring and I'll be thrown out the front door and spat upon.

2. That won't happen, but they'll say ""ok now we just need the flugelhorn tax fee, which is $900 and which has to be paid in cash"" and then I'll pretend to have to go to the bathroom and try to run but they'll catch me, throw me out the front door, and spit on me.

3. That won't happen, but since it's a car loan I'll have to have insurance, and since I don't have a license the insurance will have to be my GF's, and it will turn into a huge nightmare scene where they end up turning on a blaring siren and throwing me out the front door and spitting on me.

279,"Over the last 18 months my life has somewhat imploded. 

Our dog (only 2 years old) had a series of unforeseen medical problems that have resulted in a lot of stress. Currently he’s being kept alive by a load of medication, a state that I don’t agree with but my mother refuses to put him down as to her ‘a life is a life’. But seeing him in the constant lethargic state instead of the energetic puppy I knew is desperately sad to me and it’s something beyond my control.

I had a 6 year relationship that ended 5 months ago as I discovered my boyfriend had started another relationship behind my back, and eventually when confronted he chose her over me. To go from a promise of moving in together and an imminent engagement to having the life I thought I would have being ripped away is incredibly difficult to come to terms with. I’m getting better, but the pain does still rear its head.

The most stressful thing however, is my father. He is extremely mentally unwell with what consultants believe is paranoid schizophrenia, however he refuses to accept any treatment. He has been kicked out of the home as he has become aggressive and erratic, and that behaviour has become directed at us. We have been placed on a police victim list (meaning we have a dedicated worker as they feel there is a real threat of harm), and my father has taken to stalking myself and other members of the family and sending threats of physical harm to us or himself. This often happens in the middle of the night and the constant looking over my shoulder and worry for him as a human being means that I’ve fallen into a deep state of anxiety. We’re working with the police to hopefully get him arrested and assessed with the ultimate aim for him to be committed in a mental institution for treatment even if it is against his will. There's just a lot of bureaucracy involved so the process is slow.

The culmination of these things have spun me into terrible anxiety and near depression. My sleep habits have become poor and I’ve lost a ton of weight due to the stress. I look terrible and often I feel like I’m present in life but not ‘really there’. Unsurprisingly this has bled over into my work life.

I go in and perform my duties, I think it peaks and troughs on whether I’m having a good day or a bad day, but I know my performance has been patchy. The main issue though is that my work places emphasis on joining in with ‘office culture’ and being friendly to everyone, apart from a guy my own age who knows about my problems, I’m not particularly friendly with any of them. I’m nice of course, but when they’re laughing and joking with each other I feel like I’m outside looking in as I can’t bring myself to ‘snap out of my funk’ so to speak. It's like I'm watching these happy interactions but my own mind is fogged and I can't think of what to say even if I wanted to join the conversation. I’ve heard in bits and pieces that my boss isn’t too keen on me for this reason, and I can tell that along with some others she doesn’t particularly care for me at all. I will say that the people I am friendlier with seem quite fond of me, but those who I’m disconnected from seem to have little positive feelings towards me. I know this is my own fault for letting my situation get the best of me and I deeply regret that this is the situation and it does make me uncomfortable knowing that people don't particularly like me.

My appraisal is coming up in two weeks and at the bottom there is the obligatory box for ‘is there anything else you’d like to discuss’. I’m debating whether to request a brief conversation regarding my personal circumstances to assuage the feelings around it and give them confidence that I’ll make steps to try harder in future. But I know there seems to be a stigma around divulging this type of information at work, so I’m unsure. Is this something that I should bring up do you think, even if it’s just to acknowledge it? I know my boss and others are aware of bits and pieces, but I don’t think they know how deeply it has affected me or how serious it is. Things are finally starting to look up and I’m feeling happier than I’ve been in a long time but I feel stuck in this awkward rut I've created for myself. I’d very much like to be part of the office culture as we are a small team of about 20 people, but I’m wondering if it’s too late to explain and try again. Especially where these situations have been going on for a long time it might be a case of there’s no point in mentioning it as people are too set in their opinions. I’m not in danger of losing my job, but just to increase my happiness at work I’m wondering if it’s a good idea? Would my boss sympathise and understand me a little better? And what could I even say that would remain appropriate for a work environment even if it is a very casual one?",12Jul2018,4
280,"I'm 23 and recently quit my dead end job without anything else lined up, but I'm actively looking for a another job. My cousin is 20 and lives with his mom and grandma and his dad has been on disability for my cousin's whole life. No one in his family has made him work a day in his life.

When he was 13, he tried to commit suicide because he is gay and didn't think his parents would handle it well, which wasn't true, but certainly an understandable fear.

I feel like an asshole for saying this, but I don't particularly enjoy his company. He's very emotionally and physically needy. He refuses to drive anywhere and lives 30 minutes away from me. I end up doing at least 2 hours in the car every time I see him because he just wants to come back to my house.  

He's pretty sensitive and we have very different interests and senses of humor so I feel like I'm always tip-toeing around him. Every time he comes over, he leaves the place a mess and drinks all the soda in the house. He talks non stop and I generally prefer the quiet. I can't really do anything else (like looking for a job) when we're together because of this.

He texts me at least 3 times a week asking to do something together and I cave at least once a week because he's family. I get pretty near to having an anxiety attack whenever I see his name on the 3 different messaging apps he tries to contact me through. 

If I'm just being a dick, let me know. But if there is some way I can communicate to him that I can't do stuff with him more than like once a month, I would appreciate any help on how to approach that topic. ",12Jul2018,7

She ends up apologizing for her busy schedule and I told her not to sweat it, everyone's gotta make a living somehow. She hasn't responded for 4 days since then.

I struggle with depression and anxiety so I know I'm overthinking this, but I'm not trying to lose her interest and that date in 6 weeks but I'm also not trying to seem clingy. Been out of the dating game for 3 years now after ending my first real relationship and wanted to wait it out to try and better myself, but the problem is I've lost all confidence in these sorts of situations since then. 

I've been ghosted for some weird stuff before, but never for telling someone not to worry about being busy. Do you think I should just stop overthinking and text her or just ride it out until the semester starts and ask her if she's still on board for our date?

Let me just say that I would never cheat. Never in a million years. I love him too much to.  
Side note: I do not think of these fantasies when I am with my boyfriend in bed, I actually don’t even think of them when I masturbate. They just come to me sometimes. 


Anyway, I have always been interested in sex,porn,etc. Back when I wasn’t with my boyfriend I would learn about my sexuality and I even planned on becoming a pornstar. Like seriously. Of course I would never do that now but the idea of being “porny” or whatever was hot to me. It still is. I still act like it in the bedroom even if it is only with one person it still feels great because its with the person I love. I guess I’m just hypersexual in my mind. Whereas I fantasize a lot about certain things. (TMI Maybe but I wanna say it anyway) Some things like being gangbanged (of course with my boyfriend involved in it.) Even if this wasn’t to happen(which it probably wont happen) I’m not really fiending for it tbh. Its just hot to think about. I’m comfortable with my sexuality. Sometimes I get thoughts about people that aren’t him though,sometimes it’d be band members but...one thats really bothering me is this friend of his that I think is attractive.Of course I know finding someone attractive that isnt my BF isn’t inherently bad tho. I wouldn’t have sex with him This guilt only came along today as I started thinking about it in depth.Before the guilt,I usually would just think that the thought was hot and would be like “oh man but I’d never do that if I’m with (BFS name) because thats wrong” This doesn’t mean in ANYWAY that I would ever EVER have sex with him. I know that I wouldn’t. However it still makes me feel guilty because of my OCD/excessive guilt cycle.  My mind tells me its like my “thoughts are cheating on him” but I know its not that.

288,"So we were just given the option to work flex time, which is great! And a system was worked out that seems fair to everyone.  

Unfortunately I was kind of labelled the roadblock to it because I had raised concerns regarding flex time (I wanted to make sure I wasn't going to be responsible for covering for everyone when they decided they wanted to do flex time and inadvertently working overtime for free).

So a few of my co-workers changed their hours. It's working well so far. But now because they come in earlier, they want to take lunch earlier too (which is understandable).

I've always taken my lunch around the same time everyday. I try to keep to a schedule because I have time sensitive things that need to be done each day (I have a variety of jobs along with my main job - small company). So it can be a challenge juggling everything. 

I've always been very flexible, covering for other people in the office if they need to leave for an appointment or whatever. 

However, I've noticed that when they have to cover for someone else, they always complain and throw a temper tantrum (literally).

So now that they have changed their hours, they want to go at the same time as me for lunch (which isn't allowed, someone needs to cover). And instead of asking me if I could change my hours once in a while, they have been leaving just after I leave. And now my manager is upset with us for all being gone at the same time.

Unfortunately I'm starting to feel like it's expected of me to change my schedule to suit them, which I don't mind on occasion. But when that attitude is not reciprocated by the people expecting the favour in return, how do you handle that?

I know that even if I offer to change my time, they are still going to leave whenever they want. They don't leave at a set time and so I feel like I would just be waiting around all day to take my lunch, which I don't think is fair.

TL;DR: Co-workers have changed their hours and now want to take lunch at the time I have always taken it as. I have time sensitive stuff to do, and have to juggle my lunch and covering for everyone along with everything else. Manager is upset that co-workers are taking lunch at the same time as me. But it's up to us to figure out a system that works. Co-workers are not very flexible and kind of just come and go as they please. What should I do?",12Jul2018,1

Hello Everyone,

Before you call me stupid, yes i did buy instagram followers to promote my instagram business and yes i do deeply regret it.

As they advertised on their website, they sold “real, active users” that would like and comment on your page. After 24 hours of purchasing the users, i find that people that don’t even speak english and have around 20 followers, whilst following 10,000 started to follow me. This immediately led me to believe that they were fake, and i wanted my money back. 

I was in a live chat with the customer service for about 30 minutes, and it led no where. She basically kept repeating how they have no control over the people that follow me (Even though they advertise them as “active” and “real”) I continue to say i want my money back but the return policy only takes effect if you don’t get any followers. 

I have pictures of the chat, and i also found that the photo of the person i was talking to was just grabbed from google, while she kept saying it was her. 

I just want to know if there is anyway i can get my money back or do anything. Thank you so much if you read this!

TL;DR: I kind of got scammed on a website where you buy followers, i want to know if i can do anything.

She's not on the pill so we used condoms with no breakage, I pulled out to finish both times regardless because I took too long. She says she feels no other symptoms of pregnancy and is about to take a pregnancy test today to be certain.

I have severe emotional and psychological issues so this entire situation feels like it is literally killing me. I'm having awful thoughts. I am continuously nauseated and throwing up. I'm shaking, have chills, cannot eat any solid food. My anxiety is off the charts and I can't stop thinking about it. I have so many worries on my mind, I can barely take care of myself due to my severe depression/bipolar disorder/anxiety. Having a child in this world would murder me on all fronts.

I'm scared, alone (girlfriend is on trip in Cali, 3hrs time difference so she's asleep), and thinking very awful thoughts. I literally feel like I'm burning in hell physically and mentally. Please help give me advice or anything to help calm me down. I have no where to turn.",12Jul2018,0
296,"So to make a long story short my landlords decided to sell their house and gave me 30 days notice to move out on June 27th. 
I found a place by July 1st and moved in. 
I was supposed to have all my stuff out by July 7th but due to work I was unable to do that and it has taken an extra week. I told them I would pay them the prorated rate of 18/a day for the week. They have been relentlessly texting me, calling, contacting my family, they actually went to my parents' house and threatened to dump my stuff on their lawn. So I stopped being nice. 
She texted me this morning at 10am and asked what time I was coming tomorrow. At 11 I got another lengthy text saying ""OMG this is ridiculous you are stringing us along and not contacting us etc etc. You owe us $150 for rent and $70 for the water bill.
This is was my response: 

""You just texted me a little over an hour ago. I dont need to drop everything and respond immediately.
Yes, its been a week. I'm sorry for the extra 7 days it has taken for the 30 day notice I got to move out of the blue. I will pay you $126 for the extra week. That is $18/a day for a week. As for the water bill, that's not in my name and I'm not paying that. You should contact [ex husband] to pay his water bill. 
As for tomorrow, I have to rent a truck to haul. I'll let you know what time that will be tomorrow morning. ""

She texted back ""wow. Real nice.""

303,"Hello, on a throwaway account because of some personal details. I'm sorry for the length, but I felt some detail about me and other context was needed.

I had a slightly weird experience last Friday night and I've been looking for somewhere on Reddit to maybe relay the night and my weird feeling, to see if anyone can relate or suggest what may have happened. For background, I live in Austria, and local beer festivals are quite common through the summertime, with small after parties once the festival closes.

Here's what I drank:

* Around 8.45pm - one light beer, between 9.30pm-12am - 2 Fest beers (these are large 1 litre glasses, beer is stronger than the norm).
* Around 12am-1am - a few sips of white wine (which I watched go directly into the glass before it went into my mouth), one small shot of hazelnut liquor (20&amp;#37; vol.), one bottle of light beer, and then another bottle of light beer (but I only remember buying it and starting to drink it, not finishing it)

I'm not a lightweight, and although I was certainly tipsy, this is certainly not a crazy night. It was a companionable evening at a local festival where everyone is drinking socially. From what I've described above, I know that I would be tipsy and friendly, but aware of everything and capable of taking care of myself. The amount that I remember drinking would not have had me wasted. I had also eaten beforehand and was not on medication.

Although when I was younger, I could drink to excess without many repercussions, now I'm at the end of my 20s, I tend to pace myself, avoid mixing most of the time, and drink water. If I have an hangover, it comes in the form of throwing up the next day, though this takes some doing. I hate throwing up, so I rarely get to that point anymore.

Back to the evening. Around 1am, I pop to the bar for my second bottle of beer, when I spot a guy I had a brief thing with. We're just very friendly with each other, and that's about it. He's bi, or possibly gay, and I could tell he was sizing up the guy he was chatting to, so I just struck a friendly vibe and offered to buy both of them a beer. So we do that, and the next thing I remember is that he's gone - to the bathroom, or to smoke or something - and this guy I don't know is left with me. He starts talking to me and I remember him aggressively and repeatedly telling me that my friend is gay, and I know that, right? I'm just being diplomatic and saying, 'hey, we're not involved, that's his personal business, if you're into him, that's great, have fun.' I really don't want to get involved here but it feels like he's warning me off, a bit weirdly aggressively.

And that's the last thing I remember from that part of the evening. I have no idea how that conversation ended or what followed.

The next thing I remember is coming to in the bathroom. I know I've thrown up massively although I can't completely remember actually doing it and I sort of remember just sitting in the stall dazedly staring at the wall, because I felt so confused and disorientated. I manage to leave the bathroom, and find that barely anyone is left. I check my phone and it's 3.30am. The friend I was staying with has texted me around 3 to say that they've looked all over and can't find me - where did I go off to? She's gone back to her apartment and will wait there for me.

Luckily, there were a couple of people still left and a nice stranger quizzed me to find out where my friend's place was and made sure I got there. I remember walking with him and continuously saying I don't know what happened and why I was ill - did he know why I'd been in the bathroom for so long? I obviously just looked incredibly drunk.

And if I had drank a huge amount and remembered even just drinking more than what I listed, I would be thinking that I had just got very drunk, end of story. But this isn't me. I always vividly remember if I suddenly find myself running for a bathroom stall. I always know what's to blame if I'm hungover. I've only blacked out maybe once in 12 years and a.) that is why I don't drink tequila anymore and b.) on that occasion, I still knew exactly why I'd been in that state.

There is a chunk of time missing for me between 1-3.30am and I have no idea what happened during that time. I cannot shake the feeling that something weird happened. It's not just the being sick, it's also the confused state I was in.

Nothing else happened to me, as far as I can tell. I wasn't sore anywhere and there are are no marks or bruises, so that's not my concern.

The following day, I was tired and dehydrated, nothing unusual from drinking. However, I felt horribly depressed for nearly two days afterwards (life felt worthless, no energy except to sit around listlessly) and my stomach was really unsettled, I had to go to the toilet pretty quickly after eating anything too. Of course it's normal to have an upset stomach with a hangover, but it usually resolves itself much more quickly once I'm hydrated again. I definitely didn't want to leave the the house those two days. None of this experience is normal for me as a hangover or for the amount I remember consuming.

I would shrug it off, but I'm pretty unsettled by the feeling of missing time. I relayed these details to a friend I trust and she asked if someone could have popped something in my drink. This did cross my mind, but all the symptoms I've ever read about drink spiking have been much more severe. Is there anything that would cause my symptoms? I suppose the thing that sticks out for me is missing time, although it was less than three hours. I usually keep hold of my drinks, but I wouldn't have at all been considering this risk at this particular place, so I wouldn't have been covering up my bottle.

I've had this on my mind for a few days and I'm going to maybe ask the guy friend and someone else I know from that night whether they saw me at all and if I was acting strangely. But I don't really have any other avenue to pursue.

So there we go. Has anyone else had a similar story or can maybe suggest if something else happened?",12Jul2018,3
304,"Maybe this has to do with my bad anxiety, but whenever my friends go through something, I always listen to their complaints. I ask them why they feel down, and REALLY conversate with them. But whenever I txt them about how I feel, I don't get much of a response.

I texted one of my friends about sadness(me trying to sugarcoat my suicidal depression), she responded by telling me she is depressed as well. The love of her life died in a vehicle accident a few yrs back. Keep in mind, she was not telling me this(again) so I can relate and lift my spirits, but just to relate to something I texted her. Something she told me about MULTIPLE times in the past, and I provided an ear when telling me the details about who ran over him etc. So why is it that no one asks questions or gets deep for me, are high school friendships supposed to be all laughter 24/7? 

I felt so suicidal today, like other days. And my friend called me just to talk. I texted her like I will call her back when I ""am not angry and in a low mood"". I nvr got a response or a ?, though I listened to her for more than 30 mins in the middle of the night when she talked about her brother and his friends stealing money, hiring a prostitute, her moms tragic financial situation, her dad basically being a cheater who isn't comitted to their lives etc.

But if I talk about something deep for 2 seconds, the response is ""oh"" or a ""mhm"". I nvr get more than a paragraph or 3 sentences when I talk about something. And this is coming from someone who masks almost everything about his emotional misery because of severe anxiety and depression being social stigmas.

So do I have bad friends? They include me, but I just feel like I put out so much effort into hearing someone speak from the blue part of their heart, and I nvr get it in return. It's just laugh, chill etc. It does not help that I have a great therapist, who I don't talk to about my mental health. A family I prefer not to talk to.

I told him how I felt last night about the situation and this was his response: Can we talk about it tomorrow? We both have agreed multiple times how good we are together and how no one can make us feel the way each other feel. I really do love you and I don't just say that to say it, I actually mean it like I genuinely love you and really don't want to talk to or get with other girls. The way you talk to me, I assumed that you felt the same but I guess you're losing interest? I'm sorry but for you to say that you don't want to see me because of things that happened almost 2 years ago I'm high school is kind of weird because I have proven to you I have matured since then. And you have done the same, if there is someone else in the picture that is driving us apart that would make sense for you to spring this upon me but I have dedicated everything to you ever since you sent me that snap when I was at the wedding because I believed you're the one, no one makes my heart beat like u, if you don't feel the same at least see me tomorrow and tell me then.

309,"So I'll try my best to encapsulate the situation. I was recently offered a job from my wife's uncle on the other side of the country. He said he needed a ""computer guy"" on hand. I'm a decently qualified IT with a few certifications and a degree. With the salary offered, I took the job and we moved across the country.

I have been here for about 5 months now, and I have decided; I'm not staying. The pay is great but there are two things that I just can't handle. (1) He treats me like dirt. I was in the military so I have a very thick skin. This guy treats me like absolute dirt. He is a co-owner so he can't really be ""fired"" but even the other managers have taken him aside to be like ""WTF man, you treat him horrible."" (2) I was under the impression this job was IT related but it's not at all. It's to use an engineering program called CAD. I can use it fairly well, but a job doing CAD is not for me; I was misinformed about what the job actually entailed. 

Anyways the #1 reason I'm leaving is the treatment is horrible. I get talked to like I'm stupid. I literally get yelled at. And even today we had an IT issue which I began to troubleshoot because I have 5 years troubleshooting IT. Anyway half the office was out of network connection so when I got about 1/2 way to the solution I was literally told ""Stop messing with the computers. That's not your fucking job and you don't know what the fuck you're doing."" One of the other managers flipped out on him for talking to me with that tone, but it's not the first nor will be the last time. The guy before me who trained me, SUPER cool dude warned me that the reason he left was because of my current boss. Anyways, I've decided that I will not stay here very long.

The issue I'm facing is: when do I pull the plug? Everyone else at the company has been super polite and truly awesome people… Everyone here dislikes him.  At first I thought they were giving me a hard time, but now I see the comments Sam (the guy I replaced) as well as the other employees were saying were actually true… not jokes. 

I'm not sure when to put my 2 weeks in. I've only been here 5 months and I feel obligated to hit the 1 year mark out of respect. This job required 2-3 months of training wheels before I could actually truly do the job. I don't want to put them back in the hiring market to re-train another person out of respect for all the other employees. My wife and I plan to leave around February when our tax returns come to cover the 3 months of health insurance our family will be without. Is that a good idea? I try to lead the most respectable life possible and I try to stick to my word. Part of me wants to dip out right now, but the other part says ""You need to respect the company and stay 1 year""

310,"I live in an apartment complex with my roommate. The neighbors across from us moved in around a month ago. Since they came here, they have been knocking on our door asking for cash. The first few times, they just needed a dollar or two and I had no problem helping out. Yet,  they've recently been asking for ""help with food"".

""Can we borrow $5? We'll pay you back as soon as we can!"" ""Sure.""

""Hey can you lend me $10? We'll pay you back as soon as we can!"" ""Sorry, can't. Money is tight atm.""

They have gotten on my last nerve. We have complained about the noise twice to our leasing office, but it still continues.

I'm not in anything too deep just I have my own intentions that I feel my parents aren't aware of at all. I like living with them and all but I feel like I could get more things done if I wasn't with them. They've been blowing up my phone with things like this isn't how a person lives and I'm just living like the house is my own place. Come and go whenever and shit like that. I just work at night and honestly not a big fan of interacting with people so I come home late to a peaceful sleeping home. I could move out but I got a few things to worry about. My parents are always egging me on about school and how I should care about it more but I feel like I got more opportunities and options than just school. I'm not saying school is a bad idea just I don't think blowing money at school when I have no idea what I wanna do is the best thing for me. I'm getting lunch with a cousin in a few days and when I saw her she was saying she could get me a internship at her I.T. company and it seems like something I could do. The only thing is I'm not on my best terms with my family. My dad is annoyed and my step mom is pissed at me, my actual mom is mad too because she saw me fucked up at my aunt's wedding and judged me for it(mom everybody's fucked up it's a wedding) 

Really my parents just expect me to be perfect and go to school, be a part of the family blah blah blah. I know if it's unusual but I just really want to not be bothered anymore. I don't want to be selfish but at the same time I'm restless about getting out of the house and being left alone. I wouldn't mind visiting I just think we now have different priorities about how I wanna spend my life. With this internship I could have a real opportunity if I stick with it and skip all the bullshit. I like computers and she said they would teach me how to do I.T. it's just that if I also move out I would have to balance that and work. I think it might be doable if I work my ass off on the weekends and do the internship during the week. So am I just retarded or should I try to do these big things in my life?",12Jul2018,1
317,"Today I got a message from my old bosses wife asking me if I can lend her $500 cash. 

Some background:
I worked for them as a personal assistant/secretary/everything and anything else for 2 years. I worked out of their home and filled any and every role they needed even driving their kids to school/camp. 
I quit after a bit more than two years back in November 17 for many reasons, the biggest being:
1. Obvious money issues and seeing that the company was being run very sloppily and wouldn’t be growing or going anywhere (I.e. no future)
2. Being put in the middle of their marital problems too many awkward times. 

So skip forward to the past 3 months and I have been seeing the wife posting on Facebook about how their marriage is over. 
Back in February she asked me to meet her at a restaurant and asked me all kinds of questions about him and how he ran the business and why he has no money. I felt very bad hearing how everything went downhill after I quit and he stopped doing business and couldn’t pay any of their personal bills. (She has 4 kids from a previous marriage and just had a baby for him in December after her begged her to, promising to support them all)

Sooo now today she messaged me asking if I can lend her money and she will pay me back in 2 weeks guaranteed. Obviously I know they are terrible with money and wouldn’t lend her anything with the actual hopes of getting it back but because I feel very bad for what he has put her through the past year I was considering doing it. I asked how much she needed and she said $500. 

I would never give her $500. I am single and work to support myself living paycheck to paycheck so that is not an option. I do have some savings and would consider giving her like $100 but I’m not sure if that would make it turn into a situation where she always asks me for money.

319,"Warning: Very long post about animal abuse.

I've been volunteering at a place for some time which is a volunteer run shelter for animals. What I've discovered while volunteering has horrified me. Animals are not being spayed, vaccinated, or medically treated in a timely way (or at all). Animals are being born in the shelter and then go on to have several more generations, who mainly either die off from illness or continue reproducing for more generations. Around half of the population has died from illnesses. Their adoption rate is matched by their death rate. They somehow managed to ""lose"" a quarter of their population through ""escapes"". They magically know which animal is the father of which baby animals (even going back several generations), despite claiming the animals get accidentally pregnant. They go through the basic motions of having protocols so on the surface it somewhat looks legit if you just pop in to visit but if you look a bit closer you can tell it's basically just an image to keep people from prying. They don't keep track of the animals and it's essentially a major cover up for hoarding. They don't actually isolate sick animals and allow animal groups to live freely through the entire building, even in the bathrooms. They boast about being ""no kill"" despite half of their population having died. They offer a comically small amount of their animals for adoption and the animals they adopt out end up returned for illness or outright dying from it.

They constantly fund raise, get awarded grants of thousands of dollars, etc yet can ""never afford"" basic care and instead spend it on things like the building's appearance, or people just simply don't talk about where it went to. The last person on the board who pointed this out was personally attacked and fired. Apparently this place is already well known in the community for being terrible and has had authorities investigating it several times. They have had animals removed and put down from being so ill, and even outcry from the community and news to shut the place down. Despite doing several illegal things openly and blatantly, it never gets shut down. I am not sure why it never gets shut down despite repeated reports. 

They have had volunteers and board of directors quitting constantly and shuffling in new ones all the time.  The same few people who founded the place are always there and are totally corrupt. They get angry when volunteers interact with each other and even tried to roll out forms to sign where they can't communicate with each other in or out of the shelter. They install puppet leaders and get rid of them immediately when they start to wise up. Their board meetings involve hostility, personal attacks and lots of filibustering until time runs out. If you do anything other than smile and nod at what they say they eventually slander you until you quit, or figure out a way to fire you in underhanded ways. They will appear at peoples doors or call them to outright harass them for the most bizarre things, as well as try to physically chase people out of the shelter when upset. They also will blatantly lie to authorities and talk their way out of situations with them and the news, as well as lie to new volunteers and manipulate them until they wise up (at which point the process of slander and removing them will start). 

They have outright told lies to the media which were then published publicly as facts. Those who stay ignorant and toe the line get promoted into leadership positions without having any real merit for those positions, and usually they are not able to do much within those positions as they are micromanaged and closely watched. Volunteers are heavily censored during meetings and scolded harshly and publicly humiliated if they say anything other than what they are told to think/say. 

I'm not sure what to do about this situation because animals are suffering, constantly reproducing and being born with illnesses, becoming disfigured/disabled from illness, and dying really sickly and terrible deaths.  Money for these animals is disappearing and peoples past attempts at getting the place shut down never pan out.  Any attempts from volunteers to reform the place from the inside are completely sabotaged every time. I am honestly completely baffled why this place is still open as it is a blatant hoarding situation and possibly a money laundering situation.",12Jul2018,1
320,"A friend has put the thought of learning programming in my head, it seems like a headache although it really interests me and I think it would be a cool skill to have. I have minimal computer knowledge but I'm not brain dead. I'm wondering the best program to start with, or maybe some information others have used to get their foot in the door I know basically nothing. Ive seen that depending what you want to do should dictate what program you use, I think it would be cool to know how to make simple video games, or even apps and websites idk if that is important to note or not.

I don't have a high interest in Biology. I only went to college because I saw no other option and I was kind of pressured to go. I wish I would have taken time off after high school before going to college.

I never wanted to be a doctor and go to medical school. I thought about being a PA, but then I decided no. I thought about being a nurse, but then I don't think I want to do that. I don't know what I want to do. I don't want to end up getting a degree in Biology and then end up regretting it.

I want to take a few years off from school to work, volunteer, get my mental health in order (I suffer with social anxiety and possibly ADHD), get my driver's license, and find my passion in life. I don't want to keep wasting time and money in school when I don't want to be there.

HELP. BLIND GIRL IN NEED OF ADVICE FOR LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP ADVICE[18/F]
u/Lapista
I am in a long distance relationship. We are in two different countries. He lives back in my hometown. It has almost been a month and a half. It started off so well. We spoke frequently in the day. He would send me pictures of scenery etc(i have a little sight in one eye) but now we might talk once or twice a day. He looks at my message but takes hours to respond. I understand he can be busy. However, sometimes i find him on the app we met and i can see him being random in some groups. I trust him of course. At times he says he.needs alone time after a problem or fight occured in his life. I give him that space until he messages me on the next day. Whenever i ask.him whats happened. He tells me not to worry or that he doesnt wanna talk about it.

I dont push him, but i feel like he is pushing me away or being distant at times. I wish we could talk more frequently. I also.have this major insecurity that i want to seriously talk to him about. But i have been holding my tongue and not brought it up, because i dont want it to take hours for him to respond. Because i think its stupid and because i donylt want to make him deal with talking about it when he has his own.issues to deal with. What should i do? It makes my heart ache when these moments happen. Please give advice.",12Jul2018,1
323,"Basically I (M18) managed to land a summer job in IT (with the possibility of full-time employment), and though I think it’s fine as a summer job, I otherwise cannot see myself doing it longterm.

* It’s boring

* Antisocial hours due to long bus ride (can pretty much only see my friends on weekends)

* Not much time left for me to exercise after sitting down for ages so I might get unhealthy

* Not much room for promotion - one of my colleagues is in his 30s and does the same job as me (and has done for years)

* Not the area of IT I want to enter

My parents are mad, and say that I need to accept the job because “all other jobs will be like it” and “it’ll be hard to find a new job”.

My plan is to go to the community college to take up a course in the area of IT I’m actually interested in, but my parents don’t want me to do any further education (they think I’m stupid). 

I’m feeling really pressured to keep the job by my family, and am also worried about the future if all jobs are meant to be boring like it.

326,"I really don't know what to do about this situation because, in my opinion, it's messed up and I am inexperienced with such things. The last time I experienced the death of a close family member, I was 16 (I am 35 now).

My younger sister passed away very suddenly from pancreatic cancer just last year in November. She was diagnosed on October 13th and she passed on November 13th. She was 30. She was also pregnant but passed away before the fetus was viable. It has been a terrible thing to deal with and I'm working on healing. I feel like the healing process after a death should be a healthy combination of support from family members and also having time for private reflection. My family is small. My dad is sympathetic, but my sister was not his daughter (my mom remarried when I was 3 and subsequently had my brother and my late sister) so there's not much he can do for me. My brother prefers to grieve privately and will not discuss it in detail with anyone. I worry about that, but he's also an adult and can make his own decisions, so I let him be and we do not talk about it much, if at all.

My mother is the one who has gone completely off the deep end. I understand that to lose a child must be very hard. I don't know what it's like, will never know what it's like, and I know the types of grief we both are experiencing are different. I don't think one is more serious or has more worth than the other, but they are different.

My mother and my siblings' father married when I was 3 and they divorced by the time I was 7. He continued to wander in and out of our family (joint custody outings, etc. There was even a time where I thought they were going to get back together but had a huge fight, blah blah) until we finally moved back to Washington state when I was 11. He stayed behind in California and he stopped contacting us and didn't pay child support, didn't attempt to call his kids or recognize their birthdays or anything else. My siblings essentially grew up without a father. There was a really weird event that happened when I was 16. I cannot remember details as to why this happened, but he actually visited and stayed in our house for a few days when I was 16. But then that's the last time we saw him or heard from him for many years. My sister and brother have never been big fans of their father, my sister especially. My mom has spent YEARS talking shit about him at any opportunity and my thoughts were that she felt the same way we felt about him - we all hated him!

Cut to my sister getting sick. My mom got in touch with him via Facebook or something and then phone numbers were exchanged. By this time, my sister had about two weeks left. My sister was in terrible pain from the time she was admitted to the hospital in October, right up to the day of her passing. As her pain got worse, she was given heavier dosages of painkillers, so when my mother brought up the idea of her father coming to visit, sometimes she was lucid and said, ""No, I do not want to see him."" Sometimes she was high as a kite and said, ""Yeah, I want to see my dad!"" I believe she meant it when she said she didn't want to see him, but my mom and I very gently told her that we don't want her to leave with those feelings in her heart. We wanted her to be at peace in her final moments. Plus, whatever this guy's excuses for not being in his kids' lives, the bottom line was that his only daughter was dying. 

He ended up flying to Washington. His brother paid for his trip, as he supposedly couldn't afford it. I believe he arrived about three days before she passed, so she had very brief moments of consciousness for those last three days. She said, ""Hi, Dad,"" when she saw him, but I don't know if they shared any other words. We let family members go in one by one to have ""alone time"" with her to talk and say whatever was on their minds. I am not sure if her father's discussion with her was heard or understood, but I am glad they got that time together. 

She passed on November 13th.

After my mom took care of the immediate things you have to do after someone's death, she said she wanted to be alone for a while, so I gave her the space she requested. We live like five hours apart, so the next time we saw each other it was around Christmas and she dropped in for my birthday. We hung out at my brother's place for a while before we went out to dinner. She spent a lot of that time texting or doing things on her phone and she sat in a different room to do it and had this weird smile on her face the whole time. Dinner that night was a disaster. She proceeded to have way too much to drink and kept harping on my brother to reconcile with his father and saying things like, ""Wouldn't you just feel terrible if your dad died tomorrow?"" and, ""You should practice forgiveness! It is unnatural to not want to have anything to do with your father!"" I am not in the camp that says a child has to respect and love a parent no matter what. Fuck you! If you want to be respected as a parent, you better be a GOOD parent. My brother was appearing increasingly stressed out at the table and I can tell he was starting to lose his temper, even though he was responding to my mother very evenly and respectfully. I finally said to her, ""You are such a bitch! Leave him alone!"" Yes, that was not the best thing to say to her and I did apologize, but that really set her off. She left the restaurant in a huff (I will never go back to this restaurant because I am so embarrassed) and tried getting in her car to drive us all home. We said we'd call an Uber and get home ourselves or call the police if she insisted on driving. She finally let my brother's wife drive home, but she spent the drive back screaming at all of us and saying very hurtful things. My brother's wife is a cancer survivor and is no longer able to have children as a result, and my mom even brought that up and said some very nasty things in regards to it. It was terrible. Despite our threats to call the police if she drove off anywhere, she left, so my brother called his dad and asked him to call her. My mom was planning on driving home that night, but only her ex-husband could convince her to stay the night at a hotel. 

Not long after that, she announced that she had left her current husband and changed her Facebook relationship status to ""In a Relationship with \[ex-husband's name\]."" What the actual fuck! I don't use Facebook, so this was all shared with me by my brother and/or brother's wife. Since then, they have posted pictures of trips all over the place, including San Francisco, where they were ""celebrating their 33rd wedding anniversary in the city where they spent their honeymoon."" Y'ALL. They were married for 4 years in the fucking 1980s. Apparently he is her ""one true love"" and she ""never stopped loving him."" Aside from that craziness, I know that he is not paying for these trips! They are all coming out of HER pocket! He couldn't even buy a, what, $150 plane ticket to come and see his DYING daughter - his younger brother had to foot the bill! So, it is obvious he's not contributing to these spontaneous trips to various vacation destinations. I can't tell my mom what to do with her money, but she is 58 and I know she doesn't have a lot of disposable income. It makes me sick to think that she is either using credit cards or dipping into her retirement savings for this. As of right now, he is still living in California and she is still in Washington, but who knows what the future is going to look like?

Where my sister all figures in to this is...well, she hasn't had anything like a memorial service, yet. Her high school friends in her hometown (where I still live) held a candlelight vigil for her a few days after her passing, but my mother has said she doesn't have the strength to arrange anything, but when my brother and I offer to step in and take care of things, she changes her mind and tells us that she will arrange everything. She has also stated that she will not have a memorial until ""the family is back together."" I don't know what the hell she means by that but if she thinks I am going to pretend like it's 1987 again, she is sorely mistaken. Being a child and observing that relationship and the memory of how powerless I felt to be stuck in that environment made a huge impression on me. I was a miserable, sad little girl. I am an adult now, I have a choice, and I also don't need that person as a father. He is nothing to me. My brother can make his own decisions, and I will support them, whatever they may be. But it is like my mother is holding our grief hostage so she can get what she wants. I understand she must be going through hell, but why does it have to be like this? 

I am currently in grief counseling, because I haven't experienced anything near closure. Granted, it hasn't even been a year and it's going to hurt for a long time, if not forever. My counselor encourages me to find closure in my own way by planting a tree or writing a letter or some shit, but nothing feels right. I feel terrible that we haven't had an official memorial. Plus, I want some of my sister's ashes, and who knows if I will ever get any. All I have was a box full of stuff that my mom gave me that was basically a random box she pulled from the pile of boxes we packed up from her apartment when we moved her out. There were random knick knacks in there, but nothing that had real sentimental value to me. She let me borrow a picture I requested to make copies of, but I'm not giving back the original now. It's all I have. I have nothing, will probably continue to have nothing. This is a terrible thing to say, but my only hope is that her father dies soon. He's 60 this year, very overweight, diabetic, and in danger of losing one of his legs. The end is probably near for him, so I guess I'll just wait.

329,"First things first, this is not a romantic relationship, if the title leads you to think otherwise. 

But I have come to the conclusion that I am essentially in an abusive relationship, that I have no fucking idea of how to get out of. 

This guy, when in the office, is an absolute, unmitigated arsehole. A fucking nightmare of the highest order. Paranoid, abusive, twitchy, obsessively critical, an all road twat. Trust me, I've done a lot of soul searching, and reflected if this is something to do with me. It isn't. Reason I know this is that every single person who has worked with this person thinks he is a fucking nightmare. No matter who it is, they can't stand being around him. 

Then there is me. I have been in the job for longer than anyone else other than him, and somehow, this weird relationship between me and he has grown. The guy is capable of great kindness, but ONLY out of the office. I've been on the receiving end of that kindness in the past. He has leant me a lot of money when I was in financial difficulties. 

But none of this does away with the nightmare- and I don't use that phrase lightly- of when he is in the office. His extreme paranoia about other managers and different departments means that I cannot even say hello to another manager without an insane interrogation about every aspect of what was discussed. There is never any praise, only round the clock criticism. He destroys my confidence. 

And I recognise fully well that I am trapped, of my own making. I used to accept lifts from him home at the beginning. Now, it has become a regular thing at the end of every day. I can't wait to get away from him, but I accept his lifts because he will go absolutely mad if I don't. When I had a girlfriend once, I told him I was going to see her instead of going back with him. The strop was immense. He does not react to things the same as others do.

And, he is a king at manipulation. I have touched on the issue of leaving before, but he smartly finds ways to dismiss my concerns and offers nothing constructive, making it seem like it is my problem that I feel disheartened by the job, and that I should find ways to improve my attitude to it, when it is actually him. 

There is absolutely no way to win an argument with this man, because if you cross him, the rage and sulking will be immense. 

The small size of the organisation, the lack of any HR, the sycophantic way he approaches those in authority, mean there is no chance of him being toppled. 

I have to fucking get away from this person who has destroyed my self esteem and career prospects. 

Do you have any suggestions, as I have no bloody idea. ",12Jul2018,1
330,"I am STRESSING. I'll try to give all the details I can.

I have two options of where to go this weekend: my girlfriend's house, or my college for a festival everyone comes back for a couple days for to hang out, party, look at art, etc.

They're both about 3 hours from me.

Girlfriend's house has girlfriend and fun things to do in her town which I haven't really gotten to explore yet. BUT she'll be coming to the beach with me for five days literally next week, and then I'll go to her town for a few days a couple weeks after that, then we're back to school where we'll hang out pretty much every day.

Most of my other school friends are going to the festival, so I'll get to see all them and hang out and not feel like I'm missing out. My two best friends will be there, one of whom I haven't seen since she went abroad last semester. She really wants me to be there. BUT while I enjoy a party, I'm not the first one in and last one out if you know what I mean, and I don't drink, and it turns out that my other best friend's house, where I'LL BE STAYING, is where our big club party will be. That does not sound ideal for me as someone who likes to leave parties pretty early and hang out with a smaller group. That friend also implied he will be getting absolutely trashed Saturday, so I think I'd have to take care of him and as a non-drinker, I'm not equipped to do that and never know what to do or how to help, and I realllyyyyy don't enjoy being in that position. I'll also be living in the same house as him next year so I'll get to see him plenty. It's really my other best friend that I'm worried I won't get to spend as much time with this year. Also I'll either have to pay ridiculous prices for parking or Uber 15 minutes to and from my car at like a Walmart or something. Also I don't know if anyone will want to actually walk around and look at art with me on Saturday, which is my favorite part. But I know I'd be stressed about seeing everyone have fun without me if I didn't go. I get nasty FOMO.

In both situations, I'll leave tomorrow around mid-day, if that was going to affect anyone's answer.

340,"Hello all, let me start by saying I am 17 years old and work at a place called Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I have worked there since April and have been very good at my job since then. I always get my work done there, get orders out quickly, and rarely make a mistake. For the first moth or so there I was getting at least 4-5 four hour shifts every week, and it was great. This changed 3 weeks ago. Employees receive an email each Friday night with details of their schedule for the next week, and the first week with no hours my email said “Sorry, I have no extra hours for you this week.” from my boss. I was a little upset about it but figured no big deal, what’s one week without working? Silly me thought I would get hours the next week, but come Friday, I don’t even get an email. I figure something is wrong at this point so I decided Sunday morning to go to my job and talk to my boss. The conversation went like this, 

Me : “Hey (boss name) I didn’t receive an email Friday night so I just wanted to come and ask what was going on and make sure I haven’t upset you in some way or something like that.”

Boss : “It’s not that, I just can’t afford to give you the hours right now with holidays coming (this was a few day’s prior to 4th of july) and with football season coming soon I just can’t afford it because we start to slow down.”

Me : “Okay, I understand. Do you think next week possibly you could get me in?”

Boss : “I doubt it.”

Conversation ends and I leave, pretty bummed. It’s been 3 or 4 weeks now since Ive been scheduled at work, I’m losing track of time, and I’m very confused on what I should do. Should I go talk to my boss again? If so, what do I say?",12Jul2018,1

343,"Some months ago, my girlfriend's former co-worker moved back into town after a short marriage that failed.

She seems quite nice, and the split seems to have caused this person very severe emotional trauma; alcohol problems, frequent and uncontrollable crying, oversharing of thoughts and feelings... All very run-of-the mill, and to be expected.

What I never expected, and which is also quite alarming, is her rising level of affection for my girlfriend, which is quickly transforming into obsession and unhealthy, codependent latching.

I've noticed several brow-raising gestures and moves. Some of them alone would not be cause for concern; as a whole they are absolutely concerning, especially when combined with the more grand ones.

- Frequently ferrying my girlfriend to-and-from work.

- Frequently buying her meals

- When I left town for 2 weeks on business, she'd apparently visited her almost *every* single day, and spent the night at least half of the time.

- Spending the night alone in our apartment when my girlfriend came to visit me on my business trip.

- When my girlfriend and I returned together, this woman had cleaned our disaster of an apartment top-to-bottom, reorganized everything, and gone to multiple stores - not only to  resupply our toiletries and cosmetics to the extent that we have excessive surplus - not only to fill our refrigerator with mountains of food (which was already a habit) - but also to get us some extra furniture... And also... A 55-inch 4K HDTV... (We're supposed to pay back... ""$5 here, $15 there, whatever..."")

So I played very nice and cordial that night when she was there... Waiting for us to return home from being out of town... Although I was honestly terrified at the situation. I'd joked with my girlfriend about how it looked like she was trying to turn her gay in a light-mannered way a few times before. But now I had the strongest feeling that none of this was a laughing matter.

At the same time, I'd just been away from home for two weeks, so I put our problems away on the shelf for a moment. I figured I'd try to keep the peace and an open mind; after all, I've always been such a skeptic, and perhaps it was clouding my ability to believe that a mere friend could show so much compassion... But I also promised myself that if things got any more strange than this, then I would start by bringing the matter up with my girlfriend.

48 hours later, the woman comes to our apartment to ""hang out until her other friend gets off work."" Said friend got off and came to our apartment... 

THEN SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT MOVING INTO OUR APARTMENT COMPLEX.

I smiled and nodded and played along to avoid the most awkward potential conflict in the world.

And then... This new person took my girlfriend to go do laundry, leaving me stuck alone in my home with the person that seems to be obsessed with the person I'm dating... She was drunk as hell. I'd not been asked if I felt like hosting any company like this.

Without provocation, the drunk, obsessive woman almost immediately began trying to convince me that there was no obsession at all. I don't know how many times I heard the word ""niece,"" as if she believed that if she repeated it enough, the reality of what I'd been witnessing as of late would dissipate into thin air. She seemed to be crying on and off a bit as well.

After some incoherent, slurred rambling about how her ex grew up in a similar manner as my girlfriend (which is somehow the reason why she wants to spoil her? Incoherent rambling.) I honestly started moving the conversation towards an end because it was way too creepy and I couldn't understand half of what she was saying.

I let her pass out on the couch until my girlfriend returned home.

Immediately after the woman left, I brought up the concerns with my girlfriend that I believed, now more than ever, that this person seemed to have an obsession with her and that we needed to come up with a way to solve this problem.

My girlfriend is a genuinely caring individual who accepts just about everyone in the world for who they are. Her definition of someone who is an acceptable addition to her life is far different, and open, than mine is. I would call it having standards and the wisdom with age to know toxic behavior before it becomes an issue for everybody involved. But I do understand: she needs more friends in this town.

Much to my disappointment, she seemed to understand my position, yet contradict it from every angle imaginable; instead of this woman having an unhealthy obsession, my girlfriend claimed it was a coping mechanism for the loss she experienced after her divorce - but how is latching onto somebody supposed to heal old wounds? It doesn't; it creates a codependency situation in which a person's happiness hinges upon the happiness of another person - so in order to keep this person happy, you just keep giving and giving until you've spent all your money, moving closer and closer until you're talking about moving into the same complex and otherwise making this person's boyfriend (me) feel uncomfortable and threatened... All of a sudden you have lost your individuality to an obsession with another person, the trauma of experiences past remains and you have no idea to be happy on your own. I've no idea of the further consequences because we are in the middle of this right now.

In so many words, I explained all of this to my girlfriend yet still she resisted; claimed that I was just judging a person from the smallest amount of experience with them, that I've had my own problems so why not, that she ran out of meds, that it's just the drinking, that I just don't have nice friends or anybody that is truly all too caring of me (ouch). And also that this woman does the same kind of stuff for another friend - a concept that helped me coin the term serial obsessor. Just now came up with that one... But I have a hard time believing that she bought an HDTV for *2* of her friends.

Today I brought up leaving town to clear my head of this situation and my poor girlfriend who is trapped in the middle of this ridiculous situation has been crying all day. She's not in a good place.

So.... Quite a story.

I am on contract and can't just leave my current position, so I will have to continue coming into work and sitting at my desk until the end of August.

I just don’t want the same thing. He won’t accept the break up. Crazy right? That means he’s still pretending like we’re together. I’m seriously worried. His past dating history doesn’t look so good, he recently told me that his ex cheated on him so he posted her nudes on Facebook and sent the nude pictures to her family members via Facebook. I was absolutely disgusted that’s when I started losing feelings for him. I’m scared if he will do the same thing to me just because I don’t want to be with him anymore. Guys please help me.

346,"So here's my current situation. My father has been physically, verbally, sexually (towards my mother and sisters), and financially abusive for the length of my life. The last time he was physically abusive was 2014 but there are countless instances prior. When my sisters lived with us (when I was only a few years old) he's made advances towards and even touched them inappropriately. They are my mothers daughters and are much older now and living on their own though. Over my mother and my two brothers have endured everything from being severely cursed at in public, to being chased after with a hot iron, to being demeaned and compared to his last family (he cheated on his now ex-wife with my unknowing mother and later left her with three children and started a family with my mother). Constantly, he leaves us without unless we ask or beg for something. Recently, he sold our home located out of state for a $40000, with the home being valued at nearly $200,000. All in an effort to ensure that we're left with nothing if/when he leaves us. To further complicate things, my mother is an illegal immigrant and he constantly holds this over her head as she is unable to work, drive, etc; The bad part is he knew this when he met her, and now constantly holds it against her. He has stopped us all from obtaining any source of income by cutting off or inconveniencing us when it comes to transportation or in any way he can. My older brother is currently the only one working besides my father. My father currently operates ""his own"" business which he forced me to make for him when I was just 15. Anything from filing business or insurance documents to taxes I have handled until now. He's taken countless ""loans"" from friends and family and even myself and my brother which he does not ever intend to pay back, he's owes me $2000+, my brother $5000+, and his niece $7000. He hasn't paid a penny back to any of us and he's currently slowly spending what's left from his short sale of our home. We're all ready to leave but don't have the means to, I've been through several jobs and I'm currently looking for something at the moment to help out, but it's unlikely we'll be able to afford a place to live with me making minimum wage and my brother only being able to put in so much every month. What should I do? (I will probably be editing this for clarity later)",12Jul2018,3
347," Hey everyone,

(not a native speaker, I'll do my best and am sorry in advance!!!)

I try to keep it short, but there are many small things that I think I have to account to give you a useful picture. So, let's go!

I am doing my job now for roughly 3 years and 1,5 years before (learning), so 4,5 years in summary. Last year, I became head of a 4 man team including me. And 2 of them are leeching opportunists, i.e. work as less as possible and when there's a problem it's either ignored or put on the person in charge.

A major problem for the last years was our boss. He kinda terrorized the place for like 20+ years. Thus, many people were afraid of him and that kinda went viral. That means I was afraid of him, too, and thus I tried to avoid him whenever I could.

Now this was the last year that I had to do well to get a **permanent and currently on-going employment**. The years before, I had to do mostly the same job but it was less complex and I didn't have a team, I mostly worked on my own. Had to see my boss once in a while, but in general it went well! This last year did not go well. It was stressful, had to go through a breakup (hit me hard), but I kept going. At work, I had to tell my team basic stuff so they actually worked. I do not say that they never worked, but they should have done all of that (and more) without me telling them to do so.

During this year, one of the 2 guys already got in trouble with another of our teams (there are multiple) as he kinda fucked their things up because he simply did not care and tried to do his own thing. My boss also had an eye on him and made clear that he does not have a high opinion of him. That's the first one...

The other guy is a big talker while only doing what must be done. He is also rude to our clients and sees himself as a king. Others already told him that he doesn't work - which funnily offended him. When I asked him, he usually did what I told him to. But still he is the laid back, self-satisfied dude who leaves work as soon as he can. I try to do the same to be honest, but at least I usually stick to the rules and ask my boss, if I can leave earlier etc.

\--&gt; NOW: So my boss will retire soon and I really went through a lot of shit over the last weeks. My boss regularly called me in and talked to me. After the first talk, I was crushed and it really got under my skin. I needed a few days, but I got back on my feet and face him again, stayed calm, stayed respectful, was honest and discussed things with him. Funnily, I experienced a completely different manner of his. They way we talked changed and I felt like he started to respect me and see that I might have done many mistakes, but that I carried a big burden as a youngster and at least I really tried. During our conversations, I never mentioned that my coworkers didn't do their jobs properly and that many of my mistakes wouldn't have happened, if they had done better. Don't get me wrong; I kinda was in charge, but I am young and my authority was kinda ignored, I didn't ask for this position, my bosses (the ones below my actual boss) just had to put someone there.

The irony is now that my boss gave me a permanent employment saying we will still talk about some stuff that didn't work out well. And the others don't know. Now by accident I found out that they seem kinda worried about the fact that I have to talk to the boss again... and I guess they are kinda afraid. I got them at their balls. And I don't know what to do. Surely, I could use this to my advantage and get back at them and on the other hand, I don't wanna be a bitch. BUT someone told me this, which got me thinking that I cannot let them get away and that is roughly explained:

""Yes, it was partly your fault because you weren't 'boss' enough to kick em in the butt. But on the other hand, nobody likes work leeches in a team.""

And that is why I ask you, some absolutely not involved randoms on the internet; what would you do? I appreciate serious advice. Thank you.",12Jul2018,2

353,"I'm part of a fairly large friendship group where everyone is really nice and friendly - apart from one girl. It's worsened over the last year or so, but she has always been rude, antagonistic and sometimes downright mean. She's thin-skinned as well, so whenever people try to talk to her about this she reacts aggressively.

It's been grating on me for a long time now and I'm starting to react badly to it - the arguments are getting worse and are starting to risk fragmenting the group. I've asked others in the group about their feelings and the general consensus is that they find her to be maddening as well but don't want to speak up for the sake of keeping the group together (which is why I, usually, am the only one to speak against her). 

We don't see her in person very much as she lives far away and refuses to travel. When I do see her we tend to be on good/civil terms (don't speak very much, possibly due to size of group more than anything). This is a problem more in online group chats.

I'm not sure what to do as the longer things stay as they are the more likely it is to be an explosive argument that divides everybody. She's previously driven somebody out of the group (who didn't contribute much and was unreliable - but this did not deserve exclusion) and I am concerned she might try to do the same to me.

On the flip side she is great at organising things (in her area), introducing new people to the group and being active in the group chats.

Appreciate any thoughts or advice :) Thanks",12Jul2018,2
354,"Ok so, here goes.

I have this friend that I met during my undergrad studies in university my sophomore year. When we lived in the same city for college, we had so much fun. We would hang out every weekend and we had classes together. One thing I did note about her and it's important to my question is the fact that she is an extreme pushover. I mean it. She's a literal doormat to the point where you may wonder if there's a mental issue involved. I do know she has self-esteem/confidence problems and I suspect that she may have anxiety as I am aware of my own. Anyway, she does things like puts others needs before her own which may sound good but it's not all the time. Because of this, sometimes she wouldn't want to go anywhere because she thinks her parents wouldn't give her money (they would), or she wouldnt do things because she doesnt want to drive on the freeway or she doesnt want to drive far. Things like this were the main reason she didnt get a job until graduation and even with a degree she settled to work at a grocery store due to fear. Sometimes she doesnt go places because she worries about what people will think of her clothes and hair. Sometimes she avoids texting me because her friend from her hometown (who treats her bad and is very self centered in my opinion) is online and will try to talk to my friend and my friend doesnt have to courage to tell her ""hey i don't want to talk to you right now"" or ""hey can we talk about something else instead of you and your problems all the time."" The biggest thing is that my friend complains all the time but never wants advice or solutions to solve her problems. She wants to complain just to complain and when i help her she completely ignores me.

The reason I'm giving so much background info is because now im in grad school in a different city and she stayed in the town we went to undergrad and got an apartment. I don't have a car but sometimes I'll travel up to two hours on the public bus to come see her only for her to not care what we do, want to stay in, and send me home an hour after i get there because i can't spend the night. However, when I ask her to come visit me she doesnt want to put in an effort. I understand not everyone wants to drive but i feel like if i can make the effort to take a bus or taxi/cab why can't you? And she definitely can afford it because even though she has a good job he parents pay her bills for her.

At one point, her mom wouldn't let her do anything which was a huge barrier but i understood it. Now, her mom told her that she can do what she wants and she still doesn't put effort into our friendship. I constantly offer to come visit (because she's always bored or lonely and tells me she cries because of it) but then i'm met with indifference. I invite her to trips, events, and concerts, but she rather not take off work or she's too scared to ask her job to schedule off days even when its weeks or months before the event. She never calls me, I always call her. If I try to ask her to support me in my endeavors she won't. I write stories and she said making an account online to go read them is too much work. I make and sell t shirts for $20 which she expects to get for free but will go spend hundreds of dollars on online stores. I was even going to buy her things for her birthday but she never does anything for mine.

I decided to stop reaching out to her to see what would happen and it's been almost 3 weeks and she hasn't reached out, which is saying a lot because we talked everyday almost. My question is do you think i should stop putting effort into this friendship?",12Jul2018,1
355,"We met online, we went on a couple of dates. I like him a lot, we shared and flirted with each other a lot. Suddenly, the calls stopped and he has left me on read many times but when I start a new conversation he starts talking to me like everything was normal.He knows I like him and I might be falling for him, he told me that he might be feeling the same. But I'm not stupid I have realized, he's not into me anymore. 

I don't know why, or if I did something wrong, for a while I really wanted to try something with him but now I'm just sad. I know he doesn't look at me like a future girlfriend. 

I need help, I don't know how to stop thinking about him, I deleted his number and promise myself to move on and don't talk to him, but two days later I started looking for his number again, I really miss him (how stupid am I). Every time I have something exciting or bad happening in my life I wanted to tell him. But he's busy, tired and always hangs up first, I understand that but we used to talk all day, it's just not the same. 

I have pictures of us on our dates, and selfies he used to sent me. A couple of videos of him teaching me how to cook and every time I watched them I cry. I really was looking forward to a relationship with him. I can't concentrate, he's always in my mind. I don't know what to do

He used to be marry, he's not anymore. I'm really sure about that, in case someone thinks that is because he has a wife and got bored of his online flirt. 

TL;DR: I fell in love with him, he was feeling the same for me, suddenly his attitude changed and now I'm tired of begging for his attention. But I also can't stop thinking of him.

365,"So, background info, my place of work is really bad for avoiding firing people, and unfortunately when management realized they were a problem they were past their probation period. I honesty would probably get in trouble for posting this but I'm at a loss of what to do. I apologize for how long this is. I'm going to try my best to keep things more private for mine and my coworkers sake. 


This person is what I'd consider a pathological liar, they make up stories (including negative untrue interactions with coworkers and customers), that are blatantly false. They also lie about their own life; every lie is very very unbelievable, and I don't see why they continue to tell such outrageous stories. 

The lying also does affect work as when they make a mistake they will vehemently defend themselves and lie about it being something done by someone else, even if multiple people witness the mistake. Not to mention, a lot of those mistakes aren't really mistakes. They'll do wrong things entirely aware it's wrong just to save time? It's often very important things they'll do with this, too, and they deny it every time. 

They'll also come up with stories of coworkers doing/saying things that would get them in trouble, and make problematic coworker look like a good employee for pointing it out and telling management. If someone so much as kindly calls out something problematic coworker is doing, they'll twist it into a negative interaction and accuse the person of being rude and unfair to them. 

Naturally, management is well aware of these accusations being false, and they've actually been the target of these lies! It's actually very hurtful to people around them, some of the stuff this coworker tries saying. 

Customers have also had a huge problem with problematic coworker, as they'll treat customers as if they're entirely stupid and they'll purposely mess up they'd orders as they ""know what's better and what the customer would prefer"", which goes against *all* standards. 

Coworker has also made numerous racially charged comments, as well as touching people in ways they don't wanna be touched. Once the touching is brought up they will defend themselves and talk about how stupid it was that person complained. 

One big thing is the talking being peoples back, lying about things they've done, and acting as if the person is their best friend despite this in person. 

This person is very **very** full of themselves too. They'll call other people down, act as if everyone is around them is stupid, they seem to think they know everything, and they also will straight up correct people new or experienced (including interrupting training) to correct people, usually on things that aren't incorrect. They've also spread a lot of rumours about situations at work that shouldn't be talked about outside of work, if that makes sense. 


My management team is aware of the situation, and has talked to this person multiple times with zero change. For maybe a day they'll improve and then it's back to their old ways. I feel like people giving up on putting in complaints due to this. I'm considering reporting it straight to a higher up person but I'm honestly nervous to. All in all, what should I do? I'm tired of being anxious at work and seeing my coworkers upset and anxious as well, especially already nervous new people. I'm just, at a loss. 


TL;DR : coworker constantly creates lies, denies their lies and problems, talks down to customers and coworkers alike, and can be overall *very* toxic. I'm nervous on shifts I work with them as with other people. Management talking with them hasn't improved the issue. ",12Jul2018,1
366,"Throwaway for very obvious reasons. Xposted to a wedding planning sub.

There are 6 people I'd like to invite to my wedding. They've known me for a very long time, and we have a close relationship. They want to celebrate my wedding, and I'd like to have them there. However, no one can know how I know them because I am a sex worker and I am not out to either of our families.

Only these 6 people would be unknown to our families. Additionally, they don't look like the kind of people I would know or be friends with, so it might be extra conspicuous.

Any advice for how I should field questions about who they are? Right now, people just think I make and sell art. I know it's none of anyone's business, but I don't want to be rude when people politely ask how I know so-and-so. Am I over-thinking something no one will care about?

These kids are never outside, in the front of the house or their backyard. All the curtains and blinds to the house are always kept shut and have been that way since they moved in. The two adults in the house seem to go out of their way to avoid talking to neighbours by staying in their car until another neighbour leaves. I have only seen one of the kids once since they have moved in, they seem to be rushed into the house quickly. They are often not taken to school on time and will leave the house around 10 or 11 in the morning. There are just some odd behaviours like they kept their Christmas tree up until April.

369,"maybe i just need to vent this one out over text and wont even post this and i dont wanna make it super long. 23 yr old Male, feeling like the girl ive been seeing the last year or so has attached so hard to me that it's moving too fast. i should just man up and tell her we should slow things down, but i dont want to change her perspective of me because she's a great girl, almost too great. always do more than she needs to, to the point where it's borderline frustrating and i tell her that.

anyways, i've been cheating on this girl like pretty much every girl that i have had since 15 or 16 whenever we start dating now adays. It's a tough thing to type out and admit to the internet, nothing to be proud of but I grew up surrounded by the hip hop culture and so that sort of conditioned me to look at women in a certain way, not to mention sexual abuse (molestation) from a family member as a child multiple times, mixed in with an abusive step dad and bi polar mother. Life was really tough growing up, I made it through sober and focused but once I turned 18 and finished High School I started smoking weed and my subconscious trauma really started opening up, some would say the demons came out. I love smoking weed, but I do think it's become an inhibitor to my clear, sober mind. I dont think with everything I've been through it's good for me. I get really lustful and ""horny"" when I come down off weed, which I've heard is normal, but I've went as far as to have sex with a transvestite because of how low of a point I was at with smoking and being lonely from my ex that had a baby with another guy, or is about to. by no means does that excuse my actions, I went through a lot of shame and depression for doing that. But through my use of LSD, I was able to sort of rid myself of that guilt and really apologize to myself and my soul for what I had done, I've also let a 2nd Transvestite give me head which is also not cool because I basically relapsed to what made me feel so guilty initially. I am by no means homosexual and have no physical or sexual attraction towards males but again I feel like with the social conditioning of the media and society, I have become a byproduct and exactly what they want to morph me into. Through having to go through molestation as a child, I always knew I was never gay and eventually realized what happened to me wasnt right. I've told my mom and my cousin, because it's her brother... and I didn't want her kids to see him so I was proud of my ability to step in and let it be known that dude's a monster.

I would consider myself to be very intellectual and keen to my surroundings, in other words; I feel like I'm 36 living in a 23 year olds body watching him waste his happiness and precious time away through Lust for smoking weed every day, wanting to fuck more and more women. I honestly feel like theres a sort of demon attached to my spirit, my mom was raped multiple times when young and as an adult and went through tons of trauma so that right there should remind me to be a better human. But i'm just hoping somebody reads this because life has become sort of this vicious cycle of being trapped in lust and i try to stay conscious and get out of it but it always reels me back in, I've wasted so much money on tinder, not a TON but a few hundred dollars. Something that could have been more properly allocated ya know. I've burned so many bridges with people who love me and people who could have potentially loved me. Honestly I want to talk to a therapist but I dont want to bring up those sexual decisions it's a shame to think about and I have to take a deep breath just typing about it. I know God is forgiving, and I have forgave myself but at the same time it feels like I am sort of wrapped in this spell of lust and I want to break free.

Surprisingly, over the past few weeks I have sustained from watching any porn (big contribution to my desensitization initially) porn... ha lets talk about that for a second. I have watched porn for over a decade. I know some people watch it religiously but I would only do it to bust a nut.. ha ha thats what every guy says!! The thing is, where they get you is you get ADDICTED and u start busting multiple nuts multiple times per day, ive done a fair amount of research on kundalini energy and transmuting sexual energy into a creative one but again I just feel like staying away from porn is a good idea all around.

Also, I have fell into the trap of creating new tinder accounts and then deleting them, thats twice in the last few days after staying off it for a few weeks.

TLDR: my brain's original hardwiring has been rewired through the social conditioning of lust in the media and my ability and authority to access it. Thus, causing my inner morals and integrity to be questioned. Leading me to believe I need to let go of my weed addiction in order to suppress the valve of subconscious trauma from re entering my mind and causing a relapse of lustful desire. I used to be a person with loads of joy to give all kinds of people and now I sort of find myself all alone because i lash out at everyone who loves me. I'm even considering microdosing shrooms to promote nuerogenesis in my brain to reset my response to fear and sort of heal some of that trauma in a sense. for those who dont know much of what i am saying i would suggest reseraching paul stamets.

i really hope you guys can give me some good reccomendations on how to go about ridding myself of this energy and getting back who i truly am. honestly feel like i already can just after typing this, it's amazing what your thoughts can do for you when you type or write them out, very good feeling.

so long guys i hope i am not judged too hard for what i did, i know im not the only one who's experimented like that sexually but i just know it's not who i truly am and that after my ex left me and had a baby with another dude, i think it just really did something to my confidence. sad part is, im an attractive dude too so if i went to a bar it would be nothing to pick up a decent chick, but i sit in my room and swipe on tinder. shits sad, i want to get back to the real me.

370,"I have been dating my boyfriend on and off since I was about 14 years old, while he was 23 (I'm 16 1/2, he's 26 now). We are 9 years apart.

My family and friends are convinced that he is a sick man and that I’m brainwashed and that he will always be a predator. But I have never thought that about him. I felt it just so happens we fell in love and forgot about age.

Is he a pedophile or could he have been extremely immature or could it be that at the age of 14 I looked about 20 or maybe both or does he just love me. Or is a he a pedofile for pursuing a 14 year old boy no matter how old I look?

378,"Sorry for the massive post, there's a tl;dr at the bottom

Here's the situation.

I'm a 23 year old guy, been living at this house for almost a year. My neighbors are a middle aged woman and her younger, around high school or college aged, daughter. 

An important detail about me: I come across as a creepy person. I'm not a creep, mind you, it's just how I look and my mannerisms I guess. I've been this way since middle school, and my peers have not hesitated to let me know. I also have pretty bad social anxiety, which is either what causes my creepy behavior, or a direct result of it.

I'm pretty sure this all started last winter. It got below freezing temperatures in my area, and due to my furnace's condensate drainage pipe not being installed to code, it began freezing up, shutting the heat off in my home in the middle of the night. This drainage pipe drains out to the space between our homes, about 20 feet away from their kitchen window.

So what I would do is check the weather during before bed, and if it was/would get below freezing, I'd go out to the drainage pipe, thaw and remove any ice in it, and set up a heat lamp for the night to keep it from freezing. In hindsight, a normal person would have knocked on their door to tell them what they were doing so they wouldn't be too sketched out, but I convinced myself that if I did that, they wouldn't believe me and would think I was using that as an excuse to peek into their window at night.

So instead, I just did my best to be quick and quiet, hoping they wouldn't notice me. Because *actually* sneaking around outside their window is much better than letting them know what's going on, obviously.

After this, their behavior towards me changed. They stopped waving back/at me, if her daughter was playing outside when I got home from work, she'd rush inside and close their garage door, stuff like that. And with the waving, it's not like they don't see me, they definitely keep their eye on me when I'm outside, they just don't wave.

I was able to rationalize all of this until today. It's not like they'd actually be that scared of someone as young as me, right? Maybe they just got tired of waving, and I'm just imagining the stares. They probably knew what I was doing outside because they would be able to clearly see the condensate drainage pipe with a heat lamp pointed at it, and ice hanging off it. And when I was out there, I'd try and keep my back to the window, so it's not like I was ever looking at them through it.

So what changed? Well, this morning they had a fence built. When I saw it, I was initially happy for them. That meant they could let their dog roam around outside (without it pooping in my yard), have some privacy and give me some peace of mind about being my neighbor, etc.. 

However, within about two hours of construction starting, I heard the fencers pack up and leave. I thought that was weird, because we have big yards and there was no way they got it finished that quickly. So I stepped outside to see that they were finished building all 20 feet of the privacy fence that sits directly between our houses, right in front of their kitchen window.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not upset about the fence, and I don't blame them for wanting it, it just served as a huge wake up call telling me that my rationalizations are *wrong* and they *probably do* think I'm creepy. And *even if* I'm still wrong, there is *still* something that made them want to spend money for the sole purpose of being sure that they're not able to see me or my home from their kitchen. 

Now, if I didn't literally live right next to them, I wouldn't care what they thought of me. I just don't want to be a bad neighbor that makes them feel the need to be on guard all the time. I know I wouldn't want to live next to someone that made me feel the way I must make them feel.

So, my question is, how do I go about showing them how creepy I'm not without making myself seem even more creepy?

**tl;dr** - I'm a socially awkwardy creepy guy that scares my neighbors, but I want to prove I'm not that bad",12Jul2018,1

387,"Okay, so my wife and I have been talking about this, and decided we needed some outside opinions. She has pretty severe anxiety and depression, and has been struggling with what she wants to do. We need to make a decision tonight, and let them know by the morning...this will be a bit long, just to try to provide some context. 

Here's the situation:

My wife has a Masters in Library Science, but where we lived in Arizona there were no reasonable job prospects. I work in EMS. We moved to Southern California (not near the coast) for a job offer for her a couple years ago. The job ended up being not what it was advertised and being really unpleasant, to the point where she got hurt and was on workman's comp for 6 months (because on top of sucking as a job, they sucked at dealing with workman's comp!). She was making 47k in an area where that's an okay-but-low rate of pay. I make slightly more (50k), but also work more hours. 

To make ends meet, we bought and have been renovating a trailer that we've been living in, keeping our rent under $1000 a month not including utilities (which are insane because it's hot as hell out here), and we've enjoyed that process.

She got a job offer nearer the coast that was going to pay her 52k, and was ostensibly more in her field. It's not for a library, but it's supposedly going to be closer to what she went to school for. She jumped at the chance, and accepted the offer, and put in her two weeks. 

...aaaaaaand then found out that there was no way that salary would work closer to the coast. The area the job is in, housing's over 2k for like a studio.

Taking the trailer, which is how we made living where we are now work, isn't feasible because out by the coast, apparently there are no long-term RV/trailer parks I guess because of zoning laws, and it's expensive anyway. Realizing that she couldn't make it out there on her own, and that I wouldn't necessarily be able to get an EMS job in a timely fashion, she had to tell them she couldn't take the job. 

They actually talked to her about it, and today offered 65k, but she has to decide by tomorrow. Still below median income for the area, but at least now it's over the Section 8 threshold. She had come to terms with the decision not to take the job, but the counter-offer is sending her into a bit of a tailspin. 

To make this move happen, we'd have to put the trailer in storage, which would be another expense, or possibly sell it (But we're only about half-done renovating it). 

Our options are:

\--She takes the job, and moves out there on at least a trial basis, until she's sure it'll work. It will eat up our savings and she'll be alone for awhile, which is difficult with her anxiety and depression. If the job works out, I follow when I can and try to find a job. 

\--She doesn't take the job, and stays here. I've already got a job here and am working on trying to advance (I had to kind of start over when we moved). She would be looking for, well, crap jobs that probably barely pay minimum wage, because there's not much out here that use her skills. At least some of our savings get eaten into. We hate living in this area because it's so hot, but we could move slightly outside of it without me having to find a different job. But her job prospects would be dim. 

\--We decide to move somewhere else (this could be another state, or back to Arizona, where we still have a house that we've been renting to friends for basically the cost of the mortgage... her job prospects were crap but the cost of living is MUCH MUCH lower).  ",12Jul2018,1
389," Hello everyone, I'm in the direst need for help right now, and I was hoping I could find some here.

I've just had a deal gone wrong, after being persuaded by a friend to buy an 'iphone 7'.

I'm currently in Russia, and I don't really speak any Russian, so I let her lead the deal interaction, and wasn't basically present, and I didn't actually get to see the phone until the scammer was long gone. What I thought was an iPhone 7 that I was buying, turned out to be a completely scribbled over iPhone 6S, which I can't even determine if it's a real or a fake right now. The reason as to why, is because the scammer didn't actually erase his Apple ID from the phone, so I can't even access the phone right now.

The deal was done in cash, and before I took out all of it, my card was denied further cash lifts. Is there any way I can report this as a theft to my bank? It was a lot of money and I need it, especially right now that I am abroad.

The deal was organised on [avito.ru](https://avito.ru/), if this information helps. His ad has, of course, been deleted.

I am praying that someone can help me with something like:

\- Unlock this supposed iPhone 6S, I don't know if someone at an Apple Store could maybe help me

\- Help me with ways to minimise the financial blow

\- Someway I can contact my bank to get some of this money back

\- Anything at all, I have genuinely tried everything I could think of, and I have come here in an extremely desperate bid for help

390,"So my mom, stepdad, and I went out of town for the weekend and stayed at a hotel. On the very last day before we were going back home, it was late. Around 11 or 12 and my stepdad was drunk, not that bad. So my mom was already asleep and I had just got out of the shower so I was on my phone but I was about to go to sleep.

So my stepdad goes to the bathroom and comes back and gets in the wrong bed. With me, I mean I guess I kind of look like a short, skinny, younger version my mom but damn... before I could react, he was already pulling off my booty shorts and I'm finally like, trying to talk to him but he's calling me my mom and sucks on my breast... and when I try to push him off again... he slides inside me... Now for 1, I was a virgin. This did hurt... A lot... but he was so huge... it was like more and more just started going in and out and I was like too in shock to say anything. All I can do is muster out gasps or moan... as if I was out of breath. And at first he started slow because I was probably way too tight, but the more and more he went in the better it felt...

Probably around 10 minutes later it started feeling so good... he turned me on my back and pulled me by my hair doggy-style and was going in and out making me queef like crazy and just feeling his huge dick made me feel crazy. I was in heaven... I tried to turn around and ride him, but he laid me back down and destroyed my pussy in missionary... just my legs in the air twitching was enough to knock the covers off the bed.... He then let me try sucking his dick and he tried eating me out... well he didn't try... I was so in love with this man when he was eating me... I swear, I have never felt this good before... I rode him and we fucked some more... all this good sex for probably an 30-50 minutes... And he even came twice in my pussy and in my mouth.

---------------------

But now. Today, only a week later... he hasn't paid much attention to me at all. Not even acknowledging we had sex... I try to seduce him into fucking me again but he never goes for it. Just yesterday my mom was at work and it was just us at the house, so I came out of the shower naked and into the kitchen where he was eating and he says, what the fuck are you doing?

Like why is he acting like this? I know the sex wasn't bad... and even if it was, It was my first fucking time... he should have been fucked me again! Two days before that, I stopped locking the doors, so he walked in the bathroom when I was in the tub... so I pulled the curtains back when he goes to wash his hands and asks him to go get my clothes... he doesn't... what the hell is wrong with him!?

I'm seriously thinking of just plowing him as soon as we are alone because I am out of ideas... Please give me advice on this. Does anyone know why he would be acting like this? Is there something wrong with me or him? What should I do? Any tips on seducing him or helping me get him to fuck me again? Please and thank you.

&gt; The only thing I can think of is that I am very socially awkward... throughout school I was always to shy to really have a long term boyfriend and too scared to have sex because I felt it would be embarrassing or weird. I can barely talk to guys now even if they come up to me... like I can only say maybe basic boring things like how are you or hello... I mean... even if a guy is happily touching me, my hair, cheek. I'm too scared to touch him back, like I don't know if they want me too or should I just stand like a manikin...

&gt; But now my eyes are opened and I found a guy I'm in love with, I can't stop masturbating at night for him... I can't stop thinking about him... just the thought of this working is already making me wet because I want it so so so very bad.

392,"Hey r/advice! Perhaps more of a mundane situation than what's typically seen on this subreddit, but nonetheless any words of wisdom would be so appreciated. :-)

I'm a soon-to-be college senior. I had never had any interest in Greek life all throughout my first two years of college, despite in my second year moving in with a bunch of sorority sisters (they had a spare spot in the house that they needed filling up and were willing to take on a non-sister). I guess as a result of living there for a year and getting along with them, and also being encouraged by them to join, I decided to join the sorority my junior year (the academic year that just ended). The issue now is that I would like to leave and not have to be a member my senior year... although I've already signed the lease and to live with them for another year, so moving out isn't an option at this point due to my landlord's strict rules. Plus, I do like the house and its location, and don't particularly want to move for my last year.

I gave being in the sorority my best shot this past year, despite knowing deep down from the get-go that it wasn't really for me. I just wanted to push myself to not be so stubborn and to try things out despite my initial judgments. Ultimately though, it just wasn't for me, and this past semester it became more of a chore than anything else. I truly do think that it's better for everyone if I leave -- why would they want me to stick around if I don't want to be there, right? 

I considered staying, perhaps for the alumni network, but the thought of sticking it out for another year just brings my spirit right down. I'm also remembering the number of weekends and evenings I've had to sacrifice for the hours-long ritual events, missing out on other events that I really wanted to attend that would have benefitted my career. I've recently come to realize that I have a bit of a history of being a people-pleaser, so at some point I *have* to stand up for myself and start living my life authentically, as awkward as these situations can be.

Does anyone have any tips, things to say, etc. to break the news to my housemates (one of whom is the president of the sorority) that I'll be leaving? I know they'll feel some inevitable awkwardness, maybe anger, initially whenever they see me around the house (what with the sorority's rules about basically *shunning* someone who leaves, as they've done in the past with a couple girls who left). I want to make it clear to them that I still care about them and feel fondly about all the sorority sisters, there's just a number of factors (my schedule, getting a part-time job this fall and starting a research position, my own sanity, etc.) that have led me to realize -- after a long and hard period of deliberation -- that leaving is best for me, and best for the integrity of the sorority. I'd hope that if they've really imbibed the whole ""support our sisters"" mantra, then they (and all the other sisters, some of whom I've become good friends with) won't completely cut me off. I recognize the deep importance of the sorority to a lot of the girls, and the last thing I want to do is make it seem like I ""look down on them"" or think I'm better than the sorority, or something. 

**Tl;DR:** Leaving my sorority, but have to live with the sorority sisters for another year due to already signing the lease (subleasing not an option). Any advice on how to best break the news to them that I'm leaving, without sounding like a douchebag. :-)",12Jul2018,1

395,"

My boyfriend and I have been together for just under 3 years and have lived together for 1 year. We have two cute little rats as pets.

In April of this year he confessed that “around a month ago” he had used a site to hook up with a transgender/ male prostitute when I was out with friends for the evening.

He went over to this persons house; were he was given a massage and then anal sex. Needless to say I was devastated. The fact that this was a man and not a woman is the least of my concerns. I’m devastated because it goes without saying that  this is a real betrayal of trust.

I imagine this would be hard for anyone to deal with but I had been very specific about honesty in our relationship early on as I have cheated on before and didn’t want to be hurt in that way again. We even agreed at the very beginning to discuss the potential for bringing others into the bedroom as long as their were lengthy conversations before hand and we both agreed. I almost feel more betrayed that I was far more flexible than many people but even then; he went behind my back and did this. When questioned his reasoning is “he just wanted to feel young again”. He has had sex with prostitutes including male ones) in the past before we started a relationship which I didn’t have a problem with.

Perhaps now looking back I shouldn’t have stayed. But so far I have. One of the main (read:only) reasons he confessed was that he was scared he had an STD and was feeling anxious about this. So I supported him when he got tested. Luckily; thank god he was clear of everything included HIV virus.

We had a lot of long; drawn out discussions about why this had happened. One of which was that our sex life wasn’t the same anymore which I agreed with. We both decided to be more open about what we wanted and to initiate sex more. I feel in the past 3 months however; that I am still the main person making the effort and essentially asking for sex which makes me feel very unwanted and unattractive so in turn; I end up feeling despondent about our sex life as a whole.

While he is still kind to me in general; while he’ll make me dinner and we have made plans to go on holiday; paint the room; record some music together-he doesn’t usually kiss me; touch me without prompting; or seem particularly enthusiastic about being around me. We hug before going to bed but it doesn’t feel intimate anymore.

I get this all points to him not finding me attractive anymore or not wanting to be with me; but when we did call things off at the very beginning for a few days; he came to me sobbing telling me not to leave and that he would change. He said he saw how closed off he was and that he would open up and be more committed to the relationship. He is uncomfortable talking about future plans however.

I feel miserable and betrayed but I still love him. We are/were very close at one stage; great friends as well as partners; had the same sense of humour yadda yadda. To top all of this; speaking bluntly moving out will be very hard financial and I’ll feel like a complete loser-as I’ll be 32 and living in a rented house share (literally can’t afford anything else. Rent for 1 room is 1/3 of my whole wages were I live.

I’m stuck in limbo. Living with him; still in love with him but very very hurt and finding it hard to see a future with someone who is unwilling to work with me.

Should I leave?

401,"Ok, so I'm not really sure to begin. And I've never used this site before. I just made this account to post this and I'm not even sure if it'll get seen.

I guess to start off I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (we're both 20) for almost three years now. It started off really rocky. For the first year or so he lied a lot (seriously, a lot) and made me feel incredibly insecure in so many ways. And in a way, that's still stuck with me. He promises he's changed, and he has thankfully, but I guess someone can only change so much.

Last night he did something that he has done multiple times to me, to the point where I'm basically used to it. He was supposed to wake up early for work so he set an alarm. Alarm goes off. He lays there refusing to turn it off, and despite my multiple attempts he refuses to get up. Basically I have to sit there for 10 or so minutes saying ""get up, get up, get up"" over and over while he ignores me. So I eventually shove him and pull his sheets off, which pisses him off, and he hits me and/or starts cursing at me, calling me a bitch, a naggy cunt, etc. Keep in mind this EXACT SCENARIO happens somewhat frequently. And every single time it ends in me yelling at him in a desperate attempt to make him leave. I text him later asking what the fuck his problem is, he defends himself, we don't talk for the rest of the day, and he eventually texts me some half assed apology and I forgive him. But at this point I feel like I can't take it anymore.

I don't see why I deserve to be screamed at and shoved around simply for trying to help him get up in time for work. I just don't understand. And every time he somehow makes himself out to be the victim. 

Another thing he does a lot is belittle me for my mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, etc.) And any time we argue he uses it against me. Calls me lazy, miserable, etc. and makes me feel like it's my fault my brain is the way it is.

I know it sounds cliche and dumb of me, but I love him. He's my best friend, and I'm scared to not have him in my life. I can't imagine anybody else putting up with my shit. 
But I feel like I'm constantly swinging back and forth between admiring him and then resenting him. Some weeks our relationship feels wonderful and happy and then other weeks he does shit that makes me feel hopeless and miserable. I don't even feel like I'm the same person that I was three years ago. If I met her she would be like a stranger to me. I feel like some batshit crazy insecure control freak.

Sorry this is really dramatic and long, I just have no clue how to properly organize all of my thoughts and feelings.",12Jul2018,1

405,"My boyfriend and I moved to a new city a little under a year ago. We didn't have jobs lined up, but found ones pretty quickly. He makes a good amount of money in advertising and I'm a counselor at a children's psychiatric hospital.

At first, the job was what I expected. I kept the kids safe and talked with them about what they were going through. It wasn't always easy, but it was rewarding. I'm planning on going to nursing school, so working in a hospital setting was a big plus, too. The issue is that the job has gone south pretty quickly. I guess the hospital isn't doing that great and is going to get bought out soon, but the units are consistently understaffed and I went from being someone patients can get help from to now where I'm almost always assigned to sit at arms length from a highly aggressive patient who it is guaranteed will attack me during my shift, probably multiple times. I'm talking patients so acute that they need sitters so that if they attack someone, the sitter can intervene and make sure its themselves and not another patient. It's not the same patient doing this. By the time one patient like this leaves, another one with the same behavioral issue comes along and I'm assigned to sit with them, too. I'm basically a punching bag at this point and can barely remember the last time I spoke with a patient about their life situation or their feelings or whatever. 

I'm pretty much done with it, and have a lot of logistical reasons for wanting to leave this job anyway, but despite submitting applications for the last 2-3 months, I've had literally zero callbacks or invitations to interview. The resume I'm using is the same as the one I submitted for my last two jobs, but with the current job added. I'm well-liked by my supervisors and have good performance reviews at my current job, so even if places contacted my employer to verify employment before calling me, they shouldn't have any reason to toss my application in the trash.

I'm 100% sick of working where I do. I don't know how much longer I can take it. I've been applying pretty much exclusively to hospital jobs because that's what falls in the intersection of what I'm interested in and where I'm qualified, but at this point I'll take anything. The thing is that I don't know what to look for. I have a bachelor's in psych and another bachelor's in computer science, but the time in my life when I was working with computers made me feel even worse than I do right now.

What do I do to change this? Is this normal? It wasn't like this every other time I went job hunting. I can't network as effectively because I don't have many friends in this new city at all. What might I be missing from all this that could help me land a new job?",12Jul2018,1

407,"For the past few years since I was a child I've gone through some struggle that left me with some limiting beliefs. It wasn't until 4 months ago that I realized why I always felt so bad, even when nothing was seemingly wrong. I realized I had limiting beliefs such as that I'm not good enough, nobody likes me, or nobody wants to be friends with me, and if I express my true self that I would be judged and put down. I realized this and have been trying to change these beliefs through meditation, reading, self improvement, and taking action. Something that I'm really struggling with right now is that I feel like I can't be myself around my own sister. I'm not very close to my sister and she's a couple years older than me. I don't feel like I can say anything remotely personal to my sister. I feel like she will judge me for who I am. When she's around I immediately feel like I'm responsive to her every action and don't do what I really feel like. My mind is covered with fog and I act stupid. I feel the need to hide what I'm doing, I watch my words, I feel like she's going to judge me. It's actually easier for me to be myself with strangers than my own sister.

And I need to get back into my career field, Property Management.  The problem?

I want to know whether I have an item that I can make that would be a good product that people might buy.

Started messaging with this guy on tinder and about four days later he invites me over to his place for dinner and to smoke. I say sure, and on the day we meet at the train station and end up going to a coffee shop to smoke. 

We ate dinner at a restaurant and smoked our joints and it was nice; we decided to go back to his place to watch a movie and smoke the remaining weed. 

Fast forward and we’re on his couch making out. I had told him earlier than I didn’t want sex. Makeout starts getting a bit heated and he keeps trying to get my clothes off. I say no a couple of times until he somehow manages to get my shirt off. I was pretty high by this point and too tired to say no again.

I tell him ‘no sex’ again when he takes his dick out and tried to get my pants off. Instead I offer a blowjob (I wanted to do that) and we do it. After we kiss a bit and again he gets on top of me. 

This guy is A LOT buffer and bigger than me so he basically has me pinned making out. I get this nervous feeling. He manages to rip my pants off and I tell him no sex again and try pushing him off. He pins me down, tells me he’s only gonna put his fingers in. 

I say ok and he does, but then I feel pressure that is definitely not fingers. I dip my hands down and tell him to stop and that I’ve already said I don’t want sex. He tells me ‘don’t worry I won’t put it in’ but just a second later he tries. 

I kind of panicked at this point and tried shoving with all my weight, he didn’t budge still trying to tell me to calm down and holding me down. Finally I literally push with my knees and I manage to slip from under him.

I started throwing clothes on immediately and he says “it’s your own fault, you were making me crazy”.

I can’t stop thinking that it was somehow my fault and he keeps writing now to meet again, telling me he won’t do this again.

Should I meet him again? Was this normal?

418,"So I just finished the Lpn program at Job Corps in Upstate Ny. I moved to NYC and stayed there for 8 months back in 2016 to 2017. I spent half time in a youth shelter and half of the time with a roommate. I loved nyc and only had to leave to come to Job Corps to do Lpn. 

I came to Job Corps from the shelter and I really had no idea I'd get into the Lpn when I did. I didn't really have the faintest idea of where'd I be after I finished. I'm taking my Lpn boards on the 25th this month (and I'm staying absolutely positive that I will pass) but I'm a little conflicted.

I have no family here in NY and I won't consider living with em (largely toxic). I pretty much have no parents. I'm not staying upstate. Job Corps is only giving me just under 500 for completing. I have no savings and no real help from Job corps and I'm a bit terrified. I have gotten a call from 2 agencies for an Lpn position back in nyc. I have a church with a few friends I've gotten close with and I'd hate to leave em bc they've been a good source of emotional support.

My other option is I have a close friend who will let me stay with her until I get on my feet. The only thing she asks is to watch her kids occasionally. She lives in Chicago. Job corps will pay for reciprocity to Illinois for my nursing license and pay for me to get there. It'll take perhaps a week to get my new license there.

I've considered Chicago. It's one of the very few places that has a part time Bsn (I have 91 college credits. Mostly gen ed). This is good for me since I'll have to work full time no matter what. And I could easily afford some places on my salary over there.

If I go back to nyc I'll have to stay in a shelter for a bit then save for a room. It seems the answer is in my face...but I'm having a very hard timr making a decision. I've never lived on my own before or held a decent paying full time job.

I know down the road I want to continue my training in the fine arts and Chicago or nyc have good studios to learn it. Right now I'm in a mental bind.

422,"My fiancé and I moved into a rental property about six months ago. We noticed right away that our neighbors are on the dirtier side.  In addition to the junk yard in their back yard, they have seven small dogs who are covered in fleas that regularly visit our property. 

* our property has and additional empty  lot next to use that is ours *

Before we moved on, an older gentlemen lived in our house, but didn’t maintain the yard as he wasn’t physically able. A company came out to mow and maintain. Since we’ve moved in, it has been our responsibility to take care of this lot. 

Now, our neighbor has been using this lot to kick tennis balls with his golf club for his dogs to retrieve. We do not mind even though the tennis balls regularly hit the side of our house or our garage. 

Every day, he lets his dogs out who run straight to our front yard to relieve themselves. He has trained them to not use his hard, but ours. Daily I walk outside to water my plants and they are dying due to the amount of urine that is on them. I collect up to ten piles of shit per day, in front of our house. He stands in his yard and watches his dogs do this.

I have shooed the dogs away, in his presence and asked him nicely to keep them on his property. Yet, the issue continues. Every morning I wake up at 5am to his dogs barking in our yard, shitting on our lawn, and peeing on our plants. I can’t even believe I have to ask him to control this situation as it seems like most owners would naturally keep their animals off of others property. 

I don’t want the fleas in or yard, the shit on our lawn, and their urine on our vegetables.

There have been weeks were she won’t talk to me because of a disagreement, she will lock herself away in her room for hours when I’m home.

Today we went to Costco to refill ink cartridges. The total was $40, she couldn’t find her card, so I covered the cost. Later at the grocery store I asked if she would Zelle me my money back(I don’t like having floating amounts of cash being owed, since I end up forgetting about it). She went off on how I should pay for some of the ink. I told her I would pay $10 of it. I don’t use the printer, ever, they use it strictly for my brothers respite/HAB papers. Instantly she got pissy and wanted to see the receipt. Total was $40.13. She said well, you can pay a dollar of the tax. I told her that technically I am, $8.99 for the inkjet one and the tax was like $3 for all of it. So $8.99 plus $1 something equalling $10. She didn’t like that. My mother has control issues, and I’m a 26 year old female who lives at home, but I pay my dad rent and contribute more than what is mine here. So she stopped talking with me in the store and the second we got home she Zelled me $40.13. I said to her that I would pay the $10 and she insisted that it wasn’t up for discussion anymore. 


My question is, why would someone behave like this, so I just ignore it? This is a reoccurring reaction from her; almost like guilt tripping. I tried to cover a price that wasn’t mine to pay, and I’m treated like utter shit for asking for my money back for something I don’t utilize in this house.

Me: He's downstairs do you want me to get him? Her: Walks past me to sit at the bar and doesn't answer

Three hours later - I'm off the clock and having a drink at the bar Her: Sits down next to me What's with your face? Me: Idk what you mean Her: The way you're looking at me it's all wrong. Me: Okay... Her: See I'm a positive person, and you're just giving off so much negativity. Me: Okay...

I'm concered that I can't complain because she's the owner's friend and is my direct supervisor's best friend. My direct supervisor is the one I'd need to complain to anyway. What makes matters worse is that she lives upstairs from the restaurant.

Should I talk to my boss/manager? Speak to her directly? Leave it alone?

Any advice is so appreciated. Thanks!",12Jul2018,1
433,"I’ll try to keep this somewhat brief as I really need advice. I really don’t know what to do. 

So my husband adopted my German Shepherd mix 2 years ago when she was approximately 1 years old from our local animal control shelter. Before letting us take her home, they took her to a vet that spayed her. While she was still recovering from anesthesia that evening, we brought her home and I was alone with her and my cat. I made food and ate in the living room and when my cat started begging, she went after him and attacked him. I broke it up and my cat was fine but I was scared my husband would send her back. He didn’t and we gave her another chance. Up until now, she’s been fine with all the cats in the house (we have a few room mates and one has two cats and we own two as well). Fast forward some... we got her together with a friend of mine and his puppy, they met outside in neutral territory (and he knew ahead of time she doesn’t do great with other dogs but we figured a small dog, like a cat, she’d do fine). She mauled her and broke her arm and we had to rush her to the ER. My friend elected to amputate. This cost us a lot of money. Thankfully my friend didn’t press charges. 
I took my dog on a walk a while ago and another dog (German Shepherd) was loose in someone’s yard. They fought and thankfully I had help breaking them up. 
Another instance was when a dog was loose in my neighborhood. It was a small terrier mix and came up onto our porch, our neighbor was calling for it so I tried to grab him for her. Just then, my husband came out to see what all the commotion was about and my dog bolted out and attacked the dog causing a huge laceration down it’s side. Again, another rush to the ER and another huge bill for us. 
Finally, today, my dog went after my room mate’s cat while she was sleeping. He stepped on her to try to get to me for cuddles and she snapped and grabbed him by the throat and throttled him back and forth. I was screaming and got her to let go so he could get away. My husband and I put her in her crate and checked on the cat and thank god he was fine. 

So my problem is her unpredictable aggressive behavior. We have a 4-year-old with some slight developmental delays (high functioning autism) and a speech delay so when he plays “rough” with her and we try to stop him or explain why that’s a no-no, he doesn’t comprehend it. We’re terrified of the thought she might snap on him. 

I’ve lost my trust in her. I can’t even trust her around our cats anymore and I thought she was fine with cats for the most part. It doesn’t seem to matter if it’s small or big animals, she is aggressive towards them all and I don’t know what to do. We found a training program in a city 45 minutes away from us but it costs a grand and I don’t even know if it’ll change her, plus with work and taking care of a young child, I don’t know if it’s even plausible. 

I’m torn between finding her a new home hoping someone with no other pets or small children can give her a good life or if euthanizing so I can keep her ashes is the best course of action. At least I’d still have a piece of her to remember her by. 

I love my dog to death and I’ve been crying all day about this decision. She’s my baby and I don’t want to lose her but the fact remains - I can’t trust her. I don’t want her to be a danger to our family or other pets. 

So thanks for reading, please lend me your advice. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors, it’s been a long day. ",12Jul2018,1
434,"This post is going to be long and ramble-y, so in advance I apologize for that, but 1. I just kinda need to get it off my chest and 2. there is quite a bit of context.

In high school, I was kind of a loser. I wasn't teased mercilessly, but there was bullying. I had a lot of self image issues, struggled with depression, suicide, general teenage angst, you name it. Basically, I was a very lonely, hurt kid. But I had one friend who meant the world to me.

We were your typical teenage girls, as cringey as that is to say now. We loved TV shows, obsessed over actors, went on Tumblr a lot, etc. But we were incredibly close, and I still remember several of the inside jokes we had that would have us crying with laughter. She was so important to me. She was one of the only people that really listened when I told her about my depression and didn't immediately tell me that the meds weren't looking or that I needed more help (which is fine advice but... I just needed someone to listen to me in those days.) I thought we were best friends, there for each other for anything.

Anyway, cut to graduation, we're both going away to college, we promise to write to each other, stay bffs, all that teen movie stuff. And for a year, honestly, it kind of worked.

But... Well, then she stopped responding to my physical letters. There was an issue with her mailbox at school, she said. Then she stopped responding to my texts. There'd be that stupid 'seen at...' stamp that was always the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever seen, and I'd endlessly pour over what I had sent her and cursed myself at whatever minor flaw I must have put in, because of course it must have been my fault she wasn't answering, right? 

She'd occasionally answer, but it was often ""haha"" or ""yeah, that sounds cool."" Not a lot of conversation starters. I also started to notice she was not telling me things that were going on in her life. She got a new girlfriend, and told me about it, but I found out later they'd been going out months before she'd told me, and never offered to introduce us if she was visiting. 

Eventually I got the hint. People drift away, and all that. It hurt, though, because I hadn't wanted to drift. I still loved her, but I realized that at this point I was probably just annoying her and that she didn't want to be friends anymore, so I needed to drop it.

It would be one thing if she'd just ditched our hometown and left everyone behind, but it's just me. She still is in touch with a lot of other friends from high school, people I always found rather toxic. So I did something wrong, or she for whatever reason decided I was the weakest link.

I've seen her a few times when we're both in our hometown. The first time was by accident, and she acted as if we'd both fallen out of touch. Like she hugged me and said she missed me, and was all smiles. I was really floored by that, and still am. This doesn't have much to do with the story, but she hadn't completely shut me out, I guess, if that means anything?

I found out through facebook that she's moving abroad for her MA, and decided to reach out to her. This would be my last chance to ask her what the hell happened. I thought maybe we could grab dinner, or drinks, and after an hour or so casually bring up ""hey, we used to be so close in high school, I wonder what happened..."" or something else non accusatory but that could bring up an answer. But when I asked if she was going to be in town at any point, and if she wanted to get together, her response was basically ""yeah, maybe, it depends on where I get a job,"" and didn't really follow up.

So she doesn't want to see me. I'm not going to ever get closure, and I probably won't see her again for a long time, if ever. 

I don't know why, but I've been thinking about her a lot lately. It's been 4 years, but it still hurts so much whenever I think of her just deciding not to be friends with me. What did I do? Was I still stuck in those teenage ways when she wanted to move on? Was I just a drag with all my depression and she was getting out? I'm more heartbroken over her than I have been about any boyfriend breaking my heart.

How do I stop thinking about her? It's not like my life is empty. I have friends, a job, a continuing education. My self worth has about tripled, and I'm in a much better place. But still, I keep obsessing over her, and how much I miss her.

How do I let her go, knowing that I'll never find out why she left me?

tl;dr Had a best friend in high school who stopped talking to me. 4 years later I still think about her. Closure isn't an option. How do I get over a friend breakup?",12Jul2018,1

440,"Hey folks.  


I'm currently in a LDR with my girlfriend. I worry about it, seeing as it's set to last *at least* for three more years. We've been together for \~1.75 years. We're very close and get along great, but it's starting to become obvious that we have our differences. The main one I see is in how we react to things. My SO is very passionate. When they like things, they get involved with them and learn more about them. More power to them, I'm not against it-the issue is, my brain's first response is ""So what?"" to many of the things they're passionate about(Fair note: I've been diagnosed with mild autism. Empathy is not my strong suit.)-but it's also hard for me because my SO tends to get very intense, while I don't.  


Part of me worries that this is a bigger problem-I'm not passionate enough about anything, even the things I like. Or is it just how we express ourselves, and should I not be worried? If that's the case, how do I go about handling this?  


I worry about the relationship-it's been a good one, and I don't want to throw it away. I can't say I feel great about the relationship right now, but I'm worried about the LDR. We've had issues because of it before and I want to make sure I'm making the right decision by sticking with(or not sticking with) this.   


Any help would be greatly appreciated.",12Jul2018,2
441,"So I'm 18 and so is she, the other day I was at a two-day training course for teaching where we learn how to teach new children coming into the school, etc. There were a number of students from different schools attending and the girl I like was from a school about an hour away from where I live.  

The first day I mostly stuck to people from my own school until the night where I mingled a bit and spoke to a few people. I had noticed this girl in the morning but sadly never got a chance to speak to her. The second day one of the teachers needed three volunteers to act a scene for demonstration. The girl and her friend both went up and as I do drama, I decided it was a good chance to speak to her so I volunteered. The three of us acted together and it was great, we got the crowd laughing, made a fool of ourselves but it was great. After that, we did get talking. We spoke about acting, drama, etc. and everything we had in common. Sadly, that was only an hour before we were all leaving. I managed to get her snapchat before she left so I wasn't too worried.

At home, we spoke a bit over snapchat but the responses were rather slow but I didn't care, we were talking which was the main thing. She's visiting Stuttgart in Germany for a week to meet her friend so we won't be talking too much this week as she'd be mostly likely busy. 

I'm thinking of asking her to hangout after she comes back from Germany but I don't know. I'm afraid her responses are too short and that in reality, I'm just another boy trying too hard. I really don't know what to do. In the past, I've screwed up with girls and sometimes just given up. Any advice on what to do? ",12Jul2018,1

447,"Hi Reddit!

So basically, I’m 24, for the last 5 years I’ve worked for a very big company (my first and only job). Over the 5 years I’ve managed to work my way up the ladder a bit, got a few pay-rises and I now work from home 99% of the time.  The job is easy and the people I work with are mostly nice. I think I want to leave.

TL;DR, just after starting my job 5 years ago I was diagnosed with a rare lung condition that basically meant I was going to die. Last year that happened (only briefly). I was very lucky to have received a double-lung transplant and now I’m cured and doing incredibly well. But here’s the problem(?). This new lease on life has given me a new outlook on everything. To the point that I don’t know wether I’m just on a massive high because, well, I’m alive or because this is how I’m going to feel forever? Basically, this job that I used to love, that pays well and gives me a bit of freedom is not something I want to do anymore. Everyone who I ask advice from in my personal life tells me I’m crazy to consider leaving, that people my age don’t earn what I do, work from home, etc. But I’m bored AF. I don’t want to sit behind a computer anymore.

This new found outlook on life and my new health has meant that I’ve been able to take up many hobbies that I had during my teens. Mainly photography. I’ve been doing tons of it recently and I’ve even started doing it paid for the news, businesses and a few clubs. I love it. But the pay sucks, the hours really suck, but it’s really fun.

Deep down I know what I want to do. But I need advice.

Pros of current job: flexibility, a job I know and good money.
Cons: I’m bored AF, it’s not challenging anymore.

Pros of doing something else (even photography): it’s fun.
Cons: it’s probably way less money,

I know this sounds like a non-problem or such a “3rd world problems” problem, but honestly, this is a big thing for me.

I could write forever about all the shit going on but its not really that important so I'll give the short version.

* Hate my job, hate it enough that it's causing suicidal thoughts.
* Turning in 2 weeks tomorrow, nothing lined up after it
* Have a great opportunity to work with some friends in a hacker house next month (2weeks).
* Need to learn new languages (coding) and frameworks so I don't slow them down, compensation is not guaranteed unless I'm up to specs.
* Learning new stuff on top of coding 9+ hours a day at work is causing extreme mental fatigue and stress and wrecking my personal life.
* Made a linkedin because I was worried about the impending job search and got scouted by some top tech companies including google.
* Some how managed to get myself tangled into an interview in 2 weeks (2 weeks is no way near enough to prepare for a coding interview at google, common recommendations I've seen are 2 hours a day for 2 months of studying required)
* Despite all this coding for me to do in a short amount of time, I've having extreme cognitive dissonance that none of it is the coding that I want to do for myself. Interview prep isnt really applicable for creating applications and I'll be working on my friends app for most likely just a resume / portfolio builder.

Basically I'm just completely overwhelmed with the amount of shit I have to do while balancing personal life and my happiness. I'm so worried about being unemployed and just burning tons of money a day while searching for a job. This worrying is causing me to hate everything in life. If I'm trying to relax or see friends I hate myself since I should be working harder to avoid losing money and if I work too hard I have panic attacks causing me to unproductive, exacerbating the panic. I'm trying to finish off my last two weeks strong for a good recommendation but the stress of spending a majority of my waking hours at this job while I have so much to do at home is killing me.

On top of all this is the fucking kicker, I have seemingly no financial worries. I have months worth expenses and my family is well off. I'm just too prideful to ask for help so I'm trying to work myself to death to keep up the appearance of that I'm this amazing successful coder even though I feel like I'm going to explode all the time.

How do I balance everything I need to do while still staying positive and happy and able to see friends when it feel like I have way too much to do. The guilt of not throwing myself 110&amp;#37; at my work is driving me insane and working too much is driving me insane too.",12Jul2018,2
