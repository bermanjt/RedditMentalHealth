1,"Hey yall, I love in a big city (Vancouver, BC) and I'm my drive home today I was singing along to some music.... And I realized that EVERYONE could hear me.  That didn't bother me at all but I realize now that I really can't stand this city life.... At all.  We're constantly crammed and surrounded by people, either in traffic surrounded by people, grocery store surrounded by people, in my apartment.... Surrounded by people... It just never stops.  I have 2 years until I'm a red seal carpenter and then I'm planning on running the fuck out of the city with my girlfriend (future... And pretty much present wife)

The advice I seek is.... What the hell do I 
I do to deal with this city life that I genuinely hate with every fiber of my being and makes me feel claustrophobic. ",01Nov2018,1

3,"I’m 21,
I dropped out of a business degree I hated, tried something else and found out it wasn’t what I had hoped for.

I’m short, balding and I have no real friends.. just 3 or 4 guys I went to  school with and we meet up every now and then.
But they’ve all got their own friends, the go to different colleges..
I don’t talk to anyone on social media at all unless my dad wants me to send on something.

I feel like I wasted my college experience, if I want to go back I’ll be 22+, starting over, probably commuting from home, and paying a lot of money out of pocket (no student loan options here)..

I don’t even know what I would study, maybe Geography, I would really want to go to a top university if I was going into a field like that - I could get into Trinity College Dublin for Geography and Geoscience.
But I probably can’t afford to start again in first year and pay for accommodation and all that comes with it.

I have no where to go to meet girls, I don’t talk to any anymore..

I just feel so unhappy so often and I don’t know how to change it.
The world is horrible, it’s inherently bad, you’ve got kids with bone cancer, you work 40+ hours a week to get by.
You can loose your job and your life savings like that, music is just shit, marketing is everywhere trying to sell you crap or an addiction.

Everyone I love will one day die, it could be tomorrow.

I’ve ruined ‘the best years of my life’ according to every second Instagram post, I’ve got no friends, no girls going to want a short balding, socially awkward pessimist.
Everything just seems so unjust and not worthwhile.

I don’t know what to do...
At best I’ll have to work a year to go back to college to pay out money to be surrounded by 18 year olds at 22, to study something I’m not sure off with no certainty of a career and I couldn’t go to my current top choice because I can’t afford it.

What’s the point?",01Nov2018,1
4,"My baby’s father was in Jail this weekend for restraining order violations and assault on his other baby’s mother. He called me crying to get out that she set him up and took his money for rent and he can’t get out of jail. (I had not spoken to him for like a year.. and he has been behind on child support) he called me every 30 minutes when he could in there.. 

I felt bad because he told me he would pay me back and he really wanted to see us and be a family... i told him I didn’t have a job at the moment and I could barely afford what our daughter needs, he told me to sell things.. I sold my Nintendo Switch, my 2DS XL, and my TV to pay his bond and get him out. As soon as he got out he literally said he had to go and talk to his family and Would message me.. just left us there and we had to take a bus... he told me off in text that I’m a bad mom I’m worthless that he doesn’t give a shit and doesn’t owe me nothing

I can’t stop crying and my parents told me I’m stupid for selling my belongings for him, I feel like I am worthless and I just don’t know what I am so hurt",01Nov2018,1

6,"I’ve been renting this apartment since September 1st. It’s a small apartment in Vancouver at 520 sq feet but what attracted me to the apartment and a big reason I rented the apartment was because of the balcony. He failed to tell me before I moved in that construction was gonna be happening on the balconies and I wouldn’t have access to it for 4-5 months. I would not have rented this apartment if I wasn’t going to have access to my it. I let the first 2 months slide but now it’s really bothering me not having any outdoor space, not to mention people hanging in my windows and off my balcony multiple times a day.

7,"I (18M) don’t have friends and it’s really 
emberassing.

It was really difficult making friends when i went to middle high school up to senior high school. 
I was socially awkward and a really quiet kid, so in the first year i only talked when someone asked me something. 
First year i made some friends, well i did not they came up to me, since then i hanged with them at school. 
But then in my 3rd year i got a new class and lost contact with my friends, still being that quiet and awkward kid I didn’t make new friends and hanged with nobody during lunch breaks.
Once in a while i spoke to them but never really kept hanging with them cause they made new friends and I didn’t want to be annoying or weird if i hanged with them again.

So i finished senior high school and went to community college, made some progress with my social abilities and had classmates i hanged with. Being a bit more open was like a challenge everyday but i tried and tried. Eventually i got that “fuck it” mentality and really just said things i never would say back when is was 12-15 years old. 
I also got a job that year at a supermarket and improved my social skills there to, talked to every co worker and it really boosted my confidence talking to people.

Now doing my 3rd education, got new classmates and being really talkative and social person, but still haven’t made any real friends.
My classmates i hang with always see some friends they greet and i greet some acquaintances in school but those are not really people i know well or even hang with. 

I feel like everyone already has their own circle of real friends that they chill with from way back that they met in middle school or something, 
Where do i start? Feel like i’m behind everyone,

8,"Hello. I've peeked around Reddit for a little while, but never made an account until now. 

I'm in a rough situation and I don't know what to do. 

I'll try to keep it short-ish.

So, 2 months ago, I moved from California (where I lived for my entire life) to N.E Washington. I'm really loving it here and the change in atmosphere and environment have been good for my mental health. I'm 25 years old and have been attending school here full time for environmental sciences in addition to working around 25 hours per week at some cleaning place. I can barely afford rent. I can barely afford any food. I sure as hell can't afford to do anything that would actually make me happy. It snows here, and I can't afford snow tires or any warmer clothes. I realize I obviously should have planned better. I had a decent amount of money saved up before I moved here, so I figured I would be fine, but I had to pay for a few different car repairs totaling around $3000 on my drive up here, and that left me with practically nothing. I'm currently only making about $700 a month, and my student loan (around $1100) instantly went to paying rent, and paying off loans. I don't know what i'm going to do, I can't afford the things i'm going to need for the winter. I've been applying for another job, but a lot of the places are either looking for full-time employees or their part time conflicts with school. Also I feel that if I overload myself with too much work, I'll end up getting extremely depressed and self-destructive again. But if I don't, I might end up homeless, I have no where else to go. I'm really doing everything I can think of, but I feel like i'm running out of time.

Any advice or help would be appreciated, i'm lost and stressed beyond comprehension. ",01Nov2018,1
9,I'll try to make this short. I want to cut contact with one of my some friends. I have completely outgrown them and I want to get on with my life. My problem is I don't know what I should do in regards to ending the friendship. I know they will all give me a load of shit if I tell them I don't want to be friends with them anymore. Should I just ghost them completely? Or slowly overtime stop hanging out with them?,01Nov2018,1
10,"I am im my young 20s. I recently asked my friend out and she said yes. I got excited like everyone does. Later she respectfully said she didn't want to pursue a relationship for real reasons. I aknowleged it and now I am in this funk where I don't know how I feel. I feel sad and dreadful she had a change of heart but also glad she told me early on and didn't make me suffer.

Just to clarify, I don't want to convince her or change her mind or anything like that. The reasons were real and I have accepted it. I just want to know what im suppose to feel and what I can do to get past it.

I'll still see her in class and want keep our friendship but all I want to do at the moment is go to sleep. I know I'll get past this and have a lifetime to meet more wonderful people but it still hurts. Im just confused. Im sorry for unloading all of this to you people.",01Nov2018,1
11,"I’ve been friends with this girl, I’ll call her Macy, since sophomore year of high school. I’m in my sophomore year of college now and we are still “friends”. Recently she’s come back from Mexico and since then our relationship has gone downhill. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars to help her settle back into her apartment since she came back with nothing but a bag containing 3 outfits and a pair of shoes. She has no money so I’ve given her some to help her out. It’s really taken a strain on me because I’m unemployed and currently I’m broke with $1.95 to my name. Luckily I can still afford a bus that can take me to my campus. Macy doesn’t really seem bothered that I’m struggling, I’ve helped her get a job even. So she’s doing really well at the moment. Today was Halloween and Macy and I made plans since August for tonight. I’ve bought her, her costume along with my costume. I was in the middle of doing my makeup when I got a text saying,
“Sorry, I can’t hang out tonight. I have to shop for pants.” 
She really made that excuse, she makes excuses often not to hang out. Recently she said last minute she couldn’t hang out cause her uncle was dying but the story changed to her cousin giving birth. I dealt with other people lying and making excuses when I ask them to hang out to do something fun, something that doesn’t involve me giving them money. 

I’m sick of going in circles like this and I think it’s time I end this friendship. Macy is pretty sensitive and takes even the little things hard so how can I rip off the bandaid? I don’t want her to hate me, I want her to understand that there’s problems on my end and I can’t hang out with her anymore since it’s hurting me. ",01Nov2018,1

13,"Don't really know how to cross post, but this is a post I made today.

I'm 21 and am a college student. I have been dealing with many losses this year and it's really taken a toll on my grades and mental health.

On new years day, I lost my great grandfather who lived out of state and celebrated alone to take care of my home and watch over my dog.

Went back to school and failed a class I really needed to pass.

Later in the summer, I lose my great uncle and watched as his side of the family fought for his will/money.

In the start of fall, when I get my own apartment and school is slowly looking up, I get a call 3 days in that my grandfather passed away.

Midway through the new school year, my grades have been barely above a C and I'm trying my hardest to pass this year. I then get told that one of my grade school friends passed away. Then next 2 weeks, I am told someone I knew committed suicide, the same day two murders occur at my school.

Yesterday I get a call from my mother and she tells me my dog is at a pet hospital seeking serious treatment and that it may be near her time.

Now I am sitting here, feeling lost, depressed, weak, helpless. I tried to arrange for some counseling but my school doesn't have any available openings for a student with a crammed schedule.

I really want to talk with someone but I cannot find that person that can help me. I feel helpless and could really use any advice or pick me ups to get me through the year.",01Nov2018,1

18,"I need advice. 

I'm in my mid-to-late 40's, married for 26 years to a very supportive spouse, and an empty-nester. I've had a successful career up to this point and am a very hard worker. I work about 50-60 hours a week in a mid-level management position in a very high pressure job, but it is rewarding and despite some minor drawbacks (typical work stuff), I like it. I'm a veteran with a high school diploma and technical certificate that is not in my field of practice. I have no college degree, and it has affected my ability to advance on a few occasions, however, about 90% of the time, jobs have made exceptions for the degree in exchange for work and management experience.

I've recently been looking into the possibility of obtaining a Bachelors degree, but I am not sure of the benefit at this point in my career. On one hand, it seems I may be hitting my head as far as positions go, but on the other hand, do I really want to go $45,000-$55,000 in debt at my age? Do I want to make more money which will just equate to more outgo paying back loans at the end of the day? Do I want to drain myself at work only to have to come home and still have to make due with school and assignments?

Is there anyone out there my age that has done this? Anything that I'm missing? Is it worth it? Thanks in advance! ",01Nov2018,1

20,"TLDR:complacent kid stuck in a 5 year rut but happiness isn't the issue, motivation/discipline is. 
I graduated HS 5 years ago and pretty much haven't done anything since. I live with my parents and help around as much as I can but almost all my time is spent playing video games or watching shows, movies, and videos online. Not to mention smoke weed with some regularity. For the first 3.5 years I was ""enrolled"" (as far as everyone in my life knows) in college courses, but in reality I didn't even complete one. At the start of the summer last year it all came to a head and I kind of just got fed up with it and confessed everything to my parents. To my surprise they knew about the classes, although not the extent, and were more worried about me than mad that I've been useless for such a long time. It was the biggest sense of relief I've ever felt. I went to a couple therapy sessions and thought I'd worked out a plan to set myself straight. Stopped going after the third which may not have been wise. Anyway during the following months I got interested in EMS and got emt certified, completely destroyed the exams and the content as a whole, it all came very naturally in fact. I was on track to get the ball rolling. However at the end of the summer and certification I fell right into old habits. Picked up smoking with buddies again and let myself get away with sitting around doing nothing, going nowhere. I haven't even applied for any jobs yet, a Year later. When it comes down to it I really am happy though. My family is beyond awesome and supportive, although many friends have moved away we still game together like we always have and they are all there for me if I need them. I've always been content being alone too. Only boy with 4 sisters does that I guess. So to the advice seeking part, I want to get my shit in order and make something of myself, be self sufficient. Not that I can't get through everything you do on your first trip out the roost, because I have(moved into apartment with HS buddies for about 8 months). More so how do I motivate or discipline myself to get out there and stop being so complacent? I'd love to see the world and experience everything but I can't seem to take the first step. Thanks in advance. ",01Nov2018,1
21,"Long story short we have a tibetan mastiff; we've had him since birth. He was a gift from a friend who had the mother before her death a few years ago.  They live down the street and we never really moved them apart from birth, i think he had a health upringing and saw her regualrly. 

FFWD to now; he's goofy and clumsy...and i love him. We've NEVER had any issues with him and strangers, he has no dissociative disorders or temper issues.  That being said he's rightfully barked at someone who approached my daughter in an ill manner, touching her while our back was turned at a coffee shop...the guy was an ass and rilled me up.  Anywho, charlie barked at him..and i was incredibly proud of him.  
However my wife wants him to go away for training? But I really feel that his attitude and dynamics might change. I feel like maybe he would feel some type of resentment or disdain; feeling like we disowned him or something.

22,"Hi everyone! I posted this in the dreams subreddit, but it seems pretty dead so thought I would post here.

Starting a few months ago, I’ve been having dreams that are so intense that I wake up with headaches that last all day. The dreams are generally different but always include a fantasy aspect and a psychological aspect, such as bullying or anxiety or horror. They seem to have a medium/normal length. They have upped in frequency, and I’ve already had two of them and two headaches this week.

Some examples where I woke up with the headaches:

In one dream, I was granted super powers and had to go into an unstable building to save students and hospital patients. The building collapsed on me at the end.

In another dream, I was back at my summer job. Over the intercom, someone said something rude to me, I got upset and ran out. I ran to a hut in the woods where an old lady was there to magically battle me.

As the last example, I confronted my ex boyfriend and ex friends (definitely some bad blood there in real life) in person at a restaurant. It was pretty rough mentally in the dream. I don’t remember the specific fantasy element but I remember there was one.

I’m getting annoyed at the headaches. Why am I having these dreams and what do they mean? What are the headaches all about? Are there any ways to prevent this? Has anyone else experienced this?

The transition from a liberal arts major to science hasn't been that bad, and I have maintained a 3.8 GPA while completing everything from Gen chem I and II, Organic I and II, all the biological sciences I have taken, and finishing math with calculus and statistics. Along the way this semester, I have seem to met my match with Physics. It is completely and utterly stumping me, and draining both my will to continue and thought process on my future. I have tried tutoring, annoying my professor during office hours, and spend countless hours working and reworking problems, all to make 50s on the first two tests. At this point  I am starting to wonder if this is simply me not being wired for this, or if the way the professor is presenting the material is to blame. Should I tough out the class and take whatever grade is given, or should I drop and attempt it again. I would try to find a way around it, but it is a requirement for both medical schools and the degree program. ",01Nov2018,1

Day 1: Only thing liquids for the first meal. Then thicker liquids after

Day 2: Continue with thicker liquids

Day 3: Soft foods only like mashed potatoes, eggs, etc

Day 4: Try and resume normal diet

i’m in moderate pain, but mostly i just feel gross as i’m bleeding a lot and i just want to be in bed, resting.

i’m 18 years old and i live out of home. i got pregnant (from my boyfriend) and decided to have a termination because i’m not mentally or financially stable enough to raise a child. it was a hard decision on me, both mentally and physically. 

my lease is up and i *need* to move. there’s no way around it. it was very sudden that i found out i was pregnant and needed an abortion, if i knew earlier i would have tried to pack my house up first so i wouldn’t have to do much after my surgery. 

i have people around me to help but it doesn’t seem fair if i just lay back and do nothing. i want to take some harder painkillers but it’ll just make me drowsy and unmotivated.

i’m so frustrated, depressed and exhausted.

37,"TL;DR at the bottom

So went with some friends for a history project and one of my friends, her friend joined as well. I will call the girl ""Jennifer"".

We were goofing around on the Google docs chat and I joked ""add me on house party"" and she replied ""I dont have that"".

So i said add me on snap and put my snap in the chat. She added me and took lots of snaps of me. I told her my phone was dead before, but she kept pestering me ""add me back add me back add me back"" and lots of times when we'd take shots at her shes say ""no u"" even if it made no sense.

The next day we still were working on our group project. She did do work on the project, but mostly taking snaps/videos of me and sending them to me. She was goofy towards me and only taking snaps of a different person once or twice. 


This continued the 3rd day we did the project.  She was kind of making fun of me too.


I kind of felt a vibe and starting to wonder if I like her too, I feel something towards her and only feel like making a move if she likes me back. 

And I mean lots of snaps of me

38,"I've no friends locally, I had a small group via Meetup I'd go out with regularly and had opportunity to make friends.

My ex Mark started coming to this group and he very quickly made good friends with the core members of the group. 

I had no intention of dating Mark but we got on so well it just happened, Mark seemed completely committed to us long-term, but Mark became abusive and he dumped me when I confronted him. He got nasty, replaced me within weeks.

Now I feel I can't go out to this group any more, even if he's not there he's so close with the others that they're now *his friends*, not to mention I've no idea what he may have told them about why we broke-up...even if he hasn't lied, we looked happy and from their perspective I was 'out of his league' so for him to break up with me they'd assume my fault. 

There's no one from the group I'm close with, I tried spending time with two members outside the group after the breakup with Mark but aside from the fact they both used it as an opportunity to make a pass at me...one is fiend with Marks new girlfriend and one has taken the attitude of 'he's done nothing to me', so not exactly good contacts. 

I'm left with no friends and thus no social life, I can't use Meetup to meet new people as Mark is a member of multiple groups, it also means it's difficult for me even to go some places alone as I might run into Mark and/or the group...which will make me feel like a total loser. Meanwhile he gets this great group of friends, I know from mutual friends or event venues posting photos online that he's out with them regularly having fun. I just don't know how to deal with that.

40,"Context: I work for a very small company (about 5 employees) which means everyone is swamped  with work.

I work on average 10-13 hours a day just to get half of my lists of tasks accomplished. We got a new client who asked that I write content for 10 campaigns.

This week, I have spent way too many hours on a piece of content. My boss hated it and had me revise it. The client hated it and they had me revise it.

The first draft, I worked on for 6 hours. The new versions, I worked on from 9 AM - 6 PM. At 6, my boss emails me, asking if I’m done and when can he receive the other content he promised to the client.

I told him that I am taking a break and will get it to to him soon. When he didn’t like that, I said that I haven’t slept all week. That I didn’t eat anything the past day. I can’t remember the last time I closed my eyes.

I never complain but I couldn’t take it anymore. I am one person and I’m trying my hardest to get all of this done.

Rather than take that as a cue to let me be, he instead tells me that I need to grow up. He said that he never asked for me to work late into the night (even though he did by promising clients that I could finish big assignments in a day).

Anyway, I know he won’t fire me because he knows he can’t find another chump to do all of this for meager pay (otherwise, he would’ve done it the minute i talked back to him)

I want to quit, but I only have about 16 months of experience. I doubt I can find another job that will take me.

44,"So here’s a short back story. I am 22 years old and just moved back in after I just graduated college. My father has been married to my mother for 25 years coming up in November. They’ve had a pretty *normal* marriage I guess. Nothing out of the ordinary and a pretty happy marriage too. When I was a freshman (about 3 years ago now?) in college my dad forgot his phone when he went to work and so naturally I went to go charge it and leave it for him in his room when he got home. But he left it unlocked and I found some very lewd text messages to a contact who I had no idea who the heck it was. I was shocked, outraged, and hurt. I had no idea how to react. But I eventually confronted him and he made things right. He never told my mother and I never told my mother because it would destroy our entire family. 
Fast forward to today. So my college friends were in town over the weekend and my dad took a picture of us on his phone. I asked him to send me the picture and he forgot to. He goes to bed and I want the picture so I can send it to my friends. I thought it would be harmless to just go to his photos and send the picture to myself and that would be over with. Pretty normal. But I found more lewd text messages to another contact who I don’t know. History repeated itself. I told my brother and he doesn’t know how to handle the situation. I said to him that I would take care of it. 
I need advice. Should I gather evidence this time? Should I tell my mother? I can't afford to have my family fall apart. Thank you.

45,"I'm nineteen years old and in tech school for a career I'm entirely terrible at.  I'm living in a city an hour away from all my friends in a house with roommates who are essentially my polar opposites.  My support networks are gone and I feel like I'm completely removed from my community.  I used to have dreams.  I used to have fun every day.  Now life is pointless and everything I do is hollow.  I don't think I'm depressed, exactly.  Just starved of everything that gives me meaning.  I could easily foresee it turning into depression, though.

The advice I want is probably already within me.  Maybe what I'm doing here is seeking catharsis.  But I've drifted so slowly into the realm of lostness that I'm not entirely sure how deep I am, and an outside perspective will probably help, so I'll go ahead and post this anyway.

Last year, I started going to school to become a factory maintenance technician.  I made this decision based on very little real-life experience - I'd never even taken a shop class in high school, and I had no career experience, being only eighteen at the time.  At the same time, I was working almost full-time as a cashier at a large retailer.  I was very busy - much busier than I am now.  

But I was very happy.  Happier than I had ever thought possible.  My classmates were (and are) incredibly supportive, and we formed an amazing community.  We pushed each other to be great.  We hung out.  We cared for each other.  It was a complete realization of human community.  And in my job, I made friends out of my coworkers, found value in the human contact I got, and enjoyed every second.  Some people hate retail.  I loved it.  Not the boss, not the inane policies, but the helping, the human contact, the coworkers, the broad cross-section of society I saw.  

I loved life so much that there was almost no cognitive dissonance in my mind.  Everything I was doing was right for me.  I had space in my mind to take up a dozen hobbies and make plans for the future.  

And then, last summer, I quit my retail job to start an internship in my career field.  Shortly thereafter, considering that my college only offered the second year of the program in a different city and that I was living 45 minutes away from work, I moved an hour away to a new city.  

It was okay, at first.  I kept in touch with the people that mattered.  I stayed positive about the fact that I was terrible at my job, considering that I was new and could not reasonably expect to be good at it yet.  I enjoyed the freedom of living away from home.  I even made friends with some of my coworkers - on the day shift.

But as time went on, things got worse.  I called my mom crying a few times, scared to death I was too dumb to learn how to do my job.  I became very lonely, living so far from friends, and, for whatever reason, never made a community for myself in the new city.  It is too temporary here.

School started, and I started working nights instead of days.  The friends I'd made on the day shift were replaced with night shift's people.  One of the night shifts is miserable, mostly because the shift lead is a killjoy who never learned how to interact with people in a constructive way.  The other night shift is nice, but to be honest, I'd already begun to nurse a pit of apathy for the job, and so I didn't really try to get to know them.  The only times I like my job now are when I get to work in a different building on campus, where the coworkers are cool and I'm slightly less terrible at the work.  

Because I really, truly am terrible at my job.  I am still an intern, but I've been here for four months now, and I really should be able to fix a simple problem.  But I can't.  I just make things worse.  I'm so out of my depth.

Since the doubts about my career planted themselves, I've cared much less about school.  I make enough of an effort to pull A's, but it's not for me - it's for my classmates.  I am compelled by their support to work hard.  

I'm totally checked out.  I miss my old job, even if it was a ""dead-end retail job.""  I miss joshing with customers and being a part of the job's community, drama and all.  I really miss talking with customers about this and that.  If I could pick a dream job right now, it would probably be something intensely social and fast-paced.  Bartending, maybe.  Or cashiering again.  Or maybe sales.  

What's stopping me?  The fear that I'm simply a burnout.  That whatever I do, I'll only find satisfaction for a few short months or years before I burn out again and run away in search of something else.  And the trap that's become the expectations my classmates have of me.  It's painful to be a part of a valued community that's built around something that's stopped being important to me.  

And at home, I am the terrible housemate.  The one who stays up late and makes noise.  The one who plays guitar.  The one who generates a lot of weird smells.  The one who's paranoid about other people going into her room.  The one who goes for a run at 10 at night.  (I shouldn't say I'm an awful roommate.  I do, after all, keep the shared spaces immaculately clean.  I'm just a little too much of a wild card for my housemates sometimes.)

Not only that, but I am completely and utterly different from my housemates.  I'm a complete hippie, while one of my roommates is a straight-laced 30-year old who does EVERYTHING right by society's standards and the other one is a very Christian Life sciences teacher who never really seems to know how to react to me.  There's a new girl moving in soon who's a bartender, and I'm hoping I might find a kindred spirit there, but I really don't know.  

Right now, I'm lonely, and beyond that, I'm constantly paranoid that my roommates hate me, think I'm a stupid stoner type, or secretly wish I'd disappear.  It's really unhealthy.  It kinda pervades my life, and though I know it's all me - if there's anyone who really takes offense to my lifestyle, it's the inner voice of propriety my mother worked so hard to cultivate in me - it still really messes with me.

Perhaps I should take this as an opportunity for personal growth.  If I lived with kindred spirits, I'd never have to face the discomfort of standing by my personality in the presence of more cautious people.  But it is really hard.

In short, I'm facing an existential crisis.  I'm living day to day, and I've stopped dreaming.  Life looks bleak.  I'm caged by my ego.  Help.",01Nov2018,1
46,"Hey so I like never post anything but really need some advice here. So some context, there is this kid I’ve known for years I’ll call him John (not actual name) we are juniors in highschool and he is in my shop class so I see him for a couple hours every day. Now this kid is autistic, not severely but he’s definitely on the spectrum and everyone in my shop pretends to like him but we are very annoyed by him, he’s a dick and a know it all. Last year in sophomore year shop John starts going to the bathroom for 45 minutes every day (not at all an exaggeration) and the teacher was cool with it because he knew John was on the spectrum. But anyway I started taking drivers ed recently after school and guess what, John is in my class. I already know that everyone in there is going to hate him because he doesn’t stop talking but I’m pretty used to it by now. So John is really into anime right and that’s pretty normal for my friends who are all mega nerds but John is like an anime addict, reads manga in class, openly talks about this manga called monster monsume where the plot is based around this guy who fucks women who are half monster half woman. Now like I mentioned earlier he’s been going to the bathroom for 45 minutes almost every day for all of sophomore year and now into junior year always from 8:30 to 9:15. Now we always joked around that he went there to crank one out but today our suspicions were confirmed. Me and Johns drivers ed class is a 3 hour class after school with a 15 minute break, on the break we walk around the hallways and go to the bathroom. Shortly before the class started as well John was showing me the current manga he was reading. So anyway I’m like hey I really need to take a piss so I walk to this bathroom near the class, locked, try another, locked, go for a third and it’s open and guess what John is in there at the urinal furthered from the door. It was me him and this other kid who was just leaving, I chose the urinal closest to the door because I don’t want to be near this kid. So I take a piss flush the toilet and go to wash my hands at the other side of the bathroom and when I look into the mirror I see John bounceing up and down fast with his phone in his left hand and his (I assume) dick in his right hand, and for the split second I actually see this I can tell it’s a page from his manga on his phone because it’s black and white. I can’t tell you guys how fast I got out of there, flecks of piss still on my head a because I never got to wash them. I legit felt sick after and when class started up again I just couldn’t look at him, with his usual autist grin, with his whole pen in his mouth. So the advice I’m asking for is what do I do now, do I tell a teacher, do I forget it ever happened, do I tell him I saw, like I have no idea please help.

47,"My younger brother has been struggling with undiagnosed mental health issues his whole life. To clarify, our family has always known something was different about him. At the age of 5, he would run away from school, break mirrors in his classroom, and hit his teachers. His school councillor told our mother that he had severe ADHA and a hatred for women. I never quite understood. How could my brother hate women when he was being raised by a single mother? Fast forward 7-8 years, a psychiatrist tells him that he has PTSD from his childhood (abusive father, among other things) and a mild bipolar disorder. Although these conditions do negatively impact his life, I believe that he has another, undiagnosed condition that is severely impacting his ability to thrive as an adult.  For a million different reasons I won’t get into, I believe that my brother has not developed mentally beyond the age of 14 - 15.

I want my brother to lead a normal healthy life. But deep down I know that he is incapable of taking care of himself or making healthy decisions. I watch him make decision after decision that has direct and negative consequences for his wellbeing. He and I have talked about his struggles many times and I know he wants a better life for himself, but he simply cannot make the adult decisions necessary to turn his life around. For a long time, I chalked his behaviour up to being a young adult with little direction and ambition. But I now know that the issue is much more serious.

These last couple of years have been especially difficult. He has developed severe anxiety which makes it hard for him to be around other people. He has not been able to hold down a job for more than a couple of months and it has been nearly impossible for him to find meaningful work due to a criminal record that he picked up a few years back. He is extremely depressed (e.g., goes several days without leaving his bed) and constantly blames others for his problems. He is constantly on the verge of being homeless and gets by on a $550 / month social assistance check. My brother has burned bridges with nearly everyone in his life (parents, siblings, friends). I refuse to give up on him, but I find myself growing tired and loosing patience over the years.

My brother is lost, but deserves a better, healthier life. I have tried nearly everything aside from letting him life in my second bedroom (he has angry outbursts and I don't trust him around my wife). 

**My question for Reddit is**...Given his mental condition, does Canada have any Provincial or Federal social programs that could provide additional financial support either for the short or long term? I know there is a disability pension program, but would it apply to mental disorders? I should note that he lives in Nova Scotia.

TBH, I know the social programs in his community pretty well as I have researched them enough times on his behalf. I truly believe that if he weren't always under such financial pressure, he would be able to focus on improving himself, working through his issues, and eventually even finding meaningful employment that is suitable to his limitations. I know this is a long shot, but any insight or advise would be greatly appreciated.",01Nov2018,1

problem is my dad doesnt like cats and it was hard to convince him to let her stay in the first place. i found her outside in the rain a few months ago. if i cant stop her im going to have to get rid of her. but a bigger problem is shes old and has a bad heart murmur. no one will want her. so i might have to have her put down and i dont want to do that. but i also dont want to abandon her in a shelter or outside :'(

49,"When I was still in high school, I had a troubled kid who bullied, and physically assaulted me. I was a nerdy kid, an introvert. I had a strong moral compass. But I had very few friends. 

 I remember one day walking into math class, he was behind me and pushed me. He said something like “hurry up faggot”, something really immature and stupid. I almost fell, and people laughed at me. 

Being embarrassed, and not wanting to look like a pushover, when he walked past me I tripped him and he fell. He stood up and swung at me. He barely hit my chest and got in a lot of trouble for it. He was on step 9 out of 10 before he hit me, so he was going to be expelled. 

I felt a little bad for him. I knew he had a bad home environment, and was troubled, so I went to the principal and told him to give the guy another chance.

Years later, somehow he ended up living with my uncle (he was friends with one of my cousins and his mom kicked him out). I was 17 at the time and would go to my uncles property to hunt and ride 4 wheelers/cookout you know, just southern past times. He was always there and we became close friends.

My uncle ended up kicking him out and he had nowhere to go. I stupidly asked my mother if he could stay with us. He was very grateful when my mom said yes. He helped out with cleaning and chores, and generally felt like a brother to me.

My father had died a year previously and I was 17. We inherited some money from his life insurance policy and lived frugally. I was extremely depressed and was self medicating with alcohol, marijuana, pills, anything I could get my hands on. My mom was a nutcase at the time. I honestly felt like I was the parent taking care of my mother and sister. 

My friend, well call him Tony was still living with us, and I started to notice he was sleeping in my moms bedroom after a month or so. This disturbed me so I ignored it for about a month until I heard them having sex. 

It ruined my mental state. I felt like my mother had betrayed my father (he had only been dead for a few months) and I also felt betrayed because he had bullied me in high school, and I was kind enough to let him live with my family. 

I didn’t know how to handle the situation, so I would go on walks and get high. I had a real problem at this time. 

One day I came home and my mom was balling hysterically. Her face was red from where he had hit her. I went blind with rage. I pinned him up against a wall and I must have said some terrifying things to him because he went pale. 

I threw him to the floor next to my mother (she was curled up in a ball crying) I yelled at my mother calling her a worthless whore. I went to my bedroom and grabbed my 9mm. It was loaded. I aimed it at Tony’s face and I told him, “if you don’t leave right fucking now I’m probably going to kill you.” He looked like he was going to piss his pants. He left In a hurry and I never saw him again, but ever since then my life has been on a downhill spiral of failure, 

Every day I think about it. And I want him dead. I honestly would kill him if I saw him in the street. He told everyone in town that he fucked my mom and that I was a little bitch. He ruined my reputation, and dishonored my family. He disrespected my father. My mother spent thousands of dollars on him and now my family is broke. I want tony dead. I want to blow his brains out with my 9mm. I want to see it.

50,"I’m going to try and keep this short and sweet 

This summer, my roommate got a puppy (golden retriever). She’s the cutest thing to ever walk the earth. Him and his girlfriend would occasionally walk her and bring her to the beach while also training her. Since school started, both of them have been busy. Both have jobs as well as being students. As a result, their dog receives little physical activity. When my roommate comes home, he often wants to unwind and relax while finishing up homework. This is where we sort of differ.

If that were my dog, the first thing I’d do is take her for a walk. It wouldn’t really matter if I wanted to rest, I’d be capable of going for a 30 minute walk. It makes me sad to see this puppy lay around our small house day in and day out. 

I have very little free time as well, but I could for sure find AT LEAST 30 minutes to walk this dog. I wouldn’t mind doing it either. How could I go about doing this? Should I suggest walking her to my roommate when he’s home? Or should I just walk her quick when I’m alone at the house? My roommate is very defensive when it comes to talking about how he cares for his dog,  so I feel like directly asking him to walk the dog would piss him off. Not that I’ve ever question how he raises her, but I’ve pointed out before that she chews on our socks to get our attention because she’s lonely and he freaked out about it. But, also I don’t want to be secretive about walking her. I just want this damn dog to go outside and enjoy being a dog :( ",01Nov2018,1
51,"Ok so a good chunk of backstory with this one. I’m sophomore in college for those who want context.

Alright so I’m in an intro to programming class and there’s a guy in our class that is an acquaintance of a good friend of mine who is also in the class with me. Tbh, he annoys me a little, but I never try to be rude to him because he’s good guy for the most part and he isn’t hurting anyone. He’s always in my personal space, (not in a touching me kind of way, more of a always has his legs way spread out, and I’ve had to tell him on more than one occasion not to rest his elbow on my desk during lecture). He doesn’t retain a lot of the info taught by the professor and TAs. Me and the friend will have to tell him how to do a lab even though the TA told us how to go about doing it and he doesn’t even contribute to the process, he just waits for us to finish and then asks us questions. So this guy really gets on my nerves sometimes but I’ve never had a real problem with him, because he’s never been outright rude or anything, just lazy.

So here comes the problem. Today in lecture, our professor surprises us about the final. I mean we knew there was gonna be a final but we didn’t know much about until today when he explained it to us. It’s gonna be a group project and the groups need to be 3-5 people in size. The biggest surprise is if we don’t have a group decided up and emailed to our professor by Friday, we lose 10 points, which is like 1/5 of the project grade. So at the end of lecture the guy of course looks to me and my friend and says “I guess the three of us can form a group” and of course my friend agrees. I don’t wanna say no because then I’m an asshole. 

I really don’t want to work with this guy. I have two other final projects, three exams, and a portfolio to work on this semester, and I don’t want to add any more to my work load because he won’t do it or he won’t know how to do it. I talked to me friend about this after lecture and he actually agrees with me because he had him in a group last year and he said he never did his work. He says we can do something simple so it won’t be super difficult for us, but I don’t want us to limit ourselves either. We are in major where putting extra effort in our projects will more likely get us noticed and help us get internships. 

So we don’t know what to do. We don’t want to drop him and make him lose 20% of his final grade for not even doing anything yet, we just don’t wanna work with him. Any thoughts??",01Nov2018,1
52,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Before anyone mentions it in the comments, yes. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so I am away that a lot of what I am about to say stems from my mental illness. 

Second, I've tried therapy. It was pointless and only made my symptoms worse. Also, I can't afford it, so not an option. I'm just needing someone to hear me out.

1) I was told Monday that I had to do better at my job or I would not have a job at the end of the week. I work in a day care center. This has made my already super high anxiety levels even higher. It has also made the depression monster chime in and tell me that if I can't be guaranteed a job, there is no reason to even try. The problem is, I am doing my best with the limited experience I have. My boss always sees me at my most frustrated because the children either refuse to listen to me, or only listen when I'm ""mean"" (I am a very soft spoken and quiet person normally so any raise in my voice to be firm is seen as yelling). She nevers sees all tje good I do, like the art projects (despite the fact I put them on the walls), the fact that I'm teaching them their ABCs in ASL, that I'm teaching them numbers to 10 in Spanish as well as English. That I go ober animals, their sounds, Where they live, that I'm teaching colors, amd everything else In supposed to be doing. She doesn't see that these kids (15 months to 2 years) are beginning to recognize what their names looked like when written down. She doesn't see that they are comfortable with me to ask to use the potty, even when they don't at home. All she sees is me struggling because the children are tired and hungry and dont want to listen anymore. 

2) If I loose this job, I dont have many options. I can either work somewhere that wont hire me because I'm overquailfied (like fast food), have no experience (retail), or I'm underquailfied (need a bachelors for some, masters of higher for even more). I have run out of financial aide and literally cannot pay for tutiton out of pocket because I'm barely above the poverty line. I have no savings to speak of (many of bills leave me with little to no money left over at the end of the month). I live in a semi rural college town and college kids get hired over townies (because college kids are cheaper and can work part time, therefore saving employers money).

3) I feel like the only option I have is to move out of state and start over. I have no family where I am (except for a mother who choose an abusive boyfriend over me) and I'm an only child. Except, as said above, I'm so poor I can't afford a tent much less to move to another state. I am also in a six year relationship and my boyfriend likes where we live. Unlike me, he has a wider skill set that he can easily get a job anywhere (he is currently a tattoo artist and an awesome one at that). Plus, his family (which he has a much better relationship with) is here. Or most of his family anyway. 


I feel like my best isn't good enough for anyone. I work my ass off at everything I do and it isn't enough. I get shit on everywhere, by everyone. I don't belong or fit in anywhere. I have maybe one friend (outside my boyfriend) and no one else in my life. I am non-religious (atheist) so don't attend church. I hate bars, parties, and loud noises (I refuse to attend fireworks because I hate the noise. I don't know if I have PTSD but I might). I don't drink, smoke (cigarettes or weed, and don't plan too), and really don't enjoy being around people. I dont want to end up homeless again, and I don't want to be a burden on my boyfriend. 

TL;DR I feel as though everything I was told by people closest to me is true. My best isn't enough and I'm a worthless, useless, burden to society. ",01Nov2018,1
53,"Ok, so a bit of back story. 

My mother has been working in admin her entire life. She’s the definition of a workaholic (e.g. she went back to work when I was 4 days old). She has had two stress-induced heart attacks from working in high-pressure environments and has been out of work for 3 years. 

My mother has always loved cooking, saying it’s the time she feels the most at ease. She has now expressed that is has always been her dream to work with food and has spent the last 6 months trying to find a suitable cafe to purchase. She’s now found one and has spent everything she has on buying it. Luckily, we live in a small beach town so the startup costs &amp; pressures are lower than in the city. 

I’ve promised to help her in whatever way I can, including taking time off from my life to focus on starting the cafe with her. I have 7 years of hospitality experience and now work in digital marketing (I do plan on moving back to the city once everything is up and running because I hate working in hospo). 

My biggest fear in all of this is her biting off more than she can chew and going absolutely insane. She’s on anti-depressants but still snaps when people have different opinions or express their concern with anything she does. Mum has never worked in a fast-paced food environment before. 

My dad is 70 and does whatever he can to help and appease her, but his physical health issues prevent him from performing manual labour for longer than an hour. Mum cracks it at him constantly because she isn’t patient when he shows his age but she has an idea in her head that he will be doing the dishes out back in the cafe. 

I love my mother and believe she is the hardest working person I’ve ever met. So there is a part of me that thinks she could succeed; however, I worry that she doesn’t have a clear vision of what she wants this cafe to be like. (Her menu is confusing, she can’t decide on a name &amp; she’s got 100 opposing ideas for interior design). We take over the cafe in 3 weeks and she doesn’t want to close for even one day. 

So, I’d like some advice. How do I handle my mother’s outbursts while working with her? What are some stress-relieving tactics I can use when I see her spiralling? And, how do I offer opinions without seeming like I’m doubting her? ",01Nov2018,1

59,"As the title says, one of my wife's best friends that she's known for practically her entire life is dying.  He's diagnosed with kidney failure (they're operating at 25% according to doctors) and congenative heart failure as a result of untreated high blood pressure.  She found out about the kidney failure last night and the heart failure just a couple hours ago.

He's very closed off about this kind of thing, he's always been quiet about personal issues.  He's just a private person so she doesn't know if the doctors gave him a timeline or anything.  But a quick google search suggests there is no cure for either and a timeline for life left is probably very little, a couple years at the most if he took care of himself.  He's only 34 so this is a major shock for all of us.

But I just don't know what to say to her.  I've never lost anyone close to me so it's difficult for me to be empathetic or even imagine what I'd want to be told in this situation.  And at the risk of sounding sociopathic, I just don't know how to help someone experiencing an emotional issue.

60,"Note: I am 20 (m), I live with my parents.

For a while I have been parking in front of a neighbor's house on garbage night and when my sister is over and parks in the spot in front of my house that I usually park in. My house only has that one spot, which is physically shared with my next-door neighbor. I cannot park in the driveway because both my parents are parked in there and I would block them. I try to leave enough space behind me when I park in front of the neighbor's house but sometimes a car parked in front of me pushes me a bit back and probably results in not enough space.

Anyway, today I parked there and the neighbor's mom came out and confronted me about parking in front of their house. She said that morning they had no spot to put their garbage bins and that she couldn't park her car there because it would block the garage (amazingly, the same problem I have). She then told me it's common courtesy to not park in front of neighbor's houses.

I'm not interested in defending my parking, I am perfectly fine with not parking there. But I do have a problem with how rudely this lady confronted me. She could have politely informed me my parking was an inconvenience. Instead she said ""you just jockey it"" (whatever this means), and asked why I don't use my driveway or the space in front of it. When I explained that I park in front of their house on garbage days since my bins go where I usually park, she asked what day it was, I answered (today is Wednesday, garbage night is Tuesday), she then said, ""So not Tuesday"" (in a sassy tone). She also said, ""I never see any cars parked in the driveway"". I then went on to tell her, ""You said 'be considerate'. Then think about my situation too. I can't park on my driveway because my parents' cars are in the garage."" Lastly, she said, ""I never see you park \[in the street spot in front of your house\]."" To which I responded, ""Then I don't know what to say. I park there on the majority of days."" Then she went back inside her house saying, ""I need to go take care of my grandkids."" Throughout all of this I very clearly stated that I would gladly move my car elsewhere.

So, again, I have no problem with not parking in front of their house. However, given how rude the lady was, I don't want her to be able to just walk away at her whim. How should I respond from here? My current preferred plan is to talk to the parents tomorrow, clarify that I have no problem moving my car, and tell them that their mother was very rude to me. Hopefully they didn't know she would be so rude and will be bothered about it enough to talk to her.

61,"I’ll try to keep this as short as I can, if I could get advice on this it’d be much appreciated. I’m currently 17, almost 18. I’m having a tough time dealing with life. It’s nothing going on at home, as my parents have been great to me my entire life, but it’s mainly internal. For one, I’m lonely. I have friends, it’s mainly just a close group of friends, and I know they love me, but for some reason I feel like the odd man out constantly and I think it adds to my loneliness. I also have don’t have a girlfriend. I know I’m only 17, and people tell me I don’t need a girlfriend, and I know it’s true, but fuck it’d be nice to have someone to have around that likes you that’s more than a friend, someone who likes you for you. I’ve had a few girlfriends in the past but they never last more than 2/3 months. I don’t often meet girls outside of my school and even then I could come off slightly shy and awkward. Besides this, I have a number of insecurities, I don’t think I’m attractive, even though I’ve been told by a number of girls that I’m really good looking. I’m also constantly worrying about my body even though I’m slim and only 150 pounds, the gym is an everyday thing for me. 

I feel empty inside. If I’m not occupying my time with the few hobbies I have(photography, filmmaking, drawing), or hanging out with friends, I quickly start to feel lonely and empty. Reading and listening to music have also seemed to have helped. I know with winter coming soon, it’s going to be hard, as I don’t do too good emotionally in cold weather or sunsets at 3pm. School has also been tough for me, I’ve always been someone who’s intelligent, but just doesn’t apply myself. I’ve been able to float through high school with a decent grade. But with college applications and even my final grades coming soon, I feel like I’ve been dropping the ball as I’ve lately been having a tough time caring. I’m also tired(I know, it just gets worse), I’m often too tired to do things I like, like skating or hanging out with people, or filming.

I have a few questions about being safe about living arrangements with other people. How can I make sure I'm not being taken advantage of, prove that I have ownership of certain personal possessions (like second hand books, old electronics and things I've had since my parents bought me when I was about 14 years old or younger) and just make sure I'm being smart about relying on others in a housing situation? It's not exactly a roommate situation...maybe it is? It's hard to say.

I live in a suite— 4 bedrooms, three bathrooms. I share a room with T. K and C have their own bedrooms, and L and A share a room.

As school started, obviously our lives got really busy and we couldn’t see each-other much. 

C’s birthday is in early September. We all planned a surprise for her and it went great. Then it all went downhill. K and T are now best friends. T and I don’t get along really well. She’s very immature and irresponsible, and just plain inconsiderate. She’s disgusting. She leaves dirty dishes all over our room, until they get moldy. Leaves her **worn, dirty** panties all over the place. When we both had family headed down, I asked her to help me clean the bathroom. She stayed out until 3 AM, meaning I had to do it alone. She constantly uses my things without asking and it pisses me off to no end. She recently used my shaving cream and lied about it, to my face. 

My birthday is in mid-November. Nobody remembered, except C. She actually bought me a present really early and gave it to me. We’re great friends. I’m not upset about the presents. I don’t expect anything because we’re all broke college students. But I remember all of their birthdays and always make an effort with them.

They looked around, said “Is A here?”, called for her, and when she didn’t answer, they said “maybe we can find someone in the hall” and left. They could’ve asked me. They constantly act like they’re the only ones who exist and exclude everyone else. C and I feel the same way about it— like we’re on the outside looking in.

She said she couldn’t go home because she felt unsafe and her brother was “being mean”. She needed somewhere to go for the night. I hung with her for a bit, helped her call the police. While we waited I asked her about how school was going. We talked about some tough parts of high school and bullies and dealing with family and I told her how brave she was. She was shaking, so nervous. I told her about my sister who is a social worker.

She told the police she was 18 (I guess she got held back a grade). The police said they couldn’t do anything because she was not a minor and told her “you’re 18 you can do whatever you want”. She was literally petrified. So she had the choice of going back home, staying at the 7/11, going to hang out at the police station, and I also said she could sit in my living room and watch TV if she needed (I live around the corner).

She opted to go to the police as she “didn’t want to go home”. She was so scared. I had bought her a snack and a drink, so I handed it to her. Wrote down my name and number, if she ever needed help. She gave me a tearful hug and off she went.

A few hours later she texted me saying she was at a shelter. I said I was glad she was safe, and asked her if that’s where she wanted to be. She said she would have come to my house but she was too nervous to say so. She doesn’t want to be in this shelter she just wants to be away from her family, especially her brother. Who is 31, and lives with her along with a few other relatives.

-She could be in a truly terrible situation that I’m not equipped to deal with.

-Her family, or even her brother could catch wind of her contacting me and say “who is this stranger my ___ is talking to?” and then I could be seen as a dangerous person.

-She might misinterpret my invitation to be safe in my home for a few hours.

After-school’s about the only time we can actually be intimate with each other, it’s a one hour commute to her house via bus, and an hour commute back as well.

I’ve been basically walking her home every day now, I get home no later than 7:30 yet I’m being denied the right by my Dad to walk her home.

Am I in the wrong here?
Should I be a ‘good’ kid and listen to my Dad?

I’ve never rebelled against my parents, prior to dating my girlfriend I’ve basically never even left the house.

I’m considering rebelling against my Dad, what I’m wondering is should I? What’s the worst he can do?

75,"I have a friend that I’ve known for quite awhile who is heavily, heavily depressed and suicidal, and a lot of it has to do with her family. They’ve told me repeatedly about the sexual abuse they’ve suffered from their cousin and other family members, and about the fact that her parents deny her treatment and necessary help for depression and suicidal thoughts. In fact, her mother has repeatedly made fun of her self harming tendencies. I’ve repeatedly brought up the idea of getting the police involved, or calling CPS. She has denied for fear of it getting worse, but I personally can’t stand to see her suffer anymore and want to contact CPS. However, I have the feeling she’ll know it was me and it may ruin my relationship with her. Also? I don’t know her personally. The only way I know she isn’t lying is through her words, as well as the testimony of her boyfriend. I only know her online. I know the state she lives in and her first and last name, however I’m not sure where in the state. I’m not sure what evidence or information I need to go to CPS to get her removed from the home and to get her the resources and help she needs, and advice or help would be greatly appreciated. I’d be happy to respond to comments or DMs with any information or clarification needed.

76,"Last two times I spent money to fly to be with my family at Thanksgiving my brother in law who I can't stand invites my brother to the titty bar for a little family fun. This disgusts me. My brother is a family man and has zero titty bar history but feels intimidated by browsing in law and agrees.

My father in law doesn't go and my mom and me and sister in law are just mortified. We are church going folks.

The last one I went to the titty bar crud was followed by heavy drinking a family fight, crying, then my mom and I being thrown out of the condo we all paid for to rent. My 350 was not returned to me that I paid for the condo. I had to borrow 1200 from mom for a plane ticket home cause I was thrown out with no place to go by myself in a state and city I was not familiar with.

It took me forever to pay the 1200 back. I have a lot of resentments and have avoided holidays with my family ever since.

Tonight my mom calls and wants to know if I want to try again in the future. She is getting old and lives across the country. My gut feeling tells me no.

77,"Hi everyone!

I went to a mental hospital my freshman year and by the time I was 15 I dropped out of my high school (sophomore year). I then was homeschooled and went to college at 16. I’m 17 now and I’m completing my AA in psych (ironic right?) next semester and will be taking a full load of credits in both my community college and my 4 year as well (so like 30 something credits total), so I can graduate next spring w a BA in Psych and Philosophy. 

That being said, I completely feel like I fucked up. My friends are currently in senior year and get to see each other all the time and idk I really miss that. My high-school was amazing and I feel like being a depressed loser really fucked it up for me. College has been so different in that I actually have a good gpa, and I actually show up to class and do most of the work on time, but I remember so much shit from high school really fondly. Also community colleges are notorious for lacking a lot socially, but I’m not really out looking for friends so I guess I can’t really complain. 

Some of my friends hung out today for Halloween and it was really fun but after I got super depressed and just broke down in the shower. This is one of the last times we’ll be seeing each other before we all go away to college and yeah. 

Sorry this was a tangent, and I’m sorry if the grammar is super fucked up, I’m on mobile and I’m a dumbass. 

TLDR: I’m a depressed loser because my friends are seniors in high school and I regret not graduating with them because I was a dumbass and left for college at sophomore year. Should I talk with them about not seeing them or will I come off as super clingy?

82,"Hey guys, well here's my story. Two people (formerly I thought as my closest friends) went to the gym without me like twice, I confronted them and said I feel unwell and anxious when this type of thing happens, they apologized and promised they'll invite me next time. A week or so later one of them invited me over to have a sleepover, I was busy so I rejected the invitation. Since that, I haven't heard from them for the next five weeks, they made up excuses like ""Oh yeah I didn't pick up your call because I was at Newcastle and I left my phone at home."" And other elaborate lies, I believed every one of them because that, I was suspicious so I asked both of them am I doing anything that's annoying either of you? They responded with no or simply ignored me. Right before a 2-week holiday, someone gave me a heads up every week they've been making plans without me and speaking bad things about me, and it was all true. I completely broke down and couldn't think, I was very sad, I felt abandoned. Later I got to speak to one of them online and they said they did it because I was a hypocrite, liar and a bad person (some I admit is true). I explained to him what happened and he said he's really sorry and wouldn't do it again, the next week it happened again. Ever since it has gotten worse, even my holiday I felt like shit and was anxious the whole time, at one time I even felt like committing suicide. When it's back to school I came back to a wave of questions about me making up a girlfriend from China (which was true) and them plainly taking bad about me to almost everyone in my year. I had to change where I sat for lunch because I was scared of being judged by everyone. I constantly try to avoid them but when I see them I get so anxious my stomach hurts and I feel like vomiting. It's almost test week and for almost a month and a half I cannot focus on anything but what happened, I finally went to the doctor and I got diagnosed with anxiety, I was told to get therapy and if that doesn't work the medication will come in. I haven't felt calmness or even happiness for so long, later they sent me an email saying ""I'd kill myself too if my lies came back"" and also stating things that I told to others about what happened. It's 3 days to test week and I cannot focus on studying and all I feel is anxiety, I let go and I thought they would, I know I shouldn't expect to be invited but I still felt abandoned and felt like shit how they received no backlash from doing this and I'm in pain, what should I do?",01Nov2018,1
83,"I’ll make this as short as possible. Also on mobile, so sorry if formatting gets wonky. 

I grew up and lived most of my life in larger cities and had no issues. A few years ago I moved near to a small town, but up in the sticks. Loved it and had zero noise pollution. No planes, trains or automobiles. Recently moved to a new place in the sticks, still with no noise pollution. 


However, I have a washer and dryer in house, which I thought would be amazing. It’s been a couple of weeks and I cannot get used to the noise. It bothers me and puts me on edge. I don’t have cable, but do pop in a dvd every once in a while and I’m fine with that. I also work in a high traffic restaurant and that doesn’t bother me. Being out in public and doing normal things, I’m used to that. 

But, I cannot get comfortable to the washer and dryer. Is it something that I will eventually get used to, or should I start laundry when I’m on my way out the door? Should I try and get used to the noise? Also, I don’t have a dishwasher and I do find the refrigerator to be annoying as well.

So I'm a freshmen in College, and while of course that's rough enough already, moving away from home, learning how to study because I didn't really need to do that in High school (yay underachieving in a small town) and trying to curb my depression, some other things have been going on. My mom was diagnosed with cancer recently, and at first we thought it was just gonna require some \*light chemo\* (as if there is such a thing), it spread to a place that once you get cancer there, there's not a real big chance that it gets better.  I love my mom more than I love myself honestly, she's always been there for me and I'm an only child, recipe for a huge mama's boy. My dad and I talked about withdrawing from college in order to come back home to spend more time around my mom, I really love college life, but I feel like this is a priority, I don't want to be an hour away one day and I hear the bad news. I've made a lot of loving supportive friends in college, and getting out of this shitty small town has definitely been good for me, but I'm really just fucking scared. Would withdrawing from college due to a family emergency hurt my chance of ever going back there? Should I stay on for the spring semester and just come back on the weekends? I'm scared I'm going to fail a few classes already, and I don't know what the hell I should do. Finals are in about a month. I just need guidance, and unfortunately Cancer affects a lot of people.

85,"So, I'm 19 and am currently taking a breaker year from school. I own my own business and have a solid source of income, but my family/people around me pushed me to get a ""real"" job. I ended up finding one quick- a fairly shitty retail job close to home. They seemed very eager to hire me (when I went in for the interview they all knew my name already and the manager told me it was just a formality) which was cool, I guess, but now I know why it was like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little over a month into the job now, and have yet to see the hours I was promised (I'm not even meeting the hours I was promised weekly in two weeks. In fact, this pay period I had 7 hours.) They keep hiring more people, even though we're overstaffed and fighting for shifts as is (which is why they hired me so fast, they basically accept everyone.)Now, some new chick came in, and is now receiving all of the hours I was promised, meanwhile I've been cut. Also, I was scheduled like 3 days before a shift, and it wasn't updated on the schedule online, so I didn't find out until the day of, then of course I got in trouble for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, since I know this job is a massive waste of my time, I want to leave. I don't respect these people and just want to text/email my boss telling her I wont be coming back, however everyone is telling me that if I don't put in a 2 weeks notice that it'll follow me forever and potentially ruin future opportunities. While I doubt that it would, it does give me some anxiety, what if just leaving without a notice does actually affect me in a few years down the line?

We were both each other’s first for a lot of things and I can confidently say we had a pretty healthy/great relationship when we were together. She was practically my best friend. We tried doing long distance this year but after a few weeks in she ended it with me. She has a really busy schedule and simply didn’t have time to be in a relationship. It’s been about two months since the break up. During the break up she asked me to check in with her every once in a while but I didn’t for obvious reasons because I was pretty devastated from the break up. Now that some time has passed I truly don’t blame her at all because I know long distance isn’t easy. I’d say I’m over her but there times where I think about her and miss her. I question myself pretty often if I should reach out to her because I’m genuinely curious how she is doing. What should I do?,01Nov2018,1

95,"I have always been ""the nice girl,"" when people describe me it's ""oh, shes nice.""
Several months ago my marriage hit rough waters, I thought we could work it out, we have in the past. That was until 3 months ago when I found out my husband was cheating on me with his best friend of 12 years, I dont know how long the affair was going on, he wouldn't tell me. After i found out he told me he wanted to work on our marriage and I told him that for that to happen he needed to cut his ""friend"" out of his life. He didn't want that so we split up, we still see each other because we have kids together and because I'm staying with his parent's because I dont have any family in the state. I used to cry every night, fall asleep just to wake up crying, clutching my blankets because I dreamed about the moment I found out about the affair. It hurt so bad I felt like I was having small heart attacks, I lost 20 pounds in a month, I was a mess and torn to pieces.
Because this woman was his friend for so long she new he was married to me, she new our children and their names, she knew my name and knew where I worked. She felt no guilt, neither did he.
Recently a friend of mine was hired at a new job, it just so happened that the manager of the place she was now working at is the woman my (ex)husband was having an affair with and still seeing. My friend didn't know that her manager was the other woman. I dont think the manager knew that the new hire was my friend, but never the less she treated my friend horribly. My friend worked there for 2 days before quitting due to being harrassed by the manager, my (ex)husbands lover.
My friend now knows that her previous manager/harasser was the last straw that broke my marriage and because of how she treated her, my friend wants me to out this woman on a public forum called homewreckers exposed and write all of the dirt I know about the mistress, and post it so that my friends boyfriend can link it to mistresses work fb page for all to see.
This is where me always being ""nice"" comes in. The me I was before all of this happened wouldn't even consider doing this, but the me now kind of wants to. The only thing holding me back is my want to be who I was before this, and the fear of my ex discovering what I did and being very very angry with me.

97,"Here's some background info.  I live at home with my parents.  My nephew has been living with us also for most of his life.  My brother, his father, isn't exactly invested in this kid.  I love him like nothing else in the world, he's bright and kind and just the best damn kid anyone could hope for.  I've spent the last 7 years helping to raise and teach him.  I'm more a father figure in his eyes than an uncle, and my mother is more of a mother figure than a grandmother to him.  It's really a kind of messed up family dynamic, but my nephew is happy and healthy and what more could you ask for?  Well, here's the thing.  I'm an agnostic athiest.  I usually don't give a shit what anyone else believes so long as they're generally keeping it to themselves.  That's reasonable, right?  About a year ago, maybe a bit longer, my mother had started taking these bible study courses online.  She has never been a very religious person, at least not outwardly.  She never made me go to church or anything growing up.  Whatever, she's an adult, if that's what she wants to do with her time, go for it.  If it's helping her and making her happy, more power to her.  Recently she's been bringing my nephew to church once per week.  It started one night when she was going, he wanted to know where she was going and, well, he just wanted to spend time with her.  He doesn't care what it is that they're doing, he wanted to be with her.  She says the church has a gym and he love gym class so that's cool, let him go play.   Then she signs him up to go regularly with her.  I think it's just a daycare sort of thing because all I've ever heard was that it was going to play in the gym.  Over a couple weeks I'm hearing there's less and less gym and more and more bible study classes.  I've asked him if he likes the classes and he says he doesn't, but he likes the gym.  She gets furious when I bring it up and not only is making it clear that ""he's going because we paid for it and that's that,"" but in the same breath making me feel like some lesser-than-human being for not sharing her religious beliefs.

This is getting kind of scattered.  I absolutely do not agree with religion being pushed on kids.  I think childhood is such a sacred thing, something that should be held onto as long as possible.  No kid should be worrying about if they're going to hell.  I don't want him growing up as some young earth creationist.  I can't talk to anyone about this.  I can't even tiptoe near the subject with my mom, she just won't listen to anything I have to say on the matter.  I can't even put into words how strongly I feel about any of this.  It's keeping me up at night and making me sick to my stomach that this kid is being ruined.  I've always taught him to look at things objectively and to think critically about things.  Now here is, sitting in a classroom once per week, having scripture drilled into him, being taught to take everything in the bible as literal truth.  I just don't know what to do.  How would you feel if someone you love more than anything is being turned into something you vehemently disagree with and you're powerless to do anything about it and no one will listen?",01Nov2018,1
98,"My best friend and I (lets call her Jessica) have been friends since early high school. This year we both moved to a local university a couple hours away from our hometown. Prior to this, we talked or saw each other every day.

This story starts with my friend, Andrew, visiting us for a few days last week. Andrew is also friends with Jessica and we often hang out as a group, but they are not as close. While Andrew is visiting, the three of us decide to get lunch before Jessica and I have to go to class. The three of us are talking and joking around, and at some point Jessica starts acting a bit annoyed. We tend to make fun of each other a bit but neither of us are fully aware of what made her upset. It passes and Andrew goes to Jessicas dorm to wait until we both get out of class. My class ends earlier than usual, so Andrew tells me to come over (to Jessicas dorm). I'm hesitant because Jessica might be annoyed if I do without asking, so I FaceTime Andrew to make sure. The FaceTime call connects and I ask if its a good idea for me to come over because I think Jessica ""hates us"" (hyperbole) . Turns out she's in the room. Oops. This also passes relatively quickly and nobody seems mad, so I go over to Jessicas. While we're there, Jessica starts telling us about this mystery of a young girl who got murdered. I tell them that I find it strange and kind of invasive to discuss someone else tragedy for entertainment (especially as I have had immediate family members untimely die in the past). Jessica is offended by this and we (fairly calmly) argue about it for a minute. After this, Jessica is not talking as much and clearly mad until she kicks us out and she goes to her next class. As we were walking out, she made a point to only say bye to Andrew. This was last Wednesday and she hasn't talked to me since. I texted her over the weekend (as to give her a few days but still reach out) but got nothing in reply. What should I do? I'm not sure what the best course of action is.

We were told to have one person close their eyes while the other guides them while telling each-other 3 things about ourselves. Her words came out immediately and so smoothly. When I spoke, NO sound came out. The 2nd time I tried, it sounded like I wasn't even speaking english. When I speak to new people my accent vanishes because my area has a really aggressive accent but this time it was literally like I forgot how to speak english. 

We then had to produce a small scene with certain lines as the start in the pairs we were in and she was just amazing at acting, I completely let her down. I feel like a failure for even showing up today.

We then got grouped into 5's and had to make a scene up and I froze so badly that I just forgot everything and fucked everything up. I couldn't get the words outta me and my accent just disappeared completely. It was like I went from myself to an empty human test dummy.

Later on after that a friend hit me up on the phone to tell me he was too sick to meet me. Later on I see someone at an ATM that looked like him and my friend yells his name. No reply. We then call his phone and sure enough his phone lights up in his hand which proves that it was him. What did I even do wrong to be lied to.

We have been on and off for the past couple years, as friends. The last time we had a serious argument was on February 14th,  Valentine’s Day. I was going to ask her out with some chocolate and a stuffed animal. I never actually got the chance to ask her, I was left crying. 

Now things have changed. We are both single, and well, I want to ask her. We never get to hang out due to her doing sports and me being in clubs. 

I have planned “perfect” ways before of asking her out. Like today, but of course, on the field trip, we had to be in groups of 3 or more. That screwed me over with asking her out at lunch.

102,"Around seven months ago I’ve made one of the dumbest decisions of my life: I cut off my best friend of five years. Let’s call him Micheal. I realized I had feelings for Micheal seven months ago and I decided to push him away. Micheal has tried many times to fix whatever happened without asking me but I kept pushing him away. 
Anyways, I told all my friends about my feelings for him because they were all friends with him too. This one particular friend of mine, let’s call her Bin got really close with him over the Summer. I still like Micheal and I was decided I was going to fix things with him the minute we go back to school. However, Bin has been a cockblock and Micheal probably grew tired of my ways. Bin begs Micheal to “befriend” me again via text message causing Micheal to ask questions. Bin has always been a weirdo and in the past had bad mouthed several close friends and pretended to be socially aware. Micheal kept asking my younger sister questions about me as he grew suspicious of why I was acting the way I did seven months ago. He’s very vocal of me acting weird, he did mention it one time we were at a party during the summer why I had been acting weird but I disregarded it. So I was suspicious of Bin and Micheal. I told one of my friends about them dating and she goes and tells Bin. Bin lashes out and demonizes me and Micheal still doesn’t know (he’s probably caught on or Bin told him) the full story. Micheal decided to approach me two weeks ago but I cussed him out because I was hurt about everything and I tell him about him and his fucking girl friend talking shit about me.

I like the dog and play with it, but since my roommate doesn’t play it, the dog is *always* following me and wanting to play. He scratches on my door, he whines constantly whenever he’s alone (or even when I’m in the bathroom), and begs me for food. I can tell it doesn’t get fed enough.

However, he ejaculated and i wiped it afterwards and we did rubbing after that. I'm not sure if there was really no sperm left in his and i'm worried about pre-cum.15 hours later (October 27, 2018 at 9AM), i took ecp (4 pills of it) and another 4 pills 12 hours later. I vomited 4 hours after taking the second dose so i took 4 pills again. On October 28, 2018 i had a discharge which is similar to the consistency of raw egg white (so i assumed that i took ecp the day before my ovulation and most sources in the websites claim that ecp is less effective when taken during your fertile window). On October 29, 2018 i had a discharge again but it is already creamy. For now, i haven't had any discharge. As for the side effects, I only experienced vomiting and mild fatigue. It's been 5 days since i took the ecp and i'm currently waiting for my withdrawal bleeding. What if i don't experience withdrawal bleeding? does it mean that the ecp wasn't effective for me? also, am i likely to get pregnant with my situation? I'm really worried. ",01Nov2018,1

107,"This is a long story as it has been going on for years. I'll try to answer any questions in the comments in the event that I left something out.

&amp;#x200B;

I have known my friend (I'll call her A) since middle school. We are very close and A has always struggled to make herself happy. I'm no psychologist, but she seems to struggle with some pretty serious anxiety and possibly depression. Her sister (we'll call her B) is dangerously mentally ill and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder among other things. B has failed out of college, been subject to restraining orders from former friends, run away from home for days at a time, and has almost attempted suicide. B now spends her time living with her parents drinking and watching TV. A is also living with her parents while she saves up money for school and has had an incredibly hard time dealing with B. A regularly texts my friends and I about how B makes her life a living hell, and has even made comments about death along the lines of ""sometimes she just makes me wish I could die"". I have talked to A about getting B professional help, but apparently they have already tried. B is convinced that everyone in her life is abusive towards her and trying to tear her down. B apparently even convinced a therapist that this was the case even though her parents had given their concerns to said therapist (seems like bad practice to me). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very concerned for A because she doesn't seem to have a way to leave the situation (I currently live across the country or I would offer to be more help). Is there something that can be done to deal with B's serious mental issues? If not, is there anything I can do to help A cope with the situation? I have never dealt with mental health issues myself before, so I am a little lost as to how to help someone else. ",01Nov2018,1

109,"So recently I left my job just because it was overall a negative environment for me, and if I stayed for much longer it would only get worse and I'd probably lose my mind. I had a some money saved up so I wasn't super nervous about being unemployed while looking for something else. However, I have recently come to a crossroads and could use some advice on which path I should take. 

So I've been having the typical experience of job hunting and not hearing anything back, but I have a high chance of landing this one job in particular. It'd be in the same area where I've worked before, pay would be a bit better, and overall would be a more relaxed and enjoyable work environment. I speak with another person on Friday for another interview, but I pretty much have it in the back since I know the person trying to fill the position from working with them before. 

Today though I got a message from my cousin, who owns/runs a few locations of a certain kind of franchised food provider. He's offered me a chance to get involved a bit and help work in/run one of the locations that is under performing a bit. However, this is about 3 states away, which I'm open to moving to. We can discuss pay a bit, but it wouldn't have benefits.

So I'm torn whether I should stay or if I should go. It'd be in a city I have never been to, which would be exciting. However, if the location doesn't turn around he may not renew his lease on it when it's up. Would it be worth it to go down there anyways and at least do what I can and then if things don't work out just try to find something else down there? I don't know if I'm just overthinking everything, so it'd be nice to have some fresh perspectives. Thanks!",01Nov2018,1

114,"So a little background, I am 18 and have graduated. I’ve had a rough life but certainly not the worse. I’ve been living on my own since 15 because just the family fell apart and next thing I know I was the only one still living in my (family’s) house and when I finally got out of all the shit when I was 17 and started doing well living with some room mates I lost my amazing job. 

I had to move out because I didn’t have any rent. Now I moved in with my friend probably around 4-5 months ago. I stay on his top bunk and most of my belongings are in the basement. I feel terrible imposing on everyone but they are mostly welcoming and I try my best to keep everyone happy and do my part at the house.

I used to smoke cannabis everyday but I decided my only option was the Air Force with no support, no insurance of any kind, no car and my community college said my FASFA wasn’t valid because I didn’t have any parent info that’s what I thought was best. 

Now I’ve been in the process and I still am in the process of joining but they need me to do a lot (which is possible but takes time and some of it money)

Meanwhile, I stopped smoking for the drug test as soon as I moved in. Now here I am 4-5 months later and a friend offered me to hang the other week and we ended up smoking. Which I have now done multiple times since that day. 

And while that’s happening my community college sends me a email that something may not have been right and they may be able to help me enroll with FASFA and all.

So now I see two options with each having many complications and as well one that I really prefer.





So this all leads me here. Air Force or College.

I can not currently pass a drug test and honestly I never wanted to go into the military. I just saw it as my one and only option. A option I never wanted but all I had at the time.  Obviously it’s still a big option with lots of benefits if taken.
Complications: 

Time and money for some appointments and other things that MEPS need me to do.

My drug test would take me awhile to get clean for and I don’t know how long I might have here. It may be in my head but I feel like so much pressure has been building.





On the other hand I have community college. I’ve always dreamed of going to college I really love the whole idea I went to campus and took a tour and loved all of it. A great option as well (and preferred) but here are the complications:

My current place doesn’t seem like they want me here much longer and expect me to go to the military and know nothing of this situation. So I probably would need a place to stay.

A car to get to college or just some way to get there.

Maybe some other things I haven’t realized yet.




What the balls am I supposed to do here? I feel so trapped and like my option has to be the military. I’m afraid I’ll get in and hate it and just have to do it.  Any and all advice is appreciated and if someone is/may have been in this same situation please DM me. Thank you for all reply’s. For someone to take time to help me really means a lot.

115,"So my cousin-in-law and his fiance are getting married next weekend and I've been invited to it. We all used to hang out pretty regularly and work out at the gym together, but ever since he became a cop and they had a kid, haven't seen them in quite a while. Understandable given they live pretty far away as well.

Long story short, I got a text message the other day from my cousin in law's fiance asking about the RSVP they had sent me, but it had completely slipped my mind to send it back, so I confirmed with them I would be attending just to make sure their counts were accurate. I found their wedding registry online with both Amazon and Wayfair. but Amazon ships directly to my address and I send it to them and bring it to the wedding, while Wayfair has it directly ship to them. So I respond back via text message asking whether or not they would like me to bring my gift to the wedding or send it to them. I've gotten no response. This also isn't the first time I've sent her a message while she fails to respond. My cousin-in-law isn't really proactive and reaching out either it seems.

So I'm sitting here figuring that if they can't even reply to me given I want to make sure I follow proper etiquette for sending gifts, should I even go to the damn thing? I'll probably piss them off (well definitely, given the caterers and all that shit), but I feel if you can't send me a text reply that takes 15 seconds at most, you really just want another person attending your wedding.",01Nov2018,1
116,"So I'm torn between a few choices I have. Part of me wants to go back to college and get a CS degree. Another part of me wants to get a full time job and get IT certifications. I also want to pursue a career of conflict resolution...

  
Background:  
I'm 27 years old. I live in the Chicagoland area. I have an associates degree. I have two IT certifications already but my job offers are only about 40k or less currently. A few years ago I went for two semesters at a four year university and both times ended up dropping my classes. The first time I lost motivation. I just felt like my heart wasn't in it. I tried again the next semester and I decided that I was going to stay on campus and get a part time job to pay for it but I didn't get a job in time and ran out of money. I didn't eat on the weekends as my meal plan only covered mon-fri and things went south from there. I ended up dropping out. During my time at the university, I contemplated suicide and came very close to attempting it. After the university I moved back in with my mom. I decided to take a part time job and study for IT certifications. After a year and a half I finally got around to taking an exam and got my first IT certification and got contacted by a recruiter who offered me my first IT position. This job was in a call center. There were times where I was enjoying the job. I would try to crack some jokes with the users but eventually things become less fun and I ended up dreading it. I think it was the combination of being in front of a computer all day and then going home and studying for more certifications that stimulated this dread. That and the angry customers as well as the volume of calls each day. Maybe I was needing something more fun to do with my time after work. Anyway, after a year  working there I no longer wanted to deal with the dread I was feeling and ended up putting in my two weeks notice. So here I am now trying to decide what the hell to do with my life. I'm currently studying for my third IT certification. I think this path might be okay for me. I figure if I get my Cisco certs, I'll be making 60k+ a year which is pretty exciting as I've always have been poor and have rarely ever had a bedroom. I guess I'm sad that I had put in that energy to get an associates and I didn't follow through in getting my bachelors. I'm tempted to go back and try it again but I have a lot of fear that I'll end up miserable again and dropping out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live with my brother and mom. Both are on disability for depression. My father committed suicide when I was a little kid. Life has been pretty painful growing up and this has pushed me towards wanting to do something related to caring for people who are going through deep emotional pain. Several years ago, I learned about Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication and I found it so compelling. It's essential a process for conflict resolution and it's inspired me even more so towards wanting to help people. So maybe going back to school for something related to that would give me more energy than anything IT or computer science related. I'm open to any advice and thanks for reading.",01Nov2018,1

119,"I’ll start off by saying I think I’m a good person: I have good grades, do chores, try to help around the house.

Parents think I’m a waste of space, not who I was taught to be, and have called me every name in the book. They don’t understand I want “me” time, and often times I’ll be forced to listen to them rant and ask for my detailed opinions on everything that sally fucking did at work WHILE trying to succeed in school.

Add that to deciding it’s a good idea to do these during the week (regularly)
Vacuum everything
Sweep the floors and wipe them clean
Move the dining table
Go shopping 
Give the pets showers
Gardening

My favorite is when we’re out the whole afternoon until 7pm, get home, and try to finish my work in 1 hr because of the 8:30pm bedtime (fucking ridiculous).

They also will do anything possible to (I think) piss me off or get me to have an reaction, so they can vent their anger by punishing me.

Worst of all is that they blame me for stopping their divorce. I’m constantly reminded that I was the first baby they kept after they aborted 3 others, and it makes me wish I was aborted as well.


They want me to apply to college and take the SAT, but provide NO help when I ask for it, and only critique with no advice ever. I looked into the difference between UC’s and CSU’s and all I got from them was “everyone knows this, and you should’ve done this 2 years ago” (I’m 16)",01Nov2018,1
120,"I’m currently in High school, and it’s been rough recently, because no one is direct with me or would want to initiate a conversation with me. I used to be the person that was invited to every event and was loved by a lot of people. I go to a fairly small school with only 100 people in my class, and there a set of guys and girls I’m friends with. Im very confident and outgoing and a very big extrovert, and it’s always been that way, that’s why people became friends with me in the first place. To the guys at my school, I’m a little different because I don’t play football and I’m not a goofball who makes dumb decisions. I’m pretty mature and smart when it comes to decisions, I’ve been called an old soul, and I give advice to people a lot. 

The problem is though, recently I have seen a shift in how I am treated. I only talk to someone if I start the conversation. Jokes I have with people are the same recurring jokes from 6 months ago. I feel weird when I walk away from conversations. No one really tries to talk to me, and it’s very rare someone seems genuinely happy talking to me. I never get invited to things anymore, and It has been very hard.

So I have tried a number of things. I tried really looking at myself and how I respond to people, and seeing if anything needs to be changed. I try to tone it down with how emotionally active I am. I know now not to barge Into conversations and try to force myself to get noticed. I could list 100+ ways I have tried to fix this and it’s been the same. I just want a solution, because I miss being able to call a friend without thinking they are lying about being happy to talk to me. I miss being able to know It will be easy to have plans Saturday.

Let’s say I do come home at 3:00 they get mad at me for playing video games when I have literally nothing to do. They get mad over simple things and household rules.

122,"Long story so I apologize. 

I’m 33 and I dropped out of college at 20 because I figured I was wasting my time - I didn’t have any area to study and was bored every day. I’ve always been able to find work but it has never been work I wanted to do. I’m relatively smart and funny and good looking but believe it or not “relatively good looking and a 3.5 high school GPA” doesn’t go very far on a résumé. 

Fast forward a couple of years and I was drinking too much one night and had a seizure. I now take medicine for them and while I haven’t had any in a while, the history is enough to eliminate me from a lot of jobs that I wanted as a kid (fire, military, being a pro bowl NFL quarterback). 

I got married a few years ago and had a decent job but I traveled out of state a lot. Like 275 days a year not at home. So my wife and I decided to quit that job. That was a bad idea. Last year my wife and I got divorced for a few reasons - not having the incoming money we were used to being one of them. It also wrecked my credit score because we had just bought a bunch of things on credit (like married couples tend to do) and I had to stop paying them/sell them back at a lose because neither of us could afford them. 

I took a job at a fast food place and quickly got promoted to General Manager. The first store I was at was fine, but I was in the process of getting divorced and wanted to get away. So I did. I packed up my shit and moved 15 hours away. I took the same job in a new state however at my new job I needed to work about 80-100 hours a week to keep my restaurant from collapsing. My body basically shut down and I stepped down to a smaller role (in a vacuum that’s a good decision). However I make jack shit for money and I have a car and rent to pay that combines for about 75% of my monthly pay now. I can probably take the GM job again but it’s so stressful that I lost about 40 pounds in 4 months - my clothes were literally falling off my body and everyone I worked with told me I looked sick - and I have no long term goal to make the stress and hours worth it. 

I’ve gotten one phone call for a job interview in 2 months and it was for even less money than I make now. My résumé, no matter how many people offer advice on it, still looks like someone who can’t hold a job or finish anything - and there’s unfortunately a lot of truth to the latter. I have applied all over, all the time. From construction to receptionist to legal work to being a boat crewman. I almost never hear back from anyone. My previous job is very niche and there aren’t many opportunities available where that work translates, except for a few jobs that require a degree (I worked my way up and got a job that usually requires a degree). 

I have no real world marketable skills. I’m funny but not comedian funny. I’m smart but I can’t finish school. I’m attractive but more in the generally pleasing to look at kind of way rather than sexy. I think my ex wife is the only person to ever call me sexy. So even l if I felt comfortable taking pictures of myself, nobody is paying for them. I’m handy but not fix your broken house handy. I couldn’t correctly identify a car part beyond the steering wheel. I’m nice and kind of charming but I don’t have any salesman in me. I tried it before and I feel like I’m taking advantage of people (no offense to any salespeople, it’s just how I felt doing it). In a college communication class I gave a presentation on how to enter and exit a highway in your car because I couldn’t think of anything that I honestly thought I was good at. 

I still at this age have no idea what I want to do. You know that scene in Office Space where it’s like what would you do with a million dollars? Or when your guidance counselor said what do you want to do with your life? I would do nothing. I’m passionate about nothing partly because I’m so very obviously depressed but also because I just am not a passionate person. I’ve never been outstanding at anything and I’ve always been jealous of people who had an idea of what they wanted to be when they grew up. 

Long story short, my rent and car payment are going to bankrupt me this month. All of the jobs that I know I can do require a degree that I don’t have. All of the jobs that I can get hired at pay me less than I make now and I have not one single trade school skill. I don’t drink anymore (except for occasional events) or smoke or do any drugs so it’s not like I can try to save money by quitting. 

I could probably move in with my cousin 5 hours away, but I’d still be in the same general situation of needing a job with an application that would have 3 jobs in 3 years in 2 different states from where I would be applying. 

I feel completely lost and alone. Does anyone have any ideas for jobs or life in general?

PS I know it kind of looks like it, and it’s taboo to bring it up without the person mentioning it first, but I’m not going to kill myself so don’t worry. I will crash with my cousin if I can’t figure this out.

128,"I'm in my mid 30's, female, currently living in Large City on the West Coast. About 20 years ago, I met a guy in high school. We dated for awhile but he broke up with me then because he was questioning his sexuality at the time. We stayed friends, and then briefly got back together in college. However, in college, he was diagnosed with a rare, terminal illness and given about a 10 year time span. I knew at the time that I didn't know how to be a partner to a person that sick, and I had just gotten a private scholarship to go to art school in a different city. Because he'd always be sick, there was no way he would be able to come with me or live away from home town. We broke up again and stayed friends again. Since then, he has publicly mostly defined himself as a gay man because being bi and trying to date is super difficult.   


He has never not been sick. He is up for an organ transplant that could save his life and allow him to live a normal life for the first time ever, or he could just die. But because of the way organ transplants work, he has to get really sick before he's up for the transplant. So I'm leaving Large City and moving back in with my parents in Small Town 2000 miles away indefinitely so that I can be there. (there are other factors too. I'm getting burned out on Large City, i'm getting a lot of great, fun work but it's not consistent enough to give me a decent quality of life, and I'm really really sick of dating and the social scene in Large City. Plus my parents are pretty spry these days but they are old and we get along pretty well, especially now that Trump is fucking up so bad publicly that they've jumped ship on that, and I haven't been able to spend as much time with them as I'd like. They are really fun and sweet, especially since we're all adults now. Plus they're retired and need help cleaning out their house.) Friend and I have  established that we are still very much into each other from a romantic and emotional companionship perspective.   


In the past couple of years, I have had two ex-boyfriends die in really tragic and traumatic circumstances. They weren't even ones I still talked to, and it was horrible. So I can't just stay here and keep living my life, this person is important to me and if they do die, if I'm out here it will feel like a huge hole, but if I'm present and get to spend time with them before hand, it will hurt less. Also, he might live and be healthy for the very first time ever, and it would be so wonderful to be there for that even if it is difficult.   


This is a lot to handle. I'm not the most ""together"" person, but I have a few really, REALLY solid friends in my home town/state who are down to be emotionally supportive, plus my parents are also very emotionally supportive. I know this is a lot to take on and a really big choice to make. Especially since my career is centered around Large City. In Large City, I get a decent quantity of gigs as a freelancer but life is so difficult that I rarely have time to work on the things I'd personally really like to. (My career is art fabrication focused.)  However, even though there are LESS jobs in my industry in my home town, there is a specific niche market that I deal with that is very, very in demand where I'm from, so it might take a little longer to get a job or work out my own business but eventually I'd be able to keep doing what I enjoy in a more self directed way, but with a lot less prestige. But, because of my experiences in Large City, I'd pretty much be one of the ""biggest dogs"" metaphorically speaking in my home state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'd just like to hear some advice on how to handle this in a healthy way. I'm not sure what to do to prepare myself for spending a lot of time with someone who's very disabled functionally and helping them out with stuff. I'm pretty scared about the actual physical reality of moving all my stuff 2000 miles. I'm wary about living with my parents after living on my own since I was 18. I'm afraid everyone in Large City will think I'm a failure, because when you live and work in Large City and you're from The Midwest, people always expect you to give up and go home because it's too hard, but that's not what's happening here, but I still feel like it's what people will think.   


I guess I just need some support and advice. Has anyone here had a loved one who needed a major organ transplant? How did it go? What was the whole process like? What should I expect? I have to be the strong person now, but I worry I can't be because I haven't made any real money and am living hand to mouth, so I feel like that makes me too much of a loser to take this on, but the guy really truly cares about me as much as I do him, and I'm probably one of the only people he'd let get that close when he's that vulnerable. And I want to be there for him, and if it's our last few months/year together, I just want to spend it with him so if he's gone I can at least have some happy memory times to get me through instead of him just fading into the background of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice please.

129,"Hey everyone, in short my whole life I have had girl friends, some close and some not so close but the hard thing is I seem to be their friend until someone/something better comes along. I have a pretty bubbly and excitable personality but I can’t seem to ever find a friend that likes the same things I do or wants to do the same things I do or have a similar personality, eg: being bubbly and energetic and spontaneous or someone who loves going dancing! I love town and dancing not so much the alcohol or drinking but the night life environment. The freedom of having a fun time and not worrying about every little thing. I am in a long term committed relationship of 9 years and my partner has been through it all With me and he’s best guess is that people don’t always  get me and cant handle me or want to do what I like, which is understandable but what I don’t get is why they will be (for lack of better wording) BFF’s with me one day and then not be able to make time for me the next. And when I try and plan things ahead of time they make up excuses but then I’ll see on Social media they are out with other friends. It makes me feel replaceable. And I’m not unrealistic we all have our own lives and we can’t always be doing things together all the time but it’s like when someone new comes along they don’t have any time for me. Now this has been a consistent occurrence my whole life! 

Basically I’m wanting to know if there’s like a tinder for friends?? Because after all my experiences I really wish I could find a friend like me that wanted to actually experience the world and have fun!! Because let’s face it there are certain things that you want to go and do with friends rather then always being with your partner.

The last few years have been so rough. Everything emotional and financial is just piling up and it doesn't seem like it will ever ease. 

A few years ago me and my husband were in a good place to take over the mortgage on a house my mom owns, plus buy a new car. We even had a baby and were doing great. Since then we've had medical bills pile up because of insurance, we've had the irs come and let us know one year of taxes weren't filed correctly so we now have a monthly payment to them. We missed a few house payments and had to pull from my husband's retirement to stop foreclosure. We're nearly at that point again. I just can't do it anymore. I've been expressing this to him and my mom for months. I want to sell the house and find something more in our budget. Neither of them seem to take my pleas for help seriously. It's always we'll talk about it later, I'll pull some overtime. I've gotten to the point of feeling like just letting the house go and letting my mom deal with it. But I can't do that to my own mom. I've gotten so depressed I wouldn't be upset if we just had a house fire and it was gone. I really have no idea where to turn or what my next step should be. ",01Nov2018,1
133,"Hi!

So I've been seeing someone for a little more than a year and a half, and I just dont think I can do it anymore.


We had met at classmates in college and became best friends very quickly and carpooled to every class as we lived within 5 minutes of each other. About a year into college, were having a study session in her apartment and take a break as I tell her I'm having a hard time coping with a lot of personal things. She responded by getting on my lap and kissing me and basically telling me to have sex. I push her off initially, but she keeps trying. I'm an extremely nice person and was afraid of losing my best friend if I rejected her (I know, 100% not an excuse, just explaining my logic in the moment). I figured it was a one time thing and itd be done, wed both feel guilty, slowly drift apart out of awkwardness, and thatd be the end of it, but at least I'd have a little bit of time to deal with the loss of a friend before we cut each other off.


Wrong, she proceeded kissing me and calling me her boyfriend every day for the following weeks when we were in private, and texting me about how excited she is to be in a relationship with me at this point. She treated me so well and eventually told me how much she loved me. There was also occasional sex (I still somehow convinced myself that I'm not ready to lose a best friend and that wed both drift apart soon).


After a while she started saying that she loves me so much and that shell marry me. I know thats like typical shit you see on TV, but I know shes serious. 


Her relationship with her husband has been falling apart for a while, theyve been planning on getting divorced at some point anyways. I'm not going to say hes a bad husband, but hes not exactly a good one either, and they're ideas of a good and healthy relationship are completely different. She married him because they were young and her parents pushed her to do it even though she originally planned on breaking up with him. They also have 2 kids just to throw that in, both below 5 years old.


So now, fast forward a year and a half later, and I'm at my predicament. She says shell break up with him when I propose to her (she needs financial stability, but hes much more stable than I am or ever will be so I know shes not after my money). However, I'm just not ready for that. I know she loves me way more than I currently love her, and I'm not ready at 1.5 years. 


I also just dont think I have the balls to basically tear apart their family with my proposal, and I just feel guilty in general over the whole thing. Whenever I talk about how guilty I feel, she responds with ""well how do you think I feel? But I love you and that's what matters more to me right now"". 


I feel awful about breaking up with her because of how well she treats me, how much she obviously loves me, and how I know we couldve been happy together if she didnt marry him and have two kids with him. And I do currently love her (I fell in love after a few months), just not nearly as much as she loves me. I know theres the whole ""you havent seen her at her worst since you're the one shes cheating with"", but I can guarantee I have. The kids dont even bother me as I love kids, the issue is I dont agree with how the father raises the kids and I dont want that kind of influence with kids that I raise. 


I'm currently in my mid 20s and shes in her early 30s, and I think it's time to call it quits. As much as it sucks and I dont want to break up with her, I want to live my life and not be trapped by this guilt for the rest of my life. 


Heres a kind of random pros and cons thing about the whole thing if it matters to you:


Pros: treats me better than any ex I've ever had (and maybe will ever have), planning on getting divorced soon anyways, amazing kids that I love, loves me more than any woman ever might, shares a lot of the same relationship values and long term goals as I do.


Cons: currently married, absolutely hate how the husband raises their kids (plan on having joint custody), guilt, literally started our relationship through cheating, 8 year age difference (not a huge deal normally, but definitely messes up some long term plans I want to do in my life), gets jealous extremely easily and is pretty clingy, has no similar interests as me at all whatsoever.


Please, I need help on how to approach this. I've never hurt someone like this (again, I'm considered like the nicest guy), but I need to stand up for myself. I've broken up with girls before, but the woman never cared about me this much. 


TL;DR: in a relationship with a married woman for 1.5 years, we both love each other but guilt and the husband keep me from wanting to pursue it. Need advice on how to properly end it.",01Nov2018,1
134,"Hi guys. Hope you guys can give me some good advice.

First some background. I'm a 16 year old boy living in South Africa. I'm born in Pakistan but I have a South African permanent residence permit. I'm a closet Atheist, living in a Muslim household.

My parents have been really abusive emotionally throughout my life, and physically when I was younger ( they have stopped beating me now, but the emotional abuse has intensified).

Firstly, I have been homeschooled my entire life. I have no social life and no friends because I'm not allowed to 'socialize with those non Muslims'. I'm basically shut in the house the whole week.
Not only that, but I am very behind academically as well. I know basic English and basic math but I only know like Grade 6 stuff. 

Then, since the age of 10 I have been forced to work in my father's office. Basically he laid off some staff and used his 10 year old son to save on staff costs. These days he has like 4 different things he's doing and I'm supposed to handle all of their accounts, supervise staff on all 4 divisions, etc. To make matters worse, I'm not being paid a cent. I'm doing all of this for free.

Now, my parents are saying that I must write my A-levels, for which I have no preparation.

My parents have also made it clear that they don't want to support me anymore and that I'm supposed to start earning my own money somehow. Yet at the same time I must study several years worth for my A-levels and do my father's office work as well. 

Every weekend I am given this huge (2 - 3 hour) lecture about how I'm lazy, unproductive, a waste because I haven't started earning yet. I'm only 16 FFS!

The toll this is having on my is severe. I have suicidal thoughts fairly often, I have already planned mine, and suffer from sleep paralysis which involves my parents giving me their usual crap about not earning and what not. 

Then there is the religion part. If my parents found out that I'm actually an atheist, I'm certain they would kill me or severely torture me. They are the extremist type.

I don't have any personal freedom either. I'm not allowed to listen to music, my internet is heavily monitored (I'm writing this in secret) and I'm not allowed to lock my room either. My parents can barge in whenever they want.

My only option is to escape from this country altogether. My dad is extremely well connected with the national police and if he finds out that I reported him or that I'm hiding somewhere else in the country, I'm going to suffer pretty badly. 

I need your guys advice, what should I do? Its worth noting that the house at night is like a prison. No way in hell can I escape at night. My only escape plan is to sneak away while going to Mosque.

Is there any country who's embassy I can go to and they can help me? The only one coming to my mind is Australia. 

Keep in mind that once I escape, I have escaped for good. There is absolutely no way I can return back to my house. I understand it's a gamble that I'm taking, which is why I'm asking here.

Please guys I need your advice desperately. I need to get out of here ASAP for the sake of my own health. ",01Nov2018,1

136,"Hi. 19F, never been in a relationship before.

I’ve been talking to a guy from tinder, he seems pretty interested and he’s cute, but I have horrible trust issues and crippling anxiety regarding going on a date with someone.


I’m not used to affection, physical touch (I also have weird sensory issues) and if I think about going on a date or meeting someone in person I begin to have this crippling, physical wave of fear wash over my body where it’s all I can think of, my IBS flares up, my anxiety shoots through the roof, I can’t concentrate, I can’t sleep, etc. 


I’m generally just a mess.


He’s also sort of implying sleeping together which I’m not comfortable with right now if we were to go forward with anything. He’s being subtle but in a “I’m not trying very hard to be subtle” kind of way. Not that he’s unattractive or a sexual relationship isn’t something I’m interested but I’m just not comfortable enough or in the right mind set to handle it right now.


How do I deal with this? It tends to take over my life and before I’ve ghosted people as a result of my mental health. I feel bad about it but usually it could also be attributed to just a general disinterest in the person as well (conversations are hard with strangers online), and my horrible self image. I’m just not sure how to handle it.


Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

I got myself (35M) into a bad situation lately and started seeing a girl (27F) who turned out to be married to some other guy (25M)

At first I didn't know, when I did know I let things keep going mostly because of the way she talked about him, it sounded like she was on the verge of a divorce and so on.

I've been single for like 5 years before her,  
I really fell hard for her, and was imagining a life together, she didn't seem like the normal type to just cheat and she would always talk in terms of living with me, getting married, having kids, our future together etc...  
I feel like a complete idiot now, because she eventually started feeling guilty about cheating and now today texted to say it's over and she can't see or talk to me anymore.

I'm devastated, I feel so stupid for thinking this could be a real thing that worked out, and because of how we met, through my main hobby, almost everyone I know and would talk to about this knows her and the husband now, so I can't say anything about it and I've got like no one to talk to.

Now I've got to say nothing, and deal with still seeing her at certain events while pretending I barely know her. I was completely in love, I'm crushed, I feel foolish and I realize how much of this is just my own fault.

How do I even deal with this? I spent the last few years in a deep depression and was ok for like a year, not expecting anything like this and I'm falling right back in even feeling suicidal again, I don't want to let this disaster fuck up years of progress.",01Nov2018,1

I accepted the job offer since I didn’t have any others but this and I am scheduled for a training tomorrow at the hospital. On top of it, I have Pre-planned days before applying to this job and I let them know but can’t even guarantee those days off. 

Anyway, being scheduled tomorrow for training, I am in conflict with another opportunity that literally came up today. It’s for a customer service representative position for a digital and business marketing company and basically offers $40k-$60k within the first year.

So I was trying to see if I can schedule the interview with them Friday, but they really wanted to wrap things up by tomorrow so I just agreed for tomorrow. However it would probably conflict with my training as I’m not sure how long that’ll take.

I don’t know what to do. My gut tells me to schedule the training next week and go to this interview since I feel that it’s really worth it with the pay, hours and I honestly got along really well with the HR who called me there.

163,"A while ago ( 3 years ) life was not headed in the direction I wanted. I went through a break up and hated every part of myself. I decided to take mushrooms every day for a full month and then weed and ecstasy myself out the next. 
I ended up in the psych ward at the hospital and stayed for a week. They put me on anti depressants and an anti psychotic. 
I went to rehab and realized I should be sober for a bit so I did- I went 2 and a half years. Things were not happening how I felt they should, I wasn't getting laid how I know I could and spent most of my time alone. Friends stopped reaching out and dynamics of all relationships changed. Naturally I would push people out and I have felt like I'm tripping ever since this whole thing happened.

I want to go back to the way things were before this all happened. I've seen doctors - one just said I have a though disorder and I think I still have my psychosis I had from when this whole thing happened. 
I casually started to drink w friends to see if I could accomplish what I wanted and it failed even worse.

I'm afraid I have psychosis still or maybe bi polar or schizophrenia (prob not but idk) because of the way I am and I don't know what to do. I feel like I will never have a normal brain again- like I won't ever be myself or a normal person. It's so easy for everyone else.",01Nov2018,1

My mum has some really uptight standards when it comes to men, she hates men who dont have a university degrees, men who work trades jobs, and men who aren't religious. My boyfriend is all three, and so far she hasn't found a reason to hate him. I feel like i'm walking on eggshells, waiting for her to blow up and threaten my boyfriend with insults. (she goes straight to attack mode when her mood dips, shes kicked me out and stone walled me because I came home after midnight). Shes unbelievably conservative, throwing rages about women moving in with their boyfriends, giving lectures if I dont pray before dinner, reminding me how ""precious"" my virginity is and how non religious men will ruin me etc. 

Anyways, my boyfriend is amazing and booked us a vacation to Jamaica because it's his birthday, and he says I've been burnt out by work and family. I have no idea how to tell my mother, or if I even should. She follows all my social media and tracks my location whenever I have it on. I feel like I couldn't bear to lie for a week while i'm in another country.

166,"I am using a throwaway because my reddit account is linked to my name and I don’t want my mother to find this (15M) Alright so for a few years now my mom and dad haven’t got along and even before I can remember it being bad apparently it was. My mom yells at my dad for the dumbest of reasons and takes out her anger on all of us (me,dad,brother) my dad for years has just sat there and took it, not a word back, never stood up for himself. My dad 9/10 would make a family plan or date plan, and it would end up with mom yelling at him of all of us (hardly for a valid reason).Also money is very tight for my family. My mom would always get fed up and angry and take it out on me and my brother. As well as this she can be extremely childish and call us losers or make fun of my weight (I fall into the obese levels of overweight which I recently have been very depressed about and have been looking into getting in shape)  when she is mad. More times than I can count she has picked me up from somewhere and vented to me (saying how she’s so done with my dad [for no good reason] and how she wants to leave and how {insert me and my dads last names} are so negative and generally just says bad things about our family name &lt;she never took his&gt;)Years this has gone on and my dad has just taken it like a champ. This year has been really bad for my family (a lot of bad thing ex. Longtime family dog died) and one of the things was that my dad got into a roll over accident because a guy fell asleep and hit him. He is extremely lucky to be alive and probably wouldn’t have survived if driving another car (extremely safe car) this is important because the day this started is halloween and I’m too old to trick or treat (in my eyes) so I handed out candy all night till about 8:30. Another important thing is that tomorrow’s their anniversary. Apparently my dad was trying to make plans, my mom wanted to see a movie so my dad checked showing times and it was 10:10 pm (too late for my dad) or 7:10 (a little early for him) my dad asked her how long the movie was, thinking he’d either leave work early to go out to eat before movie( if to long) or eat after (if movie were short enough) my mother instantly perceived this as complaining and being “negative” so she yelled at him and my dad just dipped inside because he was fed up. I was outside unaware, suddenly around 8 I hear my moms bedroom door slam and hear her coming down the stairs, and at the fucking top of her lungs start screaming at my dad calling him a “f***ing loser” and a “f***ing lier” I hear this and instantly embarrassed and go and shut the door to the house (the screen was shut but door was open) and can hardly hear it. Then it gets louder and my dad yells back saying “I never f***ing said that” and other things i couldn’t hear. People trick or treating are looking at my house weird so I move down to the end of the driveway where the neighbor a few doors downs music can almost drown it out. It stops and my dad gets me and says it’s time to come in, I ask what happened and he tells me about the planning stuff. I go in and then she comes down super pissy saying “I’m ready to hear you out without interrupting” thinking this is resolved I go to the dining room to eat dinner. After my dad explains how he wasn’t complaining about the time she calls him a lier and starts yelling, I’m really upset at this point and I kinda drowned out her yelling with my thoughts. She’s storms upstairs and I think it’s over, but it really isn’t. A while later my bro gets home from work and proceeds to sit on the couch with me to watch lord of the rings (he never saw it so we had been watching the directors extended versions all week. She storms back down and yells at my dad, my bro just having gotten back from work is tired and irritated because he had to work early is annoyed and asks her to stop. She starts screaming calling my dad more names and I ask her to please stop (I’m almost in tears because I’m so done with her screaming and hate when they fight (more accurately ‘she screams at my dad and he just takes it’ and she then targets me and my bro calling us f***ing losers and lazy a**holes. Then she says some that set me and my brother off, she pushed us to our f***ing limit she said something that I cannot believe she has the balls to say “ I wish you f***ing died in the car crash “ then slammed the door. I, now crying shouted “what  the f**k did you just say!!!” And my brother leaped up of the couch charging at full speed up stairs so fast his phone got launched out of his pocket and screamed at her something along the lines of “What do you just f***ing say, that’s my f***ing dad” whilst hitting the wall and tearing up. She comes out with a shit eating grin on her face with the most bull shit fake ass apology ever “ *smiling condescendingly at my bro* I guess I shouldn’t of said that” as my brother shouted “what would we do without him, what would I do. We wouldn’t even still be living here” almost two years ago we bought a house we can hardly afford. And she says “Yeah right, I bought this house” which isn’t true she didn’t even work till several months ago and the only thing she paid for was the deposit and she used her real estate license to sell the only house she ever has, the rental we had just moved out of. After this she licks herself in her room and my brother and I are both crying and he goes outside. My dad sits there like nothing is happening just bottling up all the bullshit. My brother and I are really upset and talk for a minute then I decided to grab my kitten and go to my room. I’m in the bathroom when I hear a huge crash and open the door to see her throwing boxes of my dads stuff off the second floor Without even looking. I asked her “ what the f**k are you doing” And She says “ I’m getting rid of the s*it” I instantly say stop it and go down there to collect everything strewn across the ground and as I’m doing so she dumps tons of his clothes onto me and locks herself back in her room. I’m crying again and go and talk to my bro about it who helps calm me down and I tell him what’s going on. We go in and wait at the bottom so she won’t throw more stuff down and she comes out with her phone Recording audio and says “you’re really going to talk sh*t down there” whilst she records. My brother then says “ we are making sure you don’t throw more of dad‘s stuff down here” she then calls us losers and a**holes at this point I’m in tears again and go to the other room because I can’t take that stuff anymore my brother then says “ look what you are doing to {my name}” she then says “ f*** him he’s a lazy bi***” and I snap and call her a bit** and other stuff and says “ I’ll be gone tomorrow” and I am a crying mess and shout and encourage her to go something like “then f***ing go already” and she then tries to call my dad to “discipline me for talking back” and I say “why the f*** should he help you all you’re gonna do is yell at him anyways” and we keep yelling eventually she locks herself in her room and I’m about to go to bed then she goes down to insult my dad calling him a “spineless loser” and then comes upstairs and says “ I can’t believe you’re pushing me out like this” suitcase in hand and I’m super pissed so I yell “ you caused this, you’re pushing yourself out” and I try to shut my door but she runs down the hall and slams the door back into my shoulder (hurt pretty bad) and shouted more sh*t at me and hits me in the same shoulder and proceeds to slam my window shut. I grabbed my kitten in tears and ran outside to an extra room ( she had locked my bro outside but I came out unlocking it on my way) we had and chilled out for a bit then my dad and bro talked in the garage for a while and I tried to calm down. She then came out and yelled about how she was leaving and I was so done I shouted “then just fu**ing leave already” and she opened the door and hit me on the back of my head. She went in and since then I went back to my room and she hasn’t come out. I’m really upset and I don’t know what to do, she’s never been like this before. What should I do?",01Nov2018,1
167,"I am 16 yo and in my final year(12th grade) of Gymnasium (german highschool). 

I never get invited to any Parties or get-togethers or anything and i don't know why. In school I have a few friends and they're always nice, when we meet in school, but as i said they never wanna meet up with me. I've tried messaging my closest ""friends"" from scholl to ask if there's ""anything going on"", but they either say, that they dont know or just don't reply. I strongly think, that I'm missing something, because social interaction and ""partying"" seems important in my age. 

 

Reasons I've thought of:

 - I came to my school almost 3 years ago (9th grade) and most of the people there already no each other for 6 or more years. 

 - I'm at least one year younger, than all the people in my grade, because i skipped the 2nd grade. (I'm ""hochbegabt""(german), apperently the english word is ""intellectual giftedness""). Maybe thats why they dont like me, althought most people in my school don't know my age. 

 - Maybe I'm just an extremly unpleasant person and I don't ever notice and all the people in school are just acting. 


Maybe there's something that i could do, please help.

169,"This just happened and I’m dying inside.


Relevant info: I live in a very earthquake-prone city. I am also awful at reading social situations.


Today at lunch, I was sitting with some coworkers who were talking about the earthquake damage to nearby buildings. One them is visible from our building and has construction work ongoing, I assumed no one else worked in the building. My coworker mentions they’re amazed theres still people working in it because the damage is so bad and it’s extremely unsafe.


What I intended to express, in a sarcastic way, was something about how it’s fucked up that people care so little about the safety of the workers.


What I said, in a completely deadpan tone, was:


“They don’t count because they’re construction workers”.


So now obviously, I should say “holy fuck that came out wrong”
But wait, there’s more! Because I’m utterly socially inept. My boss says:


“No, there’s other people working in there. Cafes and stuff. You know, real people”.


And I still don’t fucking understand what I just said but vaguely realised his tone had changed, so simply say


“oh that’s terrible”


I did manage to realise what I’d said a full hour later, and got zero work done for the rest of the day because I was so stressed I honestly thought I might vomit and couldn’t tell if it would be worse to never mention it again or awkwardly apologise.


I’m now lying in bed with a bottle of wine wishing I was dead.

Long story short, I'm a woman who went to a bar alone and met two women and two men who had also just briefly met eachother. We briefly talked and later on that night I met them again at another bar. I was invited by one of the men and one of the women to join them. I ultimately declined and briefly talked to them then left the bar. 

I came back later deciding I wanted to join after all. I was invited by the same man again. The man who invited me both times was the most talkative to me was one of the men. I enjoyed it and one of the women asked if he was my type of guy. She looked upset. I began to wonder if I had taken attention away from her and made less eye contact with him. I asked her if I had interrupted anything. ""No, you are always welcomed to the group."" I wasn't sure how sincere that statement was.

The situation ended with the guy saying they were all going to another room to play a bar game. I paid attention to there not being an invitation to join that time. He shook my hand and gave a side hug. I'm looking for more insight on the situation. ",01Nov2018,1

The only possible solution to this is to take out a small-ish personal loan of $4K (which is the smallest amount I can possibly get from my bank)

187,"Soo... I've been torn apart by this for a while now. And I know the title is weirdly phrased.

Over the last few years I have developed a habit of leaving parties and events early to go after stuff in the morning and the entire next day without feeling tired or hungover. I have radically decreased the amount of beer I drink and i have said ""no"" to harder liqour so many times my friends have stopped even asking. 

I feel like this habit is now so burnt into my brain that at some point i always get the urge to leave and I do. Even if I'm having fun and enjoying the company of my friends i get this sense of pointlessness. 

 But this time I saw a real look of disappointment in their faces when I left and it hit me. I love working out, learning piano or reading... That's stuff i really feel like it's helping me grow personally but i also feel like an asshole for skipping out on social interactions this much. My friends don't really meet without drinking or in even in the daytime. I loved to drink and to smoke but the two years I have already lost to that made me realise that that's not the way to go. My biggest sin, according to my friends is when I drink water while the are getting drunk. I mean, I get it. The sober guy is annoying while every one is hammered. But I also don't want to be the drunk guy.

I hope this is comprehensive and I'm sorry if my spelling is off sometimes. I just wanted write about this stuff, because writing always helped me cope with my inner conflicts. I also would appreciate some advice, because I can't really talk to anybody about this. ",01Nov2018,1
188,"Hello everyone, I have created this throwaway as Im too ashamed to use my real reddit account for this and am seriously just lost.  


Im unsure what to do in the situation my family is now in. My mother and father are 55 and 48, and neither can work currently. My fathers diabetes has rendered the nerves in his foot dead, so he can no longer continue his work as a courier as he cannot feel the pedal underneath his foot, nor can he walk properly. He had an operation that was meant to help, but has now resulted in terrible pain in his leg and foot and constant swelling each day, rendering him almost immobile. My mother has just had a problem with the nerves in her back about a 2 weeks ago, so she can barely walk and is constantly in excruciating pain. The doctor gave her 2 needles that didn't work. We've run out of money and they've only now given my mother a referral for an operation, but it's AT LEAST a 12 month waiting list. My parents told us in about 1 or 2 weeks we'll lose the house since they can't work, my Mums work is about to fire her for continued absence as her leave has run out and my Dads work is trying to make him resign so they don't have to pay him Income Protection (It wouldn't cover our costs anyway). Centrelink only pays about $250-500 dollars a fortnight for unemployment, and our fortnightly costs are around $1400+. My friend has offered me to stay at theirs till we get back on our feet, but her family wouldn't allow my parents there as it would be too crowded and I refuse to leave my folks. Without them being able to work and having to wait 12 months before my mum can work again, we have no income minus the casual work my older brother does. Applying for full time and part time work thus far has only resulted in us being turned down. I gave up on going to TAFE to try and delay the amount of money we spend, but time's almost up. What do we do?",01Nov2018,1
189,"Hi guys!

A little back story to start with...

In March 2018, I decided to go back to school to become a Medical Assistant. When I decided to do this, it was a completely life changing decision. I live in a small town, and the closest college is an hour away. Said college does not have the best reputation, and I did not want to spend 2 years going to a crap school. I eventually decided to attend a technical school that is 3 counties away from where I live, equaling out to a 4+ hour (depending on traffic) commute. When I enrolled, they almost didn’t let me due to how far away I lived. 

The program at the school I go to is 9 months long; 8 months of classroom setting and 5 weeks of full time externship. I’ve been promised since I enrolled that I would be placed into an externship that is less than 30 minutes from my home, and that it would be in the county I lived in. I was also told that they could *probably* get me into an OB/GYN Clinic (my dream job!). 

For the last 8 months I have worked my ASS off. I have never missed a single day of class. I’ve never even been late, or left early for any reason. I also have near perfect grades, I have received A’s in all of my classes, except for 2 B’s I got when I was incredibly depressed and suicidal (4+ hours in a car by yourself every day can do that to ya, but still didn’t miss a day of class). I have seriously worked so hard to maintain my grades and attendance. The main reason I worked so hard to be as perfect as possible, was because I was being told by the career advisors at my school (the people who choose your externship clinic) that the only way to get good externship is to have above a 3.75 GPA &amp; to have missed less than 5% of school (So I would say I WELL exceeded those expectations with my 3.9 GPA and perfect attendance). 

4 weeks ago, all of the seniors in my program met up individually with a career advisor to go over any questions, concerns, and extern requests. During my meeting, the ONLY request I had was to PLEASE not send me to community health, as that’s not the route I want to start out in (I have NOTHING against community health, I just REALLY want a specialty &amp; somewhere reputable to be able to put on my resume. The community health clinics where I live are not regarded very highly at all by other medical clinics). After I talked to her about all of that, the advisor told me that there was no way they’d be able to place me in an extern in my county (even though I had been promised I would be) and that they would not be able to place me into any specialties. She literally told me, “your only option is family practice. It’s the best we can do for you.” I was immediately upset, but said okay and decided I would be fine with it, as it’s only 5 weeks of my life. She did, however, say that I would most likely end up externing at * name of clinic I really want to work at *, so that cheered me up a bit and I was excited again. 

So fast forward to last week. I finally found out where I would be externing.. and you guessed it: they sent me to family practice in community health... an hour an a half away from where I live. I instantly wanted to cry, and said what happened to * clinic I really want to work at *? All she would say is, “Sorry. It’s just not happening.” Then would change the subject. 

I moped about it for the rest of that week, and had to excuse myself to go sit in the bathroom and try not to cry every time one of my classmates bragged about the amazing externships they’ve been put in (Not even kidding, I’m the only person that didn’t get placed into a specialty). 

Fast forward to this week, on Monday, I woke up to a text from my significant other. He has been a MA for a couple years and works at one of the clinics in the chain that I want to work at. He said that his manager and HR felt real bad about my shitty extern, and after seeing a copy of my resume and transcript, decided to offer me an extern and a job offer once I finished with extern. I was ECSTATIC, thinking, “this is it! I’m going to get what I want for ONCE.” His HR emailed me all of their info and asked me to forward it to my career advisor. So I did, and literally had to sit on my hands because I was so excited, and couldn’t wait to hear what my advisor would say. 

Well, her response wasn’t at all what I was expecting. To summarize her email, she said that if I didn’t accept my extern offer at the community health clinic she would fail me for extern, and I would have to pay to retake the class. She also put my extern on “hold” until I came in and had a meeting with her and her supervisor to talk about the offer. She said a couple other suuuuuper bitchy things about contracts and stuff that I signed but they don’t apply to this story a whole lot. 

So I go in that day and have a meeting with them. I was so nervous, because they were threatening to fail me and they forwarded my emails to my extern lead. I get there, and they wouldn’t even talk about the clinic that was offering me a job. They wouldn’t even consider it. 

So here I am, with ONE DAY of class left, feeling like I have worked my butt off for the better part of this last year for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I also feel like I’m being punished for living so far away. 

What should I do? I really don’t think I deserve to be put into a crappy extern, but I HATE confrontation and am having a real hard time standing up for myself. Should I raise some hell? Ask to talk to the director? Everyone is telling me I should talk to the owners of the school (it’s a for-profit school, owned by some random family). 

Am I even being screwed over? Or am I just overreacting? I will literally take any advice at this point.

194,"I am pretty brand new to reddit, so I apologize in advance for any formatting (on mobile) issues and how long this is.

My friend was a big reason my husband was fired, and I'm not sure if I can/should stay friends with her. 

To give some back story, I have been friends with this woman for about 7 years. We share a best friend and a close friend group (the others I have been friends with for over 10). Together we make 5 people and we've all been very close for a long time. Our lives pulled us in different directions, but we've all always made the effort to get together when we can. 

I got my friend a job at the office I worked for. Without offering too many details, we're essentially secretaries. We make schedules and deal with payments, etc. It also involves some sales, but that's not super important. 

Our department consisted of 5 women and the department we scheduled for was a rotating staff of anywhere from 10-12. We worked together semi-frequently. Sometimes we worked full shifts together, more often we just overlapped for an hour or two. Working together was a bad idea. I saw and experienced behavior from her that I never had before, and things that hadn't bothered me before was starting to. She was always kind of whiny, but it never bothered me before because she would complain, we'd chat and move on. Now she's having the same convorsation with every single person we worked with from our department or the other. I don't try to hold this against her, but hearing the same issue over and over takes a toll you'd never think possible. Neither of us enjoyed working together (I'm sure there is annoying stuff I do too I won't put that solely on her) and it took a toll on our friendship. She started working more closely with a really toxic person and picked up bad work habits and became gossipy and bitter, which she had never been before. The sweet, kind, albeit self-pitying woman became spiteful and downright mean. She would gossip endlessly about a tiny, easily fixable mistake someone made like it was the end of the world and talk about how they shouldn't work here. On the other side though, she was slacking and leaving work for other people, making mistakes that actually required us to take time to fix them, and still complaining about others. I got promoted and moved to another location after about six months. Our relationship was already damaged, but it was getting better since we didn't have to work together every day now.

Around the same time I got her the position in my location, my husband started working at another location, doing the same job and for the same company. When I was promoted he was moved to my location, so now he was working with her. They weren't particularly close beforehand, but they were friendly. Their working relationship did not last even half as long as mine and hers did. I never heard from her, but heard from him that there was no difference in her behavior. He doesn't generally tolerate people like that, but for my sake he wasn't going to stir the pot by calling her out on her shitty work habits (getting worse as I left and continuing to decline afterwards). 

I won't sit here and say my husband was the star employee working there. He is not detail oriented so he tends to make small mistakes and gets frustrated easily (our scheduling system is notoriously difficult and poorly managed). Once he is made aware of that mistake though, he makes sure to not make it again. He also doesn't take his frustration out on others, but it is pretty clear when he's in a bad mood. The issue here is that the culture of the office quickly declined after I left and it essentially became a gossipy, non-communicative high school. About a month ago, his manager (different than the one I had worked with) blew up on him about a laundry list of (what I would call) small mistakes. All easily fixable, but now a problem because no one had ever mentioned it happening. One mistake was simply a locational difference that no one ever corrected him on, another was something that he honestly should have been doing and wasn't realizing he was forgetting, and a few were just plain lies. He sat down with his manager and let him know that he didn't appreciate how he'd blown up on him, he'd do his best to not continue any bad habits, but why were these (lies) things he was beimg reprimanded for when he knew he wasn't doing them incorrectly. His manager admitted that some of it was hear-say and he'd be more careful in the future about the reliablity of his source. Through the rest of the convorsation, his experiences with her, and from hearing from the other people he worked with, he learned she was the source of the complaints.

Today he was fired because of mistakes consistently made and not being the right fit for the company. He is pretty friendly with his manager, so it was rough on everyone. My manager (above both me and his manager) was also there and we spoke about it later. She was upset about the situation because she really likes my husband, but she lets us manage our staff as we see fit. She let me know that there had been complaints about his work for a while and he had been talking about leaving to other coworkers (because we are having a baby soon and he'll be staying home).  

I won't say she was the sole reason he was fired, because that is not true, but she was enough of the reason that he went from being reprimanded to fired. I'm not sure if I should stay friends with her. There is a lot of history, but the relationship was already damaged. I want to support my husband and be there for him. I also don't want to stir the pot in my friend group. I'm not looking to ruin their relationship with her, but I can barely stand to think of her right now without wanting to strangle her. She didn't just get him fired, she got him fired while we are expecting a baby. She isn't stupid and knows exactly what she was pushing his job status toward. 

I'm not exactly looking for a solution to this problem, just any advice on how to handle it would be appreciated. Thank you.

[This](https://imgur.com/gallery/N34qmwF) was from a guy I met online and talked to for TWO days. He turned completely obsessive, claiming he was in love with me and other shit, so I told him I no longer wanted to talk to him. That link shows his response. 
This happened a few years ago. Looking back I realize he may have been involved in human trafficking. The reason I think this is because he kept trying to convince me to get on a plane and visit him, even though I was only 16 years old and he was almost 20. When I blocked him, he kept changing his number and spamming me with calls. 
I still have his number, “name”, photos he sent me from where he lives, and photos of him (I know it’s him because we FaceTimed- yes I know I was an idiot).

209,"All friends have bad habits and things we can nitpick on, but we usually overlook them because no one is perfect. Fair, right? Well, unfortunately, even though I've looked past their bad traits and qualities -- there have been some as of late that are too much to bear. And here they are (don't worry, I'll leave a tl;dr at the end):

&amp;#x200B;

* One of my friends (who was formerly my best friend, I'll say his name is Austin) and I have completely different tastes in interests. We don't like the same video games, we don't like the same music. It can be exhausting and quite draining because I'm usually the one who keeps an open mind to his interests. For instance, he's a *huge* fan of Kanye. He Stans him like crazy. I'm not much of a fan of the guy myself, but I'll try and talk as much as I can about him to keep a conversation going between us. Meanwhile, I'm a big fan of Eminem. My friend isn't an Eminem fan at all, so whenever I mention him or bring him up, he just pulls out his Nintendo Switch and starts playing it or pulls out his phone and waits for the topic to change. I've been taking this behavior for numerous other interests that we usually converse about for years now and I'm starting to become really exhausted. 
* My other friend who I'll call Alex is a major hypocrite but he never sees the wrong in any of the hypocritical things he does. Like, he'll have all these Sheldon-from-Big-Bang-Theory-esque rules when we enter his car but he moves and acts freely in our car. Again, I've been accepting a plethora of the hypocritical things he does for so long (since a chunk of them are more major and serious than just a car) because if I bring them up with him then he just gets all dramatic and says ""goodbye, so long, have a great life and I'll be sure to always keep you in memory"" and I'm reaching my boiling point now. 
* My friend who I'll name Jim is a complicated one. For a few years, he only ever hits me up to hang out if he's going through girl issues. If he's not having trouble in a fling / relationship, he just solely sticks to his family. This behavior is annoying because whenever I ask him to hang out, he's nowhere to be found. He's a flake and it's annoying me a lot.
* Finally, my friend Larry who's much better than the rest will only ever hang out when it's his plan. So, if he asks me to hang out, he'll obviously be onboard with the hangout. If it's vice-versa, he says no 100% of the time. Not 98. Not 99. Literally **100%**. Again, when it comes to him, the pros outweigh the only con which is this.

These are all very specific examples and I know each of these bullet points can be broken down into their own individual posts on this sub but I just have no idea what to do. Since I'm not in high school anymore, my circle of friends is really condensed and these are really the only people I ever talk to now. But they all have these aspects of their personas that are really starting to drive me bonkers and I don't know what to do.

Since they make up my circle of friends, it's really, really getting to me and I'm just at a loss. Should I confront them all about their respective hindrances or should I just distance myself from them and focus on myself?**

214,"Okay so here is some more info with out getting personal. My Aunt's mind stopped growing at around 12, she's simple. She's also slightly paranoid/schizophrenic. I.E. Thinks smkoing is fine but won't drink water becuase, ""it will put bugs in my blood"". She probably will never have a job higher than Janitorial (not saying anything bad about that trade). 

Now part 2. She found this company... more like he found her. It's an office with about 30 other people just like my Aunt. People society kinda forgot about. He uses them to run an ""Auto Warranty"" scam company. My proof? He's moved 3 times in one year. Constantly changes the name of the company. No one will cash his checks with out a 5 day hold. Uses alisases for his website and property rentals. His current ""Comapny"" has over 90 Better Business complaints. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question. What should/can I do? I wan't to stop him, he's using sick people to rip off thousands more with his scam. I want to end him in every sense of the word. ""Legally of course"" I've thought about just going down there and fighitng him becuase what can he do? 

A little about me, Im a pretty decent Sys Admin with Networking Skills, And I am open to talk about this... is it morale, am i wrong, is he wrong, should I contact the FBI?

215,"Hey Reddit  


My girlfriend and I both relocated of our own accord for work from job near Chicago to a job near Baltimore. We moved because I wanted better opportunities if we didn't stay with our current company (we are both employed by the same company) and I also wanted to be closer to friends and family as we are both from NJ.

&amp;#x200B;

So right now though, I didn't fully understand the role we chose to come here for and its pretty awful and not at all what we expected. Both of us are horribly depressed now after a rough move of trying to get everything we own to fit and then trying to get used to the area. I personally feel like I made a big mistake and we've left what was a really comfortable life with everything 5-10 minutes away, no traffic, and a decent work environment for 20 minutes+ to get anywhere, a depressing new office, traffic always, and we're still 2-3 hours away from everyone we came back for.  


As for advice, looking for some tips on how to deal with the situation? We don't have the option to move back right now as we have a 1 year lease and would prefer to stay with our current company which also has about 1 year until we could relocate again.",01Nov2018,1

Around a year ago I broke up with my long-time girlfriend, she was the first person I ever dated.

A few days ago I went on a date with a girl that i've been talking to for the past month, we got along well but I don't feel like I felt a spark, i'm not sure if this is because my heart is damaged or if i'm just not interested in her, she was very nice. I'd like to search for more people that are out there as well because i'm so under-exposed to the dating world. How can I tell this to the person I dated?

218,"**TL:DR at the bottom**

A little context: I’m a young father of 2, we live paycheck to paycheck but still do well enough to meet our needs. 

My fiancée got a horrible cough about a week ago and it just now passed, but not before affecting my son (age 3). It hit him a lot harder than it did her, and it kept getting worse. 
We gave him medicine, didn’t allow him to go to pre school for the days he was sick and gave him lots of rest. 

Yesterday morning my fiancée calls me while I’m at work crying because our son could not breath. She was understandably scared and had no idea what to do. She managed to calm him down and got him breathing steady again, and I had to finish my work day in fear of getting fired or not making enough in my next paycheck.

Now to this morning, it’s currently 6:43 am and I just managed to get off work an hour early. My fiancée calls me to tell me that our son wasn’t able to breath yet again and she had to call 911. 
They were brought to the hospital in an ambulance and they should be getting out soon.

The doctors say that they believe he has croup and we will need to purchase a humidifier for him to get better. How bad does this look? Will I be looking at thousands of dollars in hospital bills considering just an ambulance ride is $600? 

I know that money shouldn’t come before my sons health but I’m just worried that with these bills, we won’t be able to pay our rent and be forced back with family or out on the streets. 

TL:DR: son (3) had to take the ambulance to the hospital with my fiancée because he couldn’t breath. Am I going to be financially ruined?

219,"First time reddit user here, so please bear with me.

I started dating this guy about six months ago. We get along great and I see the potential for a great future, with the exception of his career. 

He lacks ambition. He works for himself but never puts in a full week of work. He puts off the work he doesn’t like and often chooses work that pays less. He seems to lack focus. For example, he took three days off to paint his living room. He has countless ways to make money.

He says he is not happy career wise. I’ve tried to have conversations with him about finding a new job that might make him happy. When I suggested one job, he quickly shut me down. He states he can’t have a normal job because he needs to be home when his child gets off the bus two days a week. He shares custody with his ex. I feel it’s somewhat of an excuse as he could make a lot of arrangements to cover the few hours it may affect.

I am not expecting him to make a lot of money. In fact, I would be fine with his self-employment if his bills were being paid but some aren’t. 

I’m worried because I think he is going to propose soon and as happy as I am with him, I need a little financial stability and alone I am financially stable. I work full time in my field. 

My parents really struggled financially through no fault of their own. I don’t need to be rich, but I would like to be comfortable and without worry if the washer machine breaks down. I don’t make enough to support the two of us. How can I make him understand, without sounding mean, that if he wants a future he needs to have a little bit more financial stability? 

Sorry for the long question.

She asked how I knew,  I told her my friend was the cashier. She started laughing cause she hadn’t recognized her and called her a chismosa for telling me. Chismosa means likes to gossip, so it can be interpreted as a joke or an insult depending on the context. 

I thought it was like the funniest thing ever so I decided to tell my friend about it. She had started to text back but stoped.

I think the issue here is caused by my kind of poor driving skill (common thing after only 30hrs of driving) combined with my eye defects. I have astigmatism, hyperopia (high diopters) and innate squint. I have good glasses and I see everything clearly, but all defects caused my unability to define distance properly, also my spatial vision is inefficient. It's not a problem when I just drive, I stick to my lane and I drive safe, but when I have to change lane when there's lot of cars around I can't tell if the car behind me is close or far, is it driving fast or slowly, especially when I have to take care of cars in front of me. It's so dangerous I can't think about and not be panicked (I'm not afraid to drive at all, I'm just very afraid I'll cause multiple accidents because of my unreasonable actions).

It lasts for days on end, sometimes long enough I forget how long it’s been because it just is a THING. 

This morning the back pain was so bad my back was sensitive to clothing touching it. 


No extensive exercises are being done, I haven’t lifted anything heavy to tweak it, it comes and goes it seems monthly (which lead me to think maybe it was menstrual related but i don’t always get my period after experiencing the pains).

223,"my boyfriend and i have been going through a lot these past few months. and by that i mean ive been ass fucking our relationship because i cant handle commitment/ being loved because of early trauma.

i cheated on him. 5 times. i sent nudes to 3 guys, and kissed a girl, twice. i never ever did it because i didnt love him, or because hes not enough, i did it because it was a form of self harm, i thought it'd improve my self esteem (it didnt), and i was angry at him a lot for petty things, and thats how i took my anger out.

anyway, after weeks and weeks of the guilt building up inside me, weeks and weeks of my friends and family telling me not to tell him, he somehow got my social media passwords and looked through my DMs without consent (because he could tell something was up) and found out i cheated. obviously he was heartbroken and so was i, but he decided to stay with me. on a few conditions - that he had full access to my phone, computer, and everything else so he can check im not cheating; im not allowed to see certain friends etc.

his paranoia is bad too, hes worried i havent told him everything, that i slept with someone else and i havent told him about it. hes wrong, but i understand why.

last night, we got into a bad argument. he wanted to look through my phone and i didnt want him to on principle, so he got angry and broke my phone more (he smashed it a few days ago after he found out i cheated), and he threatened to snap it, called me names and stuff, and i got very worked up but i tried to manage my anger atleast, unlike him. 

he looked through my phone and found no evidence of cheating, but was still very angry. i demanded to look through his phone which ive never done before and found messages telling a girl how much he loves her and how its not as magical without her here. obviously i was angry, but i took it too far, please keep in mind that hes 4 years older than me, stronger (hes a regular at the gym) and could easily overpower me, not that that means anyhting. i still assaulted him. i threw his phone against the wall (i dont think it broke, idk tho) and i pushed him multiple times, and i think i slapped him (i barely remember it). i feel extremely guilty, and im thinking of switching from this medication that seems to make my anger worse.

he left my house and all we've talked about is having a break and the conditions for me staying with him which is to cut off a lot of friends.

im not sure i should stay with him. his mental health has deteriorated because of how ive treated him and i think it might be kinder just to leave him. i really dont know what to do. i truly think he is my soulmate, and the love of my life, but im so mangled inside because of my own issues and it makes it hard to cope. im seeking counselling. but i just dont want to lose him.

do i leave him out if kindness? because i dont think hes ABLE to leave me, no matter how bad it gets.",01Nov2018,1

Cannot have a bike either as there are also no bike lanes and you do not want to ride in the highway as that is stupid and dangerous. Highways are the only roads near you(no joke)  and there are no stop signs or side walks and the last time you tried walking that you got hurt and parents refused to let you see a doctor.

Well, this morning I got a message from one of the admin saying I was removed because my general presence made someone uncomfortable and triggered. One woman on there went through my Facebook profile and suffered an extreme panic attack because I reminded her of her abusive ex. So because of that, I was removed.

Honestly, it seems like a bullshit reason. I’m going to be an asshole here. She asked for it by scrolling through my profile. I am generally a mild-mannered individual with a good number of friends. Sure. I make sarcastic and witty remarks, but for the most part I am not an abusive individual. Rather, I have suffered much emotional abuse, and possible physical abuse when I was a baby, in my life that I’m coming to terms with now. A glimpse into my Facebook profile: which has only pictures from my travels on the road, re-posts of memes from several pages and group (I rarely ever write my own posts there anymore), and my profile page is of the solar eclipse I took in person. I personally don’t see a way my page could emanate toxicity. 

In my own opinion, I shouldn’t be held accountable because of one person’s perception of me based on social media. I’m sorry my existence triggered her. At the same time I deal with so much that triggers me but I don’t let them get to me. 

I mean, there’s not much I can do in this situation. I was kicked off the group. All because I made one woman uncomfortable. Simply because she went snooping on my profile and claimed I reminded her of her past traumas.",01Nov2018,1

It ended because he accused me of possibly flirting with another man (I have NEVER, and had NO interest in doing that) which really hurt me, along with the fact that I felt extremely smothered and stressed by him for a while during that time. 
When we started dating, he was very quick to say I love you, etc and I wasn't feeling it and was quite hesitant. In the beginning he was quite pushy about sex, too. It made me uncomfortable and made me feel a bit guarded around him, since I take my time getting close to people and he seemed way too rushed to do so. 
Next, he was really insecure about me making friends. I had recently started a new class in uni, and he would get passive aggressive if I mentioned things I learned in a fun way with my classmates. He would get upset and weird about it, and it ruined my mood. He also got really weird about me forgetting to tell him something. If I said I hated asparagus but one day, I was craving it, he made it sound like I lied to him about asparagus and just made it sound so bad. 

But that's not what makes me uncomfortable right now. I feel uneasy thinking about him in general, and almost feel disgusted. And it's related to things he liked during sex. I don't want to post details but he has a 2 year old relative and kept talking about her, sending pictures of her when I never asked, just obsessing over her in general. And that's OK. But he then mentioned he's into rape-play, incest, age-play, wanting me to act like I'm his TWO YEARS OLD RELATIVE and he'll rape me? What the fuck? There were so many other weird fantasies he had...

Please any advice if you have it... am I overthinking this? ",01Nov2018,1
245,"So I have this friend who I'm really close to, known them since the beginning of college and we're roommates now (I'll call them Alex). We're fairly opposite, like I'm a huge introvert and they're a massive extrovert, but we get along well and I think overall they're a decent person. My problem recently is that I've realized that they're not the most responsible person, and it's really affected my opinion of them. For example, they always forget stuff everywhere, like their keys, so they get locked out a lot and I have to constantly let them in, and they keep asking me for snack money because apparently it's too hard to carry quarters around themselves. Honestly I could live with this, but their irresponsibility is also affecting our friend group and there's been a lot of tensions recently: for example, they planned to host a dinner at our apartment for 7, but because of their time management we ended up eating at 9:30, and only after I jumped in to help cook; another time they scheduled a get-together, then cancelled less than an hour before because their girlfriend cancelled and suddenly they were busy. The biggest issue though is that a lot of our friend group works together on group projects in school, and Alex has been having problems keeping up on their end (this part is nothing new, they have had a history of taking too long with their work). Recently it's caused a major fight between them and another one of our friends, and they keep saying they'll work on it or ""they've figured out a way to get faster and think they've really been making progress"": the problem here is that they've been repeating this for the last three years. How do I deal with this person? They do seem like they want to change and they've shown remorse over some of their actions, and I feel like they've improved a bit, but for me it's starting to get tiring.",01Nov2018,1

247,"Before my boyfriend moved in with me and my dog, I had asked him to please refrain from watching porn while I am at home. I am always available for sex, or anything he ever wants to do. In fact my sex drive is very high, and I want it all the time. He was of course very understanding, because of some issues I have experienced in the past. Yesterday I walked into the living room, right after we had been looking at some sexy photos I had taken of myself for him like a half hour before. He put his phone down right away, and I could just tell something was up. I looked down and his dick was hard. He claimed he was looking at one of my photos but I can always tell when he is lying. He finally admitted that he was looking at porn, and not me.  He apologized profusely, ofcourse, told me how much he absolutely loves and cares for me over and over again., and That it was a mistake. Now another thing is that we haven’t been been able to have sex for a few days because of some other health issues so I do understand that he is pent up and frustrated. But unfortunately I am a over thinker to the max, and all that I could think was that omg, he must do this all time while I’m here. (I know that this is not true, but man, my brain sure likes to fuck with me) I felt sick to my stomach, I’m also not some crazy lady who doesn’t like porn. I watch porn all the time, but respectfully. I think I just need some help with perspective on this. I am a very confident, sexy, smart, Understanding woman and I can’t figure out why I can’t just let it go. ",01Nov2018,1

252,"I just really don’t like my parents and siblings if I’m being honest. It’s not their bad people we just don’t get on or click at all. My parents are over the top and too protective and I just don’t get on with my siblings. They have no respect for me because they think I have worn my parents out with my mental illnesses and really don’t understand those issues( neither do my parents).

Since coming to the University of Edinburgh I have not mentioned my mental illness to my parents once and have had tried to have as little contact as possible. I’ve made really good friends here and have had the best time of my life, being able to do what I want and eat what I want and drink alcohol and go clubbing etc. Ive been fortunate with the people I’ve become friends with and surrounded myself around.  I hang out with people who are not popularity motivated and who are loyal and good people. I have their back always. 

I live about 3 hours away and will have to see them in the holidays and probably my siblings( I have 2 brothers one younger and one older).I just really don’t want to go home and if I stay in the house they will just think I’m mentally ill and force me to go out. There’s nothing to do in my hometown it’s boring. This is why I’ve been trying extremely hard to get a girlfriend. I’ve had interactions with maybe 10 different girls over the course of a couple months but every one was either a one night stand or we both mutually agreed there wasn’t anything there in a way and so just stopped contacting each other. 

I’ve been using dating apps and have had matches but their just not my type and not people I could ever see myself being with. And there’s that saying that a relationship comes to you when your not looking for one and I think that’s a load of shit. I wasn’t looking for a relationship for years and had no interactions with girls at all. Ever since looking for someone I’ve been with numerous girls and tried things out, improving my socialising skills and confidence. 
If I wasn’t actively looking for a girl I would have not done anything with anyone. 

I rely on my parents for paying my accomm and obviously food when I’m at home etc. I do have my own source of income which makes things easier but I still rely on them. I will also need their help as I progress through life for certain things and advice like signing a contact on a house. I could do it on my own but it’s good to get a second opinion. Ultimately my parents aren’t terrible people. 

Putting it bluntly, they lack emotional sensitivity and intellectual understanding. They’re narrow minded and old fashioned and don’t accept different religions or outside ways of thinking. They’re very pushy, overprotective and over the top and manipulative in many ways.  They’re also completely sexist and lacking in integrity or compassion for people that aren’t their family. They suck up to people and paint the perfect picture of a life in order to gain respect from other adults. They try way too hard to fit in. I don’t care about fitting in. I don’t care about social popularity driven standards, popularity, fame or money. 

They’ll always want to be in my life constantly pushing me and being too needy because of my history of mental illness and my suicide attempt a couple years ago . I just want to be given some space to do my work, concentrate on my degree and having fun. But I can’t because they’re constantly messaging me saying they will contact the uni if I don’t respond straight away. They send multiple messages in a row demanding answers straight away when sometimes I’m in lectures or with friends or at a club etc. I can’t respond that very minute and I’m not joking when I say they expect me to. It’s tiring as I constantly have to be on my phone and it’s made me addicted subsequently. 

I’ve told them to stop sending me multiple messages but they don’t actually remember. I don’t really care if they care and worry for me a lot. It’s too much being bombarded. They’re also extremely judgemental of anyone my siblings or me are friends. That’s why I would never bring a girl to my home or involve her with my parents. They also stalk me on social media and pretty sure they know the password for my emails and potentially other accounts I don’t know.

255,"Okay, so all of this happened when I was about eight years old. I remember it vividly, and so does my Mom. So I was standing by the bed, waiting for Mom to get out of bed so we could go get breakfast. She wore a gold necklace that my stepfather got for her, and even wore it to bed. While she was still laying down, out of nowhere, her gold chain flew across the room, like something pulled it off her neck, and she screamed. When we looked at the chain, it was literally broken in the middle, with the latch completely detached from the rest of the chain, and on the other side of the room. It doesn't end there. The night afterward, I experienced these strange night terrors where I was awake, but walled in a brick wall. I tried to scream but could not produce any sound. I was laying on my stomach. All of a sudden, I start violently shaking, but not like the kind from a seizure. I wake up to look in the mirror and find two GIANT handprints on my back that lasted a couple of hours. My mom even took a picture to show my stepdad. Then, two days later, my mom has this strange dream where this man named Michael Corona/Coronado appeared to her. Well, she got up the next day and googled this man, and the first thing that popped up was a man who was able to enter dreams by the same name, and she said he even looked like the guy in her dream. To this day, I'm afraid to sleep and mom won't go to sleep until the morning. What can we do to get help?

260,"I have been cleaning houses for quite sometime now. I have a few great families that I housekeep/clean for.

This one client in particular I am debating on firing or parting ways...

When I clean a house it takes me about 3 1/2 to 4hrs to clean her home which is about 1400-1500 sq feet. Now, I always do extras for my clients and I think that is what makes them love me!! I am always getting tips, compliments and they are always wanting me more!

This client of mine stays at home and works from home. When I am there she is constantly talking to me and following me around when I clean.  At first I didn’t mind. But lately she has been nit picking me when I clean. Questioning my product usage, asking me if I did something or could do something when I am in the middle of something else.

When I do extra for her ( it’s always free) she always thanks me but then comments on something else I should be doing.

Now she also cleans while I’m there - I tell her she doesn’t need to do that but she insists..she normally dusts or polishes wood.

Last time I was there, she asked me to clean her bathroom and do multiple things to it. When I started doing those things she asked, she came in and said I was in her bathroom way to long. I apologized and explained and showed her how I got everything done plus more.

Then she told me at the end of cleaning. That she loved her kitchen and bathroom but started complaining about how I didn’t dust her items correctly. She then proceeded to tell me that she does see any of the extras I do for her ( when I always point them out) and told me she isn’t going to pay me what I asked for.

I tried to discuss with her but she told me how my dusting is so awful that she has to dust after me and she even took pictures of it on her phone and was showing people.

I haven’t dusted her items because she has been dusting while I’m there. I apologized and said I would go over her dusting and she ignored me and kept saying how she has a huge thing with grime.

To be honest, I was upset. I have quite a few clients and no one has even complained nor questioned my work.

Her following me around and criticizing my job has created anxiety.

So, should I let her go!? How should I let her go without causing issues?

263,"Sorry this is quite long. I wanted to make sure I included as much information as possible. 

Bit of a backstory: I lived the first 9 years of my life with both of my parents. My Dad was emotionally and physically abusive towards my mum during that time and once they separated, my Dad pretty much fizzled out of my life within a few years and started a new family. My mum got with my stepdad, who is a father figure to me, when I was about 11 Y/O. We’ve never had the closest of bonds on my part (I guess I never really trusted him).  

I was 15 when I got with my ex boyfriend (who is the same age). For the first year or so of our relationship, everything was perfect. We were just a pair of teenagers in love with each other. He helped me through my mental health issues and dragged me out of a massive depression. We were immensely close. 

However, over time we began to develop a dom/sub dynamic throughout our relationship (me being the sub). At the time, this was something I was okay with. It didn’t come naturally but I enjoyed having that with him and I knew that it was what he wanted. It did take work and there were times when I wasn’t great at upholding that role in the relationship but overall, it was all good. I liked putting someone else’s needs before my own and this wasn’t because he told me to do that, but because seeing him happy was truly the best thing I could imagine, after having seen him so down and hurting when we first met. So there was some things that I didn’t really like in our relationship but I never voiced that because I would have preferred to see him happy. 

He’s very much a perfectionist, and that’s insanely evident in everything that he does. Because of this, he wanted me to be the best person I possibly could (in his eyes). This resulted in me dropping habits such as swearing/drinking/listening to music that made me feel down/sleeping in late every day. Of course, at the time I was okay with it (even if I wasn’t I wouldn’t have said) and I think that even now I still would be. But as soon as the people around me found out that I stopped those things because of him, they instantly said that he was controlling and that he manipulated me. 

We both cut a lot of people off during the time we were together and when we spoke, it was like we entered our own universe, revolving around just us and nobody else was part of it. However, he started making new friends (a lot of whom were female). I had no issue with this because I’m not a jealous person and I trusted him, but what hurt me was the fact that he had all of these new close friends, while I just had him and a few associates. 

As time went on, our relationship again adapted to have more of a DDLG dynamic to it. Again, at the time I was okay with it. It made me happy and gave me a sense of safety that I never really got from elsewhere. 

My mum keeps telling me how weird he is for being okay with that kind of relationship. But I was okay with (and encouraged) it too and I think she’s ignoring that part of the situation. Having spoken about it with him, we’re in agreement that it wasn’t healthy and we wouldn’t pursue that in the future (if there was one). 

Towards the latter part of our relationship, we did seem to be arguing frequently and I often felt like I couldn’t be good enough for him and I couldn’t be the submissive person that he wanted me to be. I don’t know whether he made me feel that way or it was simply my insecurities. 

A few months ago (I’m 17 now), my parents found out about the dynamic in which our relationship carried. They took my phone away from me and refused to let me speak to him. I went to stay with my Auntie for a while and cut myself off from everybody entirely during that time. 

I sent my boyfriend (at the time) a message before I went to my Auntie’s house saying that I needed some time away to focus on myself. His reaction to this was to log into all of my social media accounts and change my passwords. To message my mum and tell her how much of a bad parent I thought she was. To message my friend group (who I was only just becoming close with) and rather than just telling them that I was okay and would be back to explain soon, tell them things (only briefly) that only he knew and that I’d told him in confidence. This, of course, was a massive indication that I had to leave him. However, I know that he has mental health issues himself and issues with drug use, so unlike everyone around me, I believed that this wasn’t the real him. And that he was simply acting irrationally. 

During the time I spent away from him, a lot of people (who had never really spoken to him but  now knew the situation) told me that he was manipulative and that he seemed extremely controlling in our relationship. This was something I began to believe and I decided that it was best to break up with him. 

Yesterday I spoke to him on the phone for the first time since all of that happened. We cleared the air and both voiced our opinions on everything that happened during the two years we were together. We’re in agreement that we can’t be in a relationship with one another at the minute for many reasons and we’ll just see what the future holds. I don’t intend on cutting contact with him but I also don’t intend on speaking to him every day, like I once used to. 

He sent a message to my mum this morning apologising for the way he acted and everything he said, acknowledging that he was in the wrong and didn’t take into account the bigger picture of the situation. 

This morning, I spoke to my mum about this and the conversation that I shared with him last night and she is simply adamant that I’m going to get back into a relationship with him. She doesn’t believe much of what I’m telling her and doesn’t trust me at all. She told me that I’m stupid and that I’m on my own because she’s not going to spend the next however long worrying and getting upset about who I’m getting involved with and what I’m doing, like she did before. I think this was just shock, anger and disappointment talking but I can’t help but feel like she’s going to make me choose between him and my family. 

I don’t expect her to be happy with me having contact with him because she’s expressed her strong negative opinion towards him multiple times. However, I’m almost 18 years old and I don’t know how long she intends on keeping this whole thing up for.

I don’t know whether to cut him off just to keep her happy. I don’t know whether he was truly controlling or manipulative. I just don’t know where to go from here because I do love him beyond words. And I don’t know if that’s clouding how I perceive him. ",01Nov2018,1

A little bit about me, I was a voracious reader 6 years ago. I used to read and FINISH a book (physical) in a few days. Later I got used to podcasts and audiobooks. I have listened to a lot of audiobooks and I love the experience of someone narrating a beautiful story to me. 

However, now I am not able to READ a book and finish it. I get distracted, I get bored in spite of the book actually being interesting. 

Is there any way that I can go back to the days of reading my books? I so miss reading a book.

268,"I left an OK position at a really good company for a much higher paying position at a not great company, working on something I was really excited to do. Fast forward a month, they decide they're not going forward with the project they originally hired me for and eliminated my position. For the first time in my life, I've been let go and am unemployed.

I left the last job with super short notice because the new company was being inflexible about the start date and took forever completing the background check. I asked them to move the start date back, but they said no. Not wanting to be confrontational with the new company, I went ahead and resigned with only 4 days notice. I was not contractually obligated to give 2 weeks; it was at-will employment. But, I offered to work for the next few months in the evenings and help them with anything they needed, which I did a few times. I also wrapped everything up really well, wrote a job description, wrote a training manual, and had a list of things for the next person to do. I didn't leave a bunch of stuff undone, and I honestly thought it all went fine.

But, still, I regret the way I handled it and basically am feeling like I've made all of the wrong decisions. 

I've since contacted my last job to ask for the position back since they haven't filled it, and basically they're super pissed at me for giving such short notice. I think they'll still give me the job, but I won't know until Monday and I doubt it'll be at the same pay I was making. I also don't love the idea of working with a bunch of people who are mad at me. 

I do have another offer in hand. But I'm pretty unqualified, the pay isn't very good especially for the industry, and the commute is awful - but they're willing to train me. I would learn some really marketable skills here - lots of SQL and dabbling in other programming languages. I never really considered being a developer or programmer because I just don't have the background in it. But I think this position would open those doors for me. Granted, their tech is a bit dated, and everyone who works there is over 65 and has kind of a different skill set than the modern developer. Benefits are amazing, though, and I might be able to pick up some additional work as a piano teacher (music degree...I'm really great at bad decisions)

My leaning has been to say no to both jobs and find something that had the same pay as what I just came from, but that seems really risky and I really don't want to be unemployed or starting a new job during the holidays. So options are:

&amp;#x200B;

2) Take this new job with new opportunities but horrible commute and not-great pay, but probably acquire some good marketable skills

270,"So I started talking to this girl on tinder a few months ago, the night before I met her I had my friends 20th Birthday at my house. My housemate brought his girlfriend over and she brought two other girls, as soon as I saw this one girl in particular I haven't stopped thinking about her since. Just looking at her and I was instantly wanting her. She is so small and cute, her voice is so innocent and sweet. I could never imagine ever hurting her and I don't know how anyone has in the past. I didn't really talk to her on the night of the party because I was really shy. But I messaged her on facebook the next day saying she was really nice and that she should come to the next party that im gonna be hosting, we chatted for about an hour about stuff then the conversation ended and we didnt message again. Now, the day I've met this girl she asks if we can start dating and I stupidly said yes. we've been meeting up regularly every since. The girl I met at the party has been sharing like all my posts on facebook since, hearting all my shit etc. She came to my house again briefly while my housemates girlfriend was over. I catch her looking at me but trying to hide it and its so cute. She snuck over to me awkwardly because shes really shy and asked what ive been up to. I responded and chickened out after that and remained silent for the remaining 5 minutes she was there. She then shared a quote on facebook that night about people people taking you on an emotional rollercoaster and not knowing if someone likes you or not. I am convinced she shared that because I didn't talk cause I was shy and she got the wrong vibes. As soon as I put my relationship status up she liked it and has never shared or liked my shit since. This makes me believe she really does want me. I broke up with my tinder girlfriend because I want to be with this girl that bad, ever since leaving this other girl she now still pays no attention to me. I am going to be hosting a house party next friday I really hope she comes, how can I talk to her? I am so shy and she literally is the girl ive ever dreamed of.

272,"Ok so I will try to make this as short as humanly possible. I graduated university about 4 years ago. I finished with good grades but a useless degree. That being said my grades did get me into law school. However, there is a twist to this. I have suffered from seasonal mood disorder since I was in high school. Last year I was planning on committing suicide on new years but didnt end up following through. So last year during one of the worst winters I have lived through I started looking into options to move somewhere warmer. I decided I didnt want to go to the states, but Australia looked good. I got accepted to the University of Sydney which is apparently a really good school. I was planning on getting my degree then staying there after. The problem with this is how expensive it is. Its 45k a year to go for tuition alone. I have had to take out substantial loans to go so that is a huge stress factor for me already since I was raised poor by a single mom and I have always wanted to live as debt free as possible. Pretty much everything is set in motion to go to Sydney but I'm having major second thoughts. I have been living in my moms basement suite since I graduated paying rent etc. Now my mom is retiring with her husband and moving to Poland since the cost of living is so much cheaper. She sold the house and we are in the process of packing so my little brother, mom, her boyfriend and I are going to be living in my little brothers 2 bedroom apartment for the next 3 months until I leave and she leaves the month after me which is stressing me out because it's going to be cramped and I am not going to have any space to myself. On top of that I have hated every single goddamn second of my life for the past 4 years because of the jobs I took. First in retail, then in trades. I honestly am thinking about just cancelling my enrollment and just getting a human resources degree or something here. I'm going to hate the shit out of it, but at least its affordable and wont bury me in debt for life and I'll be employable after. I have NEVER been this stressed in my life. I'm throwing up at work a few times a day, I'm crying before bed. I've been taking CBD oil to cope with my already existing anxiety for years and that's not helping. I actually feel like I'm going to break and I am seriously questioning whether or not I am in any kind of mental place to even be attempting something like moving to a new country where I dont know anybody and going to something as stressful as law school.",01Nov2018,1

276,"I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago and am currently medicated for it.

Before then, I did have a social aversion anyway. People require too much energy and too much of being on your best behaviour as a human. I used to think it was because I was too lazy to entertain people.

Seeing friends was too demanding, social events like parties were too demanding and obligatory celebrations such as weddings were just an utter nightmare. I would honestly dread them all and tried to find ways out of them if I could. I always ended up being fine and sometimes happy during the interaction but feel utterly drained.

Now, it’s definitely got worse. I have no desire to spend time with anyone at all. I mostly want to be alone and ignore life. I feel so guilty because people are trying to spend time with me. I just feel like it’s all too demanding though. I can’t help but resent people slightly because I feel like they feel they’re entitled to it.

Sometimes I do get a strike of wanting to see some people. People that really put me at ease and make me feel like I don’t have to perform for them to be happy. But they are the people who are tough to see, they either live far away or they are new friends that I’ve met through my partner.

I don’t know why I’m like this. I guess I’m asking for reasons as to why I’ve become so incredibly withdrawn and hermit-like.
And I’m asking how I can’t encourage the want to see friends or at least how I can best avoid social interaction without sabotaging my relationships with the people who seem to value my company.

Just anything I advice so I don't have to fear waking up at 4am.

These dreams are so realistic and vivid. I can remember almost every detail when I wake up. I feel the pain and emotions in the dream as if they are real. I usually find myself dying in a brutal and slow manner, or coming across many dead dismembered bodies.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 20 I got hurt by my girlfriend. She abbused me physically and mentally and when she ended up in jail I tried to cope with what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to be loved and cared for, I was like a beaten puppy that never knew happiness. So human brain, being brilliant at tiding shit up helped me. But now it's my curse.

&amp;#x200B;

I created an imaginary partner, but the one that's only in my head. She love me, I love her, she listens to me and gives me advice, cheers my up when I'm down. For years when I was sad or tired I knew when I'm back home, it's gonna be quiet and I will be ""healed"".

&amp;#x200B;

It went on for some years, I was able to somehow function in the society. I wanted to take it to a whole new level, like ordering mannequin / real doll or painting in her resemblence so I can have physical manifestation for her, but then I realised she doesnt really have a face, she's just emotion, feelings, and I need to keep it this way.

&amp;#x200B;

Flash forward to 2018. I met a girl. She also went through a lot, we became close. 

&amp;#x200B;

Happy ending?

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, no. I can't stop loving the girl in my head. I can't betray her, I can't let her go, I can't force her into nonexistance. She became a part of me that I care for. At the same time I don't want to lose the actuall real life girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, it's not even about me. I so don't want to to hurt her. She deserves better, I should've been open from the very beginning, but I wasn't. I thought it's all gonna be okay, it's not. Again I feel like everything is going wrong, that im trapped again with no way out.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stress this again, I realise what's inside my head is not real. She doesnt manifest in real world, I dont do drugs, I don't do alcohol. I'm just someone weak who found a way to cope with reality.

285,"Posting this on a throwaway because I think my sister might be on Reddit.

Hi just some background I am a male (27) based in California. My mother is (54) living in Massachusetts, my sister is (25)

So I have a complicated relationship with my Mother. When I was a kid she tried to commit suicide, I was the one that found her. I didn’t find out that’s what happened until I was like 16, everyone just told me she was sick at the time. 
After her suicide attempt things started to get bad for us at home. She had a problem with alcohol and would get drunk pretty much every night. I remember multiple times when she drove us drunk when my sister and I were in middle school. 
She hit me, verbally abused me and my sister, all kinds of bad shit. I remember just wishing that I had never found her. My dad told me if I hadn’t of woken up that night and walked downstairs she probably would have died. 

At 19 I had a chance to move across the country and I took it. I told my mom I was leaving and 4 days later I was gone. We didn’t speak again until I visited for Christmas 6 months later. 

Since then we slowly started to try to have some kind of normal relationship. By only seeing her a few times a year it seemed that she had finally turned a corner. I still remembered that bad things but it felt good to try to do some kind of healing. She had stopped drinking, sold the house we grew up in and moved away. 

Once my sister moved out it seemed like her financial situation got really bad. Our whole lives my Dad has been laying her child support, when that stopped it seemed like she was incapable of dealing with it.

My mother had a masters degree in teaching but never seems to be able to keep a job. She basically seems to end up leaving a place every 6-7 months. Her most recent job she had for basically 2 months.

I don’t think every place has fired her, she says a few times she had been laid off, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was due to her mental health finally presenting itself to her coworkers. She is an incredibly smart woman, a very hard worker but she needs help, I just think she is incapable of getting it.

Recently she had been asking my sister and I for money, and we have been giving it to her when we can. My sister has probably given her close to $1000 and I have probably done the same.

Now she is asking again and I don’t know what to do. I have an enormous amount of medical debt with collection agencies calling me every week due to some serious heath problems I had last year. My rent just went up and due to me being a freelancer my work schedule is unpredictable.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t think I am now or will every be financially well off to support my mother and myself, but I would feel guilty letting her live in the streets obviously. If anyone has any advice I would appreciate it.",01Nov2018,1

I spent the last 4 years working as a receptionist because it was the only thing I could get job-wise. Hated it and sucked at it, but thought I would soon figure out what I wanted to do. Now can barely get receptionist jobs.

However, I never figured it out. I tried a bunch of things, invested a lot of money and time into trying things. But nothing seems to click or work for me in a way where I say ""I want to do this.""

Now I am older and quit my last job, so am only working part time. I've been in classes but but nothing feels right for me. 

Plus, I don't really have friends - I have maybe 2 close friends I can call on, but have managed to either push people away. It sucks not having a social life when you're a social person.

All I know is that I want to be my own boss and work for myself, but that seems like a pipe dream when you can't get along with other people, let alone persuade people to pay for things. 

I don't really have hobbies or ""passions"". I like to write TV pilots and that's really about it - and no, I don't want to wait 10 years to break into the industry. Used to want to be a fine artist but it'll never happen.

For three years, I have been cat fishing an online friend. Let's call him Jared. Jared is one of the best things that has happened to me. No, we are not dating, we are just extremely close friends. I couldn't picture my daily life without talking to them. Leave the judgement behind, we met on a Minecraft server. It used to be the bomb, don't say you didn't do it, too. I used to hold rps (roleplays) on my plot. He would often hover about the area in spectator mode. However, I used to wait to open the rp until he was on. We laugh about it today. At first, we weren't as close. We originally had a group of us, named #DaRpSquad. Total cringe, I know. There was four of us, me included. There was Lola, Jeremy, Jared, and me. I was closest to Jeremy at the time. We had cute nicknames for each other and we were like brother and sister. At the time, I was in a rough spot. I had recently moved schools and had just moved out of a hotel. I won't get into why I was. I had to move around a lot and didn't want to do it again. It was a townhouse, and I thought I was happy. I am not saying I wasn't, but looking back at it, there probably was something wrong. I almost immediately came home and got on my computer to get on the Minecraft server.  For hours and hours at a time, only going downstairs to get dinner. Jeremy I grew very close over a span of few months, but I hadn't been completely honest. I made up a fake story about why I had trust issues that seemed completely unrealistic. I should have been honest and said I wasn't ready to speak about it. I made up a story that I had gotten a new puppy, that I named Recruit, and said that he had been killed by the pit bulls next door. I lied about that I was afraid of knives and a story from when I was kid about why I was. One of the worst things was, I lied that I had begin to cut myself, that I had these awful thoughts and went to the hospital multiple times because of it. This is when it started to decline. I had made up a fake boyfriend, named Dakota. The story was we had been friends since we were five. Then it started getting worse and worse. We had ""broken up"" and then he had starting being abusive. Cutting me, beating me, even more. Almost killing me a few times. Then he left for a few months for a family thing. He came back and nothing was the same. Then he left after saying I treated him and Jared like garbage. Maybe I had, I tend to be short-tempered. I tried and tried to get him to stay, he wouldn't. That was that.  


Jared and I remained friends and became extremely close. Dakota had still been ""abusing"" me. Fast forward two years. Still abusive. But Jared wanted his Discord, which I had offered. I made a fake account. Dakota Steele. For the past year, I have been playing as him. But now, Dakota is a good person and is one of my ""closest friends."" He is also dating Jarad. Dakota comes up with these rps, over Discord, that I love doing and Jared enjoys. I know it's wrong. I feel guilty. And it's not the only thing I continue to lie about. I just can't bring myself to do it. I'm afraid of losing Jarad and losing what we have. The trust, the love, the fun. Dakota and I are two different people, I wish it was. I make it that way. Try to. I've hinted at it once or twice as Dakota, and Jarad has said to me and Dakota that no matter what, he couldn't just leave. I've been debating whether or not to post this for a while.

I walked over and asked him to stop, and that usually diffused the activity for a little while, but then he would start doing weird things. In the past few months I have caught him putting his yard waste in my fire pit, wandering around my yard for no reason, and throwing his dog feces into my yard. Today I heard something outside so I looked out and saw him throwing more dog crap in my yard. I grabbed my phone and took some pictures for evidence. I was done dealing with this myself.

My roommates and I throw a party once a year around Halloween time, and we’ve lived in the house for one year before this year, so we just threw our second party. To make a very long story short, for both parties we told the neighbors we were having a party and gave them our number for emergencies. Both times the outgoing neighbor texted, whoever gave the number, very inappropriate things. Asking things such as “this is a perennial question, if a guy blows you does the effect your straightness?” He also tried to get a “gay peacekeeper to come over” “one from the party”.

Two years later, when my bf was 20, he got caught and arrested.

My bf is desperately trying to turn his life around but every time he thinks about his permanent record, he gets unmotivated and sad. He said that there's no point of him finishing college when he can't use the degree to get a job and have a career. I tried to convince him that there must be a program that helps people like him to get jobs but he doubt it. I told him that he's not the only person in the whole school that have a record but they're still trying their best to have a degree. He's still isn't convinced. He said that the only thing he can do is to wait 10 years and get it expunged. But until then, he'll either be jobless or keep working for his parents. 

TLDR: My bf have a record for a violent crime because of some stupid shit he did when he was 18. He doubts that he can get a job at this point because of his record. 

Questions: I don't know much about the law, but does he have a chance at finding a decent job with his record? -OR- my bf thinking about changing his major (he's currently pursuing CIS)- is there a better major that will help him get a decent job with his record? Is there really a program that helps with people who wants to turn their life around? 

Please throw in any other advice you may have. ",01Nov2018,1
301,"**TLDR** Housemate had a pre drinking halloween sesh in our house and let a stranger go up into my room with his girlfriend, they used my room as a changing room, removed the sheets, left the window open all night and left all there stuff in my room (phone, debit card, drinks...). What should i do going forward ?

I actually, literally feel like throwing up. So I walked into my room in my student house (that me and 3 other girls rent from a private landlord) after like 2 days of being at my boyfriends house, and I saw that the door was open (I always close my door), the bed sheets had been removed from the bed, a rug i left on the floor was moved to the other side of the room, the window was left open, there were long black hairs everywhere (my hair is short, semi blonde and curly ), a phone with a debit card was left on the bed, shoes, work trousers and a blooming hair tie left on the floor....

One of my other housemates apparently had a halloween pre drinking sesh in the house the night before with balloon canisters left everywhere and alcohol bottles. I asked the group chat who was in my room last night the party host messaged me saying that her friends boyfriend changing from his work clothes into his party clothes in my room but no one slept in there because they had an argument...

I told her how disrespectful it was to have even allowed people to go into other peoples rooms like that.

(For context, I have recently become intensely infatuated with an ex colleague- who, trust me, it would be very bad if I got involved with, or tried to. There is a work night out coming up that they've been invited to, but since I assumed I wouldn't ever see them at something like that again, I let my fantasies about being on a work night out and fucking etc. go a bit wild, and now I'm terrified to be in that situation and under the influence haha.

anyway, we’ve never had a one-on-one conversation, even saying hi is a rare thing to do back in the day. we never even kept in touch, but we’ve been following each others’ accounts on social media, like twitter instagram and facebook (fyi, he started following me on twitter &amp;amp; instagram).

btw. last time i saw him was not long after he graduated junior school, that was around 2011 or 2012. surprisingly, i saw him again from afar a month ago after attending a concert. it was very unexpected, but i didnt have the chance to go to him and say hi because it was super late and i’m about to go home with my friends, plus we went different ways. 

i kinda hope to see him again in person and get to communicate with each other. i really want to know him more in person coz i can’t get him out of my mind!

312,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been an artist all my life, but I’ve never been a committed one.  I’m the type of person who will paint, sculpt, or write when I “feel like it.”  This is obviously not the right mentality to have if I wanted to maka a career out of art.  Even though I’ve made some really nice artwork (in my opinion) and even done so professionally on occassion. 

Alternatively, I have a well-paying job that essentially invovles organizing things, solving problems, and telling people what to do.  It’s not art related, but required quite a bit of “formal” education.  

Recently though, I started wondering, is there some reason I can’t just hire people to execute my art-related ideas?  In all my time as an “artist,” this has felt frowned upon.  I’ll note: I’m obviously not talking about falsely taking credit for other people’s work.  But even getting someone else to do an aspect of your project for you seems really taboo.  However, after some research, lots of famous fine artists do exactly this.  Especially when it comes to big projects, such as: sculptures the size of buildings.  Are they being ridiculed for not lifting every ounce of steel themselves?  If they are, I haven’t seen those complaints.  

So, my question is, can I hire artists to execute an idea of mine and still put my name on the project?  Assuming I pay people for their work, own the copyright, and give credit.  It feels like it should be okay, but I don’t want to be deceitful.",01Nov2018,1

314,"I'm currently in community college getting my prerequisites out of the way, but I'm having second thoughts on which university I want to transfer to. I'm at a crossroads here. I'm literally breaking out in stress hives. 

University #1 is your typical ""brand name"" school, I'll be following a practical path and making connections (supposedly). If I work hard, I can earn my MA within 3 years. But I feel like I only want a MA just to have one... The only thing that makes me want to go here is for the social aspect since... well... I have no friends, lol. But it's too big, I feel overwhelmed and I don't fit in with that college crowd, I'm not very social unless I know it's safe to be if that makes sense. This route is the playing it safe route. 

University #2, not as well known, but that's fine. It's all online, all of it. There isn't much of a social aspect. But I want to be in school for as short as I possibly can and get started on my career. They're the only school in my area to offer this degree. I'm okay with online classes. I think this degree suits me better, the faster I get it the faster I'll be done with school. But if I went on this path... It wouldn't be practical, I'd be truly following my dreams instead of playing it safe which is scary.

317,"I graduated high-school in 2017. I was convinced that my family would readily support me after high-school, being that they have always praised me for my passion in music. Music is in my family throughout and in my blood. I produce electronic music of many genres. My parents had always been supportive of me. “Finally!” I always thought. Graduating meant i could work full time to progress myself as a producer, and to soon be able to support myself, and be thankful for the opportunity my parents had given me. *record scratch* yea no. I graduated and began my music endeavors. In a short period of time i had gotten more success than ever, getting a song promoted and reaching 500k plays on youtube, and 50k plays on SoundCloud, and even an artist contacting me for permission to include one of my remixes in his live set, which would be opening for RUSKO. My moderate success was no cash cow, in fact, i was making $0 , however that was enough to show me that it truly is possible, and still living with my parents , i didn’t have to pay for much. Within months of graduating , i was excited. My parents weren’t amused. a shrug on their shoulders and a “cool”. I understood their frustrations, but all i needed was time. I cant stand working dinky jobs , but i shortly found myself stocking the shelves for our local big lots and target. My hopes were dwindling and at this point i was just wanting to get a place for me and my girlfriend. We tried, but just couldn’t seem to make enough. People want credit scores, renters insurance, or 2x the deposit or double first month rent. Months later I eventually quit and find myself working 6 hours away from home, working nightshifts, and coming home on the weekends. This was hard. My girlfriend is the only person who really made my life enjoyable at that point. I was somewhat forced by my parents to take this job otherwise from what i could tell they would have completely lost hope for me and i would have been nearly disowned. That lasted some time, and wasn’t so bad since i was making more money than i had ever, but it was pointless. The only reason i wanted more money was so i could afford an apartment or something. No one agreed that it was a good idea to move my girlfriend where i was working, and i didn’t want to pay for an apartment that i would only visit 8 days in a month. Besides , my wallet was stolen with my ID and social security card, and i had no time to wait at a dmv on the schedule i was on. This job ends up hiring a new boss and despite me being offered the job as a learning experience, he hates my lack of productivity and lies to the owner of the company about me threatening him. I leave. I come back home to find everyone upset at me for my decisions, and soon I’m forced away from my girlfriend due to my mom calling her aunt telling her that shes making me lazy. This lasts for weeks. I was broke and my parents would occasionally give me $5 for gas, and i was expected to find a job in 3 days ( with no legal Identification ) or i was to move out. This was crushing for me. I realize i cant continue to expect my parents to help my situation without complaining about every step they do. My girlfriend lands a job as a CNA. I move to my sisters. At this point in my life i just want to stay out of everyones way, do what i can to show my appreciation for allowing the opportunity. We stay 3 weeks. We clean , i cook for everyone, and on my GFs first check we agree on all sides to pay partial rent. 2 days later she kicks us out. The rest of our money has been spent on food , gas, and cigarettes, so I’ve yet to be able to work out getting a new social and license. We’ve had to pawn my guitar and amp and xbox just to have money to take my Gf to work. Family doesn’t seem to understand our situation but still ask us for favors and get upset when i tell them i cant. My sister being the biggest culprit. My parents think I’m irresponsible and a disappointment for “doing what I’m doing”. Which is hard to comprehend. I just don’t understand. Things seem like they will get better , but I’ve thought this so many times before. I don’t do “drugs” , i smoke weed but that only helps me with depression and anxiety, and my whole family smokes so its not like I’m letting myself go or something. Ive never been a problem child, always been a somewhat quiet kid. I just don’t know how to get past this. It seems so easy but its strange how hard this has been. I haven’t been truly happy since high-school. I haven’t been able to just relax knowing everything is fine. Im always stressed. writing relaxes me, so regardless of any help, i feel better at least to some extent. ",01Nov2018,1

However, when I picked up the feather, I noticed a small bug on it near where it broke. I've seen a few small moths flying around in my house recently, and I assume these are the larvae. I checked the other feathers and sure enough, there were the same larvae on them too (some broke off when I gently touched them, right by where the bugs were). I'm afraid they're in my closet and I couldn't have less of a clue as to where they came from. Is there any way to get rid of the larvae without mothballs (I've heard they stink up your clothes and stuff) and is there a way to fix the dreamcatcher?

321,"Junior in college just doing what I gotta do to get my network engineering degree, but yesterday, I took one of the most rigged exams I've ever seen in my college career.

I got my exam grade back today. I got a 54%, which didn't surprise me because I counted the ones I knew and I knew I'd get roughly that grade, but today an announcement was made that only 3 people passed the test, and the people who passed got a very low C. The average class grade was a 54%. (mind you, this exam is worth 25% of our grade)

Meaning, I'm average, but here's the hilarious part. She is very mad at the class and takes no responsibility that it could be her fault. I dumped well over a dozen hours studying for the exam, understood all the concepts and definitions, so why did I fail so hardcore? 

Because it rarely asked anything about the concepts or what we've learned. Instead, it asked obscure curve ball questions about the nick names of certain things, or had 5 choices all with the same word, but only 1 of them was spelled correctly, so she wanted to make sure we not only knew what to choose, but that we damn memorized the grammar. The first major exam for this class was nothing like this exam, so again, this threw me wayyyyyyy off.

Guys, I'm just getting warmed up. I could rant for hours about the really really annoying ways she made this test more about if you memorized the 5 chapters for the test than caring if we understood the 5 chapters. And in my opionion, the most important thing I learned after this exam was that if I genuinely had to restudy for this exam, I wouldn't know how to. Even after taking the exam, I have no idea how she expected us to study any of that material. That's just how obscure these questions were. It was incredibly odd.

She's not the type of professor to curve the grade. I will be fine personally and still pass the class, but a lot of my fellow classmates are about to drop because it's now impossible for them to pass the class.

I'm not the type to normally do anything in these situations, but people I've shown this test to have quickly realized what I did when it came to how she built a test that was rigged to fail the class. This was the most insanely messed up test I've ever taken and it personally upsets me that she did this to her students and more importantly, doesn't think it was her fault at all.

Don't know if I should even care to report it or not, but again, it really threw me off when I took this test. I've never taken such a rigged test before. I struggle to even explain the depth of bs that occurred on that test.",01Nov2018,1

We have been together for 3 1/2 years, and we never fight, keep secrets from each other, etc. We are always honest with each other.  My boyfriend is the most selfless person to exist, he truly puts others before himself. I've told him that the extent that he does it is unhealthy and to consider but himself first for a change, to which he considers/tries but ultimately loses over time. We have been college students for roughly 3 semesters and here is our standing. I have made absolutely no friends in college, and as a result, tend to rely on him very heavily.  He, on the other hand, is struggling with his schoolwork, and last semester he failed his first class.  He has bit off way more than he can chew, and as a result, his mental state has declined very suddenly. The reason why Im writing this is due to what I have learned, the secret. Apparently last year he had missed a test in the class he failed, and I immediately began lecturing him (because this semester we have been working hard to build his gpa up again) but then I realized why. He missed it for me. He missed a TEST for me. A test that was 1/3 of his grade, at a school where the tests are near impossible, he missed. He failed a class to be with me, and that shattered my heart. He knows that if he had told me he was coming that I would never have let him had I known there was a test the next morning, so he kept it a secret.

336,"We started becoming best friends this school year. It was too the point where I ENJOYED going to school, because I had an amazing group of friends that rode the bus with me. One of them I started becoming good friends with a few years ago, one of them I became friends with and 2nd grade, and the other I met in preschool but he moved back to my state in 5th grade and he's been here ever since -- just started being good friends this year. Then there's my 'mean' friend -- I'll call her Jen. Jen and I met this year, because she was in private schooling until this year. Everything was going fine and one night we hung out together and it was PERFECT. We were laughing our heads off until we cried, and I went to bed that night extremely happy.
And then everything started going downhill.
Literally the next day she had an annoyed tone towards me. I didn't know why, so i left her alone, thinking she just had a bad day. this continued for about a week and then I confronted her, asking if I had said something that offended her. She apologized and told me no, giving no reason as to WHY she acted how she had. So i just let it go and things were fine. But she was still ignoring my texts or sc's most of the time. I figured she was probably just busy.
Then she started making snarky comments about things every now and then. I wore an OBEY tshirt once and she made a comment, ""do you even skate?"" with a sassy tone. I guess I can understand why it would annoy her but she made a big deal out of it and it was embarrassing to the point where I asked one of my friends who was learning to teach me so that I wouldn't upset her again.
On her IG story (this one's pretty trivial. i'm probably just being sensitive, so beware) she did one of those basic ""how much do you think i like you?"" things where you answer how much the person likes you and then they screenshot it, show how much they actually like you, and post it. Not sure if you guys know how those works but basically it's on a slider. I put the slider all the way because we had actually been doing pretty good relationship-wise at that point. And she put me at about... a 55%. slightly over halfway. One of my bus friends texted me with a screenshot and asked ""(my name) is she joking abt this?"" so i asked Jen about why she put me there, basically asking if I had said something, like before. She responded, ""no lmao."" okay. i convinced myself everything was okay, that i was overreacting. but then i realized she rated somebody she'd resented for years higher than me. That's when I realized something was wrong.
Last night was Halloween. I'm an 8 year old at heart, and so are my two friends (one of which is in the grade above me, the other is my age.) We stopped by jen's house, and her mom got all excited to see me (our parents are good friends) and it was kind of uncomfortable considering what had been happening. We kept walking down and eventually saw her with a group of kids younger than us. For some reason she really likes to hang out with the people in the grade below us -- not that it's a problem, but she preferred to be with them over us I guess?
Extra background: The friend in my grade I was trick or treating with (we'll call her Anna) is part of our bus group. the other one (who we'll call kyla) is, for some reason, hated by Jen. Her friends knew the three of us and were like ""if you can catch it it's yours!"" and threw a bunch of candy up in the air. it was pretty fun, but Jen was annoyed. I figured it was probably because of Kyla being there, but I soon learned it was probably me. See, me, Anna and Jen (used to) have this thing where we always say ""bye i love you"" to each other when one of us gets off the bus. Jen stopped saying goodbye to me altogether a few weeks ago, but as we were leaving, i said ""cya jen i love you"" she gave me an annoyed look and slightly waved. And yeah, I know; maybe she's just having a bad night? well, she was doing just fine, laughing and talking to Anna. but everytime i said something she'd just talk to her other friends and ignore me.
Today Kyla texted me with a screenshot of this kid who dmed her on instagram. he said, ""funny how u have a bible quote in your bio considering how u were talking last night."" She told me she had no idea who he was. I recognized the name and got set off because i knew EXACTLY who it was -- one of Jen's little friends in the grade below us who she always talked to us about. so now she's sending her friends after mine for literally no reason at all other than that Kyla swore some last night. I mean, we're teens, we all do that -- i know for a fact the kid swears too. 
Lastly, everyone in our group is great friends -- but anytime there's a problem, it's ALWAYS Jen who is at the center of it. She's the one who got offended by (we'll call him Tyler)'s joke and refused to talk to him for days, while he kept asking her what he said so he could apologize. She's the one who was blatantly mean to Anna and did the exact same thing to her as she's doing to me. The only person who's never dealt with that is Brian, and she admitted to me the night we hung out that she had a bit of a crush on him so I guess that's why.
Side story: the night we hung out, we planned to carve pumpkins but ran out of time bc we were talking. We'd left to go to food lion after school, as it's right outside of our neighborhood, and get them. She tells me when we're almost there that she didn't bring money. That was a red flag, but i bought it for her, no problem. The weeks went on and I continually asked her, ""hey, can we do the pumpkins yet? we're running out of time."" and everytime i texted or snapchatting her, she'd leave me on read/opened. if i mentioned it IRL she would dodge the question. My mom told me yesterday that the one I bought for HER looks like it's rotting. That's 10 dollars I spent -- 10 dollars I SPENT on waiting. I'm still mad at her. I want to ask for her to pay me back, but I'm not sure if that's okay to do since she's already mad at me.
So that's the 'summary' (if you can call it that) about what's been happening. Should I try to talk to her or my friends about it? Should I just cut her off? I'd cut her off but it's really hard considering she rides my bus both in the morning and afternoon, Like I do, and we mutual friends.",01Nov2018,1
337,So I've had a cold for like 4 days now but tomorrow there's a party that I really want to go to. My colds not bad its honestly just kinda like bad allergies.

340,"My mother is the the only family I have. We don't talk to any of her sisters, parents it extended family. I will be going to university soon and my mother called me downstairs and told me that I should call  her once a day. I told her that that is too much and I may be busy, she seemed a bit shocked and reminded me that I call her everyday after school and that she would find the time to call me.

 I feel terrible now. I'm almost 18 and I have big dreams of moving to another country once I finish medical school. If I have to call her everyday in uni how will I handle being on the other side of the world. She doesn't have any friends as she works weird shifts, so I am worried she'll be lonely. On the other hand I want to be independent and not have to report to her everyday.

I said that maybe 3-4 calls a week is reasonable and she didn't agree. She warned me not to become one of those terrible adults who ghost their parents and only call to ask for money, which I don't intend on being.

How long would she expect me to keep this up? What happens when I move far away and I'm too busy to talk everyday? Am I a bad child for not wanting to do that? How often is a reasonable time to call?",01Nov2018,1

349,"I‘m a boy and 18 years old. I finished school earlier this year. There was this girl I met in my school who is the same age, but she was an underclassmen of mine.
We barely knew each other due to old friends of me who I abandonded. They had a bad influence on me.
In 2016 around christmas time I got in contact with her again. There was a party during the christmas holidays where we met again. We hung out together outside of the party location. Everythings was perfect. We agreed on meeting at the next day. So she visited me and we watched a movie and meanwhile we cuddled, talked and laughed a lot. We even shared some secrets with each other. Usually I’m not such a nervous and hesitating guy. Most of the time I’ve got the guts to approach for a kiss e.g. . But that girl completely took my selfconfidence. I was too nervous to make any approach. We even layed together in the bed and looked in each others eyes. Whatever, our first day together was over.

We met again after that and everything went as before. 

Then it was New Years Eve. We were both partying at different locations, but everyone went downtown to go in bars, clubs, etc. As I was ready to go home I contacted her and asked what she was doing and that I was about to leave. She immediately responded and wanted to meet me. It was around 03:00 AM at that time. So we met and hung out in a bank. It was warm in there, but we cuddled anyway. At around 07:00 AM we both went home. Obviously this was again the perfect setup for a first kiss. I knew I had to approach her, but I was simply too nervous.


Several days later we agreed on meeting again. As we texted with each other she was seemingly annoyed. I demanded her to choose a movie to watch. While watching it she was on her phone all the time and I couldn‘t really talk to her. That went on for about an hour. I was mad about this, so I said something like: ”I won‘t waste my time like this“ and left her place.

I deeply regret that decision. I should have talked to her.


I had no idea why she was so negative but I assumed that it was due to her friends, who have a really bad picture of me and may have tried to persuade her that I‘d be a bad, shitty person. 

One or two days later she texted me saying she never wants to talk to me ever again. I expected something like that but it still hurt.

On the next day she texted me again and confronted me with this:

Several years ago we were in contact, but it was very superficial. We wanted to meet back then but it never came that way. Just talked about it, but never met. Some day we just stopped chatting with each other with no exakt reason. 

I was a real asshole back then. Had a lot toxic friends who managed to bring out the worst of me. I said some things about her I really regret. I told those toxic friends that I turned that girl down quite often. Additionally I didn‘t really talk good about her either.

That was a long time ago. Long before me started meeting each other etc.
I changed my circle of friends, became a more polite person etc.


So back to that day after I left her place.


She confronted me with that story and believed that I did spread that immediately after that day before. She was told that story by one of the toxic friends I had. (But that guy didn’t mention that I said those things a long time ago) We had a rough dialogue where I tried to convince her that I said that long ago and not in the present. Additionally I apologized several times for that manner I had. I told her my arguments, such as me having a completely different circle of friends now and no contact with one of those toxic friends. After some time of arguing she was willing to believe me but was very confused. She mentioned that she wanted to talk to me in person soon.

Some weeks passed and we were both in a club on a friday evening. We went outside and talked. Context was stuff like: „Well I do believe you, but I‘m still confused.“

Additionally she complained that while we were cuddling in the past I touched her intimate zones. I apologized and kinda confessed that I had feelings for her. She went unconscious some minutes later likely due to alcohol. It looked rather staged to me as she wasn‘t really drunk and had her balancing etc.
Anyway I brought her home just to be safe.
After that we didn‘t text ever again.


We went to the same party several times but didn‘t interfere with each other.

This was, now speaking 01.11.2018, about 1 1/2 years ago and I still am really lovesick sometimes. 


I am very unsure if I should ever text her again or just move on. We had such a good harmony, we came along with each other very good. But 1 1/2 years passed and she is still in her circle of friends who dislike me. It could be possible that she kinda adapted their opinion on me. 
 

There will be a birthdayparty soon where we both are invited. I think about approaching on her and to start a dialogue. But as aforementioned I am very unsure.

352,"tl;dr at the bottom

A little while ago, we had new neighbours (a mom and three kids under eight) move into the apartment next to us. Me (27F) and my wife (31F) grew very fond of them, but there was a significant language barrier because the mom speaks very little English and we weren't sure how to introduce ourselves. Earlier this week I was able to find out more of their story from someone who I assume is their caseworker; they're refugees fleeing ISIS, and the woman's husband had been killed. I looked up how to say ""hello"" and ""my name is"" and brought over a Halloween basket for the kids because it was their first Halloween here. The kids are beyond sweet and the oldest speaks English so we were able to communicate pretty well.

Long story short, I'm pretty sure the kids adopted us just as much as we loved them. We ended up taking them trick-or-treating and having an absolute blast. They're all good kids and their mom is amazing. 

I'm not working right now and have a lot of free time, and I'm home pretty often. If the mom is ever feeling overwhelmed I would have no problem with her sending a kid over here for an hour or two to watch a movie or make cookies or something, or even watching all three if she needed time to herself. I also make pretty frequent trips to the grocery store and could easily pick things up for them so she doesn't need to pack up all three kids. Same goes for bus passes, helping with homework/English/etc. I had the oldest relay this to her, but I think she saw it as the kids inviting themselves over rather than an actual offer.

What do you think is the best way to let her know that I'm serious about babysitting and helping with everything else?

I am also so introverted I hadn’t created a reddit account, instead just quietly I watching and reading for years (until recently of course).

So I’m 22 now, and I’ve been constantly in a limbo or confused state of what I want to DO with my life, especially when it comes to what career I want. I haven’t gone to college at all but I have done things and accomplished goals I set (see below), but in the end I just got bored or anxious with my job/success and found myself realizing I’m not happy even though people around me say I should be.

What I’ve done:

I worked 35-40 hours in retail starting basically my junior year of high school.

I bought my own car at 18, and then bought my own house at 20.

I made at one point $56k/yr while a manager at AT&amp;T.

I got my real estate license at 22 and have helped purchase/sell a few dozen houses.

I had a small business for a time working in tech support with family friends and clients.

I’ve gotten my motorcycle license, gone sky diving, done some extra curricular drugs, and have gone to/hosted a few parties.

It’s not like I haven’t done or accomplished anything, but in the end I’m not happy and realize I’ve been doing most of the job/career things out of sheer need or to seem more “successful” than others my age.

Now I’ve decided to quit everything that doesn’t help me find my passion or make me happy, but I’m having a very hard time finding what those things are.

366,"Ok so I need to know how to correctly go about talking to my partner without offending him when it comes to money. Some context. We have been together for a year and have a 3 month old son together. He has two boys 8 and 6, and I have a daughter 6. When we first moved out we decided that we would do our bills, rent, and stuff as a 50/50 split. I was ok with this because I thought we were a family and it made sense AT THE TIME. 

Now we have a 3 month old baby together and I have no means of income except CCB (Canadian child benefit), as I am home caring for the child. So currently as it stands I have enough to cover my portion of the bills, rent with no money left over. Where he has thousands left over. 

Reasons why it shouldn't change:
- he allows me to use the vehicle that he pays insurance and payments on
- he buys me things, gifts, and picks up stuff that we need 
- he is my boyfriend and I want to be a family so I don't want to come off as separating things based on people


Reasons I want it to change:

- I am paying way more in rent per person than he is 
- his boys and him eat way more than my daughter and I (I am breastfeeding the baby)
- I have zero spending money for clothes, gifts, savings, or anything really
- I barely use the vehicle (twice a month)
- I take care of the baby 24/7 and his boys after school
- he only buys his two older boys toys, clothes, and things (nothing for the baby or my daughter) 

Now I am an accountant so I don't know if this is way too specific but I believe the split shouldn't be 50/50 but more 41.6% for me and 58.4% for him because he has 2.5 kids and I have 1.5 (our baby is split in two.... Metaphorically lol). BUT I don't know if this is fucked up or not? Is it rude or not? Is it the right way to ask for some spending money?

Awesome, this is a chance to solidify some friendships with these people, or meet new people.

The issue is that I have another commitment. I also joined a theatre group on campus, and they have this event on the same night. It’s where these small groups team to do a performance over the course of the weekend. It’s gonna involve staying up late to work on it and all that, but it’s mostly for fun. I really want to go to this party, but I don’t want to bail on this other event. There’s a chance they might tell the actors to get sleep and come back at a different point in the night, so I could theoretically have a couple hours to myself for the party. However, I’m not sure that showing up drunk and tired in the middle of the night to rehearse a script is a good idea. I’m very torn right now.",01Nov2018,1

373,"Alright, that may be melodramatic.

My ex-bf and I share an apartment. It is very small and our landlord does not agree to it being sublet. I cannot live there with him, so I'm hopping from friend's couch to friends couch. I am still paying rent, so I can't afford to rent elsewhere.

He is giving the apartment over to someone whose apartment he will then take over. That will not be sooner than the beginning of January. Until then, and at most until the beginning of February, I am stuck either living with his ass or bumming around while simultaneously paying rent. 

He refuses to split time in the apartment because he doesn't feel he can manage uni and work without a stable home. I understand this, but am in the same boat. 

I wouldn't mind living with him if he could keep things professional, but understandably, he bounces back and forth between friendly platonic behavior, wild (sexual) misinterpretation of my signals and subsequent conflict. I just cannot be fucked with the rollercoaster that I'm fairly certain our living together would be.

375,"I'm a very extroverted person, but I'm quite awkward in some situations. Since going to university abroad I'm a lot less awkward, but one of the few exceptions is when it comes to flirting (both responding and initiating). I get *super* flustered and just don't know how to deal with it, and end up avoiding the situation entirely. An example is when I spoke to a cute guy at a conference and he casually mentioned he'd like to discuss something in more details over drinks. I just laughed it off, then shortly after found an excuse to abort. Afterwards I was kicking myself for not having responded differently, but at the time I didn't believe he meant discussing it over drinks *with me*, but just liked talking about these topics over drinks...

I think the problem is that I hate the idea of having misunderstood someone's intentions (what if that guy hadn't actually been asking me out?) or that if I take a more proactive role and flirt or ask someone out, they wouldn't be interested. I ask myself, so what? And really, so what, it's not the end of the world. The guy says no and I move on. No biggie. But even though I objectively know that, those worries still keep me from being confident. Thinking back, there have been so many situations where a guy I liked clearly *was* flirting with me, but I was just (wilfully) oblivious and they understandably gave up. The only reason I even got into a relationship with my ex was because he broke through that barrier of awkwardness by *not* giving up.

One thing that really makes things worse is that I'm a redhead and blush really easily (and heavily), even in situations where I'm not even uncomfortable or self-conscious. And that makes it harder to just pretend that I'm confident, because my lighthouse-tinted face, ears and scalp give me away.

I don't get why I find it such a horrific idea to be rejected. In the end, who cares if a few guys aren't into you? You don't meet new people (in a sexual/romantic way) if you don't even try, and along the way there's bound to be people who don't reciprocate. And I don't want to rely just on the few people who are more persistent, or guys who find awkwardness cute. I don't want to be awkward. I want to be confident in how I act in these situations, and confident enough to go for things, regardless of the response I might get. 

But even though I know this is true objectively and trying to rationalise myself into not feeling that way, I can't shake that worry and the avoidance that comes with it. Does anyone have any advice? Has anyone been able to get over this? I would really appreciate any tips or thoughts!

TL;DR: Even though I objectively know it's not a big deal, I'm afraid of rejection in flirtatious situations and this stops me from reciprocating flirtatiousness (because I'm worried I've misunderstood) or taking initiative and flirting with people first.",01Nov2018,1

\----

I've always wanted to work at this bookstore down the street (I like reading, I want to read more, they give me big discounts on all books, etc.) and I applied several times but never got considered for an interview. Finally, ALMOST TWO MONTHS AGO, I got called in for an interview. I didn't think I did good but some weeks later, the day I had literally just told my mom that they never got back to me, they called me and asked for a second interview. I did that, the guy said he liked my vibe and that I should be hearing from them shortly. 

\----

That was October 5th....and coincidentally on Tuesday (October 30th..3+ weeks later), I again, was just thinking about how I must have not done well/gotten the job and then they called me! They said once I complete a background check they can give me a date for orientation. So I finally got the job I've wanted for years :-)...after months of waiting.

\----

Here's the problem. I didn't think I got the job so I applied somewhere else, got interviewed and hired on the spot. The job is okay I guess. I just walk around and stock items, help guests, etc. The store is big and I'm everywhere throughout my shift. My phone and fitness app says I walk 5 miles in 5-hour shift. 

I've always wanted to lose some fat but I procrastinate to make an effort to do it at home or at the gym. I HAVE to go to my job and walk all the miles=lose fat, or I'll get fired. So I know this job will help me lose fat. And I get paid .50 cents more than minimum wage. Idk what the bookstore will pay and the bookstore is literally nowhere near as big so I wouldn't be walking too much. I've only been at this job for almost three weeks I think.

\----

There's my problem. (TL;DR) What should I do? Get the job I've wanted for years or stay at the job I have now that helps me lose weight?

I know that I am a valued employee. I make my deadlines and I get reports done without making mistakes. I’m helping my director with a project she’s been wanting done for years. I feel established in the workplace and that I am succeeding.

The aspect of my job that is growing a bit suffocating is how my manager (level below my director) approaches things. Here are a few examples of things that have happened in the last week:

-I got in trouble for not checking with her before setting up a meeting with someone else in my department. She doesn’t need to be there - and doesn’t have anything that she needs me to do at that time ... but for some reason i guess it bothers her that I did it without asking?

-director sent out some possible trainings to our entire department and asked which ones we may be interested in for 2019. I responded, and again got an email from my boss saying that I really should have reviewed my answer with her before responding to my director. It’s not like I demanded the trainings - I simply expressed which ones I think sound interesting like my director asked. 

It’s like she doesn’t want me to have any autonomy. I get that I am a JR employee at the company but does this level of control not seem excessive?

It’s really starting to frustrate me and I don’t know if I should express it, or how to express it, because I don’t want to jeopardize my position.

391,"**The situation**: I am a recently turned 24yo American living in Paris working as an au pair since January of this year. I received my BS in Environmental Science in the US Sept. 2017.  I realized around my 3rd year of college that I had other interests and I wasn't really interested/cut out for scientific research or working in pure science. But at that point it was too late to explore other options. I estimate I have about $15K debt right now, thankfully not student loans, a private loan which is under my parents' names. They are willing to continue loaning me money for my education, although they want to make sure any degree I get is worth the money.

About a year ago I took an International Studies class for the first time and really loved it. I'd had an interest in international relations for several years, due to language and geography classes. When I came to Paris I started researching masters programs in France relating to international relations, doing research, etc. It seemed really interesting. I decided I definitely wanted to do a masters program in Europe, probably in Paris, and most likely work in France or another European country afterwards, with my big career goal being the UN or another intergovernmental organization

**The problems**: 

* my overall grade from my bachelor's degree is pretty poor, only 2.91. This is due to bad grades in chemistry, biology, and calculus. However, I believe my senior year GPA was around 3.4. 
* I have quite a bit of work experience but almost exclusively manual labor and childcare positions during high school and college. 
* I didn't participate in any extracurricular activities during college either. 
* This week I went to a career and education counseling center and was told that I would likely need to take one or two years of undergraduate classes here to be able to make the switch from science to social sciences. This could mean 3 or 4 more years of school before I start my professional life, at almost 30, obviously not ideal at all. However, I still have to confirm this, I'm going to email some universities today to see what they think (although in my experience French admissions departments aren't very friendly/helpful).
* I'm not sure if an IR degree is the best degree to give me the flexibility to move between fields and also make me employable. Business and management degrees are tempting, although I'm not sure I would enjoy studying or working in the those fields. I'm considering degrees such as political science and public policy also
* I don't know exactly what kind of jobs I'm interested in. After taking the intl studies class I knew I wanted to have enough power in these intergovernmental organizations to make a difference. I'm interested in having some aspect of the environment or sustainability in future jobs even if I'm not working in science. But right now I have difficulty caring about much more than finding a decent job after my masters program.
*  I don't speak any languages besides English and French, which I'm still learning, and my time in Paris is the only thing I can count as ""international experience"". I worry that these facts alone make me incredibly disadvantaged compared to others interested in IR.

I appreciate any advice you can give me. I've done a lot of research like ""what can I do with a degree in..."" including looking on the UN's website and such.",01Nov2018,1

For example, I started going to the gym and eating healthy and ive been doing it now for about 6 months (6 pac gang wooooooooooow) anyway, they said to the doctor when he asked them if I have problems eating different types of foods that arent the same (common trait for aspies) and no, I dont have a problem eating any food, I just dont like to eat like shit everyday like they do, but of course they said that im a picky eater, like I know this isnt the truth, but I know they would never understand this type of stuff, I cant convince an old person too look at memes, shes the type of person that shares fucking minion memes to her facebook, thats what I mean when I say ""old person""

They are preparing to evicting me as well, or at the very least brought it up several times in the conversation. Their reasoning is because I felt so strongly about protecting my cat and having privacy, I should leave.

396,"I’ll try to keep this short, but really there’s a lot to unpack here so feel free to ask questions if you have any.

I’m 22F. I have dealt with an undiagnosed eating disorder for roughly 6 or 7 years now. I go long periods of time feeling relatively fine and undisordered in my eating (although my eating remains abnormal compared to most even during these times as I usually only eat dinner each day), but then my ED will flare up and I’ll spend days, weeks, or months restricting my intake severely, fasting, and feeling incredibly toxic towards food (I’ll feel happier when I’m “empty” or proud of myself for eating under 300 cal a day - when I’m feeling undisordered I don’t have these thoughts and can recognize they’re disturbing). My weight bounces between a little under normal weight (117ish) to decently above normal weight (150ish).

So you’re probably like okay, no brainer, go to a doctor. But things are a bit more complicated than that. Let me run through some mitigating factors:

1. I have a very slow metabolism. I have for my entire life. Even as a child I barely ate and complained about being full from the day before often. I can comfortably eat one meal a day and maintain my weight. It stresses me out to imagine getting ED help and having to figure out a “normal” (aka two-three meal a day) mealplan which I know will make me uncomfortably full, require more work in terms of cooking, and possibly make me gain.

2. I have a chronic pain condition. Cooking is very hard. And it’s boring, and it uses up my very limited energy which is absolutely a precious commodity for me. If I have to cook more, I have to sacrifice other things that I wanted to do that day because I will be too sore/too tired from cooking. I hate this.

3. My chronic pain makes me depressed. Food, and my control over it, helps significantly with this. My pain condition has taken so much control and power from me, and I feel overwhelmed and devastated at the prospect of giving up one of the last few things I do have control over.

4. I fear weight gain. I know pretty much anyone with an ED does. But most people with EDs can move to healthy eating with healthy exercise to control weight in a healthy range. I can barely walk many days, let alone work out, due to pain. A large reason in why I restrict so much is because my TDEE is astronomically low due to how sedentry and short I am. I’m very upset at the idea of eating more calories without anyway to control my weight gain.

5. I legit hate healthy eating. Healthy food depresses me and has a huge negative impact on my mood. I have never found a vegetable I actively want or crave, same goes for fruit, the only meats I like are red meats, and I have a weird other ED issue with anything smooth in texture (it makes me sick immediately).

6. I have extreme apathy and lack of apetite when presented with the majority of foods. It’s like most people have split food into five groups: hate, dislike, neutral, like, love. And they’ll eat anything from either dislike-love or neutral-love. But for me if I don’t actively love it, it feels like a waste of effort to eat it. Even when I’m not disordered, if someone else is cooking and not making one of the few foods I love I’ll probably just skip dinner. I have been this way my whole life, and it makes any sort of consistent healthy eating feel impossible.

I’m not sure if it’s the right time to get treatment for my ED. I’m dealing with a lot of other physical and mental health problems, and my ED feels both like a backburner issue and a crutch to make it through my life right now. My chronic pain diagnosis is very new and have dramatically changed my life. My depression is pretty bad. I recently came to realize that I have been ignoring and suppressing a lot of trauma in my past and I might actually have C-PTSD. I have next to social life due to physical limitations. I’ve become dependent on drugs to emotionally cope. I worry that trying to stop my ED will send me spiraling and lead to a mental breakdown. Thoughts?",01Nov2018,1

402,"**TL;DR** - Freeloading and manipulative brother-in-law has overstayed his welcome. My wife tells me one thing, then does another. I want my house and my privacy back. 

----------

To make a very long story as short as possible, my brother in law (Dave) had a very bad year in 2017. Without going into too many details, he ended up living with my wife and I for 2 months until he found his own place. 

After a few suicide attempts that were clearly his way of manipulating his parents into giving him money, they eventually cracked and supported him fully for a year. 

My wife told me she was done with him and wanted nothing to do with him again. I agree, but I will not speak ill of her family out of respect. 

The year is over and he has to get out of the in-laws rental. My wife - behind my back - told him he could stay at our place until he finds another place. I was mad that she did this without telling me, but we were away on vacation the entire time so I let it slide. 

My wife promised that he would keep the place clean, and be out when we return (Oct 4). We returned and he was still there, and our place was filthy. To me it looked like he intentionally made a mess because no one can be that dirty in just three weeks. 

My wife promised me that he would clean immediately, and she would have him out within a week. I wake up the next morning and find my wife cleaning. I took her out for lunch to talk, and she told me that she was doing it so I wouldn't be mad at her for him refusing to clean. 

He refused to clean his own mess? Fuck that, I told her he has to leave that day. She agreed and said she would talk to him.

Later that evening, she tells me that he gave her a sob story about how he lost his job while we were away and needed extra time. 

My wife talked to me and I am trying to be reasonable here. I agreed to give him until November 1st, with certain conditions. 

* He cleans
* He walks our dog in the afternoon
* He spends his days looking for work and a place to live

After a week it's pretty clear he isn't doing anything that we asked. He is sleeping until 6pm and staying up all night gaming. He definitely hasn't left the house to find a place or a job. He never even took our dog out for a pee break in the afternoon.

My wife decided to get their mother involved to help her deal with him. This turned into a massive fight where he lied about doing everything we asked. My wife called him on it, and he went full baby mode and refused to speak to her. In order to move things along, she left and let her mother hammer home the point to him. 

His mother told him that he was being rude and ungrateful to everyone. She mentioned how she gave him $20K in the last 6 months (news to us). 

His response: ""I didn't ask for anything"".

Despite that being a giant lie, what an ungrateful asshole. 

A few minutes later my mother-in-law came upstairs crying saying that he was threatening suicide since he is such a burden to us. My wife went down and lost it on him. He eventually apologized to his mom and agreed to leave by Nov 1.

Well today is Nov 1 and I see boxes moving in and out of my house (via security camera). I jokingly text my wife saying ""aren't all of the boxes supposed to be leaving?"". 

She responds: ""Oh yeah, forgot to tell you, he's storing all of his stuff in your workshop until he finds a place.""

And here I am now, at work trying not to show my anger to my co-workers. 

I want him out, now. My workshop is the one place that I have where it's my personal sanctuary. I love going there to unwind, and now it's full of his crap. Fuck that!

I want to tell my wife that her brother is out by midnight tonight or I will be dragging him out, but I don't want to make it worse. I mean I want to find an appropriate way to make this happen. I really shouldn't be the person who does it, but it's clear that my wife won't. 

Any suggestions or advice on how to handle this without smashing his ungrateful and inconsiderate face?",01Nov2018,1

About ~20 minutes ago, I was over at my boyfriend’s house. We had sex and cuddled and then we started getting ready because he had to go to wrestling practice. I’m in a very emotionally heightened state after sex so I’m not sure if I’m over reacting or what. So while he was downstairs getting ready, I was up in his room, and I noticed a piece of paper with writing on it pinned to the wall, face-down. So I flipped it over to read it out of curiosity and saw the words “it’s all my fault” carved into his wall. I was literally in stunned silence for a solid minute and I got really emotional and worried about him. The paper itself was old and he had gone through some really rough things 4 years or so ago, so I’m pretty sure it’s old, but the last time I ever ignored something like this one of my friends ended up in a mental hospital on suicide watch. 
We’re both really open with each other and he’s generally a really happy and loving person, but school and his family life has gotten him really down lately, so I’m worried. I want to talk to him about his mental health and check in on him, and bring up the carving, but I’m worried. I want to be sensitive about it. Any advice? ",01Nov2018,1

In 4 months. Quit your last year of high school, move over to the other side of the world  where the love of your life is whom you haven't seen for 8 months so far. Then when you're indefinitely living in New Zealand, go to university, even without a diploma (yes it is possible at the age of 20), finish and get a job. 

Or would you still go to high school, which you hate, for another 9 months, with the doubt you'll even pass/graduate... While missing the love of your life for another 9 months... have more time to save money and say goodbye to few friends and family then finally in July, after not seeing your boyfriend/girlfriend for 17 months, move over to NZ, with the chance your diploma is useless or won't be accepted there so you'll need to do a re-schooling for about 6 months, then go to university.

&amp;#x200B;

Know that my family has no idea I'm planning to move over, yet. We decided to keep it quiet until we figured out a possible way to move over, which we did now so it has come to the point where I will have to tell my family I'm leaving to the other side of the world and won't be able to see them for at least 2-3 years...

""hey I'm quitting school and moving to NZ in 4 months"" or ""hey, in 9 months, after my graduation i'm moving to NZ""

409,"I'm constantly told by people around me that I'm smart. Family, friends, adults in my life- I've constantly been showered with praise for apparently being more mature and smart than people my age, but I don't exactly believe them.

My grades weren't great, so I'm not smart academically. I'm not politically smart, nor do I have street smarts since I tend to keep to myself. 

I have high functioning autism and I overthink a lot, so it probably seems like I'm smart to others but it's more that my mind is filled constantly with useless thoughts since I obsess over little things.

Now that I'm going back to college soon (went to college one year after highschool and spent the past year and a half out of shool due to some personal stuff I had to sort out) I'm thinking of what career to go for. I'm also thinking about what career I'm CAPABLE of going for. 

People tell me I'm smart enough to be a doctor or a lawyer but I feel like I'm probably never going to be smart enough to really go for a career like that. **What I'm here to find out is how I can figure out if I'm really smart like people around me have said, or if I should just go for a modest career?** All humans have their limits (I think the ""you can do anything with effort advice"" is a cliche and untrue) and want to figure out what I'm capable of.",01Nov2018,1

412,"A couple months ago in the summer, some high school friends and I decided to start up an alternative rock band. We’re all just around our early 20s so we said what better time to try something like this and play some shows than now! 

My parents were nice enough to let us practice in their garage, which is inside of a super friendly neighborhood. When we started, we played consistently every weekend in my parents garage, with neighbors approaching to give compliments and even request that we play louder from time to time. 

As time went on and we start playing open mics and shows, and the summer heat in Texas can be brutal so we decided to start rehearsing at a practice studio when we had some extra cash/tip money from playing shows. The other band members also offered we just play acoustic sessions at their apartments. All of these things summed up to us playing in my parent’s garage significantly less.

Now introduce a neighbor which we gave the nickname “Scooch”. Scooch has stopped by a total of 4 times throughout our many practices at my parent’s garage. He lives about 4 houses down.

The first visit:
(Practicing on a Saturday around 4pm)

Steps outside of my garage in the rain and asks us to crank the music up and keep rocking, all while sporting a whiskey on ice &amp; a cigar hanging from his lip. Looks around the age of upper 20’s? At this point, we think this guy is pretty cool &amp; just adds to the positivity to the neighborhood! 

The second visit:
(Practicing on a Wednesday night around 6:45pm)

Steps inside my garage (again with whiskey in hand) ands says that he has a 1-year old and his wife asked him to come ask us if we could turn it down a scooch. This request was very reasonable, and even though it was still sunny outside and not very late, we respected his request and called it a night.

At this point, I’ve drove home to see this same neighbor practicing acoustic guitar outside of his house at 10pm at night. It’s totally alright with me, and isn’t super loud at all, but it was kind of nice knowing he was a fellow musician and not just a cranky neighbor.

The third visit:
(Last night on Halloween around 7 pm)

Scooch walks straight into the garage up next to us while we’re practicing and says we need to turn it down, and that he has a one year old - all with a cigar in his mouth and another whiskey in hand. In the background, you can hear multiple groups kids laughing and screaming while trick or treating up and down the neighborhood’s street. Our guitarist mentions that it’s Halloween and the entire street is loud because of kids walking up and down but offers to shut the garage doors. Scooch then says “don’t be a prick” and mumbles something to himself. I tell him that it’s not even 7:30 yet and that we weren’t planning on playing super late, and mentioned how multiple neighbors have approached us with nothing but compliments and requests to turn the volume up. This neighbor then replies “keep playing, see what happens” and walks away. We didn’t really know how to take that so we shut the garage doors and finished up practicing within the next 15-20 minutes.

I will say that we have used the exact same practice equipment from the start, (no extra amps or anything) meaning that we played at about the same volume pretty consistently. We technically play far LESS at the garage now with the practice studio and acoustic sessions. I have even gotten home from work to neighbors asking me “where’s the music??” In enthusiastic tones, usually sparking up a conversation about when our next show is. 

So we posted this here asking for advice. We definitely don’t want an enemy because I don’t want to cause any troubles in the neighborhood considering it’s my parents house. (My parent’s opinion was to tell him to **** off lol!)  We don’t want to have to worry about the cops getting called everytime we practice by this guy. But we’re also sick of being treated like some group of kids playing around the neighborhood where realistically, this neighbor is only about 4-5 years older than us. We’re in Texas and I know the rules might change for different neighborhoods, but what are some things we’re able to say to defend ourselves next time he tries to act like the boss of the street? Is there some laws about quiet hours or a certain volume you’re able to play legally without any repercussions? I mean, this guy is walking onto our property and saying that we’re being too loud for his baby but we think he might just be trying to overcompensate as the man of the house and act like he owns the street and can walk into anyone’s house with an open container and a cigar and tell you what to do. 

Ultimately, this guy really isn’t that important and we always have a great time hanging out, jamming, writing music and recording together no matter what, so in the end he’s just a speed bump. But some/any advice so that we can respectfully put him in his place and get him off his high horse in the meantime would be amazing. Thanks!!",01Nov2018,1
413,"Hey Reddit, 
thought I would ask on here as I have found myself getting unhappier and unhappier everyday even with particularly good things happening in my life.

So I am not happy with my life and have been trying to figure out what it is I am not happy about. I wrote a list of things that make me happy and what makes me unhappy.

Things I am happy about
I have a job I enjoy which will lead to a long term career.
I have a gym membership and get to improve my body image.
I have friends I can go out with on the weekends if I want too.
I enjoy talking to my parents about my day and eating dinner with them.
I am financially stable after all my outgoings (insurance, gym membership, work commute ect...)

Things I am unhappy about
I am lonely
I've never had a relationship
I am envious of lots of my friends and people I know for the 2 reasons above

After writing and looking at this list I don't understand how the things making me unhappy can overpower all that makes me feel happy. I started my first part of my career at 18 years old this past month and I love the job. I no longer wake up dreading going to work in the morning which is such a nice feeling. I get to go to the gym pretty much whenever I want too outside of work hours which again I love going too it is something I really enjoy doing and have done for the past 4-5 months. I can hang out with friends on the weekend if I want too, I get to speak to my parents about my day after work and now with my new job I am financially stable.

However after all those good things the 2 things that make me unhappy seem to overpower it all. I will get on the bus after work and sit and think about how lonely I really am and the fact that I have never had a relationship. I decided to delete all my social media last week because I hated seeing how happy all of my friends looked and just people I know in general being in relationships...

You might just say ""get a girlfriend"" but the thing is I get bored of girls way too fast, sure a girl can be good looking but whenever I speak to any of them I usually get bored of our conversation after the first 30-60mins. I think this is probably just because I am boring but I dunno.

Advice I usually get with this is ""your only 18 you have the rest of your life for relationships, you have nothing to be unhappy about"" the thing is with this is that I have been told this ever since I was 16 and I am always trying to improve myself to make me a better person in terms of social skills, appearance and extra things I can do such as drive. I thought learning to drive would be a great way to make girls more interested in me but it ended up just being a way to be used by people I considered my friends haha.

I have always solved my problems in the past just by isolating myself but I can't do this too myself anymore, usually this feeling of shittyness would go after 2 weeks but now I finish work and feel so sorry and sad for myself. I have a fairly close friend in a relationship of which he has no idea why I am so sad he says I have a job and nothing to worry about. (he doesn't have a job but he has a good relationship) I think I would throw away this job I love to be in a happy relationship honestly... Think I am just rambling now but maybe someone here can give me some sort of advice on what I can do to solve my unhappiness.

415,"The other night my friend asked me to move in with him and I said I would, but now I'm having doubts. I'm not sure if it's just nerves or what but I'm having serious second thoughts. Even though I'm currently living in a shared bedsit I'm completely independent and I enjoy being that way, I'm really introverted, liking my own quiet personal time but my friend is the complete opposite. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend has been hinting for a while that he wants someone he can trust to move with him as eventually the guy he is living with was going to at some point move out, well that time has come and he asked me to take his place. The room is alot smaller than where I'm living now and the rent is much more, but there is the fact it'll only be the two of us in an actual house.  I mentioned to him my concerns that I wouldn't be able to pay a fair share of the rent as I'm currently stuck in a part time job and although he says that he doesn't care about that I still do. We agreed that if I did move in that I would pay what a little bit more than what I'm paying now in rent and when I got another job I'd pay more, however one of my dreams is living completely by myself and if I'm paying more in rent that'll be less money for me to save for my own place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have currently been living for the last few years in a 5 bedroom bedsit where we share a kitchen and have two separate toilets and a bathroom, the rent is all inclusive of bills, except for internet, decent location and incredibly cheap. Although I do share kitchen with other people I still feel I have tons of freedom here, I get on well with the people who currently live here, we don't fight about chores and tend to sort out ourselves out on our own. He needs me to move in by the beginning of December so I'd have to let the letting agency know within the next few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how I feel about saying yes to moving in with my friend, I'm perfectly happy where I am and apart of me is wondering if I just said yes cause he wanted someone trustworthy to move in with him, I worry how much freedom I'd be losing and there's the financial aspect to it as well. I'm trying not to overthink it but I cant get it out of my head.

416,"Alright:

I [21F] have a corporate job in tech where I earn $85,000. I just got hired in September after an internship. I like the job and my coworkers. My commute is 2 hours and I’m reluctant to move since where I live is beautiful, cheap, and month to month. But the 4 hour commute is killing me.

So I decided, after I pay off my credit card debt (commuting that far saves me about $1000 a month) I would move. 

Here’s the issue:

I feel fucking 45. Seriously. I’ve been divorced (stupid young marriage) and now have this job. I live in the PNW and want to move to SoCal, so I’ve been looking at tech jobs but getting an interview down there is difficult. If I move closer to work, I’ll be locked into a year lease but at least I’ll get 4-5 hours of my day back. If I move to California, there’s a chance that I will have to work retail or something until I can get a job. This month I’m started acting classes and part of the reason I want to move to California is to get into the film industry eventually. 

So I guess my cards are: play it safe at a job I like and an area I feel lonely and stuck, or move and get back into the struggle and tell my family that “hey I quit my great job” because I want to move to California.  

Help. I honestly want to feel free and 21, not 45, (not that 45 is bad! But like I need to experience more and I feel like I’m settling down).",01Nov2018,1

So last year during one of the worst winters I have lived through I started looking into options to move somewhere warmer. I decided I didnt want to go to the states, but Australia looked good. I got accepted to the University of Sydney which is apparently a really good school. I was planning on getting my degree then staying there after. The problem with this is how expensive it is. Its 45k a year to go for tuition alone. I have had to take out substantial loans to go so that is a huge stress factor for me already since I was raised poor by a single mom and I have always wanted to live as debt free as possible. Pretty much everything is set in motion to go to Sydney but I'm having major second thoughts. I have been living in my moms basement suite since I graduated paying rent etc. Now my mom is retiring with her husband and moving to Poland since the cost of living is so much cheaper. She sold the house and we are in the process of packing so my little brother, mom, her boyfriend and I are going to be living in my little brothers 2 bedroom apartment for the next 3 months until I leave and she leaves the month after me which is stressing me out because it's going to be cramped and I am not going to have any space to myself. On top of that I have hated every single goddamn second of my life for the past 4 years because of the jobs I took. First in retail, then in trades. I honestly am thinking about just cancelling my enrollment and just getting a human resources degree or something here. I'm going to hate the shit out of it, but at least its affordable and wont bury me in debt for life and I'll be employable after. I have NEVER been this stressed in my life. I'm throwing up at work a few times a day, I'm crying before bed. I've been taking CBD oil to cope with my already existing anxiety for years and that's not helping. I actually feel like I'm going to break and I am seriously questioning whether or not I am in any kind of mental place to even be attempting something like moving to a new country where I dont know anybody and going to something as stressful as law school.",01Nov2018,1
429,"First of all let me be clear that there is no excuse for what I did. I feel terrible and now I’m panicking because I don’t know what to do. 

My husband and I got into a heated argument after drinking (bad idea). At some point he was in my face and grabbed a coaster I had in my hand and through it against the wall..... i left the kitchen and walked to our room. Finally I exploded and slapped him across his face as we were both yelling at each other. 

Im embarrassed to see him because of what I’ve done.  I’m considering leaving our marriage because of what I’ve done. I don’t know how I’ll be able to look at him without feeling ashamed. Anyone have experience in this situation? Advice? Should we seek counseling first? Or am I wasting his time?

430,"I just failed a geometry test, computer/phone taken away, I have no social life and honestly everything feels like it's all crashing down. I am really discouraged right now, I have no idea what to do. All I want to do is just lay down and cry. ",01Nov2018,1
432,"Hello everyone, this is going to be a lengthy post. If you read all the way, I appreciate you and hope that someone with more life experience could help me out. 

To begin, I am 20 years old. I am in a really weird place in life and I just want to stop being so indecisive about myself. I have major flaws that I'd love to fix, but I don't even know where to begin. I am not enjoying my life because I cannot bring myself to love who I am and enjoy being young. I feel very defeated all the time -- hopeless, to say the least. 

I am in school and I have hobbies. I have a job, but I live with my parents. I hardly go out. 

**I have social and eating anxiety.** I am not sure how to fix this. I try to meditate, but it has caused me to panic twice. I try to ""trust the universe"", but my anxiety is very physical. I get distressed when I am doing nothing, or what I perceive as ""being lazy"". I could be in bed, scrolling on Reddit, and my brain just repeatedly calls me a lazy piece of shit. This has resulted in me being a huge flake. I never go through plans with friends. It is very rare that I go out, because I start feeling weird when I do. I know my friends are pissed at me. I know I've lost a couple this way. I can't help it. I don't know why I act this way and it absolutely kills me. I wish I had more friends, but this kind of behavior seems impossible to change. This ties in with the eating anxiety. I am constantly hating myself for my weight. I am a 5'6"" 130-ish lb female, but I constantly feel myself thinking about food and everything I am going to eat. It's ridiculous. I feel like a prisoner of my own mind. I have cancelled on people to avoid eating junk.

**I am extremely indecisive when it comes to major life decisions.** For someone who everyone thinks of as disciplined and hardworking, I cannot bring myself to stick to one decision. I have changed my major 3 times since I started college. It went from wanting to be a physical therapist to settling for a business degree. My true passion is writing and reading, but I honestly do not think being an English major is a good idea. I have thought about joining the Army since I was in 8th grade, but all of my family and friends have told me I am ""not cut out for that sort of thing"". 

**I am aware I have an easy life, but I stress over the most stupidest things so much that it is literally preventing me from enjoying my youth.** I am obsessed with my appearance, I have a low self-esteem (if you couldn't tell), I have a short temper, I do what my parents tell me to do because they are immigrants and the least I could do is give them a decent ""good"" daughter that stays out of trouble. I don't buy myself clothes for myself or overindulge, because I don't think I deserve it. 

**I am bisexual, but I hate myself for it because of internalized homophobia.** I am sick of wanting a girlfriend. I am scared that I will fall in love one day with a woman, because I don't know what my family would say. I already feel like a disappointment to my parents because of how much of a tomboy I am. I know it bothers them. I know they know, but they don't want to ask. My mom always makes comments on the way I dress, and always asks me why I don't ""try harder"".

If you read all of that, thank you. I hope to find some guidance on the internet, because I cannot seem to find it in real life. I cannot come to my parents with any of this, because they most likely will not understand. They grew up in poverty, and find it very difficult to understand that someone in a first world country could have issues and stress, too. (I feel horrible saying that...).",01Nov2018,1

442,"I’ve never known how to let things go, big, small, irrelevant, life altering, you name it, I can’t let it go. Little details play in my mind on a stupid loop til I’m convinced that I’m useless and nobody likes me. Because of this, I end up feeling considerably drained every now and then, and I cut myself off from everyone and everything, sometimes for days, sometimes for months. Sometimes the smallest things will trigger the ‘cut off’ response. Like not being tagged in something although other people were tagged (I know this is stupid, I wish I didn’t care but I do). Not being invited to a small get together by close friends, or someone saying something that I consider shitty, even if that wasn’t their intention.

I have three lovely children and a brilliant partner, I’m well aware that they are all I need in this world, and if it weren’t for them, I’d be a mess or not here at all. I have suicidal thoughts almost daily, I would never act on them, they’re just passing thoughts. I’m very friendly, overall I try to be ‘good’, but I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m always getting life wrong. I can’t maintain friendships because when they get intense, I panic and push people away. I don’t like the way I look at all. I sweat too much, my face is constantly red, my hair is frizzy, I’m overweight and just overall not very content with my face. And I hate the way I feel, I don’t feel at peace with myself ever. Sometimes I’ll go weeks just wishing I could hide away in my bed, some mornings I wish I didn’t wake up.

I called the airline and the basically only gave me two options: change the itinerary/name of ticket holder  or loose your money. 

I am more thank likely going to loose those $350.

I do NOT want to loose the $250 of sleeping arrangements I had put down, seeing as I am not going. 

Is it ok to ask for my $250 back from my friends ?

They would split that $250 between the 4 of them, roughly $63 each.

447,"Hi!

So I've been seeing someone for a little more than a year and a half, and I just dont think I can do it anymore.


We had met at classmates in college and became best friends very quickly and carpooled to every class as we lived within 5 minutes of each other. About a year into college, were having a study session in her apartment and take a break as I tell her I'm having a hard time coping with a lot of personal things. She responded by getting on my lap and kissing me and basically telling me to have sex. I push her off initially, but she keeps trying. I'm an extremely nice person and was afraid of losing my best friend if I rejected her (I know, 100% not an excuse, just explaining my logic in the moment). I figured it was a one time thing and itd be done, wed both feel guilty, slowly drift apart out of awkwardness, and thatd be the end of it, but at least I'd have a little bit of time to deal with the loss of a friend before we cut each other off.


Wrong, she proceeded kissing me and calling me her boyfriend every day for the following weeks when we were in private, and texting me about how excited she is to be in a relationship with me at this point. She treated me so well and eventually told me how much she loved me. There was also occasional sex (I still somehow convinced myself that I'm not ready to lose a best friend and that wed both drift apart soon).


After a while she started saying that she loves me so much and that shell marry me. I know thats like typical shit you see on TV, but I know shes serious. 


Her relationship with her husband has been falling apart for a while, theyve been planning on getting divorced at some point anyways. I'm not going to say hes a bad husband, but hes not exactly a good one either, and they're ideas of a good and healthy relationship are completely different. She married him because they were young and her parents pushed her to do it even though she originally planned on breaking up with him. They also have 2 kids just to throw that in, both below 5 years old.


So now, fast forward a year and a half later, and I'm at my predicament. She says shell break up with him when I propose to her (she needs financial stability, but hes much more stable than I am or ever will be so I know shes not after my money). However, I'm just not ready for that. I know she loves me way more than I currently love her, and I'm not ready at 1.5 years. 


I also just dont think I have the balls to basically tear apart their family with my proposal, and I just feel guilty in general over the whole thing. Whenever I talk about how guilty I feel, she responds with ""well how do you think I feel? But I love you and that's what matters more to me right now"". 


I feel awful about breaking up with her because of how well she treats me, how much she obviously loves me, and how I know we couldve been happy together if she didnt marry him and have two kids with him. And I do currently love her (I fell in love after a few months), just not nearly as much as she loves me. I know theres the whole ""you havent seen her at her worst since you're the one shes cheating with"", but I can guarantee I have. The kids dont even bother me as I love kids, the issue is I dont agree with how the father raises the kids and I dont want that kind of influence with kids that I raise. 


I'm currently in my mid 20s and shes in her early 30s, and I think it's time to call it quits. As much as it sucks and I dont want to break up with her, I want to live my life and not be trapped by this guilt for the rest of my life. 


Heres a kind of random pros and cons thing about the whole thing if it matters to you:


Pros: treats me better than any ex I've ever had (and maybe will ever have), planning on getting divorced soon anyways, amazing kids that I love, loves me more than any woman ever might, shares a lot of the same relationship values and long term goals as I do.


Cons: currently married, absolutely hate how the husband raises their kids (plan on having joint custody), guilt, literally started our relationship through cheating, 8 year age difference (not a huge deal normally, but definitely messes up some long term plans I want to do in my life), gets jealous extremely easily and is pretty clingy (as in gets mad when I try to hang out with others, male or female, but worse with females, when were both free), has no similar interests as me at all whatsoever.


Please, I need help on how to approach this. I've never hurt someone like this (again, I'm considered like the nicest guy), but I need to stand up for myself. I've broken up with girls before, but the woman never cared about me this much. 


TL;DR: in a relationship with a married woman for 1.5 years, we both love each other but guilt and issues with how the husband raises their 2 kids keep me from wanting to pursue it. Need advice on how to properly end it.",01Nov2018,1

452,"I am 17 going on 18, and almost a year ago I was dating someone 6 months younger than me. We were together for 3 years until she left me. I was being immature in the relationship, and she was on the losing end of depression and anxiety. It was hard and toxic at times, but we were fine until she started doing drugs and got into drinking. A few months ago I got back in contact with her to tell her how sorry I was for how immature I was. She explained how she hates me for how I treated her, and that was too be expected, but one night she got drunk and said she ""hates living without me"". I could already tell she was still in love with me, but also hated me because I honestly felt the same. At one point when we were talking she started telling me in depth her side of the story up until now, and just wow... She hid a Xanax addiction through our whole relationship. When we broke up she became and alcoholic and also is addicted to smoking cigarettes and weed, and also claims to only do hard drugs with friends. I asked what drugs she was doing and she said she didn't want to disclose that information with me. But from there she told me how shes tried to commit suicide 2 different times since the breakup... She didn't tell me the first attempt, but explained how she downed an absurd amount of pills and alcohol only to end up vomiting it all back up. A few weeks ago we got into a bit of a heated conversation where she stopped talking to me entirely and blocked me. I feel like I should tell her mother who is an extremely sweet and understanding person, but I'm torn. If I keep my mouth shut she could possibly die, leaving the family devastated; however, telling the mother would probably result with her being thrown into mental hospitals which honestly scare me. I feel like telling results in either her living an awful life stuck in a hospital, or maybe she actually gets healthy... And if I don't then she doesn't have to suffer...

454,"TL;DR I'm a senior in high school and today I broke down crying to my guidance counselor explaining how my anxiety, depression, ADD has effected my grades (C's, D's, F's). She wants to tell my teachers what's going on and to give me extensions on homework and tests and quizzes so I can actually pass. Deep down I've always been scared to be abnormal or get special treatment because of my mental health. I think her suggestion would help me, but I'm scared.  She is very open and nice about any of my thoughts and opinions, so I can ask/tell her anything as well. Please if possible give me advice, suggestions, help, pros/cons.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, my guidance counselor called me down to her office, telling me that my calculus teacher went down and told her that she was worried about me failing the term. Soon after, I bawled my eyes out, explaining to her about my anxiety, depression, ADD issues and how it's incredibly difficult for me to function every day. We talked for a while, exchanged thoughts and opinions. She really want's me to take more time with my homework and to take tests and quizzes when I'm actually ready and prepared for them rather than stay up late at night studying/ staying up late at night doing nothing because my ADD refuses to let me be productive. She is going to tell my teachers about my issues and explain why I'm getting such awful grades in all of my classes. But I'm honestly just scared to do this. A suppressed fear of mine was to get special treatment or something at school because of my mental health. Like have my teachers treat me differently, get extensions on assignments, etc. I'm okay with her letting my teachers know what is up with me, because that could potentially save me from failing. But get these special treatments makes me feel iffy. I'm just really scared. But I feel like it could help me... What other option do I have? For the past idk how many years, I've tried to live like a normal student, go home, study, homework, eat, sleep. But I clearly haven't gotten in the swing of things. Are there any cons to this do you think? She seemed very understanding and 100% open to any thoughts, needs or opinions that I had. So if you have any advice, maybe I could bring it up to her. Tomorrow, I do have an AP Lit test that I  have barely studied for though, which I think I may take a break from for now. I have two quizzes tomorrow that I think I will take, only because both teachers of each of the classes approached me about my grades and I feel like I need to show them that I am capable of getting a good grade and to make them proud I guess?

Also, a little bit more about me just so there's no confusion. I'm a 17 year old girl, a senior in high school. I want to go into art after high school whether it's at an art school or liberal arts school or state school. I currently take 3 APs (Bio, Lit, Psych) plus CP calc, fine arts, and orchestra. I've been going to therapy for about 4ish years now. I'm on my third therapist because of schedule changes on their part as well as needing to move to a different firm. I've been taking Fluvoxamine for about 3ish years now for my anxiety and depression and it has made a world of a difference. About 3ish weeks ago, my psychiatrist prescribed me adderall because she suspected I had ADD, which I definitely can believe. My family doesn't really know anything about my mental health or school life. I don't really want them to know anyways because they're quite non-understanding and judgmental, besides my older brother who has experienced a fair amount of mental health issues as well. He is in his fourth year of college currently. 

&amp;#x200B;

456,"Hi, this is my first post here. I wanted some advice for an issue that’s currently going on This is going to be a bit long so if you don’t wanna read:

TLDR; Asian classmate is getting bullied by racist students, the teachers ignore the problem. What should I do? 

Here’s the long version if you want:

I go to a high school in a white area. There’s some colored students but it’s mostly white kids. Recently a girl from Taiwan transferred to my school, let’s call her A. A isn’t a native English speaker and she has an accent but you can still understand what she’s trying to say. A is in my English class and we sit near each other. We aren’t friends or anything but we’ve talked a few times. 

The majority of the students in my English class are white students. They try to be nice to A and help her when she’s struggling with something. For the first few days it was fine, but a group of students in my English class started to harass A. First it was teasing and making racist comments based on Asian stereotypes, but soon it escalated to physical bullying such as pushing, punching, kicking etc. 

The bullies harassed her DURING class when the teacher was looking, but the teacher pretends to not notice. Every single time. I’ve tried to stop the bullies multiple times and so have other classmates, but the bullies just won’t listen. 

After class I’ve talked to the teacher about A being bullied SEVERAL times but the teacher says things like “They’re just playing around” “If A needs help she’ll come to me” “She isn’t getting hurt”...What the hell. The teacher KNOWS what’s going on but just doesn’t want to be involved. Is this a normal thing for teachers to do? 

I sometimes talk to A and ask her about the bullying. She usually says “it doesn’t hurt” or “I’m okay” but I don’t believe it. 

During class the bullies start taking videos of A and they post it on social media, which is illegal right? A got very mad when she found out about that and finally went to the teacher for help after class. I was listening to their conversation and I heard the teacher say “I’ll give them a warning”. A fucking warning? She’s getting physically harassed almost every day and on top of that the bullies film her without consent. 

At this point I gave up on my teacher, I’ve asked another teacher before but they said they couldn’t help because there’s “no evidence”. 

About 2 days ago, we were in class and one of the bullies went behind A and poured rotten milk on her. What the fuck. Shes about to cry and the whole class went silent. It fucking smells too. The teacher saw the entire thing. But guess what the fucking teacher did? She told A to go to the restroom to dry herself off and got mad at A for bringing rotten milk to school. The bullies got no punishment. 

What should I do? A long time ago I went to the administrators for help and they said they’d help but nothing has happened so far. If you have any advice please help me out.

Months ago, my car started acting up but being unable to afford repairs, I ignored it. Now my car is on it’s last legs and it’s seeming my only option is to find a second job and just work my ass off to get back on top, which I’m not opposed to at all. I had a similar issue with my car months ago, and while I tried to save for repairs, I had to pay for rides/uber/etc. which meant that it was extremely difficult to to get my car back up and running only for it to give me the same issues which has been fucking with my mental.

I have many ideas that I’d like to act on but I’ve determined that would be where I start. I feel that I have an entrepreneurial spirit and know that I won’t be satisfied until I become my own boss that can give those around me and that work for me a better life. I’m driven and motivated but I have no idea what steps to take to make anything happen when I’m struggling to get through each day. 

After my time in the military, I had been offered a sales position at a rather shitty car dealership. Although, I left the company shortly, this is where I found my passion to sell and market and got my first real taste of what it felt like to be my own boss. It made me realize that I want to help people in this world, instead of screwing them over to make a dollar. I’d love to possibly work in Sales again or in a business environment and in the future developing and investing in my own startups but I don’t know where to start with my situation. Any advice reddit?",01Nov2018,1
458,"Hi Reddit,
I’ve been in love with my boyfriend now for the last 5 years. Recently this summer he wanted an open relationship... so I gave it to him because I would do completely anything for this guy. But everyday, I’m hurting. The thought of him fucking other girls hurts. The fact that I’m not the only one hurts. And I just feel like complete garbage. We only hang out when he wants me around, otherwise I’m too scared to tell him I want to see him because I’m afraid he’d completely leave me for “suffocating him in this relationship”. I’m very depressed. I don’t know what to do. I cry every night when I’m home alone in bed. I love him so much and I know he doesn’t deserve me, but I don’t know how to leave him. I’m staying loyal while he fucks and dates other girls and I’m just sitting here waiting for him to get over this “phase”. I feel absolutely pathetic and I’m hurting so much but the thought of losing him in my life hurts. I’ve tried talking to him about his feelings but he just gets mad and annoyed that I want “more from him”. He says he loves me too and that he just wants to do act single for now and will get over it, so I just wait and wait. 😔 All I’ve ever done in this relationship was give and give to him. All I’ve ever done was what he wants. I accommodate his every needs, I take care of him, and I obviously put his own happiness before mine... even if it means hurting the shit out of me. I’ve become extremely depressed and sometimes even suicidal just because I feel like complete garbage. I don’t know what to do 😔",01Nov2018,1

462,"it seems like our society only goes out of their way to recognize and appreciate cops, firefighters, EMTs, doctors, nurses, and soldiers. 

We tip wait staff and hair stylists, but nobody seems to care or notice the people who do the things that keep everyday society running like stocking the supermarket shelves or delivering our packages or picking up our trash, manning a gas station counter etc etc... Why can't we tip/thank people who do other service related things? Why is it only those and a few other particular professions, why doesn't the guy who cleans rest stop bathrooms get tips?

Whenever I have an interaction for some reason with somebody working a job like that I make a point to thank them, but they always seem to look at me like I'm crazy. It's not like I just go up to them out out of nowhere and say ""hey thank you"" but if I'm already talking to them, I usually make a point to bring that up. Some are very pleased to hear it but a lot of the time I just get blank stares like they're wondering why I'm saying that to them at all. I hope it's not condescending anyway, I genuinely think what they do is important and wish that it was valued more highly. I think they're just not used to hearing it.

463,"I live on a first floor apartment and came home to what I thought sounded like maintenance workers doing some work on the property by my patio. No big deal, never had issues with noise in the past so why make a big deal now? After about 30 minutes my curiosity peaked so I looked out my window to see some guy who did not appear to be a maintenance worker using some type of welding machine right outside of my window. Not only that, but he has the thing plugged into my patio, which has a railing so he clearly had to lean over to reach out and plug this shit in.

I don’t know if he saw me, but he packed his shit up shortly after so I didn’t come out and say anything because I was trying to still process wtf this guy was even doing. 

Two questions here, am I in the right to address this to my leasing office? And is this guy not using his crap on my dime (I pay utilities separate from rent) since it is plugged into MY outlet on the patio? That also makes me wonder how long he’s been doing this since I’m rarely at home during the day.",01Nov2018,1
464,"I wasn't sure where to post this, so if someone could suggest a better place I'd appreciate it.  I don't expect to find any answers here (as I'm not convinced there are any at this point), but I don't know where else to turn so here it goes:

I'm a 25, soon to be 26, year-old male.  I've dropped out of college like six times and have never graduated.  I have like 25 credits maybe.  I work a minimum wage job that I really don't enjoy.  I have absolutely no money and am barely keeping it together.  If any sort of emergency were to happen I'd be screwed.  My father died when I was young, and my Mother and the rest of my extended family live on the other side of the country.  I see them once, maybe twice, a year.

I'm really depressed.  This is nothing new.  I've been depressed for as long as I can remember.  I found a journal entry I made when I was 9 about how much I wanted to kill myself.  When I was a kid I had a very severe case of OCD for which I received no help.  Eventually I figured out how to overcome it.  Today, it doesn't bother me nearly to the same extent but I still can't get over crippling anhedonia and ennui.  There is literally nothing I enjoy.  I can't think of a time I've ever been happy, and I'm not being hyperbolic.  I'm currently taking prozac and ritalin and I can barely function.  I would not be able to function at all without my meds.  I've tried therapy several times but it simply doesn't help.

My life wasn't complete shit.  I was better off than most people financially.  I had every opportunity to succeed in life: money, acceptance from choice colleges, good friends, connections.  I only have two friends I talk to now, and one I see on a regular basis.  I burned every bridge and fucked everything up.  My dad left me a somewhat sizeable inheritance.  I squandered all of it doing stupid shit and avoiding going to work.  I work as few days as possible because my job makes me want to kill myself, but it's the best job I'll be able to get by far with my resume and skills.  It's the only job where I can get health benefits, which I desperately need in order to afford my medications.

The fact that so many people have it worse than me and I've blown it makes me feel like a piece of shit.  Like I don't deserve to complain, or to succeed.  I'm good-looking and smart, not socially awkward, but I'm a virgin.  I've never even tried to have sex.  Never been on a date.  Never talk to women.  I'm scared shitless.  At this point I fear I won't be able to overcome the stigma of having no experience.  Perhaps this is irrational, but there really is no excuse for my lack of experience at this point.  I just never tried.  I never thought I deserved it.  I still don't think I ""deserve"" it, as if ""deserving"" is truly a necessary prerequisite for happiness.  And I don't want to burden a potential partner with my miserable attitude.  That's ok, I accepted I'll always be alone a long time ago.

The truth is I'm a miserable fuck.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no point to life.  I've given up trying to find what I want to do.  This what something that used to really preoccupy me.  I've realized that I don't want to do anything.  I don't enjoy anything.  When I try to get motivated to do something, I get a good start and then I quit.  Every time.  Doesn't matter what it is.  I'm a quitter.  Always have been.  Just don't see the point of continuing.  I gave up a very long time ago, and I can't figure out how to undo it.  I desperately want to die, but I couldn't hurt my mother like that.  It would be too cruel.  Once she goes I'm out of here, but that won't be for a long time.  So I resolved to try to alleviate some of this misery in the meantime, but I can't figure out how.

I'm back in school.  I figured if I could get a good paying job and not have to worry about making ends meet it would at least improve my quality of life.  But I'm failing my classes again.  I just don't care.  I think about the future, and I just get depressed.  I know no matter how successful I am, I won't be happy.  There's nothing I want.  It makes me feel like giving up in the moment.  I just don't have the energy to do anything.  I really really want to give up, but I can't.  I feel stuck, and I'm honestly resentful of the fact that I was born and have to put up with this bullshit.  Every day I go through the motions.  I'm a wage slave spending my waking hours working just to stay alive and in my apartment.  When I'm not working I'm not enjoying myself, I'm just in my apartment wishing I was dead.  What's the point of struggling so hard to stay alive when there's nothing about life I like?  The truth is I'm a coward who's afraid to die.  People think those who commit suicide are cowards.  Fuck those people, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Nothing takes more balls than killing yourself.  If a coward is typically someone who is afraid to face their fears (or usually death), then how can forcing death upon yourself be cowardly? 

Sorry for how long this got, and thanks for reading.  I'm not sure what I'm asking of you, or how I expect people to respond but I just had to get this off my chest.  I have absolutely no hope that things will get better, and it doesn't seem to me that life is particularly important or sacred in any sense.  What's the point of going on if I'm just going to be miserable?

TLDR:
I'm a loser and I have no motivation.  If you've ever been in this situation, where did you find the strength to pull yourself out?  What drives you?  It all seems so hopeless.",01Nov2018,1

Greetings,

Long time lurker, first time poster. From Michigan. Please be nice = D

​Sorta odd story to tell...

So I was at work, looking at my Email account (Google), cause its payday and I'm checking my pay-stub, when I received an E-mail confirming a purchase at Louis Vuitton. Obviously not me (30M). So I look at my inbox and see the message no longer exists. I open the trash folder, and see messages disappearing. At this point, I'm fairly certain there are two people using this email account.

I changed my passwords, immediately, all around. Banks, Amazon, Google, couldn't do it faster if I tried, and start sleuthing to see what had happened. Somehow someone got my Gmail account and accessed my PayPal account without changing passwords. PayPal apparently lets you log in with your Gmail account. They changed notification options and opened a credit line, with plenty to spend. I called PayPal with a pretty obscene hold time, to put a stop to that. Went to the bank and opened all new everything, 3 new CCs, and checking acct. Even filed a police report to confirm someone had opened credit lines in my name and placed orders.

​

The guy doing the buying did something particularly strange though. He set up spam keywords on my Gmail, to automatically put emails from places like PayPal and Amazon, Chase Bank, BOA, blah blah. I use the spam function constantly, its a great feature in google. Especially when you've held on to the same email account for as long as I have. But he forgot Louis Vuitton. And I watched him delete the email, and add that name to the spam list, in real time. I saw the items popping up or disappearing from inbox to trash

Called Google, and they cant help me get those emails back...

So as I'm looking around my accounts to see what hes done, I see that paypal records the shipping address on the credit transcript (or order, or whatever, I'm not very familiar with PayPal, just use it to give family members money). I make sure to print it out and offer it in the police report. Either its an empty home this person is near, or they are really dumb.

​

So my question is, how do I secure my identity and credit? Ive heard conflicting opinions on the use of credit monitoring services, and that my only option is to freeze my credit thru the big 3 reporters. And I cant imagine how my password was compromised, I need to figure out how he got access...

​

TLDR; So, very luckily I catch someone open credit in my name, and watch him do it in real time on my accounts, spend money on a stupid purse, and I have an address for some dweeb that tried to steal, and all new passwords to remember. Advice?",01Nov2018,1
466,"I have a problem that has affected me for a long time.  It's that I have never been able to get help from 911.  Every time I call them, I get a female operator who has a flippant and disrespectful attitude towards me and clearly doesn't like me.  She refuses to help me in any way and refuses to send the police at my request.  On more than one occasion, I have called 911 because someone had threatened me with a gun and I wanted the police sent to deal with that person.  But the operator still refused to cooperate.  A couple years ago, I lived in an apartment where my landlord was a psychopath.  He would come to my apartment just to yell at me and harass me, and he would often come just to break into my apartment and pick a fight with me.  Often, he would even bring a friend with him to help him harass me and assault me.  During this period, I called 911 several times and each time I usually would get the same operator who would just make fun of me and laugh at me and refuse to send the police.  I would sometimes hang up and call again and I would get the same response.  The operator (always a female) would make lame excuses like saying it wasn't necessary to send the police or that there weren't any officers available.

I didn't think of it at the time, but after doing some research, I now know that if I need to talk to the police, I can just go to the police station directly.  Recently, I called the non-emergency police number in order to report what my landlord had done years ago and see what could be done about it.  The operator of the non-emergency line was much more cooperative and advised me that the non-emergency line was intended more for reporting minor crimes or reporting crimes that happened to someone else.  She told me that if I have been assaulted then I should call 911.  But that, of course, is the problem.  I've also recently researched that I can request a transcript of any call I make to 911 in order to obtain evidence and file a complaint against an uncooperative operator.   But this, like going to the police station, is only a solution used after the fact; I need 911 to help me right when the emergency is happening.

My question is: how can I get 911 to assist me and send the police for me when I'm in trouble?",01Nov2018,1

470,"[TL;DR] 'girlfriend' blackmailed me into having sex with her, told me she was on the pill and it was fine that we didn't have protection, later find out she is pregnant. What do I do? 
I think this will be a bit of a long read, sorry for any spelling mistakes, I'm in mobile.
First a bit of backstory. I've been dating this girl, ill call her 'Amy' for the sake of the story. Really pretty girl, has a really quirky and cute personality, I would think she is wayyy out of my league, but I think pretty lowly of myself.

Anyways, me and Amy have been dating for around 4 months at this point (both 15) and she starts to become a lot more... Irresponsible I guess. Suddenly she wants to make out everywhere, and be as wild as possible. She knows that I'm not ready for that kind of stuff yet, I had told her multiple times, she would agree every time I told her, but she would never listen, this went on for quite a few months but we still worked out. A couple of months pass since she changed and she messages me asking to come over because she's feeling upset, I ask her why and she says her cat of 9 or so years just passed away, so I make my way to her house, it's not too far and I would obviously want to support her so I don't mind. I get to her house, ring the doorbell, and she opens it smiling. All of a sudden ginger comes running down the stairs, I'm confused, she's not upset and her cat hasn't passed away. Why would she joke about such a thing? She lightly grabs me and pushes me up to her room, I go along with it, hoping for some sort of explanation, the first thing she says is 'I'm sorry but that was the only way to get you to come here,' I'm instantly enraged and I want to walk back outside, but for some odd reason, I stay. She tells me her parents aren't home and she's feeling 'especially kinky' right now. She tells me that she thinks we're ready, I once again tell her that although she might be, I don't think I am. But this time she kept insisting, and wouldn't stop. I was okay with it until she mentioned that she would release naked pictures of me for everyone to see (yep I know it was a stupid thing to do but I only sent them because she did it first). She laughed as she said it, so I part of me hoped she was joking, but I didn't want to risk that. I tell her I don't want to, I keep telling her no but she doesn't care and keeps mentioning the photos. I shrug my shoulders and say fine, but inside I'm feeling anything but fine.
We go on for about 20 minutes, she's really getting into it but I'm not. Don't get me wrong, I'm having sex, for the first time, with a really pretty girl imo, so it wasn't all bad, but I just had this horrible feeling inside me, so I couldn't fully enjoy it. Once we had finished I just wanted to put the whole thing behind me, even if that meant breaking up with her.
A week passes and we haven't spoken much at all. She occasionally messages me, I don't respond. I think she then started to accept that we were breaking up or taking a break. Until another week later she messages me telling me her period was late. At the time I didn't know what this actually meant or what it had to do with me. I research a bit and I'm instantly horrified.  We both are now only 16, way to young too be parents. She then gets a pregnancy test and sends me a pic confirming that she is pregnant. At the time she told me that we didn't need to use protection because she was on the pill. I don't know how true that was but... What the fuck do I do. I don't want to tell my parents and neither does she. Any advice? ",01Nov2018,1
472,"Hey guys,

So I’ve stumbled across hard times. I lost my job last September and recently got hired at a new one starting at $25 an hour. Through that time I was unemployed, I was living off of my 401k, unemployment benefits and the last of my savings. I stopped renting my room and thankfully my family welcomed me back to their home until I’m able to get back on my feet. I don’t have very many bills, but the most expensive one was my car payment and I was more than halfway through paying for it and in March of this year was the last full car payment I made. I’m saving money to make the bill current and I’m currently being sued by my finance company for either the balance I owe or just give up my car and be left with the difference that will come of them selling the car at auction for far less than what it is worth. I have until December 5th to come up with $6,500 and I will end up being $3,500 short come that time. I know it sounds childish not giving up my car, but the last thing my Nana ever did for me before she passed was co-signed on the car and it has way too much sentimental value for me to get rid of it over money. If it wasn’t due to being laid off, I would have no problem affording it and now I’m in the position to afford it again, but I won’t have the amount I fully owe to catch up in time. I come from a low income family and was brought up with respect, integrity, &amp; hard work from a very young age. I’m frustrated, but I’m not defeated. I learned of a r/borrow sub here, but you need 1,000 karma to request a loan &amp; I’m about 500 karma short of that. Other than financial loans through establishments and family borrowing, does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to come up with the $3,500? My plan was to borrow from r/borrow with 6 payments of $700 every 7th &amp; 22nd of Dec, Jan, &amp; February for a final return of $4,200 which would be 20% interest. Please help me out! Thank you in advance for the suggestions!",01Nov2018,1
473,"I live in Sweden and have a Polish mother and a father who can speak Polish. Naturally, I can speak Polish fluently, but it seems as if though there is no other real benefit of knowing Polish besides being able to speak with my parents in that language. 

So far I speak three languages fluently and those are: Swedish, English and Polish.

Swedish is very useful since I live here. Being able to speak Swedish opens up Sweden for me. I grew up here and have the ability to stay here comfortably, maybe have a family here, right? It's a pretty necessary language in my case.

English is maybe even more important than Swedish since it's a universal language and opens up pretty much the whole world for me, the internet and the like. I would say it's the most important language I know.

Polish is just a language I speak with my parents. Yeah I speak it with them every day, but we don't talk much with each other. So in the long run, I'm just going to forget the language anyway, and it's annoying. Why did I ever learn it in the first place? 

Yeah you could say I could move into Poland and live there when I'm an adult in my 30s or so, but why would I? What's so significant about the country? If I were to move into Poland, I would have to advance my Polish, since I do have kind-of an accent (I don't if I really try) and I'm not ""good at it"". Yeah it is a hard language and it has really helped me learn other languages easier, but seriously, I'm not sure what I should do. Should I watch YouTube videos in Polish or should I just let it be? I'm afraid I'll forget how to speak Polish one day, but at the same time, what benefit is there of knowing Polish?

I'm just so conflicted with this. What do you guys think?

475,"I work as an engineer in a startup. I need to keep this under the radar for obvious reasons.

The good: The startup is doing well and has gained big customers. It is a good product and a good opportunity. I am lucky to have the job just in terms of the money and benefits, and am glad to learn new lessons and experiences.

The bad: My bosses break rules I'm expected to follow. My feedback is shot down when I'm asked for it. I'm expected to be unconditionally positive, even though CEO talks trash about former employees (once during an all-hands) using works like ""jerk"", ""irresponsible"" and ""sandbagger."" I'm rarely in a position to do my job well. I have to sneak tests into my code sometimes, and my peers are deeply demotivated/burned out. We've been spiraling and I feel like we need permission to do our job well. All pretty standard stuff, from what I understand.

Work ethic is not a problem for me, but you should know my flaws too: I'm not a good negotiator, and I have a hypersensitive sense of urgency. I basically drip with anxiety at work, and I come off as impatient/intense even in low activity periods. I tend not to be negative, but overall I am an ""okay"" leader since this is my first time working in that capacity. For that reason I listen to constructive criticism where I can, and try to tough out what feels like an indefinite wait to do good work.

After enough repeated bad days of dealing with avoidable issues and being overridden on what seem like common sense things, I put in a letter of resignation. The response has been for the execs to do ""soul searching."" I did not ask for more money or a promotion. I only stated that I didn't want to be on a team that lacked the autonomy it needed to reach certain goals, and that I was open to trying to make things work provided that we did not stay in a downward spiral. I got a call from the HR guy that I was walking away from a stellar opportunity, that it doesn't make sense to ""argue from principles"" and that I should be aware of ""how much rope I have."" I had a talk with the CTO and I agreed to stay for another month on the grounds that they show how much they could do to make things better. They didn't.

Which brings us to the crux of the issue. Despite my awareness of things that bother me regularly I am so wired up over whether or not I'm being fair or patient that I no longer trust my first instinct.

Am I not giving things a fair chance? Am I being a coward? Am I supposed to just reserve myself to this being ""how it works?"" Should I treat things like a negotiation and tough things out? Should I seek something better elsewhere?

My inner monologue is going wild. Please advise me a bit on how I can at least make a better decision. I know I kept things a bit vague, so if you need more context, please ask. Thank you.

Not only this, apparently after telling my parents she was with her friends, she gave him a BJ in his car and has been hanging out with him way too late, keep in mind my sister IS NOT legal(16), and he is a decent amount past 18. Also today when me and her friend were on her iPad, we saw pictures of Cuts on her wrists (which I had been aware of but I thought she had stopped doing) and search history of “how to get rid of a hickey”, leading us to think that last night she was with this old dude. I don’t know if I should tell my parents in fear that they won’t know how to handle it either and she won’t trust me anymore, but I’m afraid it’s something I won’t be able to help her through. But if I dont address it I’m scared it will get out of control. I honestly don’t know what to do.",01Nov2018,1
479,"These ""hallucinations"" have happened twice this month.

First time I received a whatsapp notification from my best friend with the message ""LMAOOOO IKK"" I was actually kind of confused when I received the notification because I didn't remember sending anything funny. I click on the notification (or maybe through the app, can't remember). There was no message from her. Or anyone, for that matter. Our most recent text was a couple hours ago, which ended with ""I'll text u later"" ""bye"" etc. And it's not like she could've sent and then deleted, because whatsapp would've showed that she deleted it. I asked her and she said she didn't send anything.

Today after lab I received a message from my lab partner with a snapchat link. I assumed it was a link to add him on snapchat. I go to our chat so that I can click on the link and there is no message, and no deleted message. I asked him if he sent anything and he said no.

I do admit I use my phone excessively, have issues with being apart from it, and go on it when I'm eating, like 3x per study hour, in class, etc, and might fit the criteria for an internet addict (or maybe most people are like this?) but I have no idea why I'm seeing specific messages and even links from specific people when there are none.

Thanks ",01Nov2018,1
480,"Whenever I just let myself be a little bit freer with how I express myself, I immediately tense up, feel like people are judging me. I can't dance/sing in front of people. I have such admiration for people who can just be confident and honest and not care what people think. Is there a way to get to that point? While being sober :P",01Nov2018,1
481,"Not sure where else to turn, so here I am. Obligatory first time posting and on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

Over the past month or so my husband has been acting erratically. He keeps telling me that people are making comments about him, that he constantly feels judged. 

We recently were renovating our flat so we could put it on the market, so we took a week off from work. Bear in mind this is during the day and our neighbours work full time. He told me that he could hear our downstairs neighbours talking about him, that he was 'doing everything wrong and that's why he's getting mad'. I myself didn't hear anything.

He doesn't sleep at night because he says he hears a humming sound in our bedroom, which may be tetanus, but I cannot hear it. 

He's also started saying that people are judging him and making constant comments, but when I ask him to give me examples he blows up and says I don't understand. He tells me he feels depressed. 

I genuinely don't know what to do, I feel like if I told him to get help he would blow up at me, as every time I question him he tells me he's not insane. 

I can't talk to his parents or sister through fear of worrying them, and I don't want to worry anyone else close to me/us either. 

Am I being my classic melodramatic, overprotective self? Or does my husband genuinely need some help? ",01Nov2018,1
482,"-Their water has been shut off for at least two weeks and won't be back on until they post at least $1000. This happened a few years ago and I gave them $1600 to get it turned back on. I don't have that money this time. My mom acts like it's no big deal. She collects rainwater and takes drinking water from the neighbors hoses.
-Their house is a disaster. Beds on the floors, pill bottles on all the tables , half painted walls my mom started when sure was high and never finished. The attic ceiling is destroyed and molded, luckily my mom was able to re-shingle the roof.
-We live in a neighborhood with a lot of drug addicts
-My grandma gets prescription drugs and my mom takes them.
-Mum gets drugs off the streets as well.
-She constantly promises to get sober then starts up again.
-Steals money from me ( I'm 23 and trying to save up to go back to school!) and my grandma.
This has been life since I was little. My dad was on them too, crack and heroine, but now he's clean and they're separated.


-For example, she just took 8 ambien and went a bit ""crazy"". She was talking to the decorations (i couldn't understand a word.. at this point i didn't realize how high she really was)... Then I asked her to bring the laptop so we can watch TV together and I heard crashes and she started walking in without a shirt and her pants around her ankles. When she spoke to me I couldn't understand a word she said and I heard my grandma say ""you shouldn't have taken that many)... So I got mad and started to leave. She fell flat on her face and started telling at me about not taking the couch??? 
I left and my brother begged me to go back to make sure she's fine. When I returned I found that multiple tables and chairs were broken, along with the TV... She finally sat down and slept and tada... A drug addict starts knocking on the door. I told them to leave and that my mom is in no condition to talk. She left.... THEN SHE CALLED!! I picked up the phone like what did I just tell you???

These addicts won't leave my mom alone!!

I looked through her phone and she has texts asking for ""grams, dubs, 50, a hit, 60, 80, bags at .10"" I don't even know what these things mean!! Can you tell me??

""I feel like I want to be a bad girlie!!! How bout you? My treat!!"" - A text from the person knocking on our door. WTF!

How can my mom get help? She could go to a rehab but then no one will be around to take care of my grandma. I work and can't afford their house. They get some government assistance.

Any advice to improve the situation would be great.

483,"I'm seventeen years old. My mum and I live in a flat in a very central area of our town. I was having a bit of trouble falling to sleep and around 00h45, I heard a female voice screaming outside. I was alarmed by this, since we live on quite a scetchy street and I was afraid someone might be attempting to rape who ever was screaming. I grabbed my keys and a weapon and, wearing only my boxers, ran outside. 
A blonde girl dressed in black running by was the first thing I saw. I looked in the other direction to see a black pick up truck turn around and chase after her.  Across the street from our building there are two other buildings with a small street in between them. The girl ran around the far end of the building on the right, so I ran around the left. She then came from behind the building and fell hard on the tar, clearly crying and struggling to get up. 
I went closer and said something like 'Hey! Are you all right?'. I went on to help her get on her feet. She started heading for a hiding spot which was basically a small alley to a service door. I disagreed with her choice to go there since it was a dead end, but she told me to shut up. We then sat there on the ground and she kept on weeping. My heart was pounding rapidly. I was afraid someone would show up at any second and cause all sorts of mayhem. Rape and human trafficking were my main concerns at this moment. 
I noticed patches of blood on her feet, but I assume they were just scrapes from her fall. I tried to ask her wether she was in physical danger, but most of what she said was inaudible to me, partly because of the shock, but also because of a ventilation fan that was humming loudly in the backround. All I could make out was that she was a runaway and something about either me or her that had to go away. She stood up and ran into the night.

I didn't know what to say or do. I wish I knew how I could help her. I wish there was something I could do to find out more about the situation and possibly make an effort towards helping it. Now, I feel useless and almost guilty about not being able to help.

So my question is:
What do I say or do, should I ever find myself in a similar situation?

Also, if that girl is reading this, I'm sorry that I wasn't able to do anything.",01Nov2018,1
484,"I'm sure this type of question is asked often, but every situation is different. Here's mine. 

I was hired to work at my school's coffee shop about two months ago. The shop is one of those ""we proudly brew"" partnership stores, and it's very new. My employer was interested in having me on because I have years of former experience as a barista at a particular big-name coffee corporation, and I can immediately train others without having to be trained myself.

With that in mind, I requested $10/hr and was granted a little over $8. I recently found out that one of my coworkers, who is considerably less experienced than me, is receiving $9. 

I don't really know if I should mention my knowledge of the coworkers pay, I've never been in a situation like this, and admittedly I don't work many hours a week because I'm a student - but I do feel like my time and knowledge of this job is worth more. I've felt sour at each paycheck I get, even before learning about my coworker. ",01Nov2018,1
485,"I just going to start this off by saying that by no means do i have no friends. I have friends and acquaintances in all of my classes and means of online contact with many of them. I'm a freshman at highschool and I don't know if I should remain in a group of ""friends"" from my old middle school. The only reason I still sit with them at lunch is because I used to be acquaintances with most of them and friends with a few. I scared that if i try to leave now and i don't find anyone new itll be awkward to come back again. These guys rarely hangout and most of their jokes come from making fun of strangers, albeit they dont say it to their faces. Honestly if i didn't know 2 good friends in that group i would've left the 2nd week of school. And since i went to a k-8 school and stayed there for 9 years with my old group from that school, i dont know if ill be good at joining a new group. I always wanted to ask someone what to do but i was afraid of what their answer would be, thank you in advance.",01Nov2018,1
486,I'm starting a new job next week which is pretty much going to competing clubs and standing outside selling tickets for other clubs. My problem is that I have no idea what to say to people or how to go up to people. Any advice?,01Nov2018,1
488,"Hi everyone
I recently survived through hurricane Michael. Unfortunately, my house did not. I've been slowly packing and disposing of the remaining parts of my home. I lost most everything, except for one room which held all of my hobby stuff; paints, sports gear, ect.
Looting and theft are a problem in the area right now and I've had my fair share of it but I know who took some of my stuff.
I came home the other day to a random guy in my house holding one of the drawers from my spare room. I chased him out and on the way out he says that my landlord hired him to help clean. He did, but claims he didn't know he was in my house and didn't tell him to clean it.
Today while working in the house I notice that the guy's, (who's staying in one of the empty houses) kids are outside playing with MY nerf guns. /r/ advicd I know it's stupid, but after losing so much to this storm, seeing people using your stolen stuff right in front of you, even if it's some toy guns is pretty upsetting.
I go over and tell them they need to return my stuff, they refuse and say that it's not mine and I call the landlord. He says he can't do anything about it and they he doesn't think the guy stole them from me.
I KNOW that they were stolen because I was the first one back into our neighborhood after the storm and they were still in my house, hanging on the wall and all the rest of my stuff was put away. The kid claims he found it outside my house on the ground and i know its not true because ive been back every day and they were still there the whole time up until I caught the guy in my house. The kids shooting a lovely mix of the cheap yellow darts I buy for practise and the handmade ones I make + some of those expensive ass pro brand ones. I always leave my guns unloaded because it's just good practise, and because the clips bend the darts if you leave them in there for storage. Even if I hadn't unloaded before I put them up I never in my life would have mixed them all in together in a clip because it makes them jam. They cleaned out my entire stock, 2 rifles, a shotgun, and 3 pistols. My several bags of different darts are gone too. My landlord eventually calls them and tells them to return my stuff and the kids mom brings back the single gun with no darts.
My question is how am I supposed to get them back? I dont want to be the crazy white bitch who calls the cops on people for stupid shit, but man I bled for those guns. I modified them and spend a lot of money on them. I can give exact descriptions of them and the guy was holding the drawer that I stored the smaller guns in and the darts. Are the cops gonna laugh in my face for calling about this? Is there some other way to go about this through a legal channel.
My friend suggested just telling the landlord that I'm going to file a police report and see if it makes him actually attempt to take them back from the gym on also missing other stuff from my house like plates and video games and who knows what else. I just want me nerf guns back.",01Nov2018,1
