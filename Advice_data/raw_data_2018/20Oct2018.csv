0,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 8 months now. Before that we were friends. But the story goes even deeper. We became close friends fast, I opened up to him about everything. 
Before we began dating, he was dating (his now ex) who had severe depression. Severe. 
During the fallout of that relationship, we bonded we became close. Hung out all the time, we slept together. We were still friends. Friend who began having feelings for each other. He struggled with his feeling for me, and struggled breaking up with someone who could kill themselves at any moment. He felt obligated. I stuck by him and got emotional crumbled by him and his actions. Telling me one thing, and acting another way. He eventually became depressed and withdrawn himself. It's too much to get into, but I was confused for so long, angry, sad, depressed. I had to go home to my apartment every night not knowing how this is going to end. Dealing with thoughts of him wanting me but going home to her. Flash forward through that wreckage,  we settled. Our relationship is solid. We communicate openly, we support each other, and have fun together. Despite such hardships in the beginning, we fought our way to each other and have flourished in our relationship. I truly believe if we got through that we can get through anything. Weve been though hell and back. I love him more than myself at times. 
Need advice...I've dealt along with dealing with those feelings from the past. The anger and resentment...yet think I am still struggling today. I get bother by small things he does. He will acknowledge his friends and sister on Facebook, but not me or forgets to acknowledge a post of us or mine. I get upset and say mean things with no justification. I cant bear hurting him. Not after what I saw him deal with.  I get insecure when he talks to a co worker of ours about our golden retriever.  I am friends with her too. Why am insane. How do I let this last bit of emotion go?",20Oct2018,1
1,So this new friend I met said she was having a few people over on Halloween and invited me to come. The problem is my mom is Christian and will not let me go because it’s for Halloween. How do I explain this to my friend? I’d really like to go and she keeps asking me ,20Oct2018,1
2,"Hi sorry for the long title I’m new to this! Basically I live in student housing with 5 other girls and I thought we were all close and everything was fine! However, this evening I was going to go down to the kitchen and I could hear two of the girls talking about my friend and her situation with a boy, I knew I shouldn’t be listening in but I was curious about what they’d say and the conversation turned to us. To keep it short they seem to have talked about us before with one saying something like “how have they been today?” And basically talking about how loud we all are when we joke together and how they don’t know how we keep it up, they were also talking about my friends cleaning habits and also me forgetting to clean the bathroom we share. Basically calling us all annoying - some of it was muffled but I definitely heard my name alone a few times.
I know it probably doesn’t really sound like a big deal but their tone was so patronising and mean, especially since I didn’t even know they had a problem with us - also I tend to suffer with social anxiety and hearing actually talk about me enhanced that, I feel like I’m not going to know how to act around them now and I just generally feel uncomfortable about it.
I’m going to a protest tomorrow with the girls they were talking about and I’m not sure if I should mention it to them, the thing is I don’t want to cause I huge problem and I hate conflict but it also doesn’t seem right to just not tell anyone what they were saying. 
I messaged one of the girls saying that I heard the end of the conversation and that I’d clean when I got home tomorrow but I didn’t mention that I heard any of the rest of it, I did it because I wanted them to know that I’d heard in a way but not fully tell her that I had. 
Sorry for such a boring ramble! Any advice would be really appreciated! I’m really not that good at handling social things like this so sorry if this sounds a bit pathetic haha ",20Oct2018,1
3,"Please save the judgment of my actions for I regret my actions and realize how foolish and creepy this was and vow to work on myself and never do it again.



Anyways, So a little over 2 months ago, I received a PM from an anonymous account stating something along the lines of ""I have met with my family lawyer who has contacted authorities to track down your information whether you delete the posts or not, I hope you enjoy your life in prison!""



Basically what I did on that account was post girl's social media pictures to certain subreddits where you talk about the girls in suggestive manners. No nudity or anything, just pictures you find on instagram, vsco, facebook, etc (yes creepy and disgusting I know, I am here looking for legal advice). All of them are in college now (although in some of their social media pictures they may have been 17, I didnt really check the dates, but they werent nude in them or anything), so they aren't minors, nor did I do this to harass them (meaning I never sent them anything or told people to).



When I received that message I deleted the account right away. I have not heard anything in over 2 months so I don't know what to think. Should I just move on? I am mentally going insane waiting for a knock on my door. Anyone with legal background know of anything about these situations? 

Located in New Jersey, US

Also to be specific, suggestive manner meant sexual stuff and what not, and the subreddits were for showing off hot girls, etc. ",20Oct2018,1

5,"When I got to work this morning I was asked if I could cover several shifts but wasn't given any reason. I asked the person I was working with and they said that it was due someone getting fired (we'll call him Bob) 
So I am meant to have a shift with Bob tomorrow and he has no idea he is going to be getting fired, so he has to come in like normal and just carry on until our boss needs to talk to him (as they have to investigate the situation).
I cannot help but feel really guilty knowing that Bob will lose his job tomorrow, and I'm going to have to act as if it is just a normal shift but like it's just going to be playing on my mind that by the end of that day bobs going to be fucked. Like he's probably gonna struggle to get another job due to being fired (so no reference) and the fact that there's pretty much none going in the town I live in. He's also going to be broke, and probably get kicked out of his home as he can barely afford it anyway.
So do I mention it tomorrow before work as he's getting fired for skipping work. He never normally does so there has to be a reason for it, but what if there isn't ? Like should I just give him a heads up or not? I was planning on telling him if I see him walking to work, but what if he tells my boss that I told him? If he finds out that me (and 3 others that aren't our boss) know that he's being fired he's going to be pissed, but at the same time I could be putting my job at risk too.


TLDR: boss is firing someone tomorrow. I know about it and am meant to work with him tomorrow until he's fired. Don't know whether to tell him beforehand as I feel guilty knowing about it. Help? ",20Oct2018,1
6,"Long story short, (ahhaha jk I tried to make it short whoops) my crush and I used to be super close. That was a year ago. We honestly really never talk anymore. I just found out the other day that they never actually liked me, only as a friend. Of course I feel led on and rejected a little, and I felt hurt. I always have to see them everyday because they go to my school. I always have to see them and they are always talkative in class. That’s how I got close to them. I have to sit by them in one of my classes. (Assigned seating) They have tried to talk to me but I basically just kinda brush it off because I really don’t wanna start liking them even more than I do now. I don’t wanna be a butthurt person and just flat ignore them. (I actually kinda have a right to do this because we have never really been in contact and we both ignore each other because of awkwardness) They broke my heart though and knew I liked them but they didn’t like me back so I really don’t wanna go through this again so I feel that ignoring them is the only way. Well not ignore, but hardly talk to them. The part that really sucks is that I knew they liked me but we just stopped talking after that and we both moved on. That’s okay because I knew I wouldn’t really be enough. Do you think I should just brush it off to not overthink again? I really miss the old times but I’m pretty sure that’s long gone. ",20Oct2018,1
7,"Hi reddit,

So my mum is in (what I would call) extreme poverty. She makes £500 a month, yet lives in a three bedroom house with my brother who is in full time education and doesn't work. She claims a series of benefits (I think Tax Credit and Housing Credit, but I'm not sure). She's also got a lot of debts (not sure how much, could be £500, could be £5000).

In case you can't tell she's not very good with money (at all) and will not tell me the details of her financial situation. For example, one time when I lived with her, she sat me down and told me I have to pay £750 rent to her, to cover my food, bills and rent. She only makes £500, and I know for a fact the rent on her house is £500, so I queried this. I asked her to break down all the average monthly costs of the house and she kept avoiding the question and refusing to tell me. This is one of the many reasons I left. I'm not very good with money either, and staying there was not helping me in that regard.

She is due to receive £6k any time over the next week through inheritance money, and £5k in six months time. This money could SERIOUSLY help her out, and get her out of the ditch she's in, if handled properly. She never has money, and is always borrowing from people (she's just asked to borrow £200 from myself).

Now, the thing about poverty is that when you have no money, you don't know how to handle having money. You're just not set up to live that way. I'm terribly worried she's going to lose all the money.

She tells me her plan is to spend a bit of it to buy ""stock"" that she can sell at football/rugby matches and festivals so that she can then turn this money over, making profit. I know that when she goes to these events it's usually very hit or miss. She might make £10 (which she'll then spend on take out the very same night) or she might make £200. But that was always working for someone else. It might be more working for herself, but I can't see it being significantly more.

Plus, I know that work tires her out and causes a lot of stress. Her mental health causes her not to be the most motivated person in the world, and I worry continuing that work, regardless of who buys the stock, will keep her from succeeding in other aspects.

Her other plan *was* to buy a new car and go into taxiing. She previously taxi'd in a town near ours, but barely made anything. She thinks it will be much more lucrative in our city, but I don't believe that. She would have to take a taxi test too, to ensure she knows the roads, and she's failed it twice in our city. She also claims she'll do it alongside her three day a week 10-3 job. I know her energy levels are awful, and I don't see her keeping this going. 

I really really really want this to be the point that she turns her life around, but I don't know what to advise her. £11k isn't a ton of money, but it's a lot for her. I think it'll be just enough to help her out, if handled correctly. What can I try to convince her to do that will help her become motivated and manage this money better?

Ideally, I'd like her to quit her current job, find one with more hours and better pay (however, she's dyslexic and did not finish secondary school or higher, and some employers don't like that. She also uses it as an excuse not to apply to certain jobs), get a new car and pay off her debts.",20Oct2018,1
8,"Im a 26 year old female in Australia. This year I finished a diploma in community services which allows me to work within organisations such as homeless outreach centres, youth support centres, domestic violence organisations, etc. I have anxiety and barely made it through Tafe, which I guess is like community college in the US, so I can imagine what I'll be like trying to keep up with University level study.

I have been accepted into next years intake to complete my bachelors degree in human services. This is a 3 year course, so I'll be 29 when I finish. Thankfully the human services industry is growing in Australia but many positions require a minimum of 2 years experience.

I would love to complete the bachelor degree, as it will provide better job opportunities, but I had always pictured myself having a deposit on a home and starting a family with my partner by the time I was 30. I have very little in savings, less than $10,000, and if I were to continue to study I would be struggling financially.

There's currently a job within the human services sector which I'm confident I would get, as I had to turn it down due to my initial decision to go to University next year.

Here are my options...

1. Attempt to get a job within the industry and work my way up. Have financial security as well as creating job security. Maybe one day, when the kids are older, achieve a bachelor degree.

2. Go to Uni. Be an older mum and older first home buyer, struggle financially for the next 3 years and struggle with the anxiety of studying. But have better job opportunities rather than climbing the ladder.

3. Give Uni a go and if I don't like it then try to get a job, but end up with some government debt which I'll have to pay off through my taxes when I earn over a certain amount of money per year. 

Another thing that is deterring me from University is that I have a lot of self doubt. I'm slow to understand things and I have a terrible memory, as well as crippling anxiety. I'm like a nervous dog that shakes and pees itself, minus the peeing.

TIA",20Oct2018,1

10,"I've lost motivation to work. That's really it. I don't know what to do. 

I sell cars for a a very large company, I'm very good at it. I've been at the company for just over two years. I'm well known through out my store, and people know of me at other stores. I don't do the ""shady used car"" thing and because of that, my customers love me, my co-workers love me, my managers love me. 

I don't want to be around any of them. 

This past year, I had a kidney infection, and a fever of 102.9 at work. I didn't know, but I knew I was sick. One of my co-workers told my manager to send me home, that manager said ""she's fine"". Boom, was in and out of this hospital the next 3 days. 

I had a small infection, my car was broken into, my laptop was stolen, I was tracking one of my best months ever. Boom, I got shingles. Took two days off, sold 2 cars every day for a week and a half, lost my tracking, but still made a paycheck.

I have a lot of resentment due to those two events. I tried to quit my job the middle of September, and my GM begged me to stay. Said what ever I needed, he would help with. I didn't ask for anything but time. I had a full three weeks of time, and my paycheck today was $300. A $300 paycheck doesn't motivate you for anything. 

I'm the only female sales person that has lasted longer than 9months at my store. The lady that was there for 9mo, hasn't worked there for over 5 years. 
I chose this job for 2 reasons; 1) I've only ever worked in male dominant industries 2) I love cars and the people that love cars. 

It's my first huge commission sales job. And I've been straight commission since January of this year. 

When I quit, I was top 3. If I would have ""bucked up"" and stayed the whole month, I probably could have had my personal best month, as well as kicking everyone else's ass.

I wanted to be a game designer, took unity and programming courses online, but lost interest 3 months later. I am somewhat good at drawing and tried to improve on it, but didn’t finish the courses. I tried illustrator and animation and that didn’t last. Later i got interested in writing and i wrote a TV show, i developed a world and characters and wrote a couple of episodes scripts, 4 months later i quit, i tried graphic design, video editing, making youtube videos, writing comedy sketches, pixel art, non of these lasted. In the course of 2 years i started to notice the pattern of me never completing anything and getting bored with stuff. Even in everyday habits, i went to the gym for 3 days and stopped, i participated in charity events for a week and stopped. Is it a personal trait? Is it just that i’m lazy? Or is it just that i haven’t found my purpose yet?

15,"I am out of town for a few days and asked a neighbor to watch my two cats. This neighbor was supposed to come over twice a day to feed my cats (my cats are on a diet so it’s a set amount in the morning/evening) and scoop the litter once a day. I asked the neighbor to come over early in the mornings 7/8 and around 4/5 at night.  I have cameras on the outside of my house so I’m able to see whenever anybody comes/goes.

The problem: yesterday evening around 7 I realized the neighbor had not come over yet. I sent a text reminding the neighbor that last night was the first night basically and to let me know if there were any problems. She responded and minutes later she went over. Well now it’s happening again. It’s 7:30 and there has been no sign of her. 

At this point what do I do? If I would’ve known she would have been this unreliable I would have never asked her. Do I send another text?

16,"Hi Reddit. Sorry for the length of this post. Using a throwaway as my main account has identifiable info and I know colleagues use this site.

I work in a large open plan office. My department occupies a small area of one of the buildings wings. I have been working in my current department for just over a year. My colleagues are all great apart from one guy called ‘Craig’.

Craig is 40, overweight and single. Craig has a compulsion to fidget and make noise at his desk. I don’t mean like tics or Tourette’s, it’s more like fidgeting in his seat or randomly cough or sneeze loudly without covering his mouth (even though he is not sick). He also likes to breathe very loudly, mumble/mutter to himself and will randomly use his inhaler while sitting sedentary. The worst is when he brings food and drink to his desk where he will chew loudly, grind his mouth while eating and slurp when drinking.

I am not sensitive to noises but the sounds he makes drive me mad the entire time I am at work. I feel like I need to leave my desk when he starts eating as it makes me feel disgusted.

He also seems to be totally oblivious to the amount of noise he makes but was quick to chastise a colleague who cracked his knuckles loudly by accident ONCE. 

He also has a very bad habit of listening into my conversations with other colleagues at my desk and butting in with his ‘two cents’. For example: I have just came back from a vacation in NYC. A colleagues asked me if i had been to any shows on broadway. When I mentioned the name of the show I saw he proceeded to talk over me about how good it is from what he has read online (he has never seen this show or even been to NYC). I know it is an open plan office but in no way was he asked to contribute to the conversation. 

He also likes to answer questions that I have directly been asked and will try to finish my sentence when I am talking. I am female and I notice he does this with my other female colleagues who I sit beside but not the males who sit at my bank of desks.

I do not cover the same work as Craig (he is HR, I am secretarial) but he has a reputation of making out that he is an expert in his role when the reality is he is hopeless and leaves the work to my female colleague. He seems to get away with being incompetent even though he has worked in the same role for the last 15 years.

Unfortunately space is limited in my department so I am unable to move desks away from him. What can I do to confront Craig about his behaviour without coming across as passive aggressive or mean? 

I have considered approaching his manager however his manager is under a lot of stress at the moment and I don’t want to add what seems like a trivial issue to his stress. 

I am losing my patience with the issues described above so any advice is much appreciated.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",20Oct2018,1

19,"Okay so I know it 2018 a time where boys can be friends with girls and nothing’s wrong with that bla bla bla. 

But I can’t help the way I feel...

Me and my boyfriend have been together now for a year and my god do I love him dearly and our relationship is great, we live together, have a puppy best relationship I’ve ever had. 

Well here’s the thing that I can’t shake off. He has a female best friend that he’s known since school. When he tells me stories of the two of them I can’t help but feel my anxiety and paranoia kick in. They went on solo holiday trips together, go out all the time, sleep overs, buy each other expensive things, text every day...list goes on. 

I can’t help but hate it... I’ve met her once and I felt as if we were on some kind of relationship. Like we went out for dinner to met her and the waiter asked him “and for your girlfriend?” Gesturing to her. My god I want to flip the table. Second time we meet was my boyfriend came to my work to pick up our dog and I work in theatre so actors come through the door (this part makes sense in a sec...) basically when I went to meet my boyfriend outside stage door She was there too.. and she grabbed the dog out my hand and sat on the step of the door cuddling her .. already hating this... then the led actor walks out the door and my boyfriend recognises him and gets quietly excited and she just says “oh what ever”.. I say good bye to my boyfriend and watch them walk away. Like I really dislike the girl. I’m so worried this is going to ruin the relationship I have with my boyfriend. 

It wasn’t till my boyfriend asked if we all could go on holiday together the 3 of us and our pup to a cottage with a hot tub... I’m sorry but surely any girlfriend would be like omg wtf no?!  Also I’d feel like that’s still weird even if it was a guy instead.. 

He mentioned he got her a holiday for her birthday once for the two of them and I’d feel like if he did that while we’re together I’d go completely insane... I don’t think that’s right? Your priorities change soon as you get into a relationship if you do the same stuff as you did Before than why do you need a partner?... 

Then the two of them go on a IKEA trip not invite me to buy stuff for the flat together.. that’s what me a my boyfriend should be doing right? 

He also went to her birthday night out and is the only male there out of like 12 and again I don’t like that either... I don’t think that’s okay? And being a women myself I know what drunk girls are like.. 

This all might stem from my first boyfriend (who cheated on me with his then female best mate and both are now in fact partners...). 

I just don’t feel like there is ever a 100% innocents when it comes to these kinds of friendships. Somewhere along the line a thought of potential intimacy came into your mind about this friend. Making these relationships stronger based on the fantasy of the long term friends turn lovers making these  what I’d call the “friendship Lusts” that makes male and female friendships work.  
(Sorry I’m rambling and it’s late...) 

I’m basically feeling like I need some advice and maybe someone out there is feeling the same about a partners friendship.. I really can’t help it, I can see her ruining this for us I really can...

21,"  This is going to be long, so just listen. After a band function we all went out to a restaurant to eat, but my friends had to leave and didn't attend. I can't socialize on an unbelievable level. I just cant, I can't express my emotions or thoughts properly. No I don't struggle with depression or anything. I can't have a conversation without talking about someone else or something else, or just acting stupid. I know ""Hey how are you? That's good."" Then everything just falls apart from there.

I'm dead, I don't speak, I'm no different than a rock. Except I give off a weird and awkward vibe. I don't know what to say I feel all over the place then put my earphones in and try to comfort myself with music. I just panic.

She also just so happened to with my close friend that later was sent away, after attempting sucide. She's no longer with him. So I just kinda took awkward glances at her. I feel so stupid. Not to mention she got a glimpse of me last year in a relationship which was horrible and I regret, and I have truly have changed. The way I looked to her was probably like a total dick. I was.

I work in a very physically and mentally demanding job Im a car mechanic at a dealer. I work 10 hour days 5 days a week sometimes even 6 days depending on the week. When I get out of work Im exhausted and have absolutely no motivation to go to the gym, and along with that I'm also starving so first thing Im wanting to do is find food asap and eat. I am not a morning person due to the fact I try to get as much sleep as possible before the next day to redo everything. My only hopes of actually gaining mass and muscle would be working out after work. But I just don't know what I need to eat before I go to the gym or drink, what routines I should do so Im not physically sore the next day where I can't even complete my job. I know at first you'll be sore because your working on muscles that have never been used to that extent. I'm also a vegetarian not by choice but by religion. I will go as far as taking beef protein (Oh well). If there are protein shakes I should take in, or food between the 12-6 time frame please recommend some thing. I plan on signing up for the Gym once I figure out how I should approach all this. I do stay heavily hydrated through out my day.

&amp;#x200B;

To Help Ill lay out a basic time frame of my day

Work starts at 8 ends at 6pm

Usually just get a coffee in the morning and that holds me off till 11:30-12 I don't have an actual breakfast.

Lunch at 11:30-12 depending on how busy (Yes I eat a very good proportional sized meal)

Than I go all the way till 6 without any food.

Then I come home, shower, get food, and sleep.

26,"Yousician's free trial thing is total bullshit. Upon getting a one month free trial, I canceled immediately after it was over, but they had already selected a plan for me and now I have to pay until August 29th of NEXT year and I'm essentially enslaved to it because they won't let me cancel. Yousician is a total scam and they're just trying to get your money. My recent credit card was randomly charged 900 dollars from New York, and since Yousician is also located in New York, I suspect there must be a correlation. I'm beyond pissed right now. Do. Not.

27,"So I've been really good friends with a married couple for a few years now. They were previously renting out a small room that had no kitchen, a small bathroom that had to be shared with another couple who were renting out a room down the hall, slept on a twin size bed, and lived in a room cluttered with all their belongings. They bought food from local food places everyday and spent majority of their days eating deli sandwiches for dinner. They had been living like that for two whole years without any help. As their friend, seeing that really broke my heart because I believed they were great people and deserved much more.

My mother and I were planning on buying a house together. I invited my friends to live with us and we agreed that the bills would be split equally. They would've had their own room, access to any room in the house; I basically asked them just to be part of the family. When we were closing on a house, things that were out of everyones control happened and we had no choice but to look for another house to buy. So for the time being, I moved them into my apartment and they've been living here for 3 months now RENT FREE. I am currently working two jobs, putting food into the house and paying the bills by myself. Since they don't make a lot of money because one of them recently lost their job and they have a HUGE car noted insurance to pay, I agreed that I would be the one to pay the bills while everyone else gets themselves together. The only thing I asked my two friends to help me with was to walk my two dogs that live with us.

Within the three months of them living with me, they sleep all day, they don't clean the house, the room they sleep in currently smells like dirty socks, they barely put food in the house, and they don't contribute any money to help with the bills. The only thing they do is walk my dogs only when I'm at work, sometimes they don't even bother, and they cook dinner every so often, but if they aren't in the mood to eat dinner they won't make it. They have a car that I chipped in $200 and had to co-sign for, because they were denied, and they don't offer to give me rides to work. There was even a time where I was running late for work and I was waiting for a taxi for nearly 10 minutes and they were in their car right in front of me watching me wait for my taxi that I paid $40 for, and didn't even bother to offer me a ride. When I get home from a really long day they don't bother walking my dogs for me, because again they only do it if I'm not there. And whenever I ask them for a favor of some kind, they act if I'm asking for too much. I just feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I feel like I'm paying all the bills and the least I ask for is too walk my dogs at NIGHT and only at night and to keep things clean. Is that too much to ask ?

They constantly tell me that they feel that moving in with me was a mistake because I'm asking for a lot. They feel that I'm constantly attacking them for not helping out. But, if I know that I can be of help in any kind of way, I'm constantly there for them without them having to ask me for anything. I feel like I'm constantly going above and beyond for them, and they don't even care about me as much as I care about them. I also know that they hold some kind of resentment towards me because I asked them to move in with me, we didn't move into a house yet, and we are all currently not in school because we all had planned to move already and transfer to a different school that would be closest to the house. Are they right for feeling some kind of resentment towards me for something that was out of my control? Its not like I pulled a gun to their heads or begged them to move in with me. I was just trying to do some thing out of the kindness of my heart and give them something more, like a big house with a huge backyard. What are your feelings towards this situation ?",20Oct2018,1
28,"When I was around 6 or 7 I was molested by my older sister ashley I never told anyone. This is the first time I've acknowledged it, I've had a lot of issues since then panic attacks, anxiety and to afraid to have any relationships. I tried to kill myself a couple times after but was to ashamed to finish. She said we were just playing but I remember everything she did to me. I also knew she was playing games with my older brother michael. I didn't know for sure if she was doing the same thing with him, I had a feeling but he never said anything.

I was ashamed and scared that noone would believe me because I'm a girl and it was my sister. I had a friend in middle school who had been molested by her dad and when it came out in school it was horrible that let me know I made the right choice. Honestly I don't think I would have survived otherwise. 

After that my nieces were born and I loved them more than anything. I was always afraid of that ""molested becomes molester"" thought. Honestly i love kids, it scares the life out of me I don't know what I would do if I ever hurt them. So I never got to close I would just make sure they had everything they needed. clothes for school etc. and would keep an eye on them, their mom was ashley. As expected she wasn't the best I told my mom and her baby daddies to take the kids from her several times but they kept giving her chances.

 the oldest is kayla she's 11 I practically raised her while her mom was out hoeing around. a couple of weeks ago she told one of her friends that she had been molested by her uncle Mike so her sister found out and told my mom. So my mom trying to get to the bottom of it started asking her questions with my brother Michael and ashley went nuts and said we weren't aloud to speak with her anymore. I tried to meet up with kayla incognito since I'm closer to her I knew she would tell me but my brother told ashley and she basically cut her off from everything. Because my other sisters husband is also named Mike they blamed it on him but he's out of the country working. 

I honestly think that it might have been my brother Michael I think she didn't want to say it was him because he was there. 
Idk what to do I don't want to say anything because there's a chance I might be wrong. My brother has a family a wife and a newborn. Me and my other sister spoke about it she told me that another family member had told her that my brother had touched her when we were younger. We told our mom and that I thought it might be my brother but without talking to kayla idk what to do.

It made me feel like crap I blame myself for everything. If I would've spoken up from the beginning would it have changed anything?
I don't know who to believe or what to do. I was trying to talk to kayla but now that I can't I don't know what I should do. ",20Oct2018,1
29,"And I don’t know how to handle telling them. Fiancé and I are getting married next month and are trying for a child. His parents are fine, they watch their first grandchild all the time.

My dad is a long-time alcoholic who emotionally and physically abused me growing up. We are on excellent terms now and get along great, but neither my fiancé nor I feel that he’s responsible enough to watch our children alone in general, nevertheless resist drinking in the evening. I don’t think he would respect our wishes to not drink and would deem himself “fine”.  

My mom, on the other hand, is an angel on earth. Her husband is the problem; Aside from him being one of the most genuinely annoying people I’ve ever met, he has questionable morals (lots of casual racism, etc.) and has made me uncomfortable on more than one occasion. We both just get a bad vibe from him. The only explicitly wrong action he’s taken is rubbing my thigh when I was sitting next to him on a squished couch bc he supposedly “thought I was my mom”. I’m not saying this should damn him for life or he’d do the unthinkable, but we are not remotely comfortable with the thought of our children alone with him. 

I’m not that worried about telling my dad; I know it would upset him, but I don’t care as much what he thinks and I think he’d understand where I’m coming from. My mom, on the other hand, will totally have her heartbroken if I don’t let them watch my kids. She’s sweet but naive, and I know she won’t see where I’m coming from on her husband.

I had my child very young
I did the uni, job, second career, etc. 
I retired(ish) around 30

I don’t want to die, the thought is not pleasant, but It seems like a lot of stuff happens “early” for me, like I’ve already lived 3 lifetimes. All the *stuff* people *do* I’ve already done. Some of it was really cool, most of it was just fine. So death will probably just happen early too.

31,"It's been tough. I live in LA, with 0 friends, no sex or social life, mountains of debt and apathetic family. Life seems so meaningless. The only thing keeping me from ending life is just the fear of death itself. I feel like I'm sane of mind but I am just so unmotivated, undetermined and apathetic myself. I have a secure job, stable income but aside from that everything is null, void, I feel sub human. The problem that is culminating is that the only thing keeping me going is my decent income ($80k/ year). I can pay my bills, loans, CC, eat well and buy some neat stuff I want every month. But, because of my loneliness, lack of human interaction and depression I can't focus at work. Every time I want to go back to my work task, my mind shifts and I procrastinate or want to do something else like browse Reddit, FB or stock prices. I can't for the life of me force myself to do work more than 5 minutes unless there is a strict deadline that week I need to meet. And even then I'll barely finish the project and come up with some lame excuse as to why it isn't perfect. It barely gets me by but gives my bosses the impression that work is lackluster and minimum or average.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure this is a result of undiagnosed ADHD, my depression, my personality, maybe just who I am. But I do not and cannot force myself to work. Maybe my work is unfulfilling or maybe it's because we don't have a tech lead and I lack direction and creativity. I am not sure what's going on. I haven't done any work all week.

33,"     At around 3am a few weeks ago I went on a huge rant to my friends online about how I hate being a virgin (I am a 16 year old male) and asked them jokingly if they knew anyone. Expecting nothing my friend sent me this girls snapchat and told her I was just looking for casual sex. Fast forward a week later we have sex and we both agree to do it again next Sunday. 
    A few days later she tells me she doesn't really want to do it anymore. I asked her if she wants the do it another time or never. After a while of talking she essentially says she is not looking for casual sex and seemed to regret to stopping to such a low level as in random sex. I was going to just say goodbye but she made it clear she wanted a friend at least and I asked her out on a date. She agreed and wants to see a movie. 
    After chatting for a while I honestly have no clue if she is into me and think she might be doing it to make herself feel better about hooking up with me. The worst part is she is one of the very few women I have ever met that can actually make me laugh and I think I am catching feelings.

The fence is very loose and I constantly worry about it falling and her dog going after my older dog and two small dogs. It’s also tipping over onto our side because she stacks logs against it. We’ve had to prop it up at one spot. Their dog constantly picks fights with my senior dog with heart problems and arthritis, my dog has gotten scars on his muzzle and nose from trying to attack each other through the fence. The only time I hear her talk to her dog she is yelling at him. I feel like I should report her or something, but don’t want to be that type of person. I’d try to go talk to her, but we’ve asked her to move the logs before and she refused, she also refused to cut down a tree that is 70% in our yard over our pool, it may be pushing on the fence as well but the leaves are so dense I can’t tell.

43,"So I work with a girl who essentially has a fake life that she talks to me and the people we work with about as if it's true. Some of the lies have points that can prove she is lying, but others it's just assumed (like you know when someone's lying, the situation etc.).     The first lie I picked up on was that she owned her own house and her boyfriend had just moved into it. At the time she was 17 and as far as I am aware, you can't legally sign for a house at 17 as you're still classed as a child. 

She also booked off two weeks for a holiday (middle of September) to Spain with her boyfriend, and came back telling us that she had broken up with him. When we questioned it she told us that she left to go on the Sunday, and then on the Wednesday she caught him sleeping with a girl and she pulled him off her and broke up with him there and then in their hotel. She then went on to explain that she was dreading the rest of the week as she had to spend the Thurs, Fri and Sat in Spain by herself. She doesn't have any photos with her bf, or of the holiday so this was suspicious from the start.

Then because of the break up she has sold the house and already got a new one even though it's been like 4 weeks?

She has also faked job interviews previously, every time she says she's got the job, but she's never quit, and isn't working 2 jobs. The most recent lie was that she had a induction day at a local store on Wednesday, but couldn't go because her brother was rushed to hospital, when I asked why she said he was ill and they diagnosed him with diabetes. But a diabetes test is a 24hr fast and your bloods are monitored, or at the very least a blood test, but this wouldn't be the final thing, and it definitely wouldn't have been done in an accident and emergency room.

She also claims to drive, but we have all our licenses (or passports) on the system as ID, and hers is a provisional. When we asked about it she said that the DVLA didn't want it so they said she could keep it and they'd send her the actual license as well.
She then lost said license and got a speeding ticket/ a parking fine (changes depending on who she tells) all in one week and managed to get a new license and pay both fines off within a few days.

There's so many more, but I really just want to know whether I should pull her aside and let her know that we can tell it's a lie, or just leave her to it? I can't help but feel embarrassed for her, as none of us have interesting lives, only one out of the seven of us drives, so I don't know who she's trying to impress. She has only just turned 18 so we don't expect her to have a life like this either?

44,"Hi. Honestly I have no idea why I’m turning to reddit to try and make me feel better but I can’t see my counsellor until Monday and I have no idea what to do with myself. So my dad calls me to tell me that he ran over our bichon who wasn’t even 6 months old with a truck, and he killed him. We got him about a month after our 13 year old chihuahua died, which was only a few weeks after my grandma (mom’s mom) died. They rushed the little guy to the vet but apparently he died right away as he broke his neck. 

My parents absolutely hate each other already. They only stay married because my mom has a degenerative brain disease and he would feel too guilty leaving her at this point... and every trip home is a mess and they just fight and fight.., my dad calls her “fat tub of shit” etc behind her back to me and mocks the way she walks and her tremors (side effects of her disease). I mean she’s no peach to him either but she kind of has an excuse.... and if they couldn’t hate each other enough my dad goes and runs over her dog which has been the only comfort to her since her mom and our older dog died... and my moms disease makes her very irritable and she repeats herself a lot and she just can’t stop talking about how it was my dads fault and how she’ll never forgive him.

47,"I'm 20 living on my own. I have receding gums on my lower teeth. So low the roots are exposed and very sensitive. I saved enough money to go to periodontist and get an eval. I asked for a gum graft, dentist has lots of experience so I trust him. He tells me he can do a pin hole treatment to help with the recession. Then he says something about using lab grown tissue and needing to take my blood to make the tissue work for my body or something. I didn't quite understand but I just thought ""ok, gum graft, a modern gum graft"". I look online at his website and look at the procedure. It's a new type of pinhole treatment where basically they stick a needle inside your gums, and push the tissue up over the root. Hard to explain but basically in the end your roots are covered more and everything's better. 

The day of the treatment they don't clean my teeth (I thought that was weird, but I didn't say anything because this guy has 40 years experience and im a 20 year old trying to be an adult afraid of confrontation), and they get to it. They inject me with numbing solution and get to it. A little over an hour later he tells me that it's basically a very strong glue holding everything in place. I'm thinking, ""ok cool, the gums gotta have time to stick in place and heal"". He says everything went great.

Fast forward a week of me eating pudding and mashed potatoes later and the ""surgical dressing"" around my lower teeth falls off in pieces. I thought this would reveal my new gums. Nope. No change. If anything my teeth feel more sensitive but I read online that that is normal so I thought I'd grin and bear it. I call DR to express my concerns that there's no physical change and he says ""I'll have to review my notes but from my understanding this surgery was to prevent the recession, not cover the bone."" I die inside. I wanted to cover the bone. That's what I went in wanting. That's what I had researched. That's what I thought the pin hole was. I panic and say ""Oh ok, I was just wondering if I was supposed to notice something. Thanks"". And now I fucking feel so stupid. The communication was horrible because I thought I was getting a cover up and recession prevention through the pin hole procedure. Now I don't know what to do. I feel taken advantage of. My follow up appointment with the DR is this coming Tuesday and I feel like I can't do anything to dispute what was done since I signed everything and nodded along like a naive little girl. I doubt there's anything I can do. Maybe recession prevention alone is better for some reason. I just don't know. 


Am I an idiot? How can I bring it up to him that there was a major misunderstanding with the treatment I received without sounding accusatory?

50,"Hey guys

So my life is 100%, actual shit right now. I've been extremely depressed, suicidal, agoraphobic, and had severe anxiety for a few years now. I had to leave at the end of high school and finish from home because of it, I still went to university, but this March, I had to come home because I literally couldn't function as a student or leave my room.  

Anyway, I've been a ""nerd"" or whatever my whole life, video games, anime, cartoons, comics, the works. When I was 14, my friends and I started cosplaying. It was mostly for fun and to socialize and go to cons together, and we never really put much effort into our costumes. Then, we split ways after school, and when I went to uni, none of my friends were really the ""nerd"" type unfortunately, and I was too busy/wanting to kill myself to seek them out. When I came home though this year, I suddenly found myself with some more time on my hands, and decided to take up cosplaying again, and totally fell head over heels in love with it. It's not even wearing them that I love, it's making them; the sewing, and armour making, and prop building, and wigs and makeup galore. I started an instagram account too to start showcasing my work.

I'm really lucky that I live in a large city with a HUGE cosplay community. But no matter how hard I try, I can't find an ""in"", if that makes sense. I never used to go to cons or interact with anyone other than my school friends when I was younger, so I don't have any previous connections- 0 friends in this hobby with me. I've been to 3 cons this year since then, and met LOTS of people, and followed them and consider them acquaintances but I still don't have anyone I consider a friend.  

The problem is that I really love this hobby, but it's awful not being able to share it with anyone. The reason I'm posting this is that I'm actually at a con right now, today was the first day, and it's a very small one. I went, and I could only stay a few hours, because I just felt so awkward, and alone, and everyone around me seemed so cliquey (and no one I even vaguely knew went this day). I want to go tomorrow, but I'm so sick of doing what I've done at every con this year, which is just awkwardly wander around the dealers hall for hours and pop into random panels on my own.  

I'm so pathetically lonely (no friends back home, barely talk to my friends back at uni at all, my social interactions since March have consisted of solely my parents, and my job) and since I love this hobby and there's a huge community, I want to be able to be a part of it, I just don't know how. And it's hard since I literally have *never* had trouble making friends before, it's always been so easy for me.  

Any advice at all is appreciated. I'm just really lonely and today and every other con has been exhausting and uncomfortable and don't want to have a shitty time tomorrow because I think my costume is pretty damn good and I want wear it proudly and have fun.

If I follow my passion - something I was really good at (I had a record deal at 21)- I'll have no way to provide for my family now. If I don't pursue it, I feel like I'm dying inside, and I'm not living life. I struggle with this daily. Part of the issue is I can't work my day job and work on music - it just won't happen.  Too much to do and not enough time...

Any insight is welcome.  I'm just trying to figure this out and not be depressed. I want to be in music, not the government with a steady paycheck.  

Everyone says ""just do it! Take a chance!"" Well, it's not that easy. 

Just curious to hear from others who have experienced the same emotions.

53,"There are a few girls in my life that when I walk with, we'll walk extremely close to one another to the point of constantly bumping arms or bumping into one another but neither of us will say anything about this. These are women that I wouldn't necessarily say are my good friends, but I, think, I flirt with them and we have some good rapport and I like them and think they're attractive. In contrast, the two women I have as good friends and nothing more than that I never walk with like that or in that close of proximity. Other women that I've walked with that may not have been as good as friends or I had no intention of flirting with or anything else are the same as the two in the friend category, where we walk like a foot apart with absolutely no contact. I'm very conscious of my spacing at all time and when I walk with women in the former category it feels uncomfortable but in a good way. But then again I may just be purposefully distancing myself form women that I don't feel attracted to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is a sign of anything, I think it may be somewhat dumb to think of it as such, but I am retarded socially and can't read body language and can barely read regular language(from women). Sorry for such a dumb question. I just assume that women would be more conscious of their spacing with me unless they were doing it purposefully. I don't consider myself to be attractive enough for women to be all over me unconsciously so my only thoughts are they're unaware that they're doing it and are clumsy or they are unaware that they're doing it because they feel comfortable around me, but I would assume my ""good"" female friends feel comfortable around me when walking but as I said I probably distance myself from them on purpose.

To sell:

1. 2005 Mercedes-Benz C230K
-- Texas registered under my mom's name.
-- Insured in her name with myself listed as an operator.
-- Battery currently dead from disuse.
-- Here in Nevada.
-- Not smog tested.

2. 1993 BMW 325ic
-- California registered under old owner, I have the signed title/bill of sale with myself as the purchaser, but it's from about a month ago and I hadn't bothered yet to register it in my name. I still have the old plates which neither of us realized were supppsed to be removed. 
-- Insured in my name, switching to my mom's policy tomorrow though for the savings.
-- In Nevada here too.
-- Passed california smog test recently, but haven't Nevada smog tested yet.

To buy:

1. 2002 Dodge Dakota 
-- Nevada registered.
-- Nevada smog checked.
-- Here in Nevada.
-- Will insure under mom's policy in my name once car loan goes through, then will cancel other two cars insurance as soon as they're ready to sell. I believe that means I can cancel the Mercedes-Benz C230K's policy right now, and the BMW 325i's policy as soon as I get it smog checked and registered.

60,"I have been a very insecure person all my life, I have suffering of social phobia, an avoidant personality disorder and a dependent personality disorder, very instable and non-functional with people all my life, totally null.

From the ending of 2016 to this recent moment I have been suffering of depression, gender dysphoria and an ill father made be hit the bottom.

The last recent months, with the recovery of my father and start of my treatment I have felt better, I'm becoming who I want to be.

This depression made me think of my life, I'm not a weak person, in summary, my therapist has told me I'm going through an empowering process, but I'm afraid of feel like that.

I have got a lot better with people, more secure, less anxious, more assertive even, now I'm thinking in thinking in the possibilities, and I want to get a job, I need it, but I have never been in one in all my life and for the first time I'm actually considering it, but there is something that still holds me, there is still a heavy abulia on my shoulders, a creeping asthenia in my body, I don't go out of home yet.

What the would the ideal me say? Now I already made the request for change my ID, but it still doesn't arrive and I haven't been able to change my school diploma! The days count! It will start the peak season and everyone is looking for job! The person I really am would be able to sort this out, because those are insignificant details for her, why can't I do it?

64,"Hi all.. I'm posting here because I'm currently really concerned for my girlfriend. I'm 31 she's 34. We've been together since April of this year.

She has had a heroin addiction in the past, but has been clean on her own for years. She also has an auto immune disease which developed in the past 3 years 

When we met, she was upfront with everything she's taking. I knew what she was into in the past and what she's dealing with now. ADD medication, medication for anxiety, antidepressants, and non-opiate pain meds.

This part is kind of confusing to explain. She moved in with me, and decided to try to taper off her meds since she no longer had access to her doctor and to get better without pills. In summary, she didn't have a plan for support, it didn't work out for her, and she went back to see her doctor for a short while. Then she moved back with me so we could move together back to her home. I know how all of this sounds.

My situation now, is we finally got to her place where we're living with her folks until we can get established. It's been 8 days. Her history with her parents is a long story. Suffice it to say that there's some drug abuse early on, residual resentment, distrust, and emotional pain littered in this history.

I got caught in the middle. My girlfriend prepped me by cautioning me about her mom's intentions. I tried to go in without bias as I normally do. I need to hear two sides of a story.

My girlfriend had a doctor appointment and got her meds two days ago. While I was waiting, I stopped by the house. Her mother sidebarred me warning me about her opiate addiction (I already knew since the beginning). At one point her doctor had prescribed her opioids, which her mother saw her essentially relapse into addiction under her care. She tearily relayed a story of my girlfriend nodding out after making dinner, at which point she intervened with the doctor. Why was the doctor prescribing an opioid for pain to someone with a previous heroin addiction? She stopped getting those after that and has been clean.

In this sidebar she asked me what meds that I knew she was getting. She did ask me in a way that was going behind my girlfriend's back - her mother knows that it's confidential, but given her history and the fact that we're living there with her parents, all I could see was a mother worried about her child's wellbeing. I wanted to be honest and to assure her I would look out for her. At this time, she also warned me about her potential for addiction to the ADD medication.

I don't lie, and ended up telling my girlfriend about the conversation with her mother. My girlfriend took it as the biggest perfidy, and was really hurt that I would breach her confidentiality. I realise I am in the wrong partially for not saying ""no,"" but I was just trying to do what I though was right by being honest on both ends. I don't feel good keeping secrets like that.

This was two days ago that she got her meds. Since then, she has slept only a few hours. She was normally in bed by 10-11pm since we've been together without the ADD meds. She didn't go to bed with me the past two nights. I confronted her the first night about her aberrant behavior to me, since she immediately changed which I think is a direct result of all of the medication. She said ""isn't that the point,"" with tears in her eyes. She had been feeling ""not like herself"" off the medication, but really she was pretty normal to me. A little scattered and hard to decide on things, but not to any extreme.

Since she's had these meds, she seems really different. She spent the past two days organising the bathroom and kitchen, as well as her room. It's really apparent today that she is suffering from a lack of sleep. She's speaking really softly and her memory is off. For example, she thought she told me something and is adamant about it, though that never happened. This has happened all of today. I fear she is becoming psychotic. Not sure if that's the right psychological term, but she is only getting more stressed, scattered, in pain, angry at me. I think she really needs sleep, which I told her. (""Stop saying that. Do you know I have serious medical conditions?"" Basically she dismissed it though she said previously in the day she's exhausted and in pain) She threatened to call the cops because I was sitting in the living room while she was cleaning the kitchen, and asked me to give her space.

Do I have any recourse for her medication negatively affecting her? I know it has not been a long time on her meds, but it's really pushing us apart. We have been through some rough, real talks, but this has peaked the rough scale since I can't trust her grip on reality. I'm considering getting my own place for a few nights just to clear my own head and to give her space. But I don't want to seem like I'm giving up on her. She is just really hard to be around when she is borderline incoherent and hostile towards me. I defend my actions and memory, but that only makes it worse when it's contradictory to her. Her mother sees this and had expressed her various concerns to me.

I love her and this is only coming from the best of places. I don't think I can talk to her calmly in this state  about this, since every conversation today has led to an argument. Her mind been going back and forth and it's not clear to me what her intentions are moment to moment.",20Oct2018,1
65,"Backstory: 
I took the PSAT in sophomore/junior year of HS and received a 950/960. I knew that was bad but in junior year I took a class and studied for the actual SAT and received a 1100. I thought this was good for my first SAT and a major improvement from the PSAT. Then I study again for the next SAT and I get a 1110. I’m surprised but content. I decide that I needed to do better in the math sections so I studied that for a while and my next SAT, I got a 1100. 

I received this score today and after finding out I immediately laid down and started to cry because I felt like a disappointment to my parents. I studied my ass off and my mom after I told Her said “it’s because you didn’t study enough.” But I swear I did. 

I looked at colleges on Long Island/NYC that I could get into and all them usually accept people with a higher GPA/SAT score than me. This destroyed me because I felt like I would not get into a good college and that I would destined for nothing good. 

I take 3 AP classes and an IB class yet I still got only an 1100. I just felt stupid. Felt like I didn’t deserve to be in those classes. My GPA is 88/3.3 or a B. And I feel like that it sucks for an AP/IB student like me. 

Then I get angry and started silently cursing at myself and at the College Board. For making students take a test that could determine a good college or not. It’s bullshit. It really is. It’s not about education for everyone/ an equal chance. It’s about money and good they look. I don’t need one test to make myself look smart to other schools. I’m better than that. And I began to insult the idea that you have to get into good college to get a good job later on. I knew that was false, it doesn’t have be that way. 

Yet I always put myself down right after and just say “I’m stupid.” “I suck.” “I’m a failure.” 

It’s senior year and I’m running out of time. What do I do? Study and next the SAT in Nov/Dec? What if I do bad again? Am I screwed? So many questions. I’m just lost.

I want to start by saying I love my job. Really, I do. It's fun for me, I love all my co-workers (we get along very well), the job works well with my school schedule, and it's literally a 3 minute commute from my home. It's almost perfect.

The only thing that's bothering me is one of my managers. We have four of them, who rotate shifts constantly. The other three obviously have their own personalities and styles, but generally they are likeable, not too intimidating, and willing to teach.

But there is one manager (I will refer to her as A) who has, from day one, expressed disinterest and annoyance towards me.

She was the manager who initially trained me on register, and made sure to let every other manager know that she hated training and this was a waste of her time (she did this in front of me and made me feel kinda bad) but I figured this was just her style I guess. Things have only gotten worse. I'll try to greet her in the break room, only to get stares from her and nothing said. I catch her giving me stink eyes on the floor while I'm working. She's generally rude and sarcastic, and when I make a mistake she's a bit condesending about it. 

I'm too afraid to bring this up with any other manager because when I was hired, the store owner said that she takes pride in the fact that they've never had any drama in her store and everyone is like family.

I am married male, a very introvert one and slowly learning how to speak up. I am so very open with my wife, but when dealing with any other person, I talk as little as possible. Also please bear with my english.

This time, due to family circumstances––that's a thing in our region––I may or may not confront my older cousin. If this sub is not appropriate for this kind of advice, please point me to the right place. Here's my story.

tl;dr below.

---

I am married for about 3 years. My wife and I lived with my parents in law, and they are super supportive. My parents no longer live together. As I mentioned, I rarely speak with anybody, and that applies even to my parents. I am in the habit of being 'controlled' especially by my Dad. This mostly due to the fact that I can't speak openly with him, but also there is some factor that I was being thought that I have to listen to my parents. I've had fights with my wife regarding my condition, and I am trying hard to speak up form time-to-time.

We had been revealed that we can use our grandparent's old house in the middle of the city; the house is adjacent to my cousin's portion of the deal. A good house, but not in a good condition, and it needs some attending to. That was ~2.5 years ago, when my job gave me minimum wage and we are struggling to fit our monthly needs.

A few months later, probably seeing the house was not being attended to, I got a call from my Dad to go to my cousin's house––it's located at the edge of city. As my wife and I arrived there, my cousin and my dad had an oral deal to barter the house ownership: my cousin will 'use' the house adjacent to her, and I will 'use' her house in the suburb, with my Dad paying the rest of the mortgage (~10 years). In the suburb house--a small, single family house--, they had arranged a celebration for the event, and even brought my senile grandparent there as a witness. I can't speak up and just said yes.

This was fine to me, not to my wife--I never cared--; but my Dad had turned out had been borrowing money due to his circumstances, and can hardly pay the house's mortgage. My job is okay now, but not in the condition for me to have the extra money to pay for the mortgage, and I don't feel like paying for it either. This month, the mortgage was due for 3 months and the bank is trying to seize the house. Early this week we had moved the furnitures we brought, and slowly moving the rest of the stuff to my parent's house and my parent-in-law's house.

I don't really care about the house, as we are trying to get our own house next year when I have my raise and my salary is sufficient. I really care about our me and my wife's life going forward, and I don't really want to be bothered with this kind of stuff.

However, I've come to the understanding that this is very not nice at all. My cousin though is playing victim, and stating via text that ""we are wasting his/her 'kindness' to my Dad."" ""He/she does not want to see our face in the city-house.""

Tonight, I am going there to pick up the last of our stuff to be moved. I may be meeting my cousin, and I want to teach him/her a lesson.

What I can say so far is just defence from the text:

- &lt;Cousin name&gt; are taking advantage of my dad bartering the house with him paying of the rest of the mortgage (although my guess is that my Dad had to borrow some money to lessen his debt; that's why the barter happened in the first place).
- It is not ""kindness"" since it was a barter with the advantage on &lt;Cousin&gt; so &lt;Cousin&gt; is greedy.
- I don't care about your house as it's never mine to begin with. It's our grandparent's house.

What else can I argue from this case?

She tells me that things happened between her and a friend, and paints the scenario clearly for me telling me that after she kissed him, she didn't feel the same or let alone felt anything. She's always been truthful, and I trust her word on that. She tells me that she kissed him because she was trying to move on (which I understand, it's her life) but she regrets it heavily.

Soon after, she gets out the car and starts crying. Me being the way I am (And still in love, btw) I go out to console her. I hold her, and she immediately curls up to me. We spend the literal next three hours just being close to each other, talking about random things, doing my best to make her laugh. I go pee, come back, and we spend more time laughing as I hold her sides and arms like I always used to (Physical touch is something that helps her calm down, but only on her shoulders and hair.)

I then proceed to be honest and tell her how I feel about me lying to her, and tell her the guilt of lying in and of itself tears me up everyday, and I'm trying to live my best life forward. We keep making eye contact and she keeps smiling, but she then kisses me passionately and holds my hands for the next ten minutes or so, showing me the obviously has feelings for me still. She apologizes after, and I continue to hold her letting her know it's okay. 

This next part gets me:

I ask her what she wants, and she says she doesn't know. This to me says she wants to be with me, but can't. She said herself she's afraid of being hurt again. What should I do?

We do see each other every Sunday, as we're both part of a growing church and we're volunteering. Also, her parents and I are great friends and would've even let me marry her, and they still love me greatly.

She's said she still loves and cares about me as well.

I'm also personally working on myself, because I know I have issues, however sometimes people don't change.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR Ex is now back in my life and we kissed and shared several hours together just being in one another's presence. She says she loves and cares still, but say's she can't be with me in fear of being hurt.

83,"I'm an 18 year old male and currently in college.  The last couple months have kinda been a shit show.  I started this school year at lets call ""School1.""  School1 ended up being the school to provide the most financial aid, which is why I originally decided on it.  My family, however, could not afford for me to live on campus, so I had to commute.  The commute could range from one hour to two hours (both there and back).  My major was architecture so the work load was fairly heavy in workshops and studio.  I thought that this is what I wanted to do with my life.  I was so eager coming into the school year.  Over the course of a few weeks, I was really struggling.  I didn't enjoy architecture.  I ended up being a week behind on assignments in some of my classes, and there'd be times where I wouldn't be done to head home until midnight or one in the morning.  Overall I didn't feel comfortable at School1 with the environment and the work.  My family and I talked it over and agreed it'd be best for me to withdraw and go to a community college, ""School2.""  I came in at a weird time, so I'm only part time with two classes, but it's better than what I had at School1.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want to do with my life.  Video games have been an outlet for me for years whenever I'd feel down or stressed, but they just aren't helping.  I've found myself at times just aimlessly wandering the internet with no reason.  A lot of my closest friends have moved away for school so I haven't been able to meet them in person for a few months.  I just don't feel motivated to do anything, and I don't know how to get that motivation back.  How? How do I?  The word ""Depression"" keeps coming to mind and I keep trying to put it away.  I just...don't know.  What can I do to get motivated again?",20Oct2018,1

88,"I hope this isn't a silly question but i'm pretty clueless about this stuff. I'd like to provide background info so I can explain why it's giving me anxiety.  Earlier this year this guy and I were ""dating"" for a few months. We are really just passionate/lustful for each other but I mistook it for potential love because I have a tendency to be codependent. I wasn't ready to have sex with him, but I gave him head and that was it (he's not a tool and wanted to return the favor but i declined). With that being said, we do care for each other but are just not compatible. And neither of us are interested in being in a committed relationship. 

Anyway, toward the end of that period, I ended up going off on him for something a bit stupid and he got fed up. I eventually apologized but we both just started speaking to each other much less and stopped communicating altogether. We still flirted on social media a little occasionally. A few months later, we have started talking again. A couple weeks ago we both were flirting and basically wanted to hang out to have sex. 

During this time though I discovered a wart on my labia. The weird part is I've had a couple on my bikini line since I was a child (10 years old) and I have no idea why because I wasn't sexually active at that age. I didn't even kiss anyone until I was 18.  I went to a doctor for the ones on my bikini line  when I was younger and they said it was a common wart or a skin tag and to just let them go away naturally.  Now, I'm not sure if it's even HPV or I just simply spread those bikini line warts to my labia from shaving (i did shave over the warts on my bikini line). I'm going to a dermatologist soon and I just went to a doctor this week but I'm still worried it's an STI. I am a virgin aside from the oral sex I gave him so I am really clueless how I would have even gotten HPV prior to the oral sex.  

It's been two weeks and I still haven't hit him up about hanging out and he had told me to let him know when I was free. I don't want to have sex with him until the warts are gone (or I at least found out what the hell is even on my body because it hasn't been confirmed they're warts). It's making me very ashamed. I've suffered with anxiety and depression for years and this is just magnifying it. I'm also not sure if I'm overthinking this about contacting him and it's not even his business... especially if we aren't in a monogamous relationship. He was respectful during the times we were about to have sex, but we process our emotions very differently and it's hard for me to discuss certain things with him even though we both care for each other.

Either way i have the fear of talking to girls because my 1st rejection of trying to ask this girl if we could br friends.So i gave up on trying to talk to girls.I don't even think they would like me anyways.All i do is game and listen to Edm.

90,"I'm going to try and keep this short. So my dad's in the military. The last place we were at, my mom had a daycare where she watched a bunch of little kids and every afternoon she'd take them to the park so she could hang out with other women that watched kids. They were no lower than a 5 except for one lady that was a 2. Every day after I came home from school, my mom would drag me over there to help her out, but I always ended up doing my homework at the park. There were two that I sort of had crushes on. I'll just refer to them by their ratings. 6 got divorced and 7 was about to get one and didn't. (I hope to God that I'm not giving away things that'll lead back to me because I'd kill myself if they found out about how I feel through a post asking for advice) 6 has a kid 5 years younger than me and 7 has two babies. I feel like (I knew) I was fucking stupid for this, but I was always willing to watch their kids whenever they needed a break. They were both 24-30, but I was 13-14 during these feelings while I was still around them. Soon, I was begging my mom to bring me with her on girls night like. Which probably made them think I was in the closet which is probably why they were so comfortable around me. Anyways, we moved last winter and it made my feelings stronger. I raised my grades from Bs and Cs to all As because I wanted to be able to get a job where I financially stable enough to take 6 away from her problems. The grades aren't bad, BUT THE REASON. Looking back on it I feel like that weird kid that volunteers at the taxedermy center every summer. Well, I got over 6 because she just got engaged to some black guy. So it was just 7. She got pregnant and it kind if woke me up. I knew I shouldn't crushing on her. I blocked both of them on Instagram and unliked all of their photos. They were out of my life and I felt okay. Then my mom told me she gave birth right before I started making this post. It's a boy. This is fucking weird and dumb and I hate it, but I cried. I don't know why, but I cried. For 40 minutes. I hate myself because of this. I'm getting regrets for blocking them on IG, but I know that it's not good me. I can't help how I feel. I don't want to feel this way, but I can't help it.

Things that happened in 2010 or 2011, I think happened in 2008 or 2009. I need explanations and instructions broken down very, very simply and sometimes several times. I need to ask for definitions for many words in conversation. I don't remember how I felt when I did most things I've done or why I did them.

115,"Hi guys,

Tl;dr, I am looking for advice on how to go about starting dating in your mid to late 20s, I hope that some of you have personal insights and successful outcomes from doing so!

Details as below, 

I am in my mid 20s and I am very inexperienced relationship wise. I have downloaded tinder and get OK results in terms of matching and so on, but I have big anxiety over meeting girls in person in case the topic of 'past relationships' comes up... 

I have made really good advances in addressing my social anxiety over the past couple of years. But dating remain my weak point!

I realized this was becoming a potentially bigger issue as I have found myself totally obsessing over some girl, who largely seems uninterested in me. Like I sit around waiting for her to respond and etc, even though I know rationally it won't go anywhere!

This obsessive episode seriously has made me consider therapy as I realize how truly unhealthy this behavior is. I am probably mentally elevating this girl to an extremely high level. I think the root cause of this is that she has been friendly to me and is seemingly safe to speak to.  So the answer in view seems to be to put myself out there more and meet girls who are meeting me for the purposes of dating (hence tinder), so we are on the same wave length from the start.

However, I still really need advice on how to go about dating as a mid-20s guy, I feel so far behind my peers!

122,"Hey everyone (:  


So my very good friend is a US and European history buff. I enjoy talking politics/life/music/guitar with him, as those are our main areas of interest in common. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the issue: He has an encyclopedic memory, and without fail manages to turn every conversation into a technical discussion. I can keep up for a while, as I enjoy stuff like that. But I simply don't have the type of fact-based memory that he has, nor do I enjoy discussing things like (as hypothetical example) ""the difference between a 1999 Fender Strat vs the 1998 model with slightly different pickups, and how they sound through 2 different tube amps"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Our conversations, almost every time without fail, derail into (what feels like) a lecture from him. We became roommates a year ago, and overtime I've started to somewhat retreat from the conversations once I sense he's getting on a role. He's also horrible with social cues, and will keep talking indefinitely unless impeded (i love him, but it's true lmao).   


I've known the guy for over a decade, and I know that it comes from a good place in his heart. But it frustrates me. I've discussed it with him before in no uncertain terms. But he's the most ""take me as you are or don't take me at all"" person you'll ever meet. He's aware it annoys me, but he lacks the flexibility to change it.   


In the interest of being up front, I'll admit that I sometimes resent him for it. 

1) It kinda makes me feel like I can't keep up with him intellectually. Or that he'd be better off talking about these things with someone more knowledgeable.   
2) It makes me feel like he's using my ears instead of having a conversation with me. This feeling comes from the fact that his history stuff is often only loosely related to the subject or point he's making. So it seems like he goes out of his way to drop the knowledge whether it's in context or not. 

3) His inflexibility requires my already flexible traits to become even more flexible, and I sometimes feel taken advantage of. 

It's just a fault of my character. When someone goes on and on about a subject I know little about, it makes me feel small. If it's a one time thing, it doesn't bother me. I actually love learning new things from people that know more than me about given subjects. But it happens every time, and that's not fun or stimulating for me.   


So to clarify: The advice I'm asking for doesn't really include whether or not I should be friends with him. He's family at this point. He's also done more for me than any other friend, and is a wonderful confidant and extremely loyal. So it's 100% in my best interests to come up with a solution. But I'd really like to get all your input on this.   


Thanks in advance, and sorry for the length.   


TL;DR: Best bud is an encyclopedia who doesn't get social cues, and turns conversations into lectures; he knows it annoys me. How do I fix this?",20Oct2018,1

He has always been a worry-wart, and he is now worry about school not regulating me (as if they regulate students in the first place) or me get into trouble with the authority something.

Therefore, I need to think up someway to persuade my father to allow me to stay here. In order to do that, I need to prove to him that I am able to cover a majority, if not all, of my living expenses and make him stop worrying too much. However, truth is, I am somewhat uncertain myself, since I don't know if I am able to find a job that pays enough for someone who has no experiences like me, and I really don't want to waste my parents' money.

I was there for a year and a half. *Much* longer  than I’d planned on staying once I’d gotten a sense of how bad things were, but I was working such insane hours I didn’t have time to find another job. When I finally quit, I was so overwhelmed I took two months off and just burned through my savings getting my bearings on normal life again.

I really don’t want to screw up this great new job. But whenever I sit down to work on anything, I’m overcome with anxiety.

130,"I posted this on r/ADHD but didn't get any responses and would really like some input. Am I being ridiculous/should I just suck it up? Am I being unhealthy and just blowing this up as an excuse to look for someone who won't monitor my weight? Is any of this a good reason to move to someone new? And if I do, is it likely to be any different, or is strict weight monitoring and having to stay within a certain weight range just part of being on medication?

&amp;#x200B;

Back in August, I was referred to a psychiatrist for ADHD diagnosis and medication management. Here's how our appointments have gone so far.

First appointment: This went well overall, and I walked out with a diagnosis of ADHD-CT and an Adderall XR prescription. One aspect of it was pretty off-putting, though. She asked about medication, including birth control. I said I wasn't on it because I wasn't sexually active at the moment and didn't see that changing anytime soon, but that I'd definitely start taking it again if it did. Then she lectured me on birth control, ex. how condoms work, said that I should really be on something, and implied that I was irresponsible for not currently being on it.

Second appointment: I lost five pounds in my first month on Adderall, dropping from 123 to 118. In my defense, I had no idea how intense the appetite suppressant effect would be and the only professional advice I got on the matter was ""make sure to eat."" I was used to just eating when I felt hungry and didn't notice the weight loss as it was happening. I also had my wisdom teeth taken out that month and was on a liquid/soft food diet for a week due to the swelling. Losing five pounds in one month without trying is scary, though. She warned me that she would have to stop prescribing to me if I kept losing weight and asked if I had a history of eating disorders (no, never). Determined to avoid further weight loss, I spent the next month working on my diet and eating habits and felt like I'd gotten into a good routine, with calorie-dense meals and snacks, using a calorie-counting app, and weighing myself regularly at home, where I drifted between 113 and 118 throughout the day.

Third appointment (yesterday): I weighed in at 116, two pounds lighter than at my last appointment. She again warned me that I would lose my medication if I kept losing weight and asked if I had a history of eating disorders, and if I was eating regular meals every day (no, I don't; yes, I am). She didn't seem to believe me, though. I argued that normal daily fluctuations in weight (1-5 pounds) or me wearing a different outfit could account for the change. She agreed, but said that there was a general trend of weight loss and that was what concerned her. I asked what weight I should aim for, and she said I needed to gain weight and get up to at least 120, but ideally more, and that she was considering having me come in for weight monitoring a few times a month, at least until January, when I have to start paying down my deductible again and our appointments become more expensive.

Later, after we'd moved on to other topics, she started talking about body image -- how the bodies you see on magazine covers and in ads are Photoshopped, and how you don't have to look like a Barbie doll, and that sort of body type wasn't realistic anyway. I was confused at first, trying to figure out why she was telling me this, and then it hit me -- does she think I'm anorexic?!? Because of a two-pound difference in two weight measurements taken a month apart?

I also asked if she would recommend a sleep specialist (possible DSPD). I explained that I've been staying up past midnight since I was a toddler, had severe brain fog until around 5pm every day until I started Adderall, easily fall asleep, wake up and maintain a regular sleep schedule when I'm able to sleep 4am-noon, and am incapable of maintaining a normal sleep schedule for longer than a week or two, basically only until I adjust and stop passing out early due to sleep deprivation. She refused to give me a recommendation and said she thought it was a matter of discipline and that not everything is a disorder; some people just like staying up late. Then she showed me a site with some theta wave recordings and gave me a one-page print-out on basic sleep hygiene.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't get the whole birth control thing, and the sleep thing was discouraging, but what's really stressing me out is the weight issue. Obviously that first month on Adderall and the awkward early stages of working around the loss of appetite is why I'm hovering around 115. I can't deny that. That was my weight for most of my adult life, though, when I was healthy, active, and eating well, before some weight gain due to inactivity and overeating. My whole family is thin and I have the same body type. This feels like a normal, healthy weight for me and one I can easily maintain. I'm in my healthy BMI range (108-149, 19.9 BMI at 116 pounds) and my weight seems to have stabilized after that initial loss, since I've been weighing in at 113-118 for weeks now. I just want to maintain my current weight. I don't want to lose weight or force myself to eat an uncomfortable amount to make it into and stay within what someone else has decided is my ideal weight range.

It's also *incredibly* stressful knowing that continuing to receive medication hinges on a single metric that I only have so much control over and that slight variations in that number are unacceptable. What if I gained six pounds between now and my next appointment but peed before I went in and wore a lighter outfit? What if the scale had read 113 today instead of 116? Would I be frantically searching for a new prescriber and rationing out my remaining pills so I can work and study and fucking think straight until they're able to see me? Magazines I don't even look at and dolls I haven't played with in decades aren't making me obsess over my weight. *This* is.

Overall it's like she just keeps assuming the worst of me. If I'm not on birth control, I'm irresponsible, regardless of my situation. If there's a two-pound difference in weight measurements taken a month apart, I'm anorexic. If I have sleep problems, I'm lazy/undisciplined. I don't mind being weighed and I don't want a prescriber who's a pushover or an Adderall-dispensing machine. But I feel like she doesn't respect me and what I want. I'm not even allowed an opinion on something as personal as my weight.",20Oct2018,1

134,"I'm a High school Junior and this the first year I've tried to improve myself academically, socially and mentally. I've always struggled with self image and constantly sought out validation from my peers which led to me always pulling off stupid stunts to get attention. To be blunt, I was a laughing stock with no real friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the summer however, I've improved myself by getting a job and forcing myself to go out and be social. I've come to peace with myself and no longer seek attention and have made a lot of friends. From someone who stayed home all day playing video-games to actively going out every weekend with a group this was a big step forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come around the school year and I'm extremely confident in myself and happy with who I am. I feel as if people realized that I was finally being genuine and as such, treated me better. I was invited to games and hang outs and I also began taking really challenging courses.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started with the courses that I was taking. I was taking 3 College level classes when I've never tried in a single course through out my entire life. I was always a slacker and never took school seriously, coasting through classes and getting decent grades. My grades are all either C's and B's and even a D. It's only been a month and I have a new test and essay every week. I don't feel as if I'm psychically capable of doing all this work and I get so much pressure that I end up not doing anything and wasting more time. I constantly request extensions on my essays from my teacher because I never finish everything on time and I average C's on the weekly quizzes. Through all of my classes combined I probably have 10 missing assignments that I have no chance of turning in now because late work isn't accepted. I'm supposed to be making a Psychology essay due tonight but here I am already giving up.

&amp;#x200B;

I've since resorted to eating, playing and watching (Death Note is really good btw) my problems away and have since gained more weight than I've already had (I've always struggled with weight issues.) I haven't been outside with my friends in forever and have just been a recluse. I haven't gotten any work done and have just been a mess. I haven't considered finishing myself off yet fortunately but I just don't know what to do. Other kids are probably struggling like me, but a lot of them are a lot better at actually doing the work and also having good social lives.

However, getting to level 6 for me was torture. My whole body felt like it was going to flop every time I run. But for the past few years I pushed myself and managed to pass, but I hated pushing myself to the limit, the feeling was horrible. I felt like I was about to die. 
Just yesterday I was set for the bleep test again. Before the test I felt confident and determined to reach level 8. But as time drew close, I lost it. I felt hopeless and I was clearly having a panic attack. 
Also, they put us into a whole row of about 50 students per round and it was really cramped, I could barely fit in. I felt my anxiety getting worse as more students came to spectate the test. 
The test started and I felt empowered again. Until I got to level 4, I started to hyperventilate. This happens but I usually push myself and continue running. But this time I thought I had lost. I couldn't do this. I'm going to die. So I stopped. 
At level 4.2, I felt like a total failure. Why had  I stopped? I lost faith in myself. I always do this. I was so pissed at myself. I failed the test.

I went to start school, he went for better job opportunities and a desire to try living somewhere new. We lived together for another year before he moved back to our home state. I stayed because I was still in school, he left because despite the better paying job, he felt isolated without his family. This was fine, everyone understood and there were no problems. I missed him of course, but we were fine.

Over the next few years I had a serious mental breakdown, (unrelated to my friend leaving). I left school, stopped taking my meds, etc..   Some serious issues presented themselves, and long story short, I trapped myself for 4 years inside my own apartment. My girlfriend helped so much, and she is responsible for nearly all my recovery, but my friend is responsible for finding me my new passion and ultimately giving me the drive to leave my apartment for good.

About two years ago, three and a half years into my self entrapment, my friend found a trade school in New York City (different from just new york state). One that somehow found a perfect balance of both our skills, was affordable, and, more importantly, well respected in both our feilds. It seemed perfect, we would share a new apartment and help each other with school, my girlfriend even had a better job lined up! It was all so perfect! But maybe it wasn't?

This is so hard to explain without detail, but I need advice and I think anyone who recognizes this story will already have heard my half. I don't want to hurt anyone.

My friend is poor, this was not his fault, just his family's economic situation. Fuck anyone who says otherwise, if you are born poor it is nearly impossible to crawl your way out of poverty. His family works hard for what they have, none of them should be judged for having money issues. 

I however, am well off. This is also thanks to my family's economic situation. I have helped him many times before with accidental overdraws and things, but never anything like this.

(My grilfriend wants to point out that long before our move to New Your state, my friend did not have a perfect record for paying their bills. Durring the very first year of us living together he had a problem paying rent on time, but he always payed before the end of the month and once we had a house meeting adressing it, he doubled down on saving and it never happened again. )

Moving to a big city was hard. Without already living in NYC to start with, it felt impossible to find an apartment. Being an idiot, I figured that with $40k savings in my bank account a small two bedroom apartment would be simple to aquire. FUCK NO. I in fact had to had to ask my actual millionaire cousin to be co-signer, as well as pay $4500 deposit and three months rent beforehand. Whatever, fine, fuck it. This new school was amazing and worth it.

I need you to understand that this school opened up opportunities that I had always been too terrified to ever consider as possibilities. I am becoming the person i have always wanted to be. I really truely am. That is what makes this so very hard.

My roommate lived with me for four months in NY State, for free, before we moved to NY City. I did that because he needed to pay (his brand new) car payments, and it wasn't a burden to have him on my couch. I wanted him to save cash before we started school. 

He never paid his $1500 of the deposit. He knows he owes it but I didn't make him because I knew this school was our dream, and I would never have gone without him. He hasn't helped with the adavnce three months of rent I had to pay either. But I never asked him to...

We (my girlfriend and I) were secretly paying for an extra $20 a month out of his bills because he was having trouble. We buy all of the paper towels and toilet paper for the apartment because one more person didn't seem like much, but then he started  freely taking paper towel rolls for his job, two to three a month, which I never agreed to. We shared eggs and bread and coffee, all of which he never paid for...

And now... now he is two months behind rent. I may be more affluent than him, but I am not rich, and nearly all of my savings went into school and securing the apartment. He owes me $1600 in rent now, beyond everything else, and I am not sure what to do. It started with him being just a week behind, then two, then a month, now two months... and he showes no intention of making any payments either. I know he loves me like a brother. We have both proven that to each other many times, but I cannot afford to float two, coming close to three, months of rent. Not to mention how unfair this all is to my girlfriend who I am also helping (but not to this degree, i only help her with groceries and the rent occasionally because she can afford everything else, but I love her and she is more than a best friend. She takes priority).

I told him I would help him as much as I could, but he has taken it further than I thought he would. I can't tell if he thinks I can afford to do this, or if he is taking advantage of my poor mental stability, or if he sees the way I treat my girlfriend and assumes that he gets the same treatment.

My mother has also helped him monetarily in the past, so maybe he thinks I am getting help from her... but even if I were, how would that be fair to her?

I just don't know what to do. It is so hard to explain how close our relationship is, I think that he just doesn't know how much of a burden this is... and then there is the biggest problem of it all. The thing that has kept my mouth shut this whole time.

If I kick him out, his dream will be over. I don't mean he will have to save and try again, I mean he will not have another chance at one of the only things he has ever cared about. This job we do is very competitive, we both were lucky in the people we met here, and we both have a real shot. If he doesn't live here for the next few years he will be out. 

But if he doesn't start paying rent, I will be in real debt. I already can't afford to go into the more specialized feild I want to, but this is making it that much harder. It may even be cheaper to keep this same apartment without him. The lease is up beginning of the next year, I don't want to move. This place is perfect. I love my friend, I don't want to abandon him... 

This is so hard. I know I have to confront him about the rent, but what if he can't get his act together? Do I deserve this for assuming he wouldn't take advantage? I wouldn't be here without him, but without my help he will be out of this business for sure. If I keep helping him I will continue to place undue stress on my girlfriend, and on my own ability to succeed in this job market. I know that this isn't right, but I do owe him....

I just don't know what to do. Sorry that this is so vague and hard to understand. I just don't want to hurt him! 

I feel so selfish, but I honestly don't have more money and I can't ask my family for more either. He doesn't deserve to be kicked out imo, but I don't know what else to do. I am making huge strides in this job market, but it will be a long time (if ever) before I make more than enough for the baisics.

149,"I adopted a 2 year old cat in June, 2018 from a shelter, but since this August, I have been feeling a strong call to enter a monastery. Due to issues of personal ownership or even the impression of ownership (which is to be avoided in a monastery), the vocation director at the monastery told me that I can't bring my cat with me because he will always be seen as ""my cat"". This is leaving me torn on what to do. 

My adoption contract says that if I give up ownership of my cat, it must be to the shelter so that they control who cares for the cat. I feel lots of guilt over the idea of returning a pet to a shelter and for adopting a cat while not having the long term stability to commit to his entire life's care. I don't want the cat to suffer from going in and out of a shelter too much (his previous owners surrendered him to the shelter before I got him). My parents have mentioned that they might be willing to take my cat, but then I feel guilty for imposing a responsibility on my parents for many years just because of my own lack of foresight and for technically breaking my contract with the shelter.

Of course I could choose to continue to care for the cat myself and not enter the monastery, but then I'm putting my life of hold and waiting for an animal to die for pretty much his whole lifetime which may be decades.

152,"So I broke up with my now-ex girlfriend a little over 3 months ago. I regretted ending things almost immediately and I told her this. She wasn't able to get past the fact I ended things and as a result couldn't try a relationship with me again.

Since then we'd been talking on and off and the past few weeks we had a FWB situation going on. I'm in love with her and I couldn't turn down intimacy with her even though it killed me because it didn't mean the same as it used to.

Yesterday we saw each other and said our final goodbyes. It's killing me and I don't know how to cope. All I can think about is texting her or talking to her in some way. I can't get her out of my head and I feel like there's a part of me missing.

I know it sounds corny as hell but I'm really struggling with this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",20Oct2018,1
153,"So, I've had my fair share of shitty roommates. Let's me just preface this. This one is more of a psychological situation and less overt - that's why I'm doubting myself. I'm currently working on being more assertive in therapy. Without getting into specifics, I was in an unhealthy relationship and I've been through severe trauma. That's why I'm now in therapy - yay therapy. My counselor cancelled our last session, so reddit, here I am! 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I moved in, my roommate explained that the bills would be approximately $50 for cable and internet (I don't use cable, but whatever), and about $50 for electricity. She also said she was super eager to get someone NOW because she was starting a job soon and needed someone to pay rent. Oh, and she also told me she was ""paying a little less"" - her room is smaller (she has a huge closet), she has her own bathroom (mine is en suite), and she has the better parking spot. Sure, whatever. I need a room and it seems like you'll be chill enough, so let's do it. She has been here for 7 years and can't keep a roommate - red flag, what? Not here! I'm in. I have no room in the freezer? Your two cats take up most of the space? Everything in the kitchen and living room has to be just so and you own it? Great. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer, our electricity bill reached over $360 bucks for ONE MONTH. I was livid. I asked the landlord to check the AC. They say it's fine. I say check again. They say ""oh, this unit is too small for your apartment."" This is all coming from her, btw. She tells me that they won't be replacing it because it's too hot to not have AC for a while. I'm still livid and it's then that she tells me (in other words) that it's actually BETTER than normal because last year was way more!!! Again, I'm livid. So, she's been paying this for years and has never thought to question it until I move in? I don't know. I really don't. I planned on $50 a month. Then, she starts promising (she promised a lot of things prior to my moving in that never came to fruition) that she'll cover the downstairs vents with covers she just bought (this would help cool our bedrooms down upstairs). It literally never happened. The AC will probably remain fucked forever and I genuinely feel sorry for whomever moves in after me. 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she would be working ""14 hour days,"" but that turned into ""8-10 hour days after not working for two months."" So, she was always home for two months. Then, she was always home for being sick. This is fine - if you work from home, no hate. The issue is that, the other day, I decided to work from home because of a personal matter, and I walked in around 9:30AM and she was there, in the living room. I expected her to be gone, but whatever - she has a life. She asked me ""You working today?"" as though I didn't have a right to come home to the place I rent. That leads me to my next issue. The place I rent. For $200 more. I found out recently. Is this fair? You guys tell me - I honestly don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

She moves my shit. So, she has ""never used a microwave"" in her life. OK, so I'll buy a toaster oven. Compromise. She started leaving a plug behind my toaster oven recently, so I have to keep scooting the toaster oven up, so as not to melt her cord. Every single night she pushes my toaster oven back against the wall. Every single night. I sometimes feel like a guest in my own space when I'm paying more and should have more say. Even if I open the curtains in the morning (which I do, on account of the place being so dark), she'll ""fix"" the curtains - every single morning. Literally. I think it does something to the brain to know that everything you do is going to be altered later - like it's a kind of mind fuck. I never know if I'm doing the right thing or putting things in the right places. But I know damn well that someone is watching. 

&amp;#x200B;

She won't clean the litter box enough. It STINKS in my place. STINKS. My own sister won't come over because of how badly the litter box smells (ammonia, but I do love me some cats). So, I start putting the ceiling fan on. Every time she comes home, she turns it off behind me. Every time I leave a lamp on (the apartment is PITCH DARK after sundown) just so I don't trip over stuff (or her cats), she turns it off immediately after getting home. She accused me of being passive aggressive once because I asked where my Tupperware was because I honestly needed it, but to me, her behavior is the true definition of passive aggressiveness. Also, I did in fact tell her I needed air so I was turning on the fan and that I needed a light on because I didn't like the pitch blackness for personal reasons (whatever, I can't remember exactly what I said). So, her solution is to turn the lamp off behind me as soon as she walks in, despite my anxiety. Her way or the highway. I'm paying $200 more and have much less living space, given that everything in this place is hers. 

&amp;#x200B;

God, I feel like I could go on forever. She charged me for the electricity on the first month I was there over one week before the end of the month. How did you know what the bill was? For example, I just received the bill for October on October 20th (and no, I don't have a picture of the bill, just her Venmo demand). I'm, again, so confused. I just feel like this is a person who refuses to be criticized (I could delve more into that, but I'll save you from it), so I feel like I can't say anything. Am I being dramatic, or is this a bad situation? Thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I have super PTSD issues regarding confrontation, so it's been a real struggle for me with this one. Her approach to communication is super aggressive and if she wants to discuss something with me, she'll wait in the living room until I get home/get something from the fridge/etc. and confront me. My kitchen is not a safe space, ha. Also, for the record, she knew how upset I was about the AC (and the rent increase that happened one month after I moved in - totally not her doing), but she told me that I could take any complaints I had to the landlord. This was before I knew I was paying $200 more. I just feel like my every single move is being monitored. The worst part is that I feel like I was duped. These are just the main issues - trying not to bore you with minutiae. Anyway....sorry for the rant. I just want to live alone now and consider this a lesson learned. Thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

160,"Being in the **last year of high school** makes me \[**20M, Slovakia**\] face a decision I do not think I am able to make. A little bit of back story first:

\--

Since elementary school, **computer programming** has always been the number one thing that I have passion for. It began with simple webpages (PHP), continued to some simple games (C#) and progressed towards being a **professional self-educated programmer**. 

Over the years, I have learned base programming principles (OOP, SOLID, DRY, design patterns, ...), got to know a few languages very well (PHP, JS/TS, Java) as well as the most used libraries/frameworks (Symfony, Angular, JEE, Spring, JPA), got a lot of knowledge about linux (how it works, set up and maintainence of servers, security, backuping) and thousands of other things (coding websites, databases - sql/design/understanding how it works under the hood, designing a REST API, building an Android application (Java, now experimenting with Flutter), ...). **I think I can say I'm quite flexible and able to learn pretty much anything.**

For the past three years, I've worked for 3 companies. At the current one, I make a decent sum of money but work with terrible code base that does not really teach me anything I would not already know. However, I was promised that after completing high school, an option to become a software architect would be offered to me (= more money, living a comfortable life). 

Apart from those companies, I have been working on several projects one of which has **a pretty decent chance of growing into a company**.

As you can see, I've done a lot of work, which hasn't left me enough time for high school, therefore I've always got not-the-best marks I could (a lot of B and C, but my maturita exams will be straight A\*A\*A). // maturita exams = the last, most important exam, whose results are the ones sent to universities

\--

My motivation towards attending a **university** is simple: **to learn as much as I can and meet people that are more like me.** Thus, I would not want to attend some easy one.

**So here I am with the following questions:**

1. Would you keep the job even if it does not make you happy nor teaches you anything and simultaneously blocks you from spending more time on things that are more meaningful? (my parents are able to provide me with resources, but would not be able to pay for university, so I'd have to take a loan or work while studying)
2. Would you take a gap year (travelling, getting to know other cultures, working on myself) or go straight into university? If the project takes off, I will have one more year to work on it and eventually a company of my own (a dream come true)
3. The plan I currently have is leaving the job, taking a gap year while working on the project and preparing to university (the University of Cambridge caught my attention the most). What do you think about it? (note: admission to the Uni of Cambridge is already closed for this year)

My father is in his mid 70s and deeply religious / traditional. He lives alone in my home country, very isolated, with no family or friends nearby. The older he gets the more controlling, negative, stubborn and harsh he has become. 

I am in my 30s, a working professional in another country. I live together with my partner of 2 years. My father doesn't know about him, he's always had a problem with me having relationships and has sabotaged a few in the past. I've tried to tell him about my partner but he cuts me off mid sentence, gets angry and ends the conversation. 

The problem is that my father expects me to return home alone this year for the duration of the holidays. Also my partner and I want to marry and have kids. My father would not approve of him and would do anything to split us up if he knew, including asking relatives who live in our country to intervene and even disowning me.

164,"Ok, this is kind of stupid, but I'm really bad at being subtle and subtlety is important here. So tomorrow night I'm hanging out with this girl, she's a couple years younger than me (18 and 16). We're gonna go get food and then hang at my place. My mom's away on a trip, and my dad's out of the picture, so it's just me in the house. Now, this girl is a family friend, which complicates things.

I don't want to try to hook up or anything, but I would like to get her to chill with me on the couch, cause even platonic cuddles are nice yaknow? Trouble is, in my house there are like four different spots to sit in where you can see the TV. The one I usually sit in can fit two people if they're comfortable being close to each other, but it only looks like it fits one (cause I always sit in the middle of it). There are two chairs, one rocking and one reclining, and then an extra bit of unconnected couch that isn't really that great for watching TV. Now, I know she's not that uncomfortable being close to me, because in the past we've hung out and watched TV on her laptop on her twin bed (similar amount of space to my couch), but I feel like she'll just take one of the other spots.

I want her to chill with me, but subtlety is important for a few reasons. First, she's a family friend, so any awkwardness will have long lasting effects; but also, since I'm home alone, and bigger and older than her, I don't want to seem at all threatening or implying anything. I don't want her to think anything bad would happen if she didn't come chill with me, so I want to avoid anything at all suggestive or obvious. This means I can't really make the other spots unavailable (the rocking chair can move away but there's nothing not obvious to be done with the reclining chair), and I can't pull any of the classic lines like ""hey I'm cold, why don't you come over join me under the blanket"" or whatever.

I'm asking for advice because I'm really bad at being subtle, and I'm not great with social cues. Also, I want to emphasize, my goal is not to hook up, just to get a little closer to her.

And also, I'm not trying to ""trick her"" or anything into chilling, if she wants to sit somewhere else I won't stop her obviously -- I just can't think of a way to bring it up without making things awkward or seeming at all threatening. Hopefully you guys can help out.",20Oct2018,1

Anyway, I’m 28 years old and for my whole life my parents have been abusive to me mentally. Physically only a couple of times by my dad, but mostly mental. My dad and I don’t have a relationship in short. We never speak “normally” I’m not sure how to explain it, he doesn’t take in interest in my life, he doesn’t even know what I’m doing as a career, he hasn’t helped me out ever with anything and is mentally abusive towards both me and my mum. I was mentally ill for a long time and he basically ignored me the whole time I was needing support

My mother on the other hand is the complete opposite. Overbearing, overwhelming and treats me like a kid. In a negative way. She never lets me have an opinion on anything, if I talk in conversation I’ve to “shut up because I’m going to cause an argument” and she never sticks up for me when my dad is horrible to me. In a weird way, she’s actually sometimes more damaging to me as she is always nasty to me whenever I open my mouth, because she doesn’t see me as an adult. More like a child who is about to cause a hissy fit if that makes sense. 

Anyway, I moved out during university and recently moved back in due to financial difficulties. Everything is still the same even though I now have a job and a boyfriend. 

My boyfriend has kindly offered me to move in with him which I’m going to take up, however, if I move out, I want to cut ties with them. My boyfriend thinks this is a bit much and suggests just not talking for a while. 

But my problem is I’ve let them away with it for too long. I am mentally scarred from what they’ve done to me and feel, especially my mum, deserves not to stay in touch with me if I leave the house. This sounds mean but I honestly can’t explain how much they’ve ruined me as a person and how they don’t treat me with any respect whatsoever. 

I am scared however, as I’m a very loving person and a part of me is sad to think if I cut contact when I move out, that I won’t have a family. 

I don’t have one anyway, as honestly the relationship is horrible, but I’m just stuck on what to do. 

I see no way to get their respect whatsoever and feel that maybe if I do cut contact then they might actually change but a part of me thinks that won’t happen either. 

They both have zero friends beside each other, stay in after work and live life constantly abusing each other. I don’t see them ever changing as they don’t have any outside contacts to help them see their ways. 

When I had a therapist she actually told me they were the root of the problem and asked to speak to them when she visited our house once on a bad day of mine. They actually left the house and drove off so they wouldn’t have to see her. That’s the kind of people they are. They just don’t care. 

Some advice please. Maybe from people who have actually done this or seen it from others? I’m just so confused on what to do. 

Thanks if anyone responds as I’m just so upset.

169,"Hi all, this has been weighing quite a lot on my mind so I thought Reddit would be the best place to come for advice :)

So I have been doing some observation work for a project that I am scoping, and had a chat with a woman who was from a charity about anecdotal observations she had made about the project topic (let's say it's dancing cats).The conversation was very helpful, and while I didn't disclose anything about the project about dancing cats, she gave me insights.

I sent an email to say thank you to the woman because she was so helpful and it was received by the head of the organisation. Very soon after, my manager said that it's not appropriate to just reach out to this charity, because they are very political, particularly the head of the organisation, and that the relationship between the organisations isn't a great one.

The head of the organisation wrote back and said thank you for the feedback, will I call her on Monday to discuss my project.

The project has not been approved, and I was asking questions really just to get insight on dancing cats. Even though dancing cats is partially public already and I did not tell the original woman about what I was doing on the project, what do I do? How do I maintain a neutral relationship? How do I respond to the head?

Thank you!!! &lt;3",20Oct2018,1

172,"Basically what the title says. I'm not using a throwaway because I don't really care at the moment and I don't think anyone I know browses this subreddit. I cook for myself sometimes but eat fast food way more than I should. I never exercise, brush my teeth, floss, I shower once every two days (minimum...) and although I do have a job I am terrible with money and basically live paycheck to paycheck. 

I'm trying to go back to school for computer science, but I failed the first semester due to lack of motivation. I just got lazier and lazier, and I'm retaking the courses I was doing but now I'm on probation, if I fuck it up this time I don't think they'll let me back. 

I went to a therapist, but she really did nothing to help aside from attempting to make me feel better about my terrible life choices. I think she was a fairly new therapist (which would explain why I was able to afford her) and when I told her things like ""I can't find the motivation to brush my teeth daily"" she would respond with ""well that's ok, lots of people only brush their teeth every few days."" Well, sure, but I don't *want* to be this person. I told her I was occasionally visiting escorts (prostitutes) just to satisfy needs that my hands can't, and she said ""honestly I think escorts should be legalized, if it's two consenting adults who cares?"" Again, sure, but this is risky behavior. I could get an STD. I could be fucking arrested. I could get mugged or any number of things. I don't like who I am.

I'm 26 and I feel like I need a life coach but I don't feel comfortable asking my few friends to be that person for me. Is there a place I can find someone to be that person for me? For free? Alternatively, how can I get motivated? 

Also I'm on anti-depressants but without therapy I don't know how much they're actually helping.",20Oct2018,1
174,"I found out yesterday through text messages that my boyfriend of 6 years has visited another girls house for several hours about 10 months ago. Apparently once.

This girl was chasing my boyfriend for a long time , shes total nuts about him and we made clear that he would never ever hang out with her. He wholeheartedly agreed. He said he would never hang out with her and that she was in love with him, but he ignored her.

I confronted him yesterday and he was sorry. He said they just watched a movie because she kept complaining about hanging out.

He lied to me for 10 months because I had a gut feeling and asked him several times, he looked me in the eye and swore on his moms grave that he never hang out with that girl.

What do I do? Would you breakup over this?? 

The worst thing is that my SO is now mad at me. We talked for a few hours, he said he came clean and nothing sexual happened and that I am overreacting. He said that what he did was wrong, but he will not do again.
TL;DR BF visited another girls house 10 months ago and lied to me about this all the time.

178,"I (17m) was at the club yesterday night. It was all nice and chill, however, at almost 3 am i got tired and wanted to leave back home. My friend was having fun and so i decided to stay for a bit longer. So i see this girl, a friend of mine, sitting alone and looking tired af. Me being exhausted, i decide to go sit and have a casual convo with her. We talk for two min and the only physical contact between us was a high five. Then her Bf pulls up and i get up assuming he wanted to sit next to her. He gives me a dirty look and tells me if i touch her one more time he's gonna beat me up. I'm a very peaceful person and i never had beef or enemies throughout my high school years, and even my life. So i told him that i didn't touch her, and he threatens me again. So i just say sorry and leave them both. I then left the club and as i was leaving, i hear him talking shit about me and the situation with his other friend. I ignored the whole thing and sat outside to wait for my friend. Apparently the dude who threatened me was asking my friend for my whereabouts, and my friend just brushes him off. Anyhow, a mutual friend between me and the threatening dude comes and explains to me how he was drunk and is probably out of his mind. But i am still uneasy with the whole situation and the talking behind my back part. I was never part of a fight and I don't intend to change that. I just need advice about how to forget the whole thing and let it pass, and how should i respond if he tries to bring it up again when i see him at university. I should also mention that at the beginning of the party, his girl was drunk af and was swinging and falling side to side. I just held her up for a bit and her bf told me that he got her, so maybe he got a wrong idea from that situation.",20Oct2018,1

182,"This is a bit long and the set up takes a few minutes so please bare with me.

About 5 years ago, my best friend of 10 years at the time, who I met in high school, suddenly stopped talking to me. No reason given, no final goodbye, no hint that this would happen. We used to talk everyday. Around that time, I had helped her and the guy she had a crush on, who lived across the US from us, get together. The guy and I stopped being friends soon after because he started spreading rumors about me on online forums. This is something which he confessed that he had done because he wanted to fit in with the people who he was talking to. This really affected me because I never believed he would do that to me and I started getting paranoid and accused other people of doing it. I have low self esteem in the first place and I ended up leaving friend group because I felt like worthless. I didn’t bad mouth him to my friend, in fact I tried to stay friends with him for awhile after before explaining that I was sorry but he had hurt me too much and I felt it best we not speak. We were internet friends so it wasn’t like there would be awkward meetings where we would see each other in person. I did tell my friend that I had made that decision. 

This is where the ghosting happened. Since we were out of high school by then, our paths never needed to cross. I tried to contact her a few times before giving up. All this on top of the earlier incident culminated into me attempting suicide 2 times and getting back into self harm. A year later, we came across each other online again and we spoke again. She explained that she did it because she didn’t want to choose between the two of us. I don’t have many friends, I don’t trust people online so I no longer try and in real life I basically just have one other friend. I just said ok and accepted her back into my life because I missed having her in my life.

I never really told her how severe my depression got during that time period and I have not let her get as close as before. I don’t share everything with her and I don’t feel comfortable talking about certain things. Sometimes she doesn’t answer a text of mine for a few days and I used to care but not anymore. I want to stop being angry but, every now and then, I will feel this intense anger towards her and cry. This is not when she is with me but when I’m in private. I still have scars from the self harm and it just reminds me of that year. 

Like I said before, I basically have only one other person and I want friends, I’m tired of being so alone so I don’t want to stop my friendship with her. I don’t know if she will do that to me again though. I’m tired of being hurt. How do I get past this and just become her friend again? She says she loves me and the fact that I make her laugh so much but I don’t know what to do. She doesn’t even know I feel like this. I don’t want to guilt her or anything, it happened 5 years and I should be over it. I miss being carefree.

Any advice?",20Oct2018,1
184,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting and one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and pressed her lips together in a polite/pleasant way and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excitedly to her friend the brunette girl 'eh that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and it went quiet and then it went like:

185,"My mother has had two marriages, and 2 boyfriends, and a couple flings.  With her first marriage, she had a daughter who got addicted to methamphetamine and stayed addicted to it for a good 20+ years afaik.  

My father cheated on my mother (her second marriage) when I was 12 for a few years, we found out and it got pretty messy fast.   He was far from perfect, they were the worst match possible. Basically 2 narcissists who probably cared more about image than anything else.  He psychologically abused me, physically abused my mother, 'hit us' (I don't know where the line gets drawn) threw things, threw tantrums, smashed things. By the end I was constantly walking around on egg shells every single time I was at home or around him. My mother was extremely overbearing, and I've contacted my dad maybe 4 times in a decade, and it's been an absolute huge effort every single time with essentially no outcome.  Obviously he doesn't really want anything to do with me that badly.  My anxiety is so bad at this point it's pretty much paranoia.

At 15 I dropped out of school after several suspensions/expulsions from different schools and started smoking pot every day.  I also started drinking and taking whatever I could get my hands on a few times a week. Pot was an all day-everyday habit for 6 years straight.

Basically, pot has been a big part of my life since I was 15.  I've tried to stop probably 50 times.  This past year, I've stopped 3 times for a couple months at a time, (this being the third attempt)  I'm at 2 months this weekend, and have honestly been drinking more than I should have.  It's not the frequency that's unusual, it's more that I've been absolutely writing myself off for 12+ hour periods until I have no money left, usually a couple times a week.   I've also been smoking a pack to three packs of cigarettes a day.   It's taking a big toll on my looks, and my chest and back feels 'fizzy' just about all the time, even after no exercise.  I always pick smoking up after ceasing pot.   

It seems every time I get to this stage of quitting pot, the comments come in from my mother about how 'this is just what her daughter did', saying she just 'knows' I'm smoking pot again.  It's like she wants me to fail.  There have been a few comparisons to her daughter in the last few days alone.  She never let me explore anything when I was young, she was extremely over protective, and always tried to make every single decision for me, and if I veered away from what she wanted, I would get (looking back) a HUGE guilt trip treatment, very passive aggressive in her attitude.  She just always knew better. 

When her new boyfriend asked her for some space recently, the wheels completely fell off, and she was HYSTERICAL for 24 hours or more, crying in my arms, begging me to stay another night. It made me very depressed.  As soon as he was back in the picture she never shuts up about what she's doing with him, where they're going, who they've been rubbing arms with. It comes off as annoying to me, at first it was cute but now it's just like sheesh...  Don't get me wrong, I want her to be happy, but  I can't help but feel like there is some sick dynamic going on between us, and I probably love her too much from her programming over the years to face up to the facts. 

Not going to lie, I've definitely had a lot of thoughts about death, I can't really tell anybody that as I have an extreme fear of psych institutions after several bad experiences being taken there against my will.  I've thought about how I'd do it down to the last detail. I've bought things from vendors with ease, I could easily get some strong heroin and go peacefully. I don't know what it is that keeps me from acting on these urges, probably my sick love for my mother. At bad times it seems like one of the only ways out, and going into public in one of those moods just becomes a way for my brain to think of all the possible ways I could potentially 'do it.'

I don't know where to go with my life from here.  Making electronic dance music is my life, I've even had a release over seas previously this year.  I really just want to piss off and join the army, but my mother told me I probably won't get in because of my history of depression and anxiety.  My music would probably suffer if I took off to the army for an extended period, if I even got in. I care a lot about my music, it's the one thing I've been able to keep constant to a degree through all of the shit. 

I've been as truthful as I could in typing all of this. I can't talk to anyone about this stuff without the fear of being locked away for an extended period when really, I don't believe honestly I need to be.  I know I have a lot of life in me, it's just when I feel alone like this things can seem hopeless. I don't have a single person I can truthfully say is my friend because they genuinely like me. It seems like everyone I've ever met has gotten sick of me, or just doesn't like me because I'm defective or carry too much baggage, or something. 

\- Am I the crazy one? Or is it my parent/s? 

\- Is my relationship with my mother, not normal, based on what you've read here? I don't know what the hell normal is anymore. 

\- Would I have a shot at the army? Or am I wasting my time?  I'm very physically fit. I really have no motivation to pursue anything where I am right now.  I only have bad memories in my city, everywhere I go is a stark reminder of something bad that's happened at some point. 

\- Got any general advice or suggestions for my situation? I'm feeling like I'm treading water a lot lately, and have no where to go from here.

186,"Hello,

I am a 19 year old female living in Australia who really needs dental treatment. My mouth is too small for my teeth and my parents didn't take me to the dentist when I was a child because they did not believe in doctors. I have seriously crooked teeth and some of my baby teeth have still not fallen out, resulting in my adult teeth growing over them in weird positions that cause me to cut the inside of my mouth a lot. 

I want to get dental treatment but as a student doing a double science degree at a very expensive university, I cannot afford it. Last semester I had to get help from my university to fund my travel costs to and from university as I live two hours away and only get $300 every two weeks to supply myself, $100 of which goes to rent, another $100 to food and other expenses, and the rest generally to travel costs and other necessities.

I recently started working casually but that is only able to barely cover the cost of my rent and the travel fees. 

I do not know what to do. I have medicare, the healthcare provided to us by the government but that does not cover orthodontic treatment. 

I really desperately need this. I wish my parents had gotten me braces and fixed my teeth when I was younger and it was cheaper but they didn't, and now I am stuck paying for an extremely expensive preventable issue while trying to cover the cost of studying full-time and working casually. 

I have looked into private health insurance but it seems with waiting times generally adding up to 12 months and costing about $15/fortnight for a yearly limit of $600 in returns for a $5,000-$9,000 18-24 month plan, it doesn't seem realistic.

189,"Hey readers. I'm G. I never thought I'd go online for guidance but I'm actually worried about my best friend (since middle school). We'll call her De. 

Okay so her family is kind of rich so once she graduated she bought a  really nice house. I thought it was the coolest place for parties but she got tired of it because it was too big and she would often ""get nervous being alone in such a large space"". She was there for only a couple years until she put it up for sale and somebody actually bought it. Some rich couple. This was earlier this year 

Two weeks ago De and I were drinking at my place and...I'm sure she meant to tell me this but at the time I wasn't sure if she was just drunk or what. She told me that she plans on breaking into the house she sold. I asked her if she was just shitting me. She's always been devious as fuck but this is another level. 

I still thought she was joking but she starts going on. She was all over the place plus I was slammed but she goes ""Think about it G. This is easy shit. I just thought about it the other day. I bet they got all kinds of nice shit in there. They told me how much they travel, and they'd neeevveer suspect it was me they love me.""

I told her that one, it's risky. Two, it's dumb she has enough money, and of course, that she could go to jail . 

It's really hard to tell her anything because she's got really bad rage. Serious anger issues. She instantly snapped (which I expected)  she shot up from the couch and started pacing through my apartment. She started jabbing her finger at me from the kitchen and said ""You don't think that I can do it..! You think I'm not smart enough and don't have the balls. I know fucking cake when I see it ""  I just said I thought she was crazy.

Her and I hv done some shady shit for fun as teens but this is bad. She asked if I wanted to come along and I didn't want her to blow her top because she can't help but throw things and she was in my kitchen so I told her we'd talk about it later

190,"Hey everyone,

So I've always been a social person. I love interacting with people and hanging out with friends.

 I am awkward when I am first getting to know someone but I quickly get over that and get along with people pretty easily, whether they are guys or girls. 

 But there is one thing that I always struggle with. Everytime I like a girl or have a crush on a girl in particular, it seems as if my brain shuts down. My crush always makes me so nervous and I get so worried about talking to her that I sometimes just don't say anything to her or avoid her. It's honestly so intimidating for me to talk and interact with girls I like, let alone try to flirt with them. I can interact normally with people I am not attracted to whatsoever but I get so nervous and scared talking to girls I like.

 How can I improve that? How can I feel comfortable talking and flirting with my crush?

 I try to rationalize my thoughts but when I actually come face to face with a girl I like it's like my primal instincts take over and my heart beats so face I feel like I am having a panic attack.
 Is there anyway to improve how I interact with my crush? 

Sorry for the long rant but I just wanted to get this out",20Oct2018,1
191,"I’ve had problems setting boundaries/standing up for myself in the past, so I’d be grateful to have some outside perspective on this.

For some time now, our group of 9 friends (17-19 M/F) have been planning a big holiday for the summer. There’s one problem: none of us are certain yet when we’ll each be free over the summer, and some of the dates clash (we go to different high schools/colleges). There is one date where *most* of them are definitely free, but I’m definitely not (exams).

So on the group chat last night (I was asleep when this happened), one of my friends (Kevin) said that “To solve the problem we could  just dump OP and go in May/June” and earlier saying that “we could do it later, *if* we want OP to come”. *if*?? What was he implying? He said right after “though that’s not a great solution” but I still felt disrespected and really hurt - it wasn’t any of his business whether I was going or not, and to suggest leaving me out, right to my face and to everyone, made me feel so humiliated.

Normally I wouldn’t feel so hurt, but let me explain why I felt like that:

1) He’s a serious person - not the kind to make those sorts of jokes - normally if he says/considers something, he means it. So I know he really did consider it.
2) There’s another date where all but *one* of us can likely make it. He immediately dismissed the idea, saying “pick another date, I think Jake has plans on that day”. He didn’t even consider “dumping him”, like he did to me.

I considered letting it go, but then he would think it’s okay to say things like that to me in future. I decided not to call him out on the chat, as it would hurt his ego, so I directly messaged him. I told him it wasn’t nice. He said sorry, but he kept trying to justify himself “well I did say we could ditch me instead” and “but I said afterwards it wasn’t a good idea” etc etc. Why suggest it if it’s not a good idea?

It made him look quite bad on the chat - one of the other friends replied that of course we’re not going in May and he didn’t admit it wasn’t nice to say that. So when I asked him if he wanted to take back what he said, and he said yes, I told him to do it on the chat.

I don’t know if it was the right thing to do - letting other people see I accepted his behaviour (nobody directly called him out) wasn’t good for either of us, and I’d upset him if I was the one calling him out in front of the whole chat. So he sent a long sarcastic message onto the chat, saying that it was very, very mean and he was very, very sorry. It was obvious I’d told him. I played along, but inside I felt like I was in the wrong.

This is the first time I’ve decided to stand up for myself in a long time, so I don’t know if I was actually being over sensitive and horrible and should’ve just let it go. I’d really appreciate some thoughts on this. Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading:)",20Oct2018,1

She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then turned upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet)  ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she  said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this like a checklist) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s.

195,"So, disclaimer, I know on the grand scheme of life this really doesn’t matter, but I am really annoyed and just need to vent!!

Bit of backstory.. 

My roommate and I have been living together for 3 years, we were good friends before too. When we first moved in together, my Dad bought us a vacuum cleaner that after a few months turned out to be pretty useless. Then I bought us another new hoover, and although it wasn’t anything fancy, it got the job done. That hoover is now also slowly dying, but I make do with it because I can’t afford fancier right now. 

So, I am the tidier one out of the two of us, I spend at least one day a week cleaning the whole place for us, and she watches me every week battling with our crappy hoover trying to make the place nice for us. 

Which brings us to now..


I just did some of her laundry, and as I’d just cleared up, decided to just put it on her bed. Long story short, found that she has been hiding a fancy Shark hoover behind her bedroom door. It sounds petty, but I even checked it to see if it had been used, and the tank was full. 


I just don’t understand why she wouldn’t share that.. we’re good friends, and we share everything in the flat. I have always shared any appliances I’ve bought with her, I can’t understand the logic behind this!!! 

I know people will say just talk to her, but I don’t know if I can even rationalise being annoyed by this. 

Can anyone give me their thoughts? ",20Oct2018,1

203,"I'll stay concise.

My mom has a heart condition and is being kept alive via internal devices.  My dad, who lost his dcecent paing job during the recession, now works a minimum wage job to get health insurance for my mom.  My mom also takes care of my dad's mom who also has health issues.  She is difficult to handle at times and it stresses my mom out a lot.  She also takes care of the finances.  Sometimes my dad loses his temper for no reason and it stresses my mom out.  This stress puts more pressure on my mom's heart.  Recently she was told to take blood thinners to prevednt a stroke as her doctors were able to tell that she is under too much stress.

My dad is lazy and selfish.  My mom took him back after they divorced years ago.  When she almost died my dad and I were both very upset.  My dad does not realize that if my mom did die he would have had to take care of his mom by himself.  My dad is very impatient and short-tempered.  After one week of doing all of the work my mom has done, with a heart condition, he has a big chip on his shoulder.  I've had to talk with him several times in the past about his attitude.  He thinks that verbal abuse is normal and it's okay for him to do it.  I warned him before that if he gets angry with my mom that he might kill her by putting too much stress on her and now he has proof that this is definitely a possibility.  

My dad has been upfront with me about how he thinks life is hard.  Everything is too difficult for him.  He never finished high school, he has no marketable skills at all, and he always asks my mom to do stuff that he can easily do himself even though she has a weak heart.  I wan to hit him but I know thats wrong.  He was open with me about the physical abuse he suffered from his dad when he was young.  The last time I talked with him I asked him why he never stood up to his dad and told him to back off.  He told me he never did because he was afraid of his dad.  Yet, here I am speaking to my dad respectfully and he doesn't take me seriously.  This tells me that he only responds to physical violence.  I also don't want to hit him because I know it would make him feel much worse about life.

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here?” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) i walked over t their table and I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well just by sight and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went quiet again: 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously and politely) 

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it really pleasantly )

Me: ***ignored her because I didn’t know what to think of it***

Blonde: *watching the whole thing and after a pause between anyone talking again*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud while looking over at me like as if she made sure I heard her idk)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly in a wanted to know way)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit (I wasn’t fuming it was the coffee stain on the table I was wiping was not coming out lol) 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk walking out with her hand on her head and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ loudly smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Her eldest son, we'll call him N, and I have been best friends since we were 5, and our parents used to smack us sometimes too. I know how it feels to get bashed infront of company, I still flinch everytime my dad brings his hand close to my face.

But this woman just goes fucking nuts on her kid!

I was at N's house the other day and his little brother who is autistic, we'll call him S, has a lot of anger issues.

He got into a fight with his sister and ended up kicking the door and putting a little crack in it.

When his mother saw him do this, she went fucking ballistic. She pulled his hair, smacked his head against the wall, slapped him all over. I was pissing my pants so I backed into a room and closed the door like a pussy. I could still hear the kid's shrieks and horrifying screams.

Whenever something like this happens, N always stands up to his mother. He has basically raised his brother all alone, he sleeps with him, makes him food etc. He was arguing with his mother and started crying. I gently held him and brought him back to his room. This always happens.

This woman leaves bruises over this kid, she has four kids and beats them all.

recently I found out that my life literally sucks. I am 19 years old guy and this are my problems...

 I cant pee in school toilets, after 8 hours of not drinking and not peeing it is quite annoying, and hard to focus.

I am addicted to PMO, its not that severe now, but it was pretty bad 2 years back. Now I can do 7 days without vomiting or shaking. (Hurray)

My parents are very controlling, sometimes its hard to argue with them. I dont really listen to their advices anymore, because they were always terrible. I live with my younger brother in one room. I cant sleep when I want, because of my brother watching tv or something. Theres always someone in my room. I wouldnt be suprised if I got more privacy in middle of supermarket. Also when I wanted to do something, my mom always did it instead of me. (Or she was going with me, even when I was quite angry that she is pursuing me). I am quite anxious about making decisions, and doing social things.

I never had job. Cant imagine how i would do it without peeing all day. I am scared of looking for some, as I cant do anything useful + I am extremly socially akward.

My eating is, compared to others, extremly selective. I dont eat when I am outside of my home, as I told everyone soo many variants of lies about this. Like ""I am vegetarian"" etc. Its embarasing, everybody is like whats wrong with me...

Not long ago, I became certified to teach children with autism, and during the certification process I learned how to discern autistic symptoms and manage behavioral issues. A lot of the children I teach happen to be on the autism spectrum. I love working with these children – I find it incredibly fulfilling.

Ever since I became certified, however, I began to notice that my fiancé exhibits a lot of autistic symptoms. However, he was never diagnosed and doesn't see a need to. He currently leads a successful life as an engineer. He has alexithymia (he can't identify his emotions well and struggles to put them into words). He also has different ""periods"" of obsessions. He often becomes obsessed with different topics and talks endlessly about them. He also has trouble maintaining conversations, and is unable to tell when a person isn't interested in what he has to say. He doesn't have an active social life; the friend he spends the most time with happens to be autistic. He seems perfectly fine with this, so it isn't exactly a debilitating thing. His obsessions and social awkwardness was never a problem with me though, as I enjoy listening to him when he talks, and I am quite socially awkward myself.

I am worried, however, that these symptoms could play a role in our marriage. I am particularly concerned about the alexithymia. It became a problem once in our relationship, during one of our rare conflicts, and I am worried that it could potentially snowball into a bigger issue once we start living together.

I plan on having this conversation about my concerns when I next see him in person. I am wondering if a diagnosis of mild autism could potentially help him/our marriage? Or could it hurt him?",20Oct2018,1

224,"First, I do not know If something is wrong with me or If I am weird in the personality, or I have disorders in some sort of, ect. I have never went to a psychologist or didn't get any kind of guidance, but  I would like to listen people's opinions,

In the real life, I am usually an emotionless person that seems as that to the people too. I often get comments like how incredibly calm I am, how I do look as feelless, lifeless I am, how I do look like a person who lacks passion in any sort of, and how incredibly quiet I am and similar comments to those things. I think, I look as incredibly neutral on the things and subjects too, which is, I do not really think now if it's a good thing or not. I would have tell that I am not really like how I do look like, but it would not be an accurate saying; because often, i really do feel nothing, or when I do feel things, I often feel the emotions in a so much a lesser degree that I can be lack any kind of feeling at the times too. The things that make people feel angry, and gets offended, and makes happy and excite ect.; is not the same for me. I do not feel deep emotions. Even If I do feel them in some degree, when it comes to the natural acts and expressions, I do not display any kind of action, or impression, or show them. But It doesn't happen intentionally. I do not do this just to hide my emotions; it doesn't happens due to the preference. It does happen unintentionally. If I have deep feelings but having troubles to show them in expression, it would have been somehow fine. But it isn't the case. I do simply do not feel the deep emotions on the things in the reality. 

First, I was thinking that that is my personality. I am a calm and quiet person, somehow a closed person, which is true but when it comes to other things I start to think that it's not natural in some of the ways. Because when the time comes, and when I do not feel and express the natural human being reactions, it's getting somehow ridiculous to the people, and to me too because of I know that they do think right in the situations when I do look and act as that without feeling any kind of shit, or feel some shit but not deeply or naturally. And the thing is, I am aware of it but even if I try to change it and look as differently, it doesn't really work because when I do fake the expressions of me it doesn't really change the fact that I do not really fakin anyone, and I can not really fake myself too. 

Maybe I have really some sort of disorder. I first thought that maybe I am a sociopath. But it doesn't so much fit, because even if I do lack deep emotions, I am not a person who does lack empathy. I am capable of understanding the other people's feelings, thoughts and how they feel and their emotions. I just do not really feel these emotions deeply when it comes to myself. Then I thought that maybe I am anti social, but it's not the case too because of I do not break the rules or act as contrary to the laws in any sort. Maybe I am an asocial, but that does explain my unnatural reactions and lack of feelings on the things? I do not really know.

I do not know if I explained myself nicely, but I think I need to get off this. So, if there are other people that are in the same position, or experience the same/similar thing, how do you deal with this thing or do you successfully get rid off this thing in the life? ",20Oct2018,1

Everyone kinda notices it, and points it out (not to his face). Recently I edited a meet result to make his time look a lot worse than he did. At the time it seemed funny but looking back it’s an mean move. I sent the picture to some of my friends on Snapchat and a couple of them screenshot it thinking it was real, but I told them later it was fake. I also told them to not to talk/share the photo because I felt guilty and don’t want to embarrass him, or get myself suspended. Am I being bully, despite not being mean repetitively?

227,"I really don't enjoy talking about this so I'll try to make it short. Over last couple years my mother has been very abusive towards me (mentally, never physically). She bullied me ever since I was young, when she learnt that I was gay she made my life a nightmare until I said to her that I wasn't. My dad is a very passive person, he allowed for this to happen, I don't think he's as bad as her, but he never stepped in or tried to change her behavior towards me. I don't resent him as much, but I think he's at least partly responsible for all the shit I had to go through.

Now I'm 18, things have calmed down a bit, I learned how not to get in her way, I still think she's the worst happened to me, but I think I can distance myself most times to the point where I don't really care about what she's saying and she rarely gets to affect my emotions on a deeper level. At the same time seeing the person that made my life hell for so long everyday and having to deal with her toxic behavior is still very stressful to me and I think I could be a much better person if I got away from her.

I always dreamed about how I was going to move out as soon as I was legally an adult, but now I realize how difficult that could be. I'm still going to high school, its my final year, so I can't really afford to get a full-time job and even if I were to get one the minimal wage wouldn't be enough for me to pay for a place to live, buy food and other basic things. I go to one of the best schools and I studied hard all of my life, so I don't think I could ever drop out of school or not go to university as that would go against almost everything I wanted to do in my life.  

My plan for now is to try to get into a good university abroad, so I have an excuse to live somewhere else, but I'll still have to keep in touch with them, visit them for Christmas (and never be able to bring someone I loved home) and other occasions and just never be able to express how I felt about all the abuse I had to deal with from her and never be able to cut out that evil person from my life or at least not until I can sustain myself financially.

Is there anything I could do differently? I would really appreciate some advice from someone who were in a similar situation or just had to deal with an abusive parent that they relied financially on. I can't stop myself from thinking I could be a much different person if I didn't have to deal with the constant toxicity I get from her and it just kills me not being able to do anything about it.",20Oct2018,1
228,"I'm a 17 year old guy and this year has been really hard for me and my family. My parents relationship is falling apart, to the point where my dad suggested a divorce or living apart from my mom. The root cause of all of this is my mom's narrow mindedness and narcissism. She has OCD and doesn't let anyone live freely in our home. She always interferes in my dad's lifestyle and his social relations. This includes very petty things like not letting him read sometimes, have any relations with any woman even if it's work related, doesn't allow him his phone sometimes. And my mom always dismisses any criticism thrown at her, blames everything on my dad. All of this on top of his health issues is taking a toll on him. And as these quarrels or issues are brought up more and more frequently, it's taking a toll on me too. I can never put my mind to anything productive after all of this.

Well, that didn’t happen, so my test registration got canceled. Me taking the test most likely wasn’t going to be the difference in me getting into my first or second choice schools- my GPA is pretty good at a competitive school with a tough schedule &amp; a lot of extracurriculars, but I still would’ve liked to take it to help me with my reach school(s). 

I’ve been beating myself up since I realized my mistake and I really don’t know how I can tell my parents. They’ve been riding me really hard this year, more so than they do already. They’re usually supportive but they said they think i’m borderline to get into school and I don’t want to give them another reason to believe that, or give them a reason to scream at me, because that’s become a more frequent thing. The next ACT I can take is in December unfortunately, but i’m open to taking the SAT again if possible, which is probably a longshot.

Soo I met this girl back in january last year.We met in a tuition class and she had a crush on me initially and started approaching me.In no time we started talking to each other and i started liking her too.

We became so close for the next few months and started dating.I was a pussy for not having the courage to tell her that I really liked her a lot(love i guess?idk but i had really strong feelings whenever she was around) and would like to get into a relationship with her.

Fast forward to september,I never made any moves or express to her the way I feel and our relationship started to fade out because she started losing interest in me i guess.

I gave up on the idea of telling her/saving the relationship,because I thought it was impossible to keep in touch after graduating from highschool and moving into college.

By end of october(tuition class ended) we stopped talking and no longer kept in touch and i just buried my feelings for her and shrugged it off like nothing happened.

Now her I am,3 days ago,out of nowhere she texted me on insta and after having a conversation about college and stuff with her,I’m wondering if i should initiate another conversation and start it over,tell her how I’ve felt about her the whole time and make things happen again for real because I’ve been supressing my emotions the whole time  but in the same time,i don’t wanna do something dumb too.

I was quite homophobic and I was having therapy for some issues and it was suggested that I make an effort to be more sympathetic and friendly to lgbt members of society.

I might have taken that a bit far, but I basically just went on a gay app and asked for friends only in the area. I met a guy for coffee, and instantly we clicked. He is in to all the same stuff I am, he’s amazing and he just lights up a room you Know? I don’t think I’ve laughed for like four years and he made me crack up so much.

I made it clear I’m married and I’m not into men sexually anymore. I have tried it in the past. 

He called me handsome and I just collapsed, you know? And we text every day and the last week he said to me ‘I was hoping you would let me take you to dinner’. And I was like omg what do I say. That sounds like a date doesn’t it? That phrasing?

To clarify, I’m not in to sex with men. We aren’t doing anything sexual or even kissing or anything,  we did hug and do a cheek peck though.

I really really want to hang out with him and I think dinner is fine, it’s in public it’s not going to turn into anything. But I need to know if I should just call it quite and it seems like he fancies me. I have said nothing can happen. I think he’s great though. ",20Oct2018,1
243,"I’m not exactly sure how to make this short, so if anyone would mind taking the time to read this I’d greatly appreciate it.


Basically, I’m a 26 years old male living with my 45 year old mother, we’ve been pretty inseparable my entire life. Save one year I actually got to live with my best friend and it was my best year, I was motivated to do things and always wanted to go out and be social. The past three~ years my mom hasn’t been able to hold down a job, she has no GED or HS diploma so she got by her entire life working bartending/serving jobs. These past couple years I’ve been holding down the fort basically; put in more for rent sometimes, fell behind on a cable bill that I pay 200$ for on top of trying to pay off the past due balance, I pay for her cell phone sometimes, put in more for groceries or just flat out by them, I’ve had to dish out money for her car insurance once or twice, and just recently had to put out another 300$ to the vet because her dog got Lymes disease. 

Now, because my mom has been going through some things, she lost her patience with the landlord and decided to withhold rent until he made some repairs to our apartment, but now he’s taking us to civil court and she’s telling me *we* need to come up with the money we withheld from him. The problem is, I used the rent money to pay for the vets bill, thinking that my mom has things under control and not really paying attention to the arguments between my mom and the landlord because IMO I felt she shouldn’t have started a fight when she had practically NO money to her name. So now I feel expected to come up with and dish out even more money to try and save us from whatever might happen during court or after court. She’s asked me how much money I have in my bank account. I just feel like I’m being used at this point, I work and work and work and I’m terrified to spend any money in case my mom can’t help that month, or the next, or the next. I’ve declined a lot this year emotionally, I’ve been really depressed and just sit at home, never go out or make a point to see my friends. I have really bad anxiety. She tells me sometimes that if it’s ever too much I can leave but she says it in such a manner that I feel guilty, like she’s telling me to go but I know if I tried or decided to that she would be angry with me. Sometimes she’ll pick up a shift or two and come home talking about how tired she is, or how she doesn’t want to go to work. Meanwhile I work 40-50 hours a week. I feel like she’s always sick, or something is always wrong that she can’t go to work, or she’ll be late more times than not. 

I’m just not sure what to do anymore. I’m getting worn out and I feel like whatever decision I make, will be a selfish one. Is it? Am I obligated to stay around and help out in her times of need, or is she milking it at this point and using me as a clutch? There’s things I want to do, but I feel like I can’t because those things require money and I’m ferried to spend the money that I work for.  And if she is using me, I’m not sure how to confront that. I’m not confrontational to begin with and the fact it’s my mom makes it worse because all I’ve ever really known is my mom. I can’t shake this feeling of guilt. I want her to be happy and I wanna help and I want what’s best for her, but in doing so right now, I feel like my life isn’t going anywhere.

I dont have a drivers license, and even if i did i couldnt afford a car or insurance. But my room mate who is in academic probation has his rich dad buy him a brand new car every year. 

I love computers, and science, but I have no motivation so succeed anymore. I spent 2 years doing engineering at my school, only to fail out of the program effectively wasting 2 years worth of loans and credits that count as nothing towards my new major, financial analysis.

This new major is so fucking boring I cant stay awake in class or while studying, and have absolutely no interest in the material, but i feel like if i dont get a degree of some type I'm never going to amount to anything or have any funds to support my hobbies or basically do anything.

I feel worthless and depressed, im on antidepressants but i feel like they dont do anything.

I overheard her talking about problem she had with her car and offered for my husband to look at it for her since he is a mechanic. Consequently the same day her boyfriend's car wouldn't start. We set a time for her to come over and I told her to jump start his and bring it over my husband would look at it. Turns out his needed an alternator and her car was involved in two incidents from him. The first time he drove over to Boulders in a road, he swears he didn't see them and he damage the complete undercarriage so there is exhaust fumes going into the cabin. It is a Subaru wagon. Her kids are breathing carbon monoxide and we told her this. The second incident he drove off of an embankment. He said it was raining someone cut him off and he went over and literally had the car towed out and she's been driving it. The frame is bent the windshield is shattered, the car is just a wreck. after much consideration we offered her my son's old 20 year old Volvo which we were going to take to the junkyard for $200. It needs some work but it is a better alternative to what she has.to get to the point, that weekend which was now four weeks ago my husband put an alternator in his car so he could go to work. I paid for it. It was $140 and of course he didn't charge for the labor. 3 weeks ago when I offered her the car I recommended she call the same junkyard to get $200 so she has the money to put the Volvo on the road. This car is still sitting in my driveway. Neither one of them have given me a date when they would pick it up and now that he got laid off from his new job and she makes very little money I don't know when this is going to happen. He has not acknowledged the fact that he owes us money nor has he attempted to give a couple dollars towards the alternator. It's not so much the money as he's never said hey I know I owe you the money thank you so much I'll give it to you as soon as possible just nothing. last I heard she was trying to borrow the money from her mom but that was a week ago. I really want this car out of here and we could really use the $200 ourselves. Would it be horrible to junk it? Tell her we gave her 3 weeks to pick it up and didn't know what her plan was?
TLDR -wanted to help out a co-worker down-on-her-luck by giving her my son's car and after 3 weeks she still has yet to pick it up from my house. Also we paid and put in an alternator for her boyfriend's car and have not gotten paid back anything after 4 weeks. Would it be horrible of us if we took the car to the junkyard and got $200 for it?",20Oct2018,1
264,"24M and 26 F.  We‘re pretty close though we’re always dancing on the edge of a relationship. We do things you normally don’t do one on one with friends. i would normally say she is just a friend but things are just to weird.  We just started getting close and she says she wants to spend more time together, wants me to move closer, and has said I really like you...and that’s a lot coming from her because she’s reserved with her emotions. I feel like she’s keeping me around when she’s ready for a new partner. It’s just weird. 

A few weeks ago she asked me to plan a romantic trip, it’s romantic by virtue of the activities and the setting.  She was on board all the way. Then when I sent her an email with all the options for whenever we decide to go. I said I was excited to go with her and she echoed that.  I also empathized that this was all not pressure cause we’re just friends.  Whenever unsay that she gets really quiet.  But she hasn’t responded in 5 days and I like her a lot but don’t have any right to say hey what’s going on. 

I just think I’m overreacting, and have to be patient because we’re not kids, but adults with busy lives.  I posted this somewhere else and they said back off, but every time I withdraw a tiny bit she starts asking after me.  The longest we gone without talking was less than. Two weeks. I’ve never pushed anything and she always goes out of her way to try to make me happy when we’re.  

Do I need to apologize by saying something like ...
I’m sorry if I was overwhelming you with this, I just get excited when I get to spend time with you. If it’s even a secret anymore, I really enjoy spending time with you.

We used to be close years ago and pretty open with each other, and this behaviour started when we had some issues in our family that we wanted to deal with ourselves without getting others involved.

I have a fear that they will rape me, I know they won’t but I can’t stop thinking about it and it won’t leave my mind and it really terrifies me. My parents are wonderful and they care a lot, they are stable and they are kind people, they are social and just great parents in general so there is no reason for me to think this way besides of society.

267,"Some months ago I moved to Colorado with a girl. Upon getting here, the relationship collapsed. The girl next door is gorgeous and is the one who finally convinced me to leave my abusive ex. As time went on, she was a great friend and confidante. After about four months of getting to know each other we slept together last week.

This is where it gets weird.

The condom broke and she went off about how I did it intentionally and after remaining calm and explaining that I had no such intentions, she settled down and agreed with me. Everything seemed fine and I have been on cloud nine since.

Fast forward to last night. She came to my place earlier than we had agreed upon and she seemed beyond delighted to be with me. We had sex again last night, and halfway through she completely flipped a switch. Saying again that I was trying to get her pregnant or sick ( I have herpes which I warned her about and after months of discussion she seemed okay with that risk ). She was saying that I needed to put on a condom and that I needed to ""Grow up and act like a man"" , when I offered to grab mine and be right back, but she quite literally wouldn't get off of me.

After she throws on clothes, she begins to berate me telling me I'm worthless and beneath her. First she grabbed my dog by the ear and dragged him to me. Then she hit me with a fist in the side of the head. Then she did it again. She told me to get out and that we were no longer friends.

She's one of maybe 3 friends I have made in Colorado since moving here. I never expected to have sex with her, but when she is tearing BOTH OF OUR CLOTHES OFF - - It's a little hard to think that she doesn't want to fuck me really bad.

Now I don't know what to do. I'm stuck feeling like she turned all of our totally open discussions into lies that make me seem like some kind of selfish monster, when I am actually so dumb struck by the things she said to me and what she did that it almost seems like a nightmare.

I relied on her to hold my spare key, and even trusted her to watch my dogs some days when she was home and I wasn't.

TL;DR - I had sex with a friend and now she wants my head on a spike. I don't want to lose one of my only friends in a city, but the signs of abuse she exhibited seriously rattled me. What should I do? ",20Oct2018,1

I was arrested by city police, not university police but I think I did tell them I played football which was really stupid. I don't know if they will tell my coaches??

269,"My brother is a well, but mainly my mom.

I moved out s year ago and was living the dream. Then I became ill, and she was here with me for a few months helping me around the house and such. All the while getting on my fucking nerves, but I appreciated it. She finally went home less than two weeks ago, and I was so happy to have my home back how I want it. Peace and fucking quiet.

Then she got into it with my uncle, and he threatened her, broke the front windows out and also her water is off there (many people living there over time, many not contributing, bill added up). So, of course I felt bad and she came back here, but I don’t want her here. I feel awful saying that but I just want to be alone. I’m honestly angry every single day I wake up now. I’m feeling suicidal... but everytime I think about her being at that house or a shelter or whatever, I feel terrible.

We’ve been looking at apartments that are in a low price range, but that seems to be taking too long and she’s barely trying. I already don’t have a ton of money, and have an entire house to take care of, but now even if I wanna buy me some dinner, I have to buy us BOTH dinner.

273,"Hi reddit! My SO and I have been together for six years and recently got married. Three months ago, his father was also diagnosed with terminal cancer and given a timeline of a year. Up until that time we had been saving money and living at his parents house. However, now we are in a position of having the resources to be out on our own. Understandably, we don’t want to be too far from his father so we have been looking at places that are within a few miles of his parents house. 

The relationship with his mother is difficult. She does not give us any space, and becomes hostile when gently asked to back off. Now that we are married, it has gotten worse. 

We want out, we have wanted out, but now that his dad is sick, would it be fucked up to move out. We love him, and we’d continue to dedicate all our free time to him and his happiness and needs. We’re just desperate for our own space. 

We were supposed to move out roughly an hour north to be closer to his work (he’s in law enforcement) this month, but that plan came to a complete stop once his father was diagnosed. 

We don’t know what the morally justifiable thing is to do. God forbid, if/when his father passes it will then turn to, “we can’t leave this house because we can’t leave MIL alone.” He has siblings, one of which still lives at home and is going to college, and immediate family all nearby. 

I don’t know what we should do. ",20Oct2018,1

Turns out that he has FIP and we can't really do anything about it as it's untreatable and located in his brain. We decided that it's best to put him down (next week) as we really don't want him to suffer. This all really sucks as the little guy is so loving and affectionate :/

We're really gonna miss him.

I'm still left with some questions about our other cat, he doesn't look sick, still eats a lot and is very energetic. Should we take him to the vet and get his blood tested ?

We're also considering adopting a new cat, I know thinking about this so soon might soonds a bit weird to some people. But we really don't want our other cat to be alone.

276,"So this girl and I have been together for about 3 months. I know it does not seem like a long time, but after our first date, things really clicked and it was great. We could not stop finding fun things to do because we had so much fun together.

A little background on both of us: I have pretty much always been single. I dated a girl for a year or so a few years ago, and the same thing with her. She dated a guy for a while a few years ago and that's it. Other than that, both of us don't have a lot of prior relationship experience except for the things we went through with our last partner. We have talked about our last partners and came to the conclusion that they are a lot alike, very manipulative, etc. and that's not something we want.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the situation. We both constantly tell eachother how much we appreciate eachother. We never argue, she never gets jealous, we let eachother do our own thing and it's fine. We had a little flop a while back when she was suspicious of me dating another girl, but I quickly assured her that was not happening (it wasn't). The discussion lasted for 3-4 days and we didn't really see eachother during that time, but talked on the phone about it and we finally worked things out in person.

&amp;#x200B;

Proceed to the next part. We engage in some intimate actions, as all couples do, and it was fine. But then she wants to talk about it. So we do. She tells me that she had a bad experience when she was a child and it makes her uncomfortable doing these things so she wants to wait and she might not want a real relationship if it's going to involve that stuff. She didn't go into too much detail, but I told her I understand and that it's okay because I can enjoy my time with her by doing casual things, it doesn't have to be sex. She let me know how much she appreciates that and tells me something along the lines of ""I'm not sure why I keep thinking I don't want a relationship, because every time I'm with you, it's like I can't get enough of you."" Of course that makes me happy and I tell her that she never has to worry about her insecurities or anything around me, and that I accept her for who she is. (Side note: she also told me that she is sometimes interested in girls, but has never dated or done anything with one. She only dates guys, but the thoughts are there sometimes. I, of course, tell her that's okay and I like that because it's a part of her.)

&amp;#x200B;

Later that week, after giving me the ""I can't get enough of you"" bit, she starts ignoring my calls/texts. I'm not too pushy and wait to get done with my day, then I text her and say ""Is everything okay?"" She tells me that she doesn't want a relationship anymore and she's sorry. She lost feelings. Keep in mind that this is literally two days after our conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

It hurt me. I am so hurt inside. This was a little over a week ago. I tried talking to her about it and she wouldn't talk to me. She made me feel like I was at fault. I drove to her house (I knew she was home) and she wouldn't answer the door. I'm not a crazy boyfriend, so I drove back home. A couple days later, we talk on the phone about it. She insists that she doesn't want to talk in person because it won't make a difference even though I prefer talking in person over serious things like this. So we talk on the phone and she says the same thing, but we have a good conversation and we are still friends. We still talk every day, albeit not as much, but it sucks. It honestly sucks. I don't know why she did this and I feel like I've tried anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Her birthday is soon and I offered to take her out for her birthday (nothing serious, I think I said for ice cream or something) and she seemed like she was down, but I'm not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Why did she do this? Is there anything I can do? Does she still like me? I can't stop thinking about her. She was my best friend and now it hurts. Some friends have suggested I write her a letter about how I feel, and others have suggested I just try to get over her because she probably has lost feelings. I just don't understand how someone can go from not getting enough of me to losing it all. Please help!",20Oct2018,1

280,"In September, me and 4 other friends moved into a new apartment. It’s only a 4 bedroom, but one of the rooms is pretty big with an alcove, so my friend and I decided to split it. It makes the rent cheap for everyone and isn’t too inconvenient.

Cut to now - I’ve dropped out of my current semester because my depression has gotten really bad recently. On top of that, I needed to get a job but just kept putting it off, and I’m just completely broke (my checking account is massively in the red) My life just feels in complete shambles. What I really want to do is move home for a bit , find a therapist, and work on myself. As well as getting a job and saving up some money.

However, the problem is that since I’m just living in an alcove, it’s not like I can sublet the apartment on Craigslist or anything. Our landlady doesn’t even know I’m here. So moving out would massively screw over my roommates by bumping up everyone’s rent. But it’s not like I could pay next months rent if I stayed anyways - even if I got a full time job today, it would take 6-8 weeks for me to get out of the red. 

So is there any good way to handle this? Should I offer to pay half my rent while I’m gone? Idk. I want to do right by my friends, but I also think moving home is the right move for me right now. ",20Oct2018,1
281,"Hey everyone,

So I've always been a social person. I love interacting with people and hanging out with friends.

 I am awkward when I am first getting to know someone but I quickly get over that and get along with people pretty easily, whether they are guys or girls. 

 But there is one thing that I always struggle with. Everytime I like a girl or have a crush on a girl in particular, it seems as if my brain shuts down. My crush always makes me so nervous and I get so worried about talking to her that I sometimes just don't say anything to her or avoid her. It's honestly so intimidating for me to talk and interact with girls I like, let alone try to flirt with them. I can interact normally with people I am not attracted to whatsoever but I get so nervous and scared talking to girls I like.

 How can I improve that? How can I feel comfortable talking and flirting with my crush?

 I try to rationalize my thoughts but when I actually come face to face with a girl I like it's like my primal instincts take over and my heart beats so face I feel like I am having a panic attack.

Anyway I’d really appreciate any advice you guys can offer, this is my own sister going around me and my living situation and it really feels like she’s trying to ruin my life, like I said any advice you guys can offer means everything to me. I don’t wanna cut her out of my life because I really thought we had a good relationship but now I’m questioning everything


So, I’m 19 living in a somewhat awkward situation. I moved in with my sister and her boyfriend almost a year ago, this went on fairly well for a while, but they eventually broke up. My sister moved back in with our mom and stepdad and I remained here, not wanting to go back there and also wanting to maintain my relationship with Jared (her now-ex boyfriend), and help him save some money (he has had a lot of deb). However, Jared and my sister maintained their friendship and she still comes over fairly often to hang out and catch up with us.


Move to ~3 months ago, my girlfriend has moved in with us, we’ve been very happy even in such a small apartment. She’s happy to be out of a toxic family and environment, and I’m happy she’s around. More than happy actually, my life has improved so much than ever before and for once I have control of my future, and she has control of hers’ which is all we’ve wanted for so long. 


Present day, for the past few days I keep thinking I’m hearing arguing, or some loud talking. Chalking it up to a neighboring apartment I hadn’t thought much of it, until today at least. I came home and fed up with the apartment being dirty so I cleaned up a bit and took out the trash, (note, I work overnights). Came into my room and laid in bed with my girlfriend for a while before she had to go to work and I heard the arguing again. Being a nosy little fuck I listened in and heard the female voice raise a bit. Then the male voice “He just took out the trash he didn’t even know you were here!” this is when I knew it had been my sister and Jared arguing this whole time. 



I tuned in a bit more and heard my sister say “He’s a psychopath!” followed by “He’s shown me his genitalia!” Okay this sounds super fucked lol, but there is one moment in my life I can recall her seeing my genitalia. I estimate I was around 5-6, and we were in the pool with my cousin from Mexico. I had always been a very hyperactive kid and as what I thought was a joke stood on the ladder and flashed my sister and cousin. I get now that obviously it’s fucking weird to do that, but all my life I’ve just thought about that awkward memory as just that, an awkward memory. I was just a kid who didn’t even know what sex was, why would she put so much weight on something like that. 


This goes on for a while and I hear her saying I don’t love my girlfriend. Jared, who has spent the most time with us, by far, defended me saying he’s certain I do, and that she hardly sees me so how could she know, and he’s right. Me and my sister have a decent relationship but she’s never been very close to me. As kids she was very cold and when I was younger, would constantly bully me until I got older and was able to defend myself. After this I hear her yell “You’re a failure!” multiple times to Jared.


Recently it was discovered my sister was diagnosed with HPV. My sister also has a history of anxiety/depression, and she is medicated but she still overthinks a lot of things and my mom has told me that she genuinely believes she has cancer. No tests have been done to indicate this yet, but she is certain I guess. I’m starting to think that the stress is getting to her anxiety and she’s just coming here and taking it out on us. But why say these things about me? And calling Jared a failure? She’s been coming here for the past few months and everything seemed fine. Last time I saw her she was so friendly to me and I had absolutely no indication anything was wrong. Nor has there been anything wrong between us since we were almost children! I genuinely feel like she’s trying to ruin my relationship with both my girlfriend, and Jared, who I both care about a lot. It feels fucked up, like she resents me for staying with Jared when she left. Maybe she feels betrayed I don’t know. I’m just really lost right now and fucking confused as to why my own sister would switch up like this, and not even confront me about whatever problem she has with me. 


Whatever you guys can offer, please just point me in a direction.

We're now having second thoughts on this house. We're not very comfortable with the idea of living somewhere where something tragic happened. We don't want to live in a haunted house.

We're bummed though because this is the best house we found so far and it's the most affordable. Should we keep looking or should we just see what it's like?",20Oct2018,1

He even acfed out almost every month. Started a fight with no reason. I had to beg for apology.

We had a slcial circlr and i thought they are my friends too. Nope.never asked how am i, never cared. I managed to introduce two people who i knew to each other, who became a couple. Never acknowledget it or introduced me to a single girl. I had a female friend. I was his friend until a boyfriend came in the picture and she didnt spoke with me. Until she was single again.

It’s been two years and I’ve not had a full time job I occasionally worked at my cousins shop but I’ve not been on good terms with him for nearly a year. I have poor relationships with mostly everyone in my life and I eventually cut them off. 

My mental health is at the worst it’s ever been, I regularly apply for different jobs and I get few responses back and I blow them due to my anxiety. 

I’ve been dealing with intrusive thoughts they’re suppressed childhood trauma/memories and I tend to get them when I’m in social situations I have started seeking treatment (potentially bipolar disorder), I recently had a telephone assessment with a therapist.  

My goal is to move out my family home which is a toxic environment for me and also get a job where I can support myself financially, but at the same time I freak out as I can’t fathom living by myself and the responsibilities I will have in addition to my reckless behaviour. I’ve been a fuck up my entire life since high school I haven’t accomplished anything so I don’t know what to do.

I need some advice from someone who’s been through a similar situation and how they overcame it and pursued what they wanted, I need a reality check and please be brutally honest with me.

301,"So growing up, my family had an INTENSE ant problem. I would wake up in the morning just in time to see them dropping off the ceiling onto my bed and then look down to see ants all over my blankets. I would be at school and feel something crawling on me underneath my clothes and surprise! It’s an ant! We made sure we didn’t have candy or anything out and I usually checked my clothes before putting them on but these suckers were EVERYWHERE. To make matters worse, my mom bought me a pair of coveralls, my brother thought it would be funny to throw a big carpenter ant down the top of them and then laughed at me freaking out about it biting me. 

My dad has this thing about letting repair guys in his house/on his property so he wouldn’t get an exterminator and he took fairly minor measures in trying to get rid of the ants. 

Omg my dad would go out in the garage and find the grossest scariest looking bugs/spiders etc and bring them in the house and pretend to show me and then would “accidentally” drop it on me and then laugh at how I’d scream and cry at it.

So yeah, I have a thing about bugs. I’ve never told anybody but the feeling of them crawling on me has never gone away. I constantly feel like bugs are crawling on me and things like lice and fleas absolutely send me into a panic. My brother brought his lice infested kids to a family dinner, I was CHOKED. Call us and say they have lice so they can’t come, we’d all appreciate it. 

My uncle brought his flea infested dog to my house multiple times and never said anything to me about the fleas, but for some reason my indoor cats were infested and he finally tells me he’s having trouble keeping the fleas off his dog. THANKS FOR INFESTING MY CATS AND THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

I moved into my apartment in May, the landlord said the previous tenants finally saved up enough to buy a house. Ok. I honestly have no idea how long it takes for an infestation to spread but last night I had an itch on my back and felt a bump there. I looked in the mirror and find [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/LB76xqn) I immediately am like holy shit bedbug bite. I don’t know if it is or not but when I panic, I tend to not move or anything. I will sit in the same chair for hours and not move. So I’m laying in bed and all I can think is “if that is a bedbug bite, I’m laying in them right now” so I turn onto my side and pull the sheet aside and there is a fucking bug on my goddamn mattress. Just one, I squished it between my fingers and went and washed my hand while absolutely freaking out. 

I looked at pictures of bedbugs and honestly, it didn’t look the same but it was a little bit similar so I’m thinking it is one. I looked all over the top of my sheet and all over my blanket, stripped them off the bed and then looked all in the nooks and crannies of my mattress and nothing. No poops, no black spots, no grit. But now all I can think of is how many eggs did this thing lay before I killed it?

I went into my sons room and looked all over his bed, took the mattress pad off and nothing. 

I don’t want to tell myself false alarm and then have all the eggs hatch in however amount of time it takes but I couldn’t sleep all night. My fear is in overdrive right now. I got up early and thought I should get an early start and make breakfast, get showered etc but here I am in my chair, I don’t want to get up, I am freaking out and I am tired. I managed to drift off for a little bit but I just had a nightmare with bugs crawling in my hair and biting me all over so I woke up right after that. 

I wish I had taken a picture of the bug but I just reacted and squished it.

307,"Posted to r/findapath and r/needadvice

Hello r/findapath,

Currently, I am attending a mid-sized midwestern school and I am not really enjoying it. I am a first semester sophomore, so this is my 3rd semester here. As of now, I am majoring in Civil Engineering. I have had internships the past 2 summers, and coursework in the major, so my belief that I wouldn't like the field based on this is not without substance.

My current school is about an hour away from home, which isn't bad. However, these past 3 semesters have been really tough. I have suffered from chronic depression (dysthymia) and really missed my home support system that allowed me to succeed in my earlier years. The whole dorm life and college life is just not for me, as I have found out. I have made some friends, but there isn't really anyone that I click with here. The school is in a rural area, and is a big agricultural school, which probably isn't the greatest fit for someone who came from a large-ish city. This isn't to say I haven't done well academically. In my first year, I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA and should be able to get at least a 3.5 this semester. I'm just not enjoying my classes or my time at this school.

And so I have been looking at transferring to a school in my hometown. Because the school is a small, liberal arts college, it doesn't have a ton of major options to choose from. The majors that I have been looking at are either Applied Mathematics or Computer Science. It is conceivable that I could double major in these subjects, and still be able to graduate in 5 semesters, as I would normally at my current school. I have taken most of the Calculus sequence (I, II, and DiffEq) and have gotten A's in all of these classes, so I don't think the math portion would be too difficult for me. I am just worried about making this move and finding out that I also don't like this.

I have not had much prior programming experience, which is also something that worries me. Both of the majors I am looking at have a strong base in computer science, and I am worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up. I also feel that I would be selling myself short by picking a major just because it would have the most transferable credits, and not something that I would actually like. The small programming that I have done, I enjoyed it when it actually worked, but it was frustrating when I couldn't figure it out. I wouldn't consider myself technologically illiterate, but I'm also someone who has not had much exposure to advanced computer functions and whatnot.

If it works out, and I find my true path, then great. But there are multiple things that are keeping me from committing to doing this, and I just want others' thoughts on it. If anyone has done something similar or has something to add I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",20Oct2018,1

313,"I’ll start off by saying that I have worked at my current job for almost 2 years, and it was the first proper job I ever had. I get on well with most of the staff , and although my boss can sometimes be moody and demanding I have always been able to have a laugh with her, etc. 

Anyway, today I made a mistake (I won’t go into the details as it will get confusing), but I didn’t realise this until a costumer complained. It was a simple mistake though, and I only made it because I was under a lot of stress and was in charge of loads of different things at that time.

So, my boss found out about the complaint after my co worker rang her to tell that a costumer wasn’t happy, asking for advice on what to do to rectify the situation. My boss announced that she would come down to talk to us; fine, maybe she could help us resolve it.

So she arrives, waits til my co worker leaves the room, and then slams the door shut ; proceeding to scream at me and make a whole bunch of horrible, personal comments at me because of what I did. I can understand her being annoyed at a customer complaining, and I took full responsibility for it...but the nasty , vile comments she made reduced me to tears. 

She even questioned whether I could be ‘trusted’ in my role anymore and said I needed to ‘buck my ideas up and stop being ditzy because I had now given us a bad reputation ’. I was completely taken aback and to my annoyance, I did get incredibly upset. 

I don’t know whether I was just being overly sensitive but I feel she could have gone about things in a different way...the comments she made keep playing on my mind, it’s like I know what she really thinks of me now. 

I’m already nervous and insecure being the youngest person working there (by about 10 years) and I never ever put a foot wrong until today, I always do everything they ask of me and never complain...even when sometimes I feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

Afterwards, she could see I was still visibly upset as I was trying to finish off my job, and proceeded to hug me...but then told me not to tell my parents? Was this because she knew she was out of line and knew my parents would be angry? 

I don’t know...any advice would be appreciated. I have a day off tomorrow , so need some time to think about what I should do. ",20Oct2018,1
314,"So to start off, I’m a first year in university. My biggest problem is that I have such bad decision making in prioritizing school and my future success over everything. 

In the transition between high school and college, I know it’s difficult to get used to it and it’s hard to make new friends. In my case I went to a university that none of my old friends went to and I don’t even dorm here either. Im a commuter and it’s hard to make friends with students that pretty much all dorm. 

I also need to admit that I’m addicted to video games as well. I wake up and instead of doing homework early or studying, I just want to play games and have fun. I think the issue is that the people that I play my games with are my only friends. I use video games to fill the social interactions hole that I don’t have in real life. My only social interactions are through an online medium. So even if I’m not really playing games, I just want to talk to them because they’re my “friends” I guess. And since they are all playing games, it motivates me to want to play as well.

So this results in me procrastinating and making bad decisions. Just last night, I was doing computer science homework at the last few hours and I’m like ok lots of people are online, so I’ll just talk to them and finish my homework. It resulted in me forgetting about submitting my homework before the deadline and playing till 4am. 

My grades are falling exponentially. I got an email from my advisor and professor saying that my academic progress needs improvement. I just ignore these emails and I don’t know why I ignore them. Entire essays I’ll just skip doing because I’m lazy.  

Living in a household where there is extreme pressure to be successful, as my parents are harsh on me, doesn’t help. 

I’ve been pushing this aside all semester now and just telling myself that I’ll just try hard later in the year. But I know now that I have a serious problem. I wake up hating myself and want to hurt myself because of my decision making. I feel like dropping out but I don’t want to feel like shit either. 

I know there is no easy solution and I probably sound like I’m just being a baby and just gotta suck it up and do work. And I know that this is my future and I should try and work hard so I can be successful in the future. I have this internal conflict where one side of my head yells at me and tells me I need to get my shit together, and another side says that I can manage. 

It feels like there is a giant looming pressure behind me and I keep running from it, but there is another pressure coming in front of me as well. And eventually I’m going to be squashed and I’ll collapse. 

But I just have such a hard time not playing games and wanting to talk to my friends. The transition from high school to college is something most people go through, and for me it has resulted in me hating myself.

After that, unless they were really interesting, I didn't even try. What's the point in being in a relationship that I didn't see going to marriage? Then again on later examination you wouldn't really know whether or not you wanted to marry a person unless you really knew them, so that was bad reasoning.

I really don't find a lot of women that I'm very attracted to. No judgement on them, but not many women spark my fire in a way that makes me want to put forth the effort, then you get on dating websites and it's like god damn, talk about a hit to the ego.

I do get this advice from women I ask, they say ""be confident."" Be confident about what? Admittedly I'm a bit desperate sometimes, but it's for a sort of long term relationship with a best friend I can fall in love with. Every time I find that sort of person, and we get a connection, I find out she's in a long term relationship and I'm no homewrecker, or she chooses someone else somewhere along the way.

Hell, where is even a proper place to flirt with women? I don't want to put them in situations they don't want to be in so I tend to avoid flirtation in general and women don't often open the door open flirtation, seems to be more of a guy thing. I did once ask a girl if she had a boyfriend, she said no, then I asked her to marry me. She said yes, so we were work husband and wife for a while, but she ended up going to Louisiana with our boss.

For over a week now (with no end in sight) her father has barged into her single apartment and has been “monitoring” her. Been staying on her couch all day and night in an apartment very much meant for one person. Last night my friend was forced to sleep somewhere else on campus because her father took her room key and wouldn’t let her in to her apartment (I offered my room but she didn’t respond by 2am when i went to sleep). I’m not even sure she was sleeping in someone’s apartment, she might’ve been in a random building, I don’t know for sure.


We have rules in our dorms that guests can’t stay for longer than a few days. However my friend does not want to get an RA or RD involved because she is worried her father would then flip out, stop helping pay for school, do something really bad, etc. I am also concerned of this happening, but I feel awful just doing nothing besides being there for my friend if she needs it (I feel like I am not doing enough).


Is there anything I can do, someone I can talk to, something i could do to get her horrible father away from her? I know, realistically, i shouldn’t get directly involved because that could be dangerous, but I just feel so angry at the father and angry that I haven’t done anything to help.


What is my best move in this situation? I don’t want my friend to go through this.",20Oct2018,1

(Literally think of the most racist thing and x100). even if I’m sitting in the car and I’m looking out the window my mom will accuse me of looking at the “black guys”.

328,"I signed up for roommate matching during the summer as I had nobody to move in with and was desperate to move out of my parents' house. I met my roommates for the first time on the first day, and I feel like right when they met me, they just wrote me off.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a short, minority male living in the southern area of the United States. While time spent in this area has been rough being challenged by racists, jokes, etc., I have found people in my past that came to be my friend and accept me. I think meeting someone for the first time and immediately writing them off based on how someone looks is just fucking ridiculous. They came to the apartment after I did, and spent alot of time on the first day hanging around as I had work and came later that night. They probably saw my last name on the door and had their own assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

The people I've matched with are all close friends together, and I'm just kind of the random guy there. They've made their efforts to get to know me and welcome me; I acknowledge that and appreciate their efforts despite my assumptions of this being a race thing (I really hate admitting anything is a race thing, as I sometimes see it as a cop-out or a lame excuse, but I really have to this time).

&amp;#x200B;

But before I elaborate on that last note, I'll clarify that before I moved in, I went through a long period (from maybe March until move-in day) of intense isolation and depression, and was not in any mindset to be sociable or meet new people. I developed terrible anxiety and fear and that became the precursor for the situation I'm in right now.

&amp;#x200B;

On the first day, we shook hands and met, but I retreated to the bathroom shortly after as I worked a manual labor job at the time and was desperate for a shower. I came back out there and saw they've invited some people and we talked a bit. I gave up in trying to participate in the conversation after making little contribution and just went to my room and slept. This became the lifestyle for me for the first month. I'd try to avoid them as much as possible and just stayed in my room. I was very antisocial.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd hear them making comments about me making jokes, etc., not necessarily racists ones, just how I'm being a pussy (which I was) or how lame I was. However, one night, in a moment of absolute desperation of being out of drugs, and being the drug-seeking fiend I am, decided to drink some of their alcohol while they were out drinking and got a little too trashed, but had a blast when they came home. We barely had any rapport before this, but things were looking good.

&amp;#x200B;

I started coming out of my room and hanging with them in the living room. I didn't say much, just chilled, but it was better than what I was doing before, and built a little more rapport. It was a bit annoying though seeing how alot of their attempts at conversation and responses seemed to be out of duty with them being my roommates and that air of awkwardness was still persisting.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured I'd built enough comfort to ask them to bring a handle of alcohol to my friend's house while I was there one night. They did, and paid them back the next day. I did it again a week later, but was left on read after telling him I'd Venmo them money.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I especially hate is how one of them just decides to disrespect me right to my face, and do things that one could spin off as harmless, yet the intention is the opposite. He'd Snap pictures of me to girls or show me to them while Facetiming them knowing they'd laugh in an attempt to ridicule me. I'm done with this and won't even go through the effort of telling him. They won't take me seriously because they never did. They'd have their friends over often, and I'd meet them and be told I was describes as, ""Yeah, he's this Asian dude."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned before in this post I do appreciate their initial efforts of trying to get to know me. I'm partly to blame for this situation as I came off as super antisocial and unwelcoming, but I can't stand the disrespect. This is the main reason I've considered leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to move back into my parents' house, but this seems like the only option. They'd be covering the rest of the rent (about 4k) by themselves should I make this decision, and I'd feel terrible. But I'm absolutely unhappy with this situation.

329,"Im a 19f, I’ve been out of my parents house for about 2 years. I’m taking a semester off of college, but I’m trying to go back. Right now I’m seriously dependent on my family and I don’t want it anymore.

I do pay some of my living expenses and have a full time, minimum wage job. I pay about $500-$550 of my own money towards rent and utilities, and I pay for my own food and gas. My parents pay for my car payments (they own the car), car insurance, my tuition (when I went to school), phone bill, etc. So obviously, my parents pay a lot of money just so I can be “on my own”, and because of that they have a lot of say on what goes on in my life.

I live with my sister (25f) and her boyfriend (30m). I get my own living space and it’s pretty cool. But because she’s my sister, she has direct access to my parents whenever we’re in a fight or when she doesn’t like something that I’m doing.

My biggest gripe is that my family has a huge say in my relationship, especially the sister that I live with. She (and my parents) won’t let my boyfriend (22m) sleep over. I was fine with it at first because we’ve only been together for 6months, but it became an issue about him just coming over. She doesn’t like him and it’s awkward when they’re in the same room. My sister calls him a loser and an idiot and a douche bag and that he won’t do anything with his life. She says he’s not good for me, but she never even gave him a chance. She talks down to him as if he’s a child, when in reality he’s taken care of himself for years.

I’m terrified about him meeting my parents. My mom already doesn’t like him because of my sister.

I’m not perfect. I don’t always do my house chore and I can be messy. But I don’t feel like I’m in the living space (besides the kitchen) enough to have to clean. I’m always in my room!

I’m grateful to have the financial support, and I know I have it great compared to most people. But I feel like there should be a line between my family and me as a person. Because my family is so involved in my life, I have no space to be me. I want to be more independent and stable because I hate being in this middle ground of “child” and “adult”.

336,"Hi Reddit,

I am relatively new to the work place and we are working over ten hours a day. A group of about ten. 4-5 of them I feel stonewalled by.  This group is relatively new as a whole so most people haven't been there long either. Mostly a few weeks more than me only. 

Mostly a group of early 20s to late 20s ppl. 

I feel this way because:

1) there is a sharp contrast in interaction between the way there is playfulness/talking when they interact with one another, and then  with me as an individual. 
2) people outside of our work team in other divisions give a far more noticeably friendly demeanor and warmness towards me than those within my group. 

It was noticeable on the first day that one member of the group was stonewalling me. No effort in forming a human connection and it was noticeable how sharply contrasting, in terms of friendliness/playfulness, that person's interaction was with others in or team.  Others were very friendly the first day. But as days moved on the social stonewalling could be felt. 

I don't feel I have done anything outlandish or offensive. I've been kind and very similar in demeanor to others outside our team that have been friendly to me. 

It's hard to deal with because I see this team so often and I would like human and playful interaction with people who I spend ten plus hours with a day.

Obviously I can’t jump to conclusions and assume it was a double date, but I can’t help but feel lied to. Layla said I had every right to be upset and that frankly, John must’ve known posting it and sending it out (streaks on Snapchat) would’ve made me jealous.

Honestly, when I sent my boyfriend a picture, he couldn't even find the scratches. I rubbed most of it out with my finger alone, and left a note suggesting the owner use toothpaste or Turtle wax to get the scratches out, and if that didn't work, to call me (left my name and number). Mind you, there was NO DENT. Just the two tiniest scratches the length of a pointer finger. A few hours later I get a call from the owner thanking me for my note, but saying they are very upset about the car and would be taking it to a shop to get a quote. Now, I know these commercial shops will tell you it's gonna be a $700 job for something that a mom and pop shop could wipe out in two seconds.

At first, we took over her dog care duties. But it’s starting to become more work than we want to be doing. Her dog has been abused and needs serious socializing. The dog even bit one of our friends that came to visit.

That was peace. But, the guy I was with had the mindset of making the land he had into something better. So it was constantly work and goals of making a lot of money through funding that I think ruined what he had. But it was in a third world country full of issues, so I understood.

Earlier this month, my sister said she was open to shaving off all her hair, something that could significantly help her curb her disorder. I thought this was a good idea, as I have seen a rising number of woman shaving their heads for various reasons in media and in real life. My recommendation was shaving it off near Halloween and dressing up as Eleven from “Stranger Things” to help her come up with a reason for shaving it if she did not want to disclose her actual reasons to strangers. 

My mother does not like this idea. She is very understandably worried that this will put her in a position where she will receive even more ridicule at her middle school.

361,"I suspect that a female friend of mine is into me and would appreciate some other opinions on that situation (don't ask why). I think she's quite cute but I wouldn't want something serious so I didn't try anything when she visited me yesterday. That are the main points:
1. she asked if she could visit me and was really hesitant to open the text where I answered what I was doing the next day (it was clear that as soon as she opened it she’d have to ask if she could visit me). Why hesitate if it was only on a friendship basis?
2. she kept eye contact when we both stopped talking instead of looking away (like I did)
3. in the end we came quite close with her laying on her side facing to me (we sat on my couch)
4. my neighbor and a friend of his claimed that she is into me with the reasoning that she focused mainly on me when she visited with a friend of hers last time but this could be due to the fact that I was desperate for my neighbor and his friend to leave (didn’t even want them here) and she was amused by my reaction
5. she currently isn’t into anyone as she already came over her last crush about a month ago (I’m kind of her advisor for these things so if there is anyone apart from me I’d know)
6. when she was about to go and nothing happened she mentioned that the hot guy from the bus in the morning maybe smiled at her, fixed her hair and said “maybe there are also cute guys there” (the event she went to after) and when she was in the tram she texted that the guys in suits there look rather good. 
7. she also mentioned being underweight like me is as bad as overweight and is rather superficial (I shouldn’t be below her standards though as we already hooked up twice with her instigating it the second time. This was 10 months ago)",20Oct2018,1
362,"Hi so I have my hair chemically straightened (Japanese straightening perm) but the roots grew out to about my shoulders. It’s really hard to manage because I always have to straighten it since my hair is naturally wavy, very puffy, and frizzy. Whenever I straighten my hair, the waves and frizziness just comes back after a few hours. Even if I curl my hair, I need to straighten the grown out parts first.

I want to touch up my perm but I also really want to dye my hair blonde which is going to require bleach since my hair is naturally very black to the point of people asking if I dye it black. 

However I see a lot of people advising against both perming and coloring hair. Which do you guys think I should do?",20Oct2018,1

365,"Not really. I live in the US with 3 men. One in particular has two dogs that he cant train and keeps locked up all day in a cage. When hes home he lets his dog shit and piss all over the house. There has been a pile of shit in the hallway outside my bedroom (he passes it at least 10 times a day) that he hasnt cleaned up in a week. 

I can only keep so much clean and its getting so bad that its beyond where I am even going to begin to start cleaning. This roomie is a man-child and the most irresponsible pet owner and human being ive ever met. 

I live here for free, so I dont ever say anything to him, but it is begining to affect my health. I keep getting skin infections and so does my (very clean) dog. I pretty much stay in my room and whenever I walk outside my bedroom, I go wash my feet before I enter and I also wear socks or slippers. Out if all 3 roomies, this one is the only one I have never even spoken to. He hides in his room when he is home, which isnt often, and he is the actual home owner. I am close with one of the others, which is how I ended up living here. 

I am beyond annoyed and frustrated that I live in such filthy and unhealrhy living conditions. This is a big 3bdr house and should never be this dirty. I have tried to keep up by mopping every other day, but piles of piss and shit are just everywhere every day. Ive never seen anybody live this way... unless they have a literal dirt floor as their floor (as seen in some other countries or extreme poverty areas - this is neither). Even then, its not soaked in urine.

I just want him to mop. With like, at least a gallon of bleach afterward. 
Im sure it will take fully mopping it at least 6 times before the floors will even be semi-clean.

His dog is a great dane and not neutered (which I have a huge problem with since this dog stays in a cage for 22 hours a day its whole life).

Im really frustrated. Why do I live here? Oh yeah, its free. 


What should I do? I feel like its wrong to confront him because its his home and I just live here. Perhaps he expects that I will be cleaning his dogs messes (not something that has ever been asked or discussed). I dont want to come off as ungrateful, but this is causing actual infections on myself and my dog. If I had somewhere else to go, I would. Thats not an option for me right now. 

I AM going to clean it. For my own health. Im not going to let my own stubbornness affect me negatively. But this situation needs under control.

I need advice!

368,"So I've had a problem with only having nightmares at night for a long time and I recently started realizing a pattern with them. They usually involve me dealing with high stakes stressful events, like some kind of an apocalypse scenario in which my life, and sometimes many other people's lives, depends on how I handle whatever's going on. I usually fail and die or watch people close to me or even  strangers die as a result of me failing to save them, but then the scenario kind of starts over and it's like I'm given another try. These scenarios usually replay around two to four times before I wake up, and I have other dreams in between them that I never remember as well after I wake up. 

Around the time that I started realizing this pattern of the same scenarios in my dreams repeating, I also started actually somewhat succeeding in surviving these scenarios on occasion, usually after a few times of the scenario restarting. I've definitely failed and died or watched other people die in these dreams way more often than I've actually survived in them. But I've been realizing while I talk to my fiance about it in the mornings that the repeated dreams almost feel like training that I might be getting better at. Like training to handle high pressure life threatening scenarios by having to think on my feet and make important split second decisions, and using resources around me to help, like finding ways to hide or weapons to defend myself. 

For example, last night I dreamed that I was in a futuristic Paris and there was some kind of dictator figure (played by Jared Leto) that was leading a group of followers in finding and killing people in the group that I was in. When I was thinking about it this morning after I woke up, it kind of seemed like the divide between us and his followers was based on economic class, and his followers had some kind of intelligent futuristic technology that made hiding from them difficult. But I never have time to really analyze the scenario like that while I'm dreaming, I just had to figure out how to hide from them and was trying to help others around me hide too. 

I think the scenario in the dream repeated around three times last night in between other dreams. The first time I think I just got shot by the robot people and taken to Jared Leto really fast. The second time I was back in the same scenario, I found a mostly empty house with two other girls that only had a few pieces of furniture in it and a cat. I think the cat's meowing gave us away to the robot people and they busted into the house and shot us. But then the last time I was in the scenario again, I figured out a way for me and a large family to hide out in that house without the robot people sensing us. One of the old ladies in the family I was with said that the cat was hers so I think that's why it didn't meow that time. And then for some reason I thought the robot people wouldn't notice us if we pretended like we were living there and not among the group of people running away from them, and it worked. There were some kids in the family that wanted to go outside and go somewhere to get food because we were starving, and I had to tell them that we just had to be patient and wait there because they would get us if we went outside. The other people in the group were very old and they just kind of seemed like they were in shock. At some point the robot people went by the house that we were pretending to live in, chasing and killing people who were running down the street without noticing us, and then I think I woke up right after that. 

These scenarios in my dreams are definitely scary but while I'm dreaming it's like I don't have time to be scared because I have to figure out what to do. And then while I'm awake, usually at night, I'll think about stuff from my dreams and get scared that something is in our apartment, or if we're outside that something is going to jump out and attack us. I started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago for anxiety and I think these nightmares are probably a symptom of my problem with anxiety, but I've only gone around four times and I'm not really sure if that's helping yet or not. 

These dreams feel very real and I always remember so much of them after I wake up. Does anyone else remember so many details from their dreams and feel scared in real life from them? Does anyone else dream that they have to try to survive in scenarios that repeat themselves like this?",20Oct2018,1

371,"
I’m 17 and I’ve just finished my first term of Alevels. I do History, biology and Chemistry hoping to become a vet or biochemist. My history teacher has a weird kind of hatred for me. Though my gcse years she constantly told my parents that I would get nothing more than a 5 (C) -jokes on her I got an 8 (A*)- and would constantly imply that I was too “stupid” to do a science for an Alevel. She even demanded to know who my teachers were so she could “talk to them”. She makes inappropriate comments in class including comparing our school to Hilters Germany and making a school shooter joke. She would tell us she didn’t love her husband anymore just weird shit like that. Anyway back to the original story. On Friday, she was giving out our engagement grade rated either A B or C. In my assessment books she had written a B and I was fine with that as she had explained A was very hard to get. She then read our C for me in front of the whole class and I was so angry. I asked her why she gave me this as you have to justify it to our head of year. She then goes on to tell me that I’m always late to her lessons, that I don’t do my homework or further reading, that I constantly go for toilet breaks in her lesson and my notes are up to standard of an A grade student. I have never been over come with so much anger at being told such blatant lies. I am ashamed to admit that I actually broke down crying. This women then ashames me even further by doing this half laugh and sending the whole class out so “she can deal with me”. Thank god one of my friends refused to go and stayed with me because this women starts guilting me saying “look what you made me do interrupting my lesson” “you think I’m out to get you”. I’ve never been late to any of my lessons I take my education so seriously which is proved in the fact that my target grades for my end of Alevels are A B B and I hope to raise them all to As. I then asked my teacher what the two girls who got As did to deserve them and she said both had them had come back to after class for different reason but it showed they were invested. I thought fair enough seems right but if I understand everything why do I need more work. I got 65% on my first essay and I had thought that was good enough for my first go at an Alevel style essay 4 weeks into my first term. My teacher herself had written in it that my knowledge on the subject material was perfect and I just need to work on my style. Of which I have two years to master I don’t expect to be perfect at first. Upon speaking to these two girls they told me that they have never been back after class and she had lied to me again. I have spoken to my head of year about it as I was very upset at being called lazy. I haven’t told my parents because they are very stressed at the moment and I don’t want to stress them further. My head of year wants me to compile an email of everything that happened because she find my teachers behaviour worrying. 

I’m really sorry for my rambling and poor grammar but I’m so worried and stressed about this matter. I just wanted to get it out. I want advice on whether I over reacted or if I shouldn’t let it go. I’m really not the type of person who speaks badly to teachers and involves themselves in student teacher drama but this woman is actually lying.

372,"Early in the year, we had a new employee start. Aside from numerous personal conflicts (she wants my shift that I requested due to a second job, she's religious and will lecture while I'm agnostic), she's slow, often taking 3 hours to get what I get done in less than 1 and forgetting what you taught her the day before. The problems only get worse. She was on probation for DUI and frequently showed up late and reeking of alcohol. Boss wouldn't do anything because a). she has a hard enough time finding people as it is and b). a lot of customers do like her (she's the chatty type, but it holds up the line and she neglects her cleaning duties for it).

I got fed up with her to the point I looked into contacting her parole officer. However it would've required me to give my name and info in case I was called to testify, so I decided it wouldn't be in my best interest. Meanwhile she was becoming a direct cause of my anxiety (Yes, I have been diagnosed. I looked into therapy but I have yet to have a truly positive experience with it). In an effort to do something, I got involved with civic organizations like MADD.

Ultimately, someone sent a letter to the courts that got pinned on me. She's apparently in jail, her boyfriend has threatened me and I feel like my job is in jeopardy. 

I do realize I probably said too much to a lot of people (holding things in also contributes to my anxiety). I have not been fired yet, am looking for a new job, and I have obtained mace. Is there anything else I can/should do?

My sister had mental issues since she is around 16. My mom brought her to therapy after she said she wanted to kill herself. 

A few days after her 18th birthday she moved away. It was really hard for my parents because of the way she did it and things she said but eventually the relationship got better again.

374,"Hey all. I'll try to make this quick and hopefully it makes sense. I'm gonna use nicknames for people involved. 

I have a really good friend, Red. She is married to Blue. I have a relatively new friend, Yellow, who has become really good friends with Red. Yellow is a female. 

Red and Yellow spent the summer going on trips out of town and spending a lot of time together, while Blue worked. I always knew that Yellow is attracted to women (which is obviously no issue, just context). So I suspected early on that she had a thing for Red. About two weeks ago, Yellow and I went out to a bar. Yellow got drunk and told me that she is in love with Red. She continued telling me how Red is in love with her as well and wants to be with her. Said that Red made the decision to try and be with Blue, but still tells Yellow how much she loves her and that she wants to be with her. Basically messing with her head. Saying that she can't be with her, but also tricking Yellow into holding out for her. Hoping that Red will get a divorce. 

When Red found out that I knew. She talked to me about it. Spending an hour on my couch, crying and telling me that she loves Yellow so much. That she wished she could leave Blue and be with her. But she doesn't want to hurt him. Said she feels obligated to stay with him, but knows she will never be as happy with him as she is with yellow. Red has also told Blue all of this, in hopes that Blue would just let her go and be okay with it. But he's not. He's trying so hard to keep her in his life. Being really understanding and sweet to her. Blue has always been an incredible husband to her, and she knows this. She's just happier with someone else.

Now for Blue. I haven't talked to Blue yet. But red told me, that recently he has been really upset (obviously) and doesn't know what to do. He told her that he really needed to talk to someone and that he wanted to come to my house one day, and talk to me about it. But he decided against this. I wish he had, because he needed someone. But I honestly have no idea what I would have even said to him. 

I don't want to sound like I'm making this all about how it's affecting me. I'm not that selfish. I just don't know what to say, when they come to me about this. I've literally been giving conflicting responses. 

When Yellow talks to me, she tells me how Red won't leave her husband. So we talk about how she needs to not to wait for her. To start moving on. To stop talking to Red. To try going on dates. I don't want to tell Yellow, the stuff that Red told me. It will just mess with her more. 

When Red talks to me. She tells me how badly she wants to be with Yellow. And that she wants to leave Blue, but feels she owes the marriage one more chance. I just repeat the things she says to me, back to her. Trying to make her realize that she needs to do what makes he happiest. Whatever decision she makes. She needs to go into it 100%. She wants her marriage to fail. She says she wants to give Blue time to process this. So they can be friends after. I basically tell her that if she wants to end it, she needs to do it now. Otherwise she is hurting Blue more.

I'm telling Yellow to move on 

I'm telling Red to be with Yellow.

And I'm terrified to be alone in a room with Blue, because I don't what the hell to say to him.

I often identify more with the villain because I often wish I could be the serial killer, because I like doing things that raise my adrenaline. Killing people, drugs, etc. I have never acted on these impulses, but I feel like I will inevitably do them because I have such a high urge that I don't think I will be able to control much longer. I don't feel sadness either. I don't remember the last time I was sad at all. I go out of my way to hurt and betray those who trust me. I am never able to keep friends because of this. Sooner or later, I become unsatisfied with what I have and want more. I want power over people. I lie all the time. Sometimes I don't even know I'm doing it.

377,"So she (single) is in the same class as me, and also happened to be the friend of a very close friend of mine ( a girl also but nothing romantic). I never really gave her that much attention but she kept talking to me and asked me that we should go out us three ( Her, me and the mutual friend) to hang out. So I asked her if she was free on a certain date, and I suggested coming to my place to play a bit of poker ( she kept telling me she wanted me to teach her poker), and then go have lunch somewhere. She said something along the lines of “ I have many things but I can cancel all of them” and seemed very excited and happy. So the day we went out was after class. She came, full makeup and had made her hair. The entire time she seemed very energetic and always smiling. In the restaurant she sat next to me and she kept leaning on me and she frequently tried to touch me ( though I took it as more a sign of familiarity and friendship than anything romantic).  So why after all that I haven’t asked her out yet ? Well I have my doubts.    
Most of the girls I dated previously were pretty obviously into me all I had to do was just ask them out. But here, though she might be showing signs of affection, it’s confusing the hell out of me because she seems to be like that all the time with all her friends. So it’s hard to interpret what are the “signs” and what are the traits of her usual self and personality .     
Here are some stuff that are confusing me a lot:    
1)should I ask our mutual friend if she is interested in me since they are very close? (I’m pretty sure she if I ask her she’d probably not tell her I did though them being bffs doesn’t assure me that much).       
2) Do I take things slowly before asking her out ? Maybe a few more friendly hangouts before I ask her if she is interested in a relationship, or am I just opening the door to the friend zone.         
3) She seems to friend zone every one since she has a LOT of male friends and I guess she shows the same “signs” to them as well.     
4) I know I will probably ask her out and am always prepared for a rejection. But this is a girl that I have feelings for so I’m probably not gonna be “just friends” if she says no because I can’t handle that, but I’ll probably lie because i’m not a dick.

Hello there! I’m new to this whole Reddit thing so please bear with me. I’ve been told I can probably rally up some good insight on this here.

Anyway, Halloween is coming up as of the time I’m writing this, and I’m trying to decide as what or who to dress up as for a few parties I’m attending. I’m really drawn to the idea of dressing up as Emma Decody from the show Bates Motel, as she seems like an easy and fun character to portray.

Thing is, though, I’m a bit conflicted.

For those who don’t know, in the show, she’s got cystic fibrosis so she carries around an oxygen tank and wears a nasal cannula. I really want to capture her essence, but my concerns lie in the possibility that going the extra mile to, y’know, craft myself a cannula and whatnot would come off as some sort of appropriation or something. I really don’t want to cause any harm or offend anyone. I’m not so sure if doing that is appropriate. I don’t want it to seem like the costume is to mock anyone with her condition or any condition, period. It’s for fun and I want it to be accurate, because as Emma’s disorder is not her defining trait (because there really is so much more to her), it does serve relevance in terms of some plot points. HOWEVER, I know it’s not necessary to have that FULL getup for me to have fun, but it’d be really nice to do if it isn’t going to hurt anyone.

Maybe my hesitance to do this is a sign, but I want some input from you guys.

381,"How do I differentiate if my boss has a crush on me versus just being his favorite in the office?

Intuition tells me he has a crush. However, he is a dentist and I plan to attend dental school in the near future, so maybe he is just enjoying being a mentor to me of sorts. Or maybe he feels bad for me because I've had a really tough year.

He has been married for a long time.

But he compliments me a lot. And he is extremely attentive to me. He definitely gives me preferential treatment in the office, although he is smart about it and does not make it obvious. He is constantly poking fun at me in what I take as flirtatious, but maybe I am not interpreting it correctly? He is very protective of me. And he was basically gushing about me when we had our quarterly review. He was throwing compliments left and right. He is very personable and patients adore him, but there is still something different with how he treats me. When he introduced me to our new coworker last week, he told her that I am the best assistant he has ever had all the while my other coworkers were standing right there. He ate lunch with all of us in our break room a few weeks ago... but he never really talked to or looked at anybody else other than me.

I admit that I do have a crush on him. I feel terrible about it. Mine started a few weeks after he began to compliment me a lot. It happened so naturally, and I am ashamed of it. I am very neutral around him because he is married. I will never, ever allow my feelings to get in the way of professionalism and his marriage. But I am curious as hell to see what others think, because I have never been in a position like this before. Thank you in advance.

So I quit, since I live with my parents and have money in the bank, I had the luxury. But now, I have no idea what to do with my life. I don’t know if I want to work in IT, since yeah I’ll make money but I feel like I’ll be miserable. I don’t have any real interests besides video games and television. And I barely even have the motivation to do those things. I’m pretty sure I’m depressed and I want to start seeing a therapist to deal with it.

I know I have to work, and I want to. I just don’t have a clue what to even work towards right now. ",20Oct2018,1

385,"Right now she is in Greece, with two of her friends. Last night she was walking alone and drunk. She says she doesn't really remember everything because she was so drunk, but she says a man held her down, kissed her, fingered her, and she doesn't know / can't remember if he put his penis in her, but she says she remembers he had it out at. She was able to run away at some point though.

I've told her to go to the hospital or walk in clinic, and she says she doesn't want to because she was raped before and doesn't want to make it a whole thing again. Plus it will be expensive there, and free in Canada when she gets back in 8 days. The 2 guys she is there with are saying there is no point in taking her either, because they won't be able to tell if she has contracted any STI's until 7 days after it has happened. So they should just wait until they get back to Canada. This sounds like absolute bullshit, I think she should go right away, and a quick google proves my case.

386,"I'm a 19 year old professional Software Developer. I moved from Essex into London, to live with my GF's family, whilst I settle at this new job. My GF is 18, most of her friends are all around the country. 10 / 12 of my Friends are across the country at University. The 2 that aren't, live in Essex, an hour journey from London.

&amp;#x200B;

It's quite depressing for me at the moment, most of my friends are all off at their own places, in different unis. My family home of 4 people, now just consists of my dad. The rest of the family have split off. Basically, everyone is separating off to do their own things, friends and family.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm 19 and I professional, I'm not at uni or school, so I don't have that many ways to make friends. I ride Motorcycles, but since moving in to London I barely ride and will be considering selling the motorcycle. That's one less way to make friends. I'm quite close with a couple of guys from work, we occasionally meet out of work - but it's not the same as having non-work friends.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few cool custom-motorcycle places in London, but as an outsider they appear quite intimidating to become a regular at (without any other people with you).

&amp;#x200B;

I try to avoid as much technology outside of work as possible, so I try to avoid programmer meetups, especially since I don't tend to share the same interests as 90% of developers, I'm really quite adventurous, a risk-taker and really enjoy outside activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried Meetup, but as I live with my GF, most of my hobbies are at a minimal, since there's not really much space for my stuff. I can't go camping in London, I plan on selling the Motorcycle, I can't fit my Gaming PC at my GFs place.  I'm stuck in a loop of 9 - 5 work and work-events. Other than that, I just tend to chill with my GF. Which, being a person from outside Essex who enjoys adventurous, outside activities, I'm finding really difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

I absolutely LOVE my job and the environment, I just want more opportunities to socialise outside of my work group and maybe some ideas for hobbies, similar to that of my hobbies I had in Essex.

Well he just messaged me that the depression is too much, he's started cutting himself and just wants to die but is too weak to actually do it, and he doesn't know what to do. I don't really know anything about him other than his name and that he has a big family, his parents (and him) are super religious.

So, I moved in with my boyfriend recently who has lived in this apartment (upstairs apartment of a duplex house) for 2 years. According to our downstairs neighbors, there has been a mice issue here even before we were here and our landlord knows about it. Over the past few months, we heard mice in the attic but it didn’t bother us that much because we rarely go up there. When we did go up there, we found mice poop everywhere. It is literally everywhere! 

Soon after that, we noticed that mice got into our cabinets in our kitchen and got into our food and they left poop there too. We trashed everything and cleaned it out. 

There was about a month period where we didn’t hear the mice anymore. But yesterday we turned the heat on for the first time in a while and all hell broke loose. We heard mice sounds coming from the kitchen. Our cats were staring at the oven so we figured they were in that area. There’s a little drawer that can be pulled out from other the oven. I pulled it out and found at least 3 dead mice. And somewhere either behind the oven or in that drawer was a live one scratching around and squeaking and making a lot of noise. 

We got fed up with this mice issue so we called the landlord and said we need an exterminator. He says to just buy some mouse traps and cheese and trap them and clean the poop and dead mice ourselves. My worry is that I think this issue is much bigger than what normal people can do. I think we need a professional. Is it safe for us to be cleaning all of this up?? Should we insist that he hires someone professional for this job?

402,"I'm a High school Junior and this the first year I've tried to improve myself academically, socially and mentally. I've always struggled with self image and constantly sought out validation from my peers which led to me always pulling off stupid stunts to get attention. To be blunt, I was a laughing stock with no real friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the summer however, I've improved myself by getting a job and forcing myself to go out and be social. I've come to peace with myself and no longer seek attention and have made a lot of friends. From someone who stayed home all day playing video-games to actively going out every weekend with a group this was a big step forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

Come around the school year and I'm extremely confident in myself and happy with who I am. I feel as if people realized that I was finally being genuine and as such, treated me better. I was invited to games and hang outs and I also began taking really challenging courses.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem started with the courses that I was taking. I was taking 3 College level classes when I've never tried in a single course through out my entire life. I was always a slacker and never took school seriously, coasting through classes and getting decent grades. My grades are all either C's and B's and even a D. It's only been a month and I have a new test and essay every week. I don't feel as if I'm psychically capable of doing all this work and I get so much pressure that I end up not doing anything and wasting more time. I constantly request extensions on my essays from my teacher because I never finish everything on time and I average C's on the weekly quizzes. Through all of my classes combined I probably have 10 missing assignments that I have no chance of turning in now because late work isn't accepted. I'm supposed to be making a Psychology essay due tonight but here I am already giving up.

&amp;#x200B;

I've since resorted to eating, playing and watching (Death Note is really good btw) my problems away and have since gained more weight than I've already had (I've always struggled with weight issues.) I haven't been outside with my friends in forever and have just been a recluse. I haven't gotten any work done and have just been a mess. I haven't considered finishing myself off yet fortunately but I just don't know what to do. Other kids are probably struggling like me, but a lot of them are a lot better at actually doing the work and also having good social lives.

It sucks.

412,"My stepfather died from a terminal illness in January. He married my mom 20 years ago after his first marriage broke up because his ex wife of 30 years had been cheating on him. (Side note:she’s been married to the guy for 20+ years also.)

My stepdad was my father growing up because mine wasn’t around. He has 4 adult daughters (37-47)he wasn’t involved with much after the divorce due to their own fault (never came for Christmas, holidays etc he invited them to - or if they did come they’d hit him up for money and leave). One daughter hugged me in hospice telling me how much he loved being my dad &amp; wouldn’t have done it if he wanted to , lots of tears ... a nice moment.

The next day after he died the ex wife started posting on FB how the love of her life died, my mom killed him with morphine, we messed up the obituary (my stepdad wrote it), and so on. 

The same daughter that hugged me started dragging me on the internet and then texting how I took her away from her dad why didnt he take her on family vacations (mind you said vacations I was in my 20s paid my own ticket &amp; went to visit my mothers brother 🤷🏻‍♀️ - at the time she was married with 5 kids).

413,"I’m 21 and my brother is 22. We are very near in age and growing up was tough because of it. My mom had a subconscious way of favoring my brothers over me and my sister. This is something we worked through growing up. My brother also always had a complex about being older than me and constantly pitted himself against me “I got to do blah blah first.” Or “I get the front seat because I’m older.” This made me feel like I was less than because my parents never really interfered too much with the interaction. 

Now, I know I can be an annoying little sister. That’s what siblings are. But I was play fighting with my brother (not actually kicking and punching. Just miming it) I stopped when he told me it was annoying him. 

After some time while talking with my older sister, I was just comparing size of her hand with mine (she’s smaller than me and I was amused by the size difference) Then my brother wanted to compare size and then he grabs my hand harshly in a way I’ve told him many times in the past that I hate. 
(Context for this is I really hate the feeling of my bones grinding next to each other. I’m also right handed and draw a lot. The thought of injuring my hand and not being able to draw scares me.)

I got angry and then pushed him and kneed him in the leg ( giving him a charley horse). He came back at me like he was going to punch me in the face. And swore at me but I blanked out what he said because it scared me. 

I apologized. Then he threatened me again. 

My older sister told him to cool it. He then called me a c*nt which is honestly a word that none of us use. We don’t swear a lot in our family and my sister scolded him for saying it. That was crossing a line. 

I also brought up to my sister the time her punched me in the face. (It was wrong of me to bring up the past, honestly but I was scared of him. And I wanted to tell my sister. He listens to her more than me so if my sister knew he hurt me before maybe she could talk to him)

I apologized again and explained why it made me upset and that was why I lashed out by I shouldn’t have and I was sorry. 

Now, I’m in his car headed back to my apartment with my dad. And I’m just thinking that I’m just annoying as hell to him and it hasn’t changed. I don’t usually get angry like that either but because I had been horsing around with him earlier like that I just switched into that mode. But its no excuse either and that’s something I should work on. 

I’m just afraid he hates me. I can’t say he’s in the wrong, he just scares me when he gets angry like that.

The party started before i got off work at 10:30. As soon as she picked  me up i could tell she had been using something and point blank asked her what she was on. She lied to my face and just said she was drunk, i was being niave and  let go, i wanted to trust her.  At the party she continued to behave in way that i knew something was up. Some dude eventually yanked her close to him while i was standing next to her, and i told her we were leaving that it was now crossing boundaries we had established. She got defensive and refused to leave, i refused to stay and argue in front of strangers so i checked with her friend to make sure she could get a ride, then i left. She comes hone an hour later, acting like we are perfect. She ends up telling me she was doing coke with her friend and did it right before coming in the house. She knows i was raised by a drug addict and that i have zero tolerance for drug use around me. We had a horrible night, she promised to go to aa/na meetings, she text her friend she can't hang out with her any more and then deleted her number. 

A few days ago i surprised her at her work, and her and that co-worker had left the building together then that co-worker honked good-bye. She even introduced that co-worker to her brother today.  I asked her if they were friends at work originally and she told me no, now she says they are friend at work because they live together.

To me, this is a person she essentially cheated on me with, only with lies, drugs and deception.  When i brought it up to her like that, asked her if she would want me being work friends with someone i cheated on her with, she said ""we are just different"" meaning her and i. 

We have a trip planned in a little over a week, and i was going to propose..... thinking all of this is behind us. I no longer am going to propose and im left kind of scrambling. I feel like she just keeps this hidden world of people who know she is lying to me, or teaching them not to respect me by deciding to participate in activities while knowingly keeping it from me.

So, a frat party doesn’t sound so bad, but let me give a little backstory.

Before the summer, she was caught grinding on another guy and she did it once more before that without telling me. She told me she wouldn’t either and lied to me about a few other things so we broke up.

Summer went by and we eventually got back together. However, the feeling I got when I found out she lied to me still haunts me.

She has changed a lot and she is better now, and she knows she did wrong but she still wants to get out there and twerk.

Kids all over the place grinding on each other everywhere. And I already know I prob won’t feel right about it.

When being with him is all I want yet all that he does seems to bother me and make me unhappy.. when he stopped putting in an effort to make sure we were good and taken care of when I wasnt(which is like all the time) I feel like I’m the only one fighting for us and he’s just comfortable because he knows I will fight for us.. I’ll take care of it. There’s no joint effort. 
I’m left alone to clean up his mess
Even being with him just makes me all confused.. I’m just not happy.. however when we are together physically I experience happiness that I don’t when we are in our separate paths.. and all we have is communication. He doesn’t try for me.

420,"Hi, 

I am looking for the perspective of parents, or religious parents on this topic. My family is traditionally religious, however, the last time I went to church was probably 5 years ago. I am 18Male and I want to hear the thoughts of older experienced members of Reddit about having your kids sleeping with girls.

 I am still in school and live with my parents but I'm not sure about having a girl sleeping over with me (like overnight). I feel like my parents may not appreciate the behaviour but they won't tell me I can't. I don't want to do my parents wrong and before I engage them in a conversation, I wanted to come here for some heads-up/perspective.

I know a lot of my friends have arrangements where they are not allowed to literally sleep overnight at the other person's house, however, they are sexually active and the parents don't mind, but for some reason the parents are against the connotation of sleeping together (like literal sleep).

Advice about what you think? How I should approach this conversation?

422,"I was at a local drug store with a friend, and had no idea of his intentions other than that he wanted to purchase a few things. I was walking around with him while he picked up his items. He got to this one particular item which had a value of around 50 dollars. He picked up the item and took it out of the box and into his pocket, but he put the box back so the scanners wouldn't ring on the way out. I was sort of in shock and didn't really know how to react to this, I had never stolen or been around anyone who has stolen anything before. Not knowing how to react, I didn't say anything and didn't even think to leave or tell him not to do it at the time. He paid for the rest of his things and we both left. It is not a very busy store, with 2 or 3 staff max, and I'm not sure if he will get caught for this but I can't help but worry about it. I feel really guilty and am very worried about this.

423,"Hi, so we are needing some advice about a situation we're dealing with right now. We just moved to the country and we also got 3 ducks as pets. We have the opinion that it would be beneficial to have at least 1 gun. To deal with the animals that will get our birds but also for safety of ourself and our house. Heres where the questioning comes in. My partner has in the past been suicidal and voiced it. He is doing well/stable now and has been for a couple years but I am not convinced that on a seriously irrational day it wouldn't slip into his mind to use it, years into the future. He says he doesn't think like that anymore and would not ever do that and couldn't imagine doing it. 

I said I am nervous and do not think we should get one for that reason. He is cautious of his mental health and says he understands why it may seem like/be a bad idea. BUT he is very adamant about our safety and our ducks and not dealing with coyotes in our shit so he wants a gun (I am not opposed to having one but wary). 

Is there any solution to this?? I am open minded as is he, but want to be very cautious with mental health concerns. His idea was to get a long barrel shot gun. We both think its a good idea, but want to check what anyone had to say on the matter? Is that not a good idea?",20Oct2018,1

430,"(we’ve been besties since we were 7 years old, we are now almost 24🤯), my best friend and I have been in a strictly sexual relationship for the past year and a half since I became single, I left from an extremely difficult and abusive relationship. 

My best friend had been there for me the entire time. 

I’ve known he’s had feelings for me since we were 16ish? That’s when he confessed to me, I explained I don’t feel that way and we promised never let that change our friendship. 

He had told me on several occasions how much he loves me, how he in a heartbeat would ask my fathers permission to marry me if I agreed to be with him, etc etc... 
Me on the other hand was never attracted to him in any way so I brushed it off each time he spoke of those sort of things. 

Fast forward to right before my breakup with my ex. We where both in “serious” relationships so to speak. 
I dump my ex and obviously tell my bestie what happened, that’s when he confessed to me how he was with her because he didn’t want to be alone. 
Alright fine I understand, what I don’t understand is how much personal stuff he told me that night about their relationship. 

How she’s been cheating, they’ve been having threesomes with her ex, they’ve been on several “breaks” from each other, you know the usual 🤗😂 

I’m obviously devastated because he didn’t tell me but I support him, the same way he supported me through it all.. 
and we where both singles

Then one thing led to another and we had sex.... 
and no it was not magical, it was not amazing, it was the shittiest sex I’ve ever had. 
He cums within seconds and tells me it’s my vagainas fault, we still continue having sex though. Cause we’recomfortable, it feels safe and we have so much fun. 

Fast forward to recent times and the reason to why I’m writing this, I think he’s in love with me
Like for real. 

I honestly do now know what to do? 

Do I end this whole thing including our friendship, cause it doesn’t seem like we could be friends after that. 

What the hell do I do? Honestly guys I’m devastated

439,"A little backstory:

Ever since I first found out about porn, I’ve &lt;pleased&gt; myself to it often.

After a few years of consuming, it started becoming a problem.

Now it’s gotten to the point in which I’m watching and using (I guess that’s what you would call it?) pornography at least once a day.

About 3 years ago, I met the most wonderful girl I have ever know, and we started dating. It’s easy for me to say that this is the girl I wish to marry, and she feels the same way. Now she knows that I watch pornography, but not to the extent that I really do, and I’m always lying to her about the truth. I feel sickened of myself for not only watching an excessive amount of porn but also for lying to my significant.

My girlfriend and I are sexually active, but that doesn’t seem to be able to help. (Just in case it helps, we have intercourse at least 2 times a week and on those days I don’t even touch porn)

Maybe around late September early October I tried to stop by going completely cold turkey, and it worked... for five days, then I fell off the wagon again.

It’s gotten to the point in which I’m completely desensitized to it, and it’s not even fun anymore, it’s just something I do when I’m bored, a fix.

I’m disgusted in myself, and I want to stop. I need to stop. I don’t want porn to control my life. I don’t want porn to destroy the happiest relationship I’ve ever had. And I don’t want porn to cause me any more suffering. Please, I need advice, I’m an addict and I need to stop, it’s ruining my sex life, and it’s making me stop focusing on the things I love.

Please anyone, I will take any advice I  can get, and any advice is highly, truly appreciated.",20Oct2018,1

I know a person can't truly start dealing w something like addiction until they fully accept that there's an issue, etc and wholly want to fix it, and I don't mean this selfishly or whatnot, but it's incredibly draining and difficult to watch certain moments play out w so much anger around it, on top of declining health.

The team is great, the job is easy, and I learn quite a lot, so I'm afraid I'm making the wrong decision. Most people in my country would stick with this job for years, and I'm bored of it in a few months.

Should boredom be a sufficient factor in quitting a job? I just don't find the job stimulating and it's not the field I want to pursue one year from now. Additionally, the job limits the time I spend on fields I am interested in, and ones I want to build my career in.

That brings me to a second question. Should I go for Master's, or just focus on getting rich and travelling the world? (Big dream). 

But I also supremely enjoy academics. Very confused.

452,"She's done this before, but we started talking again recently and she's done it again, I'm eager to understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

She'll take a while to answer my texts, sometimes won't even continue the conversation if it hits a dead end. Tells me to go away, then we talk then shes fine, I then send her a text and she doesn't answer.

&amp;#x200B;

She's just really weird, then the big part. She phones me off no caller ID, I refuse to pick up. I'm 90% sure its her, it only happens when we talk, and its funny because I've just got a new number and only her and my mum have it.",20Oct2018,1
453,"On my street people go CRAZY with Halloween decorations. This is our first Halloween here, so we tried to do what we could to fit the mold (without much money). We have a giant tree in our front yard, so I tried to leverage that. I found a [cheap skeleton and hung it from a tree](https://i.imgur.com/0mWUsst.jpg). 

It has been up for about 2 weeks and I just found [this](https://i.imgur.com/xU3NtAH.jpg) on my door today.

Am I out of line here? I am not sure how to respond. I want to be a good neighbor, but at the same time, I have only had positive feedback on the decorations.

Reddit, in all of your wisdom... how should I respond?",20Oct2018,1
455,"So I have a friend. It's fair to assume I'm her best friend. We talk every day and are very close. In fact we used to date and things might even be leaning that way again. But she has another friend that she is ok to talk about sometimes, and other times will not even admit to doing things with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know she values her privacy, she has even complained to me about this other friend on multiple occasions when they are invading hers too much and I make it a point to not repeat the mistakes that he does. But when I KNOW what the answer to some of my questions are and she refuses to answer them, it confuses me and makes me feel like she doesn't trust me. WHY doesn't she want me to know she was spending time with this friend? She has also said that she doesn't want to mix her friends when I've suggested doing so even though I've brought her to my friends and I know this other friend has introduced her to some of his too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example. We were talking today and I had to go to work. Now while I work I can stay on my phone on speaker as I'm a driver and so that's what we did. Normally she stays with me for my 5 hour shift, maybe taking breaks in between. Last night she left 1 hour before the end and said she'd play a game with the other friend. Cool, that's fine. Normally she comes back too but she said she lost track of time and went to bed and we texted goodnight, also fair enough. But today she left REALLY early and I know for a fact she then Skyped and played with this other friend for 5 hours before coming back to me after I asked if she would. Then when I ask her if she had a good evening and what she's been up to the response is ""nothing much"". I ask her if she had finished making something that she had nearly finished before and she says no, the reason being ""she just didn't"". She didn't give any indication of what she'd been up to for the last 5 hours even though I know 1000% she was talking to somebody else.

&amp;#x200B;

She can talk to whoever she wants. All I'd like advice on is why does it seem like she's hiding it? Why would she need to hide it? How can I make sure that she know's she doesn't need to? Even if we don't get back together, this is somebody I really care for and am worried at why she might need to hide things from me. I really don't want to see our relationship fall to ash. And before you suggest, I REALLY don't believe she's the type of person to play with people's emotions or lead them on so please don't suggest that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",20Oct2018,1
456,"Recently a lot of shit has happened to me and it never seems to end. About 8 months ago the love of my life left me for someone else, our relationship was rocky but it still hit me like a truck and fucked me up bad. She also still try’s to get ahold of me about once a month to just talk to me or tell me how she’s doing even though she’s with the guy she left me for.  

Then my boss at my job starts treating me like shit compared to the rest of the people there even though I was one of their best workers ( every month I received awards for best customer reviews and amount of extra work found) so I quit to work for my dad temporarily. 

Just so happens that was a huge mistake because my dads always treated me like shit and I ended up telling him to go fuck himself and left that job.

 So then I got a job making good money ($20 an hour and living in a small town that’s really decent pay) well for some damn reason my foot got fucked up at work whenever I never did anything to it. It just started hurting one day and got progressively worse until I could barely walk on it. I took a leave of absence while trying to figure out what’s wrong with my foot. 

Well about a week later I got a call about a job offer as a sheriffs deputy (always wanted to be in law enforcement) and I needed to go take a physical assessment. At this point I knew I needed to start training since I wasn’t exactly the most fit person. Took that test today actually and passed everything with flying colors other than the run. 

Lately I just can’t seem to get out of this damn rut, like I can’t miss work anymore I’m out of money but my foots still fucking killing me and with the tests that’s been done they haven’t found anything. Then I find out my therapist I saw wayyy back when my ex left me says I owe her a fuck load of money because she fucked up the billing. I don’t really know what I’m asking for exactly but anything could help at this point. ",20Oct2018,1
457,"So recently I moved schools and i knew a few people who went there before i went. Ive made a few friends so im enjoying myself. 
One of the Girls there ive known for a while and recently weve become really good friends and i really like her and i want to ask her out. 
Usuailly id have no problem with this kinda thing but shes still really attached to her ex and talks about him to me all the time. I dont know what to do. Can anyone help?",20Oct2018,1
458,"I work as a hairdresser and I am new to the industry trying to grow my clientele. There’s this girl at my work who keeps actively trying to steal my clients, when people call specifically for me she talks them out of seeing me or if I’m working on their hair she tries really hard to charm my clients by talking to them for a really long time. The whole thing is awkward and greasy and overall It pisses me off, my boss wont do anything about it because their both best friends and she can do no wrong in his eyes.

This girl is very pretty and stylish (nice clothes, heavy makeup, Metallica tattoo’s, sparkly nails, etc), but she has a very shitty personality with low morals and her work isn’t that great. People initially want to go with her first rather than me bc of how she looks, but they don’t stay. The whole thing is annoying and apparently she’s doing that to other stylists as well. 

What should i do? Should I just keep ignoring her pettiness and keep doing my own things or should i confront her and cause unnecessary tension and awkwardness at work (its a very small space) I know the beauty industry is superficial and competitive, but i’m not any of those things. I don’t look trendy, just average and my morals stop me from trying to steal from others. When clients do give me a chance, they tend to stick with me and enjoy my work. Do you think I’m in the wrong industry? Maybe i will fail bc i dont look the part and im not actively trying to fuck people over. ",20Oct2018,1

460,"One of my best friends’ mom is an acquaintance of my mom’s. The lady and my mom don’t talk much, but my mom tries to include her in social events and such she hosts/goes to. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to visit the same friend for an evening, and because they live in one of those neighborhoods without mailboxes, my friend’s mom asked my gf to accompany her to get their mail. 

Just to cover some backstory, my sister became and underage mother almost a year ago, and my sister has had many problems with rebellious phases and school misbehavior. 

My girlfriend later told me in private after we had left my friend’s house that his mother had spoken ill of my sister, stating she never liked her and that she saw her teen pregnancy coming from a mile away. My gf has begged me to keep it quiet from my mom. 

Next weekend is my nephew’s baptism, and my mom wants to once again invite the lady, but I don’t want the woman there if she doesn’t respect my family. I’m just wondering what I should do. ",20Oct2018,1

466,"We are doing a marketing assignment and he wanted to write about pricing and promo strat.

Those two require good writing skills and you need to really understand the content from our textbook to come up with good strategies.

He just gave me a rough draft of what he has and it's absolutely terrible.  I will pretty much have to re-do his entire work.

I wanted him to do something like scheduling or profit analysis. But forcing that on him by saying ""Look, your english isn't very good. You can probably contribute more on these stuff."" sounds kind of rude and disrespectful.


I will have several more group projects with him in this semester. While I wanna be as nice as possible, I don't want to do the work of 2 people. I am also the group leader who is in charge of combining individual writings into one final product so it's already too much work for me.

Any thoughts?

He's kind of a weirdo but I'm kind of one myself so I didn't really miss the opportunity to make a friend. once day in the group chat with all my other friends they were joking about him and I asked why people didn't like him. then i was told by my friend (we'll call him RH for this story)that while he looking through his camera roll there was pictures of girls taken by TN from class. what's even worse is that most of that classes students were a year younger than him. I believe the accusations because RH is a pretty honest person &amp; throughout the years TN has the messenger ""chat head"" bubble thing with this one girl always on the top that i know he doesn't talk to (i think she actually moved schools or something) 

should i just ditch him as a friend and ignore him now? I used to think he was ok but i'm grossed out now",20Oct2018,1
