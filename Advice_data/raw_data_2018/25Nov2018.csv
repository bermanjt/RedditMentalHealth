0,"Today, my stepdad (48M) and I (21F) were at the grocery store and as we left he said “the lady in front of us is how you are going to look when you’re 40” and I replied with “oh good, she was pretty” and he said “uhhhh... well I guess you could say that”. My stomach dropped. I said what the fuck and told him that upset me. He didn’t really have a response, just kept repeating that she wasn’t attractive but not unattractive? This isn’t the first time he has done this, he always describes me as “somewhat attractive” and says other hurtful things. 

I have been crying all day and feel gross and absolutely worthless. I am not unattractive, but I am not a perfect 10. I hate how I look, just like a lot of other women my age, and he knows that. Why would he say such hurtful things knowing that I hate myself and knowing that it hurts me? How should I deal with this when it happens again in the future? ",25Nov2018,1

5,"long story short i had a tough childhood-mom had cancer and had to take care of her until she passed away. got told i was worthless because my grades started slipping. depression etc.

now as a young adult i am trying to get it together:
loving myself, setting goals, lose weight, do well in school

unfortunately i have no energy. i guess i just dont care for anything anymore, but i want to! but when i try it takes out so much out of me. i gained weight from the lack of movement and constant sleeping but when i work out i get even more tired. where is the time to study when you are tired after work? where is the time to find out what you love to do if you don't have time or money to try new things? i want so badly to be those annoyingly happy people but i can't force it. i'm so tired. even doing basic things like brushing my teeth and leaving the house for school drain the hel out of me.

6,"**TL;DR:** GAD sufferer looking for any advice: experienced  stressful event accompanied with lots of strong (and unfamiliar) physical symptoms, stressful event is now over but the physical symptoms have increased instead of subsiding. 

(originally posted on r/Anxiety)

Hi,

I'm sorry in advance if this is really long, but I have a lot to say and I don't really know what else to do at this point. I'll try and keep it as brief as possible. I've (18/F) always dealt with GAD, but my problems were mainly mental (rumination, overthinking, etc), with brief bouts of stomach issues that mainly centred around jitters with occasional nausea. In the past month, my anxiety has absolutely skyrocketed to heights that I didn't know were possible, mainly in a physical sense, and I honestly have no idea what to do anymore.

My mother, whom I have quite an (abnormally) strong attachment to, went overseas about a month ago. I reacted badly to this, and was extremely tense, nervous, and inconsolable. For the first week or so, I experienced severe dizziness and brain fog that seemed to be relentless, accompanied with stomach and digestion issues, mainly pain, nausea, diarrhoea, and even vomiting on a few occasions. After the first week that my mother was gone, these issues were still present, yet somewhat subsided and became slightly easier to manage. I think this may be due to me beginning to take a Magnesium supplement, although I can't say for sure. 

Last Saturday, two days before my mother came back, I went out with a few friends and actually had quite an enjoyable night. The aforementioned symptoms were probably the lowest they'd been, yet still present. I drank three Vodka redbulls throughout the course of the night, which is less than my usual amount on a night out, and the second I got home, I started feeling extreme dizziness and nausea, similar to that of my typical hangover. I chalked this up to just needing rest, and these intense feelings of dizziness and nausea did subside to that of what I'd been experiencing in the past few weeks. 

Now fast forward to Monday, two days after the drinking episode, my mother returned from overseas. I was overjoyed, yes, but these symptoms have NOT subsided like I assumed they would. If anything, they are much, much worse now. I wake up every morning extremely dizzy and nauseous, and can do nothing for about an hour except lie in bed, until these feelings subside. They never go away, though, they just reduce in intensity, and I feel them for the whole day. I've had a few (minor) panic attacks, over the past week, I've been struggling to eat properly (I dry heave on most occasions, sometimes throw up, but mainly just can't stomach too much food), my ears ring, my brain is extremely foggy, my body aches and I just overall feel myself in this extremely heightened state of anxiety and stress for no apparent reason. I've tried lots to subside it - meditation, exercise, hanging out with friends, mindfulness, breathing exercises, the Mammalian dive reflex, chamomile and ginger tea, Magnesium supplements - but nothing is giving me relief. I'm stuck in this deadly cycle where I am so scared that I am going to be in this heightened state of anxiety for the rest of my life, and that thinking pattern is what is making my physical symptoms so much more unbearable. I know this, but none of the CBT skills I have learned in therapy or any of my usual coping mechanisms are providing any relief whatsoever. 

Does anyone have any idea whether this will subside at all? Just become more bearable even? Could this be due to a deficiency, since there is no actual stressor going on here? (I had some blood work done on Thursday, and will be getting the results on Monday). Could this be due to that Saturday night, and the drinks, since I was already not in a perfect headspace yet decided to drink? Sorry for the super super long post, but if anyone's actually read this far, I would be so grateful for literally any piece of consolation or advice at this point. ",25Nov2018,1
7,"Throwaway for...pretty obvious reasons. Some details: I'm an older teenage female living with both parents. 

So, my crotch hair has always been incredibly uncomfortable. It's itchy, burns, and been like this for several years. Thought that was normal until I told my friend about it casually and she said it definitely wasn't. Got it checked out by a dermatologist, and the hair down there is both unusually thick/coarse and it grows in a way where it's always rubbing my nether regions. She suggested shaving to relieve the tension, but it didn't go well. I'm not skilled with a razor, and I cut myself up pretty bad. After that, she suggested getting a full bikini wax. I was surprised, but considered my options and I think it's probably the best at to go. I'm not concerned about the pain of waxing or anything-I'm just nervous of how my mom might react to asking.

My mom isn't shy about waxing or the pricing of it. She has me get my eyebrows done monthly. But I don't know how she'd feel about me getting a full pubic/bikini wax. I can't do it without her permission. My fear is that she'll think it's for sexual reasons, but it's literally that I just don't want to be this uncomfortable anymore.

Is there any good way to give my reasons for waxing and convince her of it? ",25Nov2018,1
9,"I'm currently in a school club that is interested in helping the victims of the Camp Fire in whatever way we can; however, we haven't been able to find any info regarding what we, as high schoolers, would be capable of doing (we can't drive up to paradise, for obvious reasons). We normally go to events, go door to door asking for cans, shit like that. Does anyone have info about what exactly the victims need (is it food, clothing, just straight up cash?), where we can direct whatever we get, or any fundraising events happening in the East Bay area? Other ideas would be great too.",25Nov2018,1
10,"Long post. Half venting/half asking advice.

I love my sister to death. I really do. She took off just days after she turned 18 to a big city, started stripping (no judgement, idc honestly, but she’s not being safe about it. She won’t tell anyone where she’s staying. She’s very secretive. Won’t tell anyone who she’s with) No one is surprised she left. She’s one of those people who will blame everyone else for their inconveniences and problems, except for themselves. I’m a little relieved, because she was so nasty to my poor mother and it was heartbreaking to watch. To see a daughter verbally (and sometimes physically) abuse our mother, while my mother just cries and cries. She treated my mom like shit up until the moment she left. And she still treats her like dirt. Refused to even speak to our mom on Thanksgiving while she ate the food my mother worked so hard to cook.


Our entire family has tried to help her and set her on a path that doesn’t lead to self destruction. We’ve all tried talking to her and she refuses to see any kind of reason. She wants to party and have zero responsibilities. She dropped out of high school because it was inconvenient. 


I saw her for the first time in three months during Thanksgiving and it was nice to see her. She didn’t really speak to anyone and kind of isolated herself. She did speak to me once, and it was to ask for money. When I said no, she didn’t speak to me the rest of the night.


The holidays are approaching, and I’m not sure if she’ll be spending it with the family. I’ve gotten mixed answers from her via text. I bought her a few small things at the store today (probably worth $15). I refuse to buy gift cards or give her money. I already know it’s going to turn into an argument about how “I didn’t spend enough on her” or do enough. I had this conversation with my mom, and my mom isn’t going to try very hard to go all out either. Honestly, the only reason I think she’ll show up for the holidays is because she knows people will give her presents. She’s entitled. She’s selfish. The only time she’s ever nice to anyone is when she wants something.


I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I love her, but I’m worried about her. I’m anxious about seeing her for Christmas, because it’s going to end up with me feeling heartbroken that what I can give her isn’t enough. I’m anxious about her making me feel like shit because I can’t afford more. I’m pregnant and I’m short on money as we’re saving up for the baby. 


I feel like I’ve run out of things to say, advice to give. I can’t stand the way she treats our mom. I can’t help but worry about the lifestyle she’s living, especially when she’s keeping secrets and refusing to tell anyone where she is. I don’t know how to keep handling this. I don’t know how to keep from crying every time I see her. She’s turned cold and heartless. I don’t want to push her away from being with her family, but I can’t let her verbally abuse everyone anymore either.

TL;DR: My little sister is a jerk, and I don’t know how to deal with her verbally abusing the entire family. ",25Nov2018,1
11,"I've been mapping it in my head for months and it doesn't go away, so I'm wondering what to do. I haven't studied film but that's always been a passion of mine. Dreaming about making a movie has happened before but never on this scale. It sucks when you have the urge to show something to the world but not the means for it.

12,"(I’ve known this guy for 4 years now but it’s gotten worse within the past year. We’re both high school juniors. Sorry for shitty mobile formatting) I have a friend who always has a snappy remark for whenever I succeed at literally anything. Here’s a few examples: I was talking to some friends and him about how I wasn’t taking trigonometry and almost immediately after he brought up how I had to retake Algebra 1 during the summer of freshman year. 
We both take Mandarin but he is chinese and I am white so despite being in the same class we have a bit of a skill gap and if I get an A or a higher grade than him on an assignment (which is kinda frequent actually) he says I am cheating in the class or says the Chinese teacher prefers me because I’m a laowai (foreigner). 
This ones stupid but it pisses me off so much, we’ll be playing fortnite and he will say I suck because I play on a console while he’s on pc and if I get more kills it’s because of aim assist or kill stealing, but if he kill steals me he just says I’m bad at the game and stuff. Frankly it’s annoying and I want to ask if there’s a reason? He said it was to be funny but nobody laughs. Also if I should talk to him about it or just stop talking to him?

13,"Okay so...my roommate has been gone since Wednesday night. She's 22F and I'm 20F. Friday morning I had a guy over who is in his 40s (I know, messed up, but that's not the point). She knows all about him and has been very supportive in my...decisions. He's been over plenty of times before to hook up but theyve never met, and she's always been fine with it. She's (usually) never home when he comes over...I say usually because she just got fired from her job, so the mornings when he would usually come over, she's here. But we stay in my room and it's always early so it's never gotten in the way of her day. 

Anyway, Friday he came over for some particularly rough sex. She wasn't expected to be home anytime soon so I left my bedroom door open. Towards the end, my phone goes off several times, but I'm quite literally tied up and can't answer. After we finished and start getting cleaned up, she comes flying in the door yelling. We quickly shut my door, and I cover myself to find out what's going on. As she's leaving, she has a handful of clothes and I ask what's up.  She says that I knew she was going to be home at 10am (it was 9:40) and I told her I didn't know and she called me a liar because she announced it in the group chat (she didn't). And then she tells me it's ""her goddamn house"" and she shouldn't have to wait for me to finish getting fucked to come in and that he's not allowed here anymore. I tell her we'll discuss it later and she says ""yeah we will"" and leaves. 

We're both on the lease, all the bills are in my name, but we pay half of everything. I'm particularly angry that she said it was ""her goddamn house"". I'm pretty easy going and don't get upset with her too often even though her best friend is over all the time and they like to get high almost every night (which resulted in the cops watching our apartment). I didn't even say anything when she rearranged the apartment without asking me, which upset me a lot but I decided it wasn't worth arguing about. 

I just don't know how to handle this. I haven't spoken to her/seen her since Friday and I've noticed several things around the apartment of hers missing. I'm annoyed because she hasn't given us the opportunity to talk through this. I feel like if the tables were turned, I wouldn't be as upset, and I definitely don't think this one time mistake is something to ruin a friendship over. We've never even been in a fight before and we've been living here about 5 months. Everything has been great up until now. I don't like arguing, I like to talk through it and see what we can both do to fix the problem and keep it from happening again, but she gets explosive and pretty over dramatic. She's told me at least 5 times since we've been living together that she has no problem ""dropping [her best friend]"" even though she never does/will. 

How do I approach this without escalating the situation?

TL;DR roommate and I are in a fight cause she walked in on me having rough sex and I haven't seen or spoken to her since Friday.",25Nov2018,1
14,"So ever since I entered high school, I've started to realize that I don't have a passion for anything. I'm not interested in any classes, subjects, or really anything that I'm doing. I used to have hobbies like sports and playing instruments, but I've stopped doing them after I began high school in order to focus on my studies. Even then, I wasn't super interested in them, or at least interested enough to prioritize it over school. I'm in some clubs, and their mostly just competitive academic clubs so to me it's just like more schoolwork. 

The only things I enjoy doing is basically just watching TV shows, but it's not productive/will help me in the future. 

So how can I find my passion? Especially since I'm closer and closer to graduating, I feel pressured to know what I want to major in/have a career in in the future. I know I still have time and don't need to rush, but I feel like I'm not really living life since I'm not interested in anything that I'm doing. ",25Nov2018,1
16,"I'm not sure where to post this or if this is even big enough of a deal to post. I (23f) work at a small local bar in my city. Because the bar is so small, I or my other two coworkers in their 30s (one female and one male) are often working and even closing alone. A couple of nights ago my female coworker was followed home and was brutally attacked and possibly raped by a customer. She is covered in bruises and even has rings around her neck from being strangled. She has told our boss, but due to the sensitive nature of what happened to her, she is refusing to go in to details and we are nervous to push her into telling us more. She also doesn't want to contact the police. 
With our male coworker currently out of town and my female coworker obviously taking much needed time off, I'm left working and closing the bar on my own for the time being.

I'm scared that I'm now in danger due to what happened. Is there any sort of legal action I can take to report what happened to my coworker in hopes that whoever did this can be caught?  What steps should I take to protect myself? Shouldn't my boss be doing something more into investigating this?

I just feel like this whole event is being blown over when I feel like my life could be threatened any day.

20,"In high school (middle school) I got bullied and some other bad stuff happened, I don’t want to get too much into the details. After, and partly during, I suffered from depression and PTSD. It was really bad, I went through therapy for years and only recently it got better. I went to another high school after the bullying got too bad and I didn’t have to see those kids again. 

I started going to college and it’s been going fine. I was worried of not being accepted (the bullying still leaves its marks) but there were some really nice people in my classes. 

Last Friday when I was about to enter the building for my last class of the week, I saw a guy from my old high school standing there. I didn’t acknowledge him and went inside, hundreds, maybe thousands, of kids have classes there and I hadn’t seen him the last few weeks so I thought I had nothing to worry about. I sat down in the auditorium and about two minutes before the class was going to start, that guy sits down in the row in front of me. He hadn’t seen me by then but there’s no way he didn’t see me later. He didn’t say anything to me and I didn’t say anything either. I’m kind of glad we didn’t talk because I don’t know if I could’ve handled it but I also kind of wish he had said something to break the tension.

He wasn’t one of the kids who actively bullied me but we have a weird history and his best friends were some of the ones who did the worst bullying. I don’t hate him but I have no idea how he feels about me, I know that there were a lot of nasty rumours about me going around. Now, the fact that I don’t hate him doesn’t mean it does nothing to me to see him right in front of me. It’s quite a big trigger and even though I didn’t want him to get to me, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him and I’m scared to go to that class next Friday.

I’d really like some advice on how to handle this. Should I confront him next week, or at least acknowledge him? Do I ignore him? I have no idea what’s best for me. If it gets worse in the next week, I’ll consider going back to my old therapist for advice but I don’t want to do that too soon.

Sorry for the long post, I am just not feeling too good and I really don’t know what to do. Seeing him made it all come back and I wasn’t prepared for this. ",25Nov2018,1

25,"If your sibling had banned your spouse, the father of your child, from visiting their house, would you let your child go there? 

 Spoiler includes details of family situation. Throw away account. I want to know other peoples thoughts on this situation. 

&gt;!People involved:!&lt;

* &gt;!Me, people pleaser!&lt;
* &gt;!Husband (Jason), keeps to himself, which people often mistake as being prickly. Isn't afraid to call people out on their BS, doesn't because he knows it'll cause me grief !&lt;
* &gt;!Sister (Gwen) known as the family drama queen!&lt;
* &gt;!Brother in law/Sisters husband (Tom) a bit of a yapping dog in the background!&lt;
* &gt;!Daughter (Ariel \[4\])!&lt;

&gt;!My husband and sister haven't ever really gotten along with each other. It's recently exploded in a dramatic fashion.!&lt;

&gt;!Rough background: Gwen refuses to allow Jason over her house, due to a recent -set- of arguments where Gwen refused to see her part in instigating the entire thing. As a result Jason said some things to Gwen that hit home, (the kind of thing that people always want to say, but it's rude, so you don't) he's since apologised for and stopped having anything to do with her. !&lt;

&gt;!Gwen demanded an apology, fair enough he threw in some pretty hectic insults and apologised for them. !&lt;

&gt;!She got it and now refuses to accept it, claiming it's lip service. !&lt;

&gt;!Since the big argument/apology, they've been in the same room while we dropped off our daughter (my husbands suggestion, so that Gwen can see Ariel, since it'd been a while), they'd spoken to each other while playing online w/ others (Raiding in Warcraft). Also had a family function, where they amicably ignored each other.!&lt;

&gt;!Meanwhile Tom said things during said argument, apologised for them. Then continues to stir the pot, by shouting things out in the background whenever I'm on the phone to my sister. !&lt;

&gt;!Seemingly out of the blue, Gwen says that Jason isn't allowed over her house any more because she 'just can't', doesn't want him around her. He hadn't done anything since the apology and was actively trying to move on. Gwen is now wanting to see Jason's actions change (??) before wanting anything more to do with him. !&lt;

&gt;!However, she's blocked him on everything and refuses to be in the same room as him. Including her house. Her call. As long as they're polite to each other in public, I honestly don't give a rats who she lets over her house and who she doesn't. !&lt;

&gt;!Gwen however, wants to see our daughter, at her house. I've said to Gwen that she is welcome to come to our house to see our daughter (which she's done, while my husband was here), or take our daughter out. However, she's not able to take Ariel to her place, while Jason is not allowed from her place. !&lt;

&gt;!Gwen has said that I'm using Ariel as a weapon and pushing her away, because I'm not allowing Ariel to go somewhere her father isn't allowed to go. She thinks I'm being flippant, because she can pick Ariel up and drop her off again, that Jason doesn't need to be involved. Jason could go the rest of his life and have nothing to do with Gwen and he'd not be fussed however, he knows that our daughter enjoys Gwen's company. We both agree that Ariel isn't allowed over Gwen's house, if Jason isn't.!&lt;

26,"So, long backstory, three years ago I quit smoking weed after having smoked for 12 years, 10 of those as a daily smoker. Quitting coincided with me getting out of a long term relationship and trying to get my financials under control. The main reason I quit was finances. Surprisingly, I didn't even miss it and still don't. The weird thing is, when I have tried to smoke since I quit, I lose it. I get all panicky and anxious and skin crawly and I do not like it. This has been frustrating as I really enjoyed smoking and never understand people who would freak out after smoking. But all in all, I'm glad I don't smoke anymore. 

The ending of the long term relationship was really tough and lonely, I had lost a lot of friends and my family had moved away and then I started working overnights so I wound up drinking a lot in a misguided effort to not feel so lonely. I jumped into a new relationship and started caring for my ailing father as he developed dementia. My depression got really bad and the new bf dumped me out of the blue. Two months later my dad died. I pretty much went off the deep end after that. Casual sex, drinking, overspending, etc. I eventually got a daytime job with regular hours and a set schedule and pulled it back together. Now a year later I'm emotionally closed off but not drinking anymore. 

Back to current events, my grandma just passed away (on thanksgiving which was also my little sisters birthday, can this damn family catch a break?) I will be seeing my cousins for the first time in about 2 years and they can't seem to understand that I do not want to smoke weed. Or eat edibles. Or do oils. Or get shit faced drunk. I plan on spending the time I am there helping my aunt close up the house and get things sorted out and listen to stories about my grandma from relatives. It kind of pisses me off that my cousins are acting like this is a time to be partying. So without being an asshole, how do I get them to just accept that I don't want to smoke weed or get drunk?

Sorry for the rant!

tl;dr: I've had a rough couple of years and I've stopped drinking and getting high and now my cousins are pressuring me to smoke during a family get together for a funeral. How do I tell them to fuck off",25Nov2018,1
27,"So i'm gonna preface this by story by saying that me and my best friend of two years hang out every weekend. I am very close with her family to the point where her parents refer to me as their child. I'm three years older than her and have always been as patient as possible when it comes to her lack of maturity. The majority of the time we get along great but more often than not she will do things that I consider to be very questionable, resulting in me getting angry but never bringing it up. As an example she will openly tell people that she is selfish and is proud of it, has rated my looks on a scale of 1-10, told me that when it comes to attracting guys that she doesn't want to be around me because ""You have the body"", requires me to text her everyday for multiple hours or she gets insecure, always has to know everything that I'm doing, and gets jealous for no reason. This makes her out to sound really terrible but most of the time she is fine. Although I am currently struggling with the realization that I may be allowing her to treat me poorly under the guise of friendship. 2 days ago I came over to her house and she said she was feeling a bit sick but insisted she didn't have a cold. I have been described by many as being the 'mom friend', so I immediately made her a warm drink and did whatever I could to ease her sore throat. The same night she told me that she would be hanging out with a different friend over the weekend, which I really didn't care about at all, from my perspective she is free to do as wants. On the day that she was getting together with this friend I came down with the exact same symptoms that she had, quickly realizing that I had gotten her cold. To me this was not a big deal, no hard feelings. But I can't help but feel frustrated that she got me sick so I can't do anything the whole weekend, and then blew me off right before I thought we were going to hang out. So I'm sitting at home realizing that the past days have been me checking up on her to see if she's feeling better, to her giving me her cold and then not even bothering to ask if I'm okay even once. In my opinion everything in friendships should be fair. If I got her sick I would be checking up and taking care of her while feeling incredibly guilty, if I told her the night before we were supposed to hang out that I couldn't she would be pissed at me. I understand that you can't expect things from people but in my mind this might be the last straw of her selfishness. It's also to be noted that between my mom, my sister, and everyone who has heard how she treats me they all encourage me to stay away from her. I'm starting to think they're right but I would like a completely unbiased opinion, as I don't want to be oversensitive or impulsive in the situation. Any advice is very much appreciated.",25Nov2018,1

29,"I realise that this advice ask is from a huge place of privilege but I just don’t know who to ask about this and my mental health and anxiety is fucked up and I have some intense run away feelings. 

I am financially fortunate entirely down to losing people in my life who were financially responsible human beings and cared a lot about my welfare after they were gone. 

So I’m at this weird point where I’m 28 and have finally started confronting my depression and anxiety. I used to be able to gage my level of not okay based on my “run away” feelings, when I was a teenager this formed itself in fantasising over zombie apocalypses but now it’s a feeling of wanting to escape that is quite prevalent all of the time, despite being technically very happy. I have more money than I need, which genuinely disgusts me, have a partner who I adore even though things aren’t perfect and have started working this year at the company I’ve wanted to work for for 10 years. I am so so aware that it’s my fucked up head but so so frequently I just get the feeling of wanting to run away, from my living situation from my partner from my friends from my life. It would be easy if I wanted to start over and I guess that adds another whole layer of ridiculousness, is that I could afford to just be completely crazy if I wanted to. 

I don’t know what advice I want. I just need to hear people’s perspectives I guess. I can’t talk to friends about this because no one understands the money perspective ",25Nov2018,1

31,"Me and this girl who i never really spoke to (i guess we were acquaintances) had paired up for a bio project and we hung out two nights previously leading up to the party working on our project. She came to see me at work the day of the party and invited me. We were all having a good time and she kept saying “oh my god im not gonna remember any of this” and i was just as drunk as she was but as the night progressed we started being more touchy feely but nothing crazy but definitely more than i would with someone who i would have normally just met. Then we were sitting on the ground leaning on a couch when i made a move i rolled her unto her back we were just face to face talking and she went to kiss me and we made out on the floor in-front of everyone (yes i know that was a rough idea considering i only knew 3 out of the 20 people who were there, meaning all the others were people i had met only hours before, but now im on the ground with one their friends). Then someone called her so we acted like nothing happened and she hopped up and ran into the kitchen. I just sat in the living room on the ground with all these new people looking at me though it wasnt that awkward since it was a lame highschool “hangout”. 

After a few minutes i went into the bathroom and i heard her say “hes a cool dude” to her friends and i guess they never expected something like this to come from her and frankly i didn’t expect it in myself either. But the night continued we flirted a lot i found myself being seriously and i dont know how to say it “suggestively touchy” not grouping or anything but im sure you get the idea, but i was much more intimate and intentional than i had ever been with a partner. We kissed two more times after this and she kept repeating “oh my god im not gonna remember anything” and I remember my corny highschool ass saying “i want to remember this” which definitely wasnt a good considering i didnt have any preconceived “feelings” for her other than friendly ones. 

The next morning i had to leave for work around 6:55 so i was awake and gone before everyone else at the house. I texted her and was just talking how tired i was because i had a double shift coming up and she was usually dry and plain in her conversation leading me to believe that either she didn’t remember what happened and her friends told her, or she remembered everything. But she left me on read earlier which is something she hadnt ever done perviously so i suspect shes pretty embarrassed but i dont really think what happened meant anything atleast to me i dont really view our relationship any differently we were just drunk and dumb teenagers not to say i didnt “have fun” i was a drunk teenage boy after all im just worried that it may have ruined the young relationship we had shes a super cool girl and I definitely viewed her as a friend. I know there isnt much or anything i can really do but i was just wondering if anyone had any advice or any experiences that were similar. 


Ps. Yes this whole post is riddled with immaturity but what did you really expect from the title. 
Also I really love reddit i think just getting my feelings and thoughts in the open on here helps me work these things out.

My two friends that I just met a couple months ago at school have talked about buying eachother christmas gifts. One told me that they’ve already bought me a gift.

38,"Finished in June from Glasgow uni, I’m American. Got my MA in linguistics and am now looking to further my education. I’m only 21 so I feel like I have so many options and avenues open to me that it’s actually overwhelming me and causing me to get anxiety. 

I know I want to make a difference in the world and help people who don’t have a voice in society. Longterm I’d like to go into politics, to that effect I’m applying to public policy, public administration and international relations courses at USC, UCLA, Harvard and NYU. 

In addition to that I’m applying to film school at SC, UCLA and NYU. I feel an urge to go to the big city and make something of myself, get famous and be remembered. Paris, London, NYC, LA etc. Idk how much of this is me wanting to do it or the fact I saw Fantastic Beasts the other day and have a massive crush on Alison Sudol and that just motivated me to want to get into showbiz lol.

I do have experience with filmmaking however as I am a youtuber focusing on US/U.K. culture and travel content which usually includes cinematic B Roll. So I know my way around a camera, editing software, have an eye for scenes etc.

Success is not necessarily fame and happiness isn’t fake necessarily, I get that, but still I feel drawn to do that as if I’m meant to be something big. I’ve felt like this for years really. GRE scores are really solid and GPA is solid too so I should be a lock for the public policy courses assuming I do a good personal statement. That said I guess it’s really just a case of what I want to do in life.

I’m also applying to jobs back in the UK but obviously as a non eu person I’m at a disadvantage so that’s been going slow.

41,"  

Per the title, I'm a 29 going on 30 y/o male and am coming to terms with an extremely toxic pattern of behavior that has persisted throughout my life. My parents are hindering my progress in life and I don't know what to do about it. This is part of a series of posts I'm putting up on several subs to ask for help, since I currently have no friends and nobody to talk to but am finally seeing the light on how fucked up my life is.

For some backstory: we're a Spanish-speaking family in a major US city. A few things happened in the 1990's: we came to the US (mother, father, myself), 2 more kids were born (boy, girl), both were diagnosed with severe autism (at the time just called severe retardation by the therapist), the girl spent 4 years battling cancer beginning at age 3, and severe financial difficulties persisted due to my father's inability to keep a job (he refused to learn English. He still refuses). We lived on food stamps and other handouts for a while but for the most part always had a place to live and didn't go hungry too often.

Since then my parents basically lost their minds. I grew up being physically abused (punched in the teeth, hit with sticks, belts, nearby blunt objects) and under fear of any act that could be construed as disobedience. The first time I went out with friends past 10PM when I was 17, my father waited at home and we got into a physical altercation that included him throwing a chair at me and me having to defend myself with a nearby frying pan. I began stealing report cards at school and either forging my own, showing them a friend's grades, or hiding the fact there were report cards at all whenever I got any grade below an A, since that would also elicit a violent response. Until I left for college at age 20, I wasn't able to go outside unless for school or work and was under constant surveillance. I never had a private space until I moved out either, as my parents said I should share a room with my brother, and they used this situation to constantly monitor us.

They also view us as tools: if I can't or refuse to help with something, then it's my fault and I'm the guilty party. My father refused to learn English because he believed (and still believes) that I should translate everything for him. At age 13, I was the subject of physical and verbal abuse because I couldn't figure out how to illegally hack software he wanted to use to unlock cell phones and make money. He bought thousands of dollars in computer equipment with the thinking that if I play video games, I must be able to hack the software and he'd be able to get rich. He uses my autistic brother as a servant to fetch his shoes, get him food and water, and do whatever else he doesn't feel like doing when he's watching baseball, which is the only activity he ever partakes in. It's also the only thing we can do as well, since we're not allowed to do anything else or he'll go off the handle in a fit of rage; my mother has no friends and hasn't participated in any activity outside the house whatsoever in my lifetime, and I'm forced to keep the fact I have friends a secret and can't talk about anything I do outside work, lest I be the subject of a tirade of jealous remarks about how I don't make time for him.

My mother is essentially a prisoner: she's too afraid to rock the boat, and she just wants to have nice moments, so she just tells me to keep the peace and not stir him up, and she coddles the kids into doing what he asks. When I try to bring up the topic of ""doing something about this situation,"" she gets defensive and starts saying ""it's too late in the game to do anything about him,"" and ""he's old and sick now so we should let him have what he wants,"" and she will commiserate endlessly and say she understands and yada yada but there's nothing we can do about it so we should pretend everything is fine.

This post could be much, much longer than it already is (and will be), as there's a history of abuse in my cousin's family as well (she and I were very close growing up) and our fathers are very similar. Our mothers are polar opposites however the family dynamics and health issues remain the same (alcoholic fathers, her brother is mildly autistic as well, both of us faced similar pressures).

This leads to my adult life. After finally ghosting the dysfunctional group of friends I grew up with (who are all jobless, on drugs, or caught in a tax evasion scheme set up by their parents), I have had ample time to reflect on my life. That was in January, and I've spent the past year virtually alone and to myself. I've had a lot of time to think and I've begun posting on other subs for help/advice about my social issues and what I don't understand about the world, which is a lot. I'm professionally somewhat successful, making $100k in a major city. But I struggle to move forward due to continued harassment by my parents. They want me to spend every Sunday with them, and if I stop showing up then they'll come to my apartment, which interferes with my life not least because the space is tiny, but also because I have roommates and because I need the time and space to do my work. I have little to no social life due to professional exams and a second degree I'm pursuing which leaves me with no time to go out, but my parents want me to spend time with them on weekends despite this and without care for the fact that I'm falling behind in my professional life. I'm in a very competitive area of financial services and am more than just an underdog given my lack of pedigree.

Today, I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to fail a big exam coming up next Saturday yet again. I've tried to take it once per year for the last 6 years (paying $1000 each time), but between the 4,000 pages of material I need to cover (which changes slightly every year), working 50-60+ hours weekly, and needing to visit my parents every Sunday (which should be de-facto study time), today I've just given up after hitting a mental barrier and realizing that I'm not going to pass yet again. This year, my parents had an assortment of plots that drained time away from me: mystery illness from my mother that at first had her in the ER then randomly disappeared and showed no signs in X-rays or EKG; randomly getting married, officially, at church with 2-weeks advance notice that I needed to be there to be a witness (I live 1.5 hours away); wanting ""help"" to figure out how to buy a house (which I now know they have no intention of doing since they're blowing all their money on 3+ week trips to their home country); spending 3+ hours on the phone with them if I don't visit. Frankly, my life consists of work, study, parents.

I recognize that I could simply get a less competitive job, settle for something easier, work less, fall behind, etc. but that leaves another problem on the table: my siblings have no plan for the future and my parents have no money or assets saved up to care for them when they're unable to do so. They've invested nothing into mitigating their disabilities and my siblings are unable to even shower without supervision, much less ever have a life of their own. When my parents die, I hope to be able to afford assisted living for the kids somewhere, along with a good life for myself and my own future family.

What I wonder is very simple. What would you do, given these circumstances? Would you ghost entirely? Would you proceed as things are? My plan is to move someplace when my lease expires and not tell them where I live. In the past, my father has called the police to find me when I refuse to answer his phone calls, but I don't think that would go very far now that I'm older. I plan to move someplace new, not say where I am, and selectively engage them during the year. Is this correct? Has anyone dealt with anything like this before?",25Nov2018,1
42,"I need some advise on what to do, please. 

So my friend and I started going to this bar less than a month ago. Now, this isn’t just any bar. This is a very well known sports/arcade/bar type of bar. (I will not disclose the name of the place) 

My friend and I both drive for lyft on the weekends. When he and I are both done driving for the night, we will stop into this place and have a beer. (No we do not continue to drive for lyft)

Let me paint a picture- 
There’s this bartender... we will call her Mel. Mel is a very pretty girl who is very nice as well as social...as you would want any bartender to be. So my friend and I are also very social people so we like to strike up conversations with the bartenders. We go there quite a bit so why not get to know them. 

This is where it started— My friend and I went in last weekend to this bar. I got there first so I started with my beer. By the time my friend got there I was just about done with my beer so I mentioned to him- hey there’s another bar upstairs, let’s go up there... I’ll show you the bowling alley also. So he says ok let’s go. I said hang on let me close my tab. Mel was standing next to her coworker and just as I was about to get Mel’s attention she turned around and I said we’re going upstairs, I need to close my tab. She discretely waves her hand low so her coworker doesn’t see and mouths “just go, I got it”. So I said, ok...  I thought it was sweet. 
Later my friend and I made our way back downstairs we order more beers from Mel. Again! I was about to close my tab because it was last call when she said “Oh you’re good. They closed my till out” 
My friend and I were not happy about that. The beers at this place are $6 each. She just gave us away 4 beers total. 

My friend and I go back last night and again the same thing! Except this time we order 4 beers and she charges us for 2. So now we’re at 6 beers. $36 dollars....to me that’s a lot of money... and to me that is stealing. I’m going to assume they do an inventory and see how many beers have been sold then count the beers in the cooler? 🤷🏼‍♀️ We also saw her make a drink for a friend and gave him so much liquor for a drink that didn’t even require that much liquor... you know how I know that... she looked at my friend and I and said “shhh” then laughed. 

So my friend and I have a plan of giving her the money and she can do with it as she pleases. We just want our conscious cleared. We also don’t want her to think we come in for free beers because we don’t. We pay our tab and tip the other bartenders. It makes us uncomfortable and makes us not what to go there, which is unfortunate because we really enjoy going there a lot. There’s this other bartender we really like... the music is always super good because of the DJ on the weekends. I’d hate to stop going because this girl can’t stop stealing.


So my question is- what do you guys think? What would you guys do in this situation? 

I was also reading on this website about bartenders who do these tricky things to give people free beers/shots then pocket the money. I don’t know her personally but what my friend and I gathered, there’s something going on with her. Idk. She’s young, covered in tattoos and just doesn’t give a f*** I guess. ",25Nov2018,1

46,"As a child my family was extremely dirt poor and as such has left me with problems of self control. Mainly concerning fast food. Now that I’m an adult and can “afford” it I find myself always reaching for my car keys even when I’m not really hungry.

I feel like garbage because I have no self control to stop eating out and making bad food choices in general, and even though I’ve been paying for a gym membership for the past 2 years I’ve probably only gone a handful of times. I just got engaged and the thought of me looking like this on my wedding day terrifies me to my core. I really need advice on how to kick myself in the ass and learn to control my bad habits and start working out.

47,"So I decided to go back to Nevada to see my family for Thanksgivings and I thought nothing of it. I flew out about a week ago and scheduled to leave today. I was feeling good hanging out with my family before yesterday I got a major ear infection. It was bad, but I thought it would be gone before the flight today. So I wake up today and it wasn’t... not wanting to reschedule and go through that hassle I decided to power through it and go. About halfway through the flight my ears started to clog up.

48,"She's older than us by 5/6 years, mainly because she's a regular at a place I work-time. He is a quiet type of person. He exercises, but he would rather stay at home or quiet places, in his own alone time, and read books. She is a HUGE party animal, and she has an incredible alcohol tolerance. The other one time at a colleague's wedding, she drank 5 glasses, and then proceeded to the after party where she drank even more. My classmate? He doesn't drink, at all. Not for religion purposes, but he also does NOT like partying. She is also INCREDIBLY rich, branded bags, designer dresses, while my classmate and I are poor college students hence working part-time. 

It is probably me trying to force my opinions on him, which is why I have not spoken to him about her. I have got no clue how is it going to turn out, but I feel like the relationship might take a potentially drastic turn because of their completely different personalities. What should I do?

49,"I've suffered depression for ten years, between that and life being a b\*tch I now find myself with no life, no friends, no hobbies - trying to find hobbies/interests when you're depressed is difficult, trying to make friends when you've no hobbies to connect with others and when you're the depressed chick with no life is even more difficult.   


In short I'm boring, so much so I bore myself - how can I expect to make friends when I'm this boring?   


It's not just the practicality of finding hobbies and ways to meet people, which is stunted by a lack of money and I also think not having friends limits your ability to meet people a lot too, but all I do is sit in front of my laptop refreshing the same handful of sites.

51,"My good friend is getting married in just over a year. I'm a bridesmaid. However ever she asked me she's said things like you need to save money for my wedding/party! The wedding and bachelorette are both far away for me so it will be a costly plane ticket. The party is going to be a destination so it's flight to party, flight to her wedding and flight home. This is all over the holidays next year so tickets are always is jacked up then. I also spend holidays with my fam so this is another flight. 

Anyway I told her that it stresses me out when she says to save money. And she got super defensive and says that she says it to everyone and stuff. And I'm like i am saying something now so it doesn't get worse and I'm letting you know how I feel about saving money. I mean she is the one getting married! It's not like it's a luxury vacation that we are going on together. 

I want to be in the wedding but I'm worried she's going to just get worse and ask me to buy a crazy expensive dress. I don't even know where I am going to be in a year (I might move/get new job) and I can't make all my plans around another person's wedding no matter how close we are. But I still want to support her but she doesn't seem to respect my boundaries.  I'm afraid of losing the friendship if this continues. I know she is excited but it's just a wedding and I can't go into debt for this nor is it my only savings. Also I shouldn't have to save that much for it! I'm not getting married. She is also getting financial support for this too..

52,"They’ve been married for 25 years, and I’m their 19 year old daughter. My dad has always had a problem with his temper and gets worked up really easily. Years ago, he started an antidepressant but quit taking it and won’t go to therapy. He’ll start yelling, sometimes he takes his anger out on inanimate objects. For example, his laptop wasn’t working so he ended up throwing it to the ground and breaking it. However, he has NEVER hit any of us. Not once. He just yells a lot and can’t control his anger. He told me once that it’s like he sees red and he can’t control it. His yelling doesn’t usually consist of a whole lot of name calling, so I wouldn’t exactly call it abusive. But just now my dad was once again yelling at my mom about their finances and threatening to take her credit card away. They say they love each other, but my mom doesn’t deserve this. I don’t want to start any problems, but I’m wondering if I should pull my mom aside and ask if she’s truly happy and that it’s ok if she wants to leave.

I've been clear from these issued for 3-4 years.

Now to the issue at hand. They are back and only started since meeting and hanging around with this particular girl. Her friends often tell me shes interested in me but I'm not one to rush into a relationship. By no means am i emotionally involved in this person, I'm not in love and we are not dating. Yet but she has been on my mind in a weird way, worrying about her issues instead of my own and alike. This would be understandable if i was in love with this woman on some kind of level but i dont feel like i am at all. Yet i find myself having massive panic attacks if i say something incorrect to her, anxiety attacks because of her general worries that she has told me about and huge nerves before we meet from time to time.

What is going on? How can i make these attacks stop? my work (self employed) requires a lot of driving and i often have to pull over for water and that just to attempt to calm my anxiety. I have been care free for years why has all this returned since meeting her? Despite having no real attachment to her.",25Nov2018,1

There’s this girl I like. We’ve snapped each other for a while, both are in college, and known each other since high school. 

It’s weird though. She’s like 2 diff people in person and while texting. She also knows I like her. It’s like, in person she seems happy to see me and stuff. We run into each other pretty often. We talk, she seems into it, sometimes she comes up to me. 

Texting is a whole different story. Idk, she posts to her story, is active on IG, yet she takes anywhere from 12 hrs to 2 days to get back to me on anything. Sometimes it’s more though than others. Other times it’s like, “yep” or “uh huh” when it has nothing to do with what we were talking about.

Normally I’d be like “yep she just doesn’t wanna see me” but then she goes and pulls a 180 with me in person. I just don’t know what to think. 

The issue I have though is that she just doesn’t even say stuff like “I’m busy rn”. It’s like derivative “uh huhs” and other two word responses. 

I just don’t know what to think of it. It’s not like some girl who doesn’t know I exist. We’ve known each other for a while. I don’t know. I’m not about to just up and stop texting, but I just don’t know how I’d go about handling this.

My mother's taxes have caused a huge debaccle this year, first she had an incompetent accountant do them causing her to pay a ridiculous amount in taxes. Now, the Canada Revenue Agency is asking for supporting documentation that she WAS the benficiary for my dad's retirement accounts and I cannot find any. I am freaking out and I have no plan of action.  My mom is mentally ill and a very poor record keeper, I do what I can but I can't control what she does with letters she receives when I'm not home, etc. (We do have an accountant who is involved, but I am still freaking the fuck out about this.)

I can't find any documentation from the Insurance Company saying that she's the beneficiary of the RRSP, BUT I did find the letter she received upon the transfer of the RRSP to her. The letter has an account number at the top for my dad's insurance company. Even though he's been dead for almost 2 years, can my mother call the insurance company quoting the account number (and all other relevant info) and receive documentation stating that she was the beneficiary of that particular account? Would the insurance company have a record of this after 2 years? 

I've tried to search for answers online, but I am going through a true anxiety spiral trying to deal with this.

I don't know if I should go to a more astute college/university like the ones I listed above, or a less expensive, less competitive, more chill place. Specifically, I am seriously considering Hofstra as a jumping off point; It is in a city, is cheap and isn't hard to get into (~60% acceptance rate).

Is it smart to save up for the school I'm getting most of my education for as apposed to my first school?

To couple that, I also ended up getting a job where we had very lax supervisors and our only task was calling a set number of people to make appointments and pretty much the rest was banter.

My family consists of me, my husband, and our son, so when gifts are exchanged between us, there's an obvious unbalance when it comes to family size. At the moment, we are poor students and don't really have much to give for Christmas, but we really want to do at least a little something for them. But how can you do small gifts for that many kids of the same family without them feeling like they all just got the same generic gift?

Note, my sister doesn't expect us to get huge things, and even though we say to keep it simple, they always end up giving us nice gifts around the holidays as well as birthdays. We don't live close by anymore and don't get to see each other for the holidays, but we'd still like them to know we care and appreciate them.

I started hanging out with him a few months ago and he asked if I wanted to be his groomsman for his wedding and I agreed and sorted things out with his fiance.

Now we haven't been talking much again since then and I'm thinking I want to cancel because I can't really afford to do all this wedding stuff eg. Suit, bucks party etc they are very pushy people and will either make a big fuss over it or will keep pushing to try to get me to come saying that they will pay for the stuff.

Problem with that is they are in a worse financial position than I am but they are stupid with money which is the problem because me saying I can't afford it won't be a good enough reason for them and it will probably cause alot of problems with the friendship.

Basically just want some advice on what I could say to make it understandable for them

73,"Recently (after about a year of not speaking due to drifting apart), one of my college friends got in touch with me asking if I wanted to hang out. I was happy to hear from them and said sure and asked when we could hang out. She suggested a day, and we casually agreed on it, but didn't actually arrange a time or place to meet. 

So when the day came I was expecting my friend to message me to arrange the meeting time/place, but I never heard from her. I kind of just assumed she'd forgotten or was busy and left it at that.  In hindsight I think I should have messaged her, but I didn't :(

Anyway, that was around a week and a half ago. Still haven't heard from her and now I'm wondering if I actually might have been in the wrong. Should I have made an effort to make the plans more solid? 

I was thinking of messaging her now to say ""hey man, thought we were gonna hang out what happened?"" or something. Would that be weird after 2 weeks? I also know she is busy with college and since we aren't close anymore I feel kind of awkward and annoying. But I do want to reconnect with her.

81,"This is about to be a long story. 

I have grown up with this girl, Jessica, since i was 2 years old and she was 3 years old. She is a year older than me and is a senior in high school, whereas i am a junior. We are best friends and practically sisters. We have had our ups and downs, but ultimately it makes our relationship stronger.

My freshman year of high school, I remember seeing this boy, Xander, in my gym class. For some reason, I remember feeling something whenever I would see him. I was a shy freshman and he was an athletic outgoing junior, so i forgot about this feeling as soon as it passed.

Fast forward to my sophomore year of high school, I was in my speech class. There was this girl named Vicky in my class. Sometimes Xander would come into my class to sit with Vicky, his girlfriend at the time. I remember telling my friend in a joking manner that Xander was the only one for me. Vicky and him broke up a year later because she moved to France for fashion school.

Now this year is my junior year of high school. The summer before this year started, I remember my best friend told me that she met this friend, a college dude who was apparently really nice. When she showed me a picture, I almost died. It was Xander. Note... he

They started hanging out a lot in groups. The group would be Jessica (best friend), Priya (good friend), Sam (Xander's good friend), and Xander. She would invite me, but I had so many things to study for I just couldn't. Finally, it was Sachika's birthday. So all of us decided to go to a Hookah bar. That was the first time I had met Sam and Xander.

Sam was really nice and it was obivous to me that Xander was into Jessica, cause shes gorgeous. 

Sam, Xander, Priya, Jessica, and I became a really tight group of friends. Then something happened. Jessica and Xander kissed when they were drunk. Jessica started really liking Xander. They kept making out when they were drunk... in front of us. The thing is, they never mad out together when they were sober. Jessica got so frustrated because Xander never talked about them as a couple.

One day, Jessica came to my house and was crying. She told me that Xander is moving to New York in 6 months for college. She asked me to ask Xander about their ""relationship"". I went to Xander's house and asked him what was going on. He basically said that he should have never kissed Jessica and that he did not want to date her. 

I went back and told Jessica that he does not wanna be with her because he is moving, which he is.

For the next three weeks, they had been really tense. I had to be mediator. Finally, they agreed to be friends. Soon after, they were 100% platonic and Jessica got over her feelings.

A month after, everyone got drunk again. There were not enough seats for everyone in front of the fireplace. I had to share with somebody. No one would share except for Xander, so I was sitting in a small chair very close to Xander. I ended up passing out soon after. An hour later, I woke up to someone kissing my neck. It was FUCKING Xander. I was too drunk to care and ended up passing out again. 

3 days later, I texted Xander. I told him that we should forget it happened and to never tell Jessica. He completely agreed. 

The week after, we all decided to go out and get drunk. Me and Xander ended up separate form the group due to some circumstances. We ended up making out.

This kept happening when we were drunk.... until it happened when we were sober. We kept making out when we were sober too. I knew that this was SOO wrong, but it felt so right.

I thought that he just wanted friends with benefits and I was honestly okay with that, until I wasn't. I started liking him and I was trying to stop.

I got so wasted and I ended up telling him that I liked him. I was waiting for rejection, but I got something else. He told me that he likes me and wants to be with me. I did not know what to do. Drunk me decided to kiss him and lose my virginity to him in a fucking car.

Two days later, we talked about it. He told me that he wanted to be with me, but it had to be in secret because of Jessica. I said okay. 

2 weeks into dating, I get a text from Jessica. She is very suspicious of us and very angry. I ended up calming her, but I felt terribly guilty, as I should. I told Xander. He basically broke up with me because of his guilt. He felt as though he was getting between a 15 year friendship.

The next day.... me and Xander went to the lake. He was still acting as tho we were together. He was holding my hand and kissing me and saying sweet nothings. I was so confused. I tried to talk about it to him, but he just avoids the topic. 

What the fuck should I do?

About his exes/love.

I'm pretty sure his exes are not interested in him anymore, he is sick ( has a chronic condition) so in the first place is why he was alone when I met him, I know his exes and I can be 100% is not because he is back with one of em or have a thing with a women ( he is ugly and poor and has a kid) 
 
His chronic situation:

He got surgery for helping about his pain, it didn't work, he is on strong pills for calm the pain, due to his condition he developed anxiety, he is so open about what he feels and he spends a lot of time in the ER 

Actual situation:

We had troubles since his mother died because he didn't want to talk to anybody and told me he didn't want anybody around, for me was a completely selfish situation but then I realize he was grieving and I know how that feels tbh, after that he apologize and we are back in the same, he is trying to be more happy and more busy with his family and daily life, also is contacting me a lot

About the gift thing:

He told me he wanted to send me a good christmas gift and made me to choose, I also told him I did want to send him a thing and he told me what he wanted, so yesterday I tried to buy him that thing and asked for his address, he avoided my texts and ignored me, he changed the topic and I asked once again, he admitted he didn't feel confortable sending his address ( I know where he lives I have seen pics) but that was his right and is acceptable.

The thing is I wanted to send him a gift not stalking him, I feel a bit hurt because he is the one who keeps saying he wants me with him at his home and that he can't way to be with me but he avoided to give me his address, after he shared more private things.

come a month later i started thinking about the experience but i was able to just kinda forget about it. however as of the last week or so ive been unable to shake the thought of doing it again once i get a job. make no mistake, i dont want to do it again but the idea of me doing that once im employed has been stuck in my consciousness at all times. if im not thinking about anything else im thinking about that. its been the source of some of the worst feelings ive ever experienced that i can only describe as anxiety attacks because my mind will talk itself into thinking its addicted to cocaine and im experiencing some form of withdrawal. once this happens my body will start to get a weird ""static"" feeling to it, in particular my arms and legs. ill get some chest pains and some burning and i will start breathing quickly. i had to talk to my dad about it eventually because it was getting out of control. when he spoke to me i calmed down a lot and i think he realized it was just my head convincing me that this happening. This happened about 2 days ago and ive been able to kind of control the anxiety from these thoughts more but i still cant stop thinking about it.

once again im sorry if this isnt articulated well. if you need me to explain what i meant or something along those lines then let me know. i just need some advice so i can stop thinking about this. im losing sleep over it.

91,"So...there’s this girl. We met about 6 years ago through some mutual friends, she was dating one of them at the time. 

The first time I saw her I thought she was so pretty. I started talking to her and we just clicked like we were good friends for a long time. I had never felt that way before. We talked for a while and I was so surprised how well I could open up to her. I’m not an open person and I’m usually very quiet and shy around people I don’t know, especially girls. I never made any moves because I’m shy and well, she was in a relationship and I’m not the type of person to get in between 2 people. 

She lives a few states away where I was going to college, I was done with school at the time of meeting her, I had gone back to visit friends. 

After going home I couldn’t stop thinking “what if?” So I found her on Facebook and got her number and kept talking to her, as friends. 

Throughout the past years I went back to the college state probably like once a year. Sometimes I would see her and sometimes I wouldn’t. When I did we would talk and hangout as friends. I figure I should point out that we never really spent time alone, there are always mutual friends around. 

Also throughout the years she had a few different boyfriends, I knew they wouldn’t really workout because I knew the guys and I knew they weren’t right for her. 

Which brings us to now. She is single, has a job in the college state, and we talk every once in a while. 

I have a good job where I am and I couldn’t imagine moving to a different state. 

I have never told her I have feelings for her, and I wouldn’t know how to tell her.

I’ve never met anyone that I connect with like her and she crosses my mind every day. 

I need to know if she feels the same way, even if we do live in different states. 

The last time we saw each other it was a little awkward. I told her I wanted to see her and that I would come to the college state, but the only place for me to stay was at my friends. So most of the time I was with my other friends. We didn’t really get to talk that much.

I can’t help but think she might feel the same way about me.

How do you tell somebody that you want to be more than friends if you live and have a life in different states?

I want to stay friends with her either way, but I don’t want to say something that will make her feel uncomfortable. ",25Nov2018,1

93,"I'm a freshman in college and almost done with my first semester and I can't help but feel depressed. A lot has been going on in the past 3 months. School isn't hard but work is tedious and exams can be unpredictable. A large portion of my new friends joined a specific club (really a cult) and their activities force them to almost-exclude me from everything they do. Then my flirt/friendship with this girl I liked drifted away when she decided that she didn't want anything to do with me because she found another boy who knew what he was doing and it's hard to cope with because we have been talking for almost a year and a half at that point. I'm not suicidal or anything but it can be hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I exercise a lot as in going to the gym 4 times a week and I do calisthenics at the track 3 times a week. I used to run \~25 miles a week but that messed up my knee pretty badly so I've been having to do physical therapy for it. I drink coffee every morning but never after 12 o'clock. I also try to get at least 7 hours of sleep which I have been succeeding at doing. I have been suggested to go get counseling or go to a doctor to get meds but I have my problems with both of those. I've had counseling before but the therapy would never get around my head and I would always loop around. With meds, I'm scared that if I get prescribed depression meds or something, I'll get kicked out of the Air Force ROTC because they apparently don't like that stuff.

94,"I practically live with my boyfriend we’re both mid 20’s. We’re not ready to get a place together yet. But I spend 98% of my time at his. 

When something comes up that I can’t stay or if I’m visiting family, I really struggle to sleep in my own bed. I end up having to listen to sleep stories or play YouTube videos. Just have some noise in the background to distract me enough from thinking to sleep.  I also have to have a night light on again, but I’m still scared of the dark and assumed that I just felt safer with him there so didn’t mind the light being off. So I think that one makes sense.  

This is odd as when Im sleeping with him in the same room (or the rare times me and my sister have to sleep in the same room for Christmas) I find it so easy to sleep. He almost finds it annoying how easy I get to sleep as he has insomnia most nights. 

Any reason why I can only get to sleep easily when I’m not alone?  And any solutions to not overthinking when I’m sleeping alone. I don’t want to be reliant on external noises ",25Nov2018,1
95,"It only happened last night. I heard someone drilling metal and then screeching and our SUV was gone. I didn't register it and thought it was parked out of view until a few hours later because I saw the keys in the house, so they must have hotwired it. Inside was a bunch of things my mother received when her mother passed away. The car itself will only get us around 2000$ from insurance, which is nowhere near what we need to afford something with the same capability (mainly towing weight and general size). I'm also not sure if there's much use in searching for my grandmother's things. We don't know what a lot of the jewelery looked like and don't have pictures, so unless we get the car back which I doubt because we live in an area known for chopping up cars (Vancouver WA).

We have 2 other cars and a trailer that we cant tow right now. Both other cars are paid off which is good, we also added steering wheel locks and replaced all the outside locks on trailers and sheds. We had also just replaced every light on the car, the tires and rims, detailed it, and had it fully serviced.

Currently all 3 members of us, me and my parents, are out of work and I have mental illness issues and my mother has fibromyalgia as well as depression. Right now we're all just kind of stressing out. Overall it won't impact us in achieving our daily lives, but I just feel really overwhelmed right now.

105,"Hey, I don't know who will read this, and I don't know when someone will see this, but I have a problem, and I need some advice. So first off I should say, I am a male sophmore in High School, I also have a small rambling problem, so if this gets too long because of my stupid rambling, I'm sorry. And just a little sidenote, I am not proof-checking this, so if there are any mistakes, I do apologize.

OK, so to begin, It was freshman year, and I had this little friend group, mainly consisting of about 3-4 people, including myself. However, one of my friends, let's call her Abby, introduced me to one of her friends, and once again for the sake of privacy, let's call her Julia. Immediately, Julia and I became really good friends. I helped her with math, boys. etc, and she was there to help me talk through things and was there for me, when I needed someone. But, later into freshman year, closer to the end (so like April/May), she told me that she had a crush on this boy, let's call him Joseph. I never really talked to Joseph, nor did I really like him in the first place, but Julia really liked him, so I kind of had to hang out with him, cause Julia wanted to get closer to him.

Come to the summer time, and at this point all of Julia's friends knew she likes Joseph, and they all knew, including me, that Joseph had a crush on Julia, so being a good friend, I kind of told him how Julia felt, keep in mind Abby has already told Joseph that Julia liked him, but didn't tell him why she liked him or how she felt during certain times. And they pulled it off pretty well.

Now comes the closing of summer, and Julia, a friend (Jack), and myself were hanging out at the mall. Out of nowhere Julia tells me that Joseph fucking hates me, and she starts telling me about all these things he said about me, and that he wants to hurt me. Now to add, Joseph is a 6 foot 1 180-190 pound person, to me who is only 5 foot 8, and 120 pounds (very light because of a health condition). Now to me this sounds fucking stupid, and not to mention cowardly to fight someone at my size, but whatever.

Obvouisly I start freaking out, not just because this cunt wants to hurt me, but also because this has been going on, behind my back, and Julia hasn't done anything, or told me about this sooner.

Some months past and, by September, Joseph tried to fight me multiple times, which I strongly declined, and when talking about this with Julia, she just told me to stop talking to her. So for the next month and a half, I stopped talking to the person that found to be close enough ot be my sister. I felt betrayed, and most importantly hurt. But I was also anger, I was anger at Joseph, angry at the site of him, angry at what he did to me, all the harressment, all of the verbal abuse, but did anybody care. NO! I was ready to fight him, no matter how the odds were stacked against me, I was atleast going to go down fighting, but I didn't, because I knew that Julia would not want me to do this, even if (at the time) she hated me.

The second to last Sunday of September comes around, and I wanted my closes friends back. I had so much to talk to her about, I didn't care that her boyfriend hated me, I just wanted to talk to her again. So, I apologized, I even put on the blame on myself, even though I didn't do anything, I blamed myself. I didn't get a response til the next morning, or closer to 3 in the morning, where all she said was ""I understand."" I idn't know what to say, I tried to get my friend back, but obviuosly she didn't want to talk to me anymore. 

However, next Saturday, I got a text message from her, apologizing to me. She said she was just angry, and that she still wanted to be friends.

So everything was back to normal, well, not really. Her and I don't talk we use to, and we barely even have a conversation. I'm just glad I have my friend back. BUt not everything was going right. Her boyfriend was still being an ass. Though I let everything go, and barely even think about him, or even talk about him, he still carries on this whole drama. I still here him make fun of me he probably still threatens me here and ther, but he is still hanging on to this grudge. Not to mention that he is the reason, I can't hang out ith Julia, because he is always around her like a fucking guard dog.

So I don't know what to do. I tried ignoring it. I even talk to him about this drama before. I don't want to fight, nor do I want to bring this up with Julia, but I can't keep getting constantly harassed by this guy, who really needs to get a fucking life.

109,"Necessary background:

I did not finish college, financial problems arouse with my family, preventing me finishing my senior year. I originally thought they would pay for it. But after I found out the loans 
were taken out in my name and I had to pay them back. That doesn't bother me, but affects what I want to do. When I found out I could not continue college I started applying for full 
time jobs within Information technology. I was lucky enough that I landed a full time job at a good company doing system administration work.

However as time as gone on I find myself not liking this job. I get anxiety going into and while at work, mostly because everyone is much better at their roles than me. I feel that I do 
not belong or I will get found out and be fired. I have tried looking into a new job, but I think my lack of a degree and less than two years of experience are hampering my chances. 

I feel like I have lost what I wanted to do. I thought I would like IT, but it is looking like that is not the case. Combined with my college debt I feel like I am trapped in my current 
path. I have to stay because I need to pay loans back. I don't think I can take risks and get a job that would pay less and hamper me paying back the 
loans. Along with that I don't think I have many other skills to look for anything else. I mainly played video games/board games/tabletops. I never cultivated skills other than information 
technology since that was one of my main interests. 

I am nervous because what if I am stuck here, or if I do get fired how can I sustain any way of paying off loans? Should I take the chance and try to pivot
into another career?

Thanksgiving break will be ending within the next few days meaning I will have to return to high school. I have had to deal with serious mental health issues since the beginning of sixth grade, and I fear that if I continue on this route I will return to being a danger to myself. Naturally, I don’t suppose that will be good for anyone, especially my therapist who has been encouraging my recovery for years now. 

The high school itself is not the problem (my family moves frequently, I’ve attended multiple different schools, in each of them I experience the same fatal relapse). I have looked into transferring into nearby high schools but I know that it isn’t going to change anything for me, and only add onto my anxiety. I am also only fifteen at the moment, so unfortunately I can not just drop out and earn my GED. So, my last option is homeschooling. 

The thing is, my mother is biased against homeschooling. My older brother attempted it after dropping out of high school and failed all of his classes, hence why he received no credits and did not pass the grade. Now my mother believes that home schooling is terrible and will withhold credits from me if I do enroll. Is there any way I can convince her to enroll me?

120,"Yeah so these are really weird problems, I haven't heard of anyone with issues quite like this so bear with my while I explain. 

Ill start by simply saying that I can't see myself like a normal person. Like people have self image issues, but I'm really reaaally obsessive I think. A big contributor to this is that my entire physical perception of myself has been crushed on a couple of occasions. I am a 21 year old guy, 5'4"", and skinny, and I've often been pretty insecure about all that, but it used to be to a point of full on body dysmorphia. About a year ago I realized that I had been buying clothes that were small enough on me to look ridiculous, but I would look in the mirror and they would seem fine. One day a friend made a comment about it though and I realized my entire closet was trash and I'd looked like an absolute idiot for years. I think I was perceiving myself as even smaller than I am?

Another occasion,a friend told me someone we met in a college class told him she recognized me because I ""walked like a robot"", and shed seen me around our campus because of that. This is the weirdest fucking problem someone can have, but this was years ago and I am still insecure about how I walk now. For someone to tell you that you can't even walk properly, that's fucked me up man. This was a couple years ago, but I still don't know if I've fixed it. Sometimes I'll get hyperaware of my walking and that mental state definitely translates to make my walk look fucked in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have this inherent distrust in how I perceive myself now I guess, because what I think has been fine has been shown not to be in these major ways. Because I'm short, skinny, and probably look weird as hell whenever I walk one side of me thinks I should be a complete freakshow in other people's eyes. However  on the other end of things, I've had multiple people tell me genuinely that I'm really attractive in the face, attractive girls will stare at me in lectures and smile at me on the street. I've never had a girlfriend and am too socially awkward to actually flirt without coming across weird though so I don't have much solid confirmation on that end. Actual hot girls have tried to flirt with me before they realized I was a complete autist. 

All these pushes and tugs on my mind regarding how I am perceived from someone else's perspective has created an obsession, I'll stare at myself in the mirror for ridiculous amounts of time, ill film myself with my phone to try and get that third persons perspective. Sometimes I actually am pretty satisfied with my image, but then ill catch how small I look next to a normal sized friend in a reflection or something and I'll be crushed again, or someone will comment on my walk that I'd thought I'd fixed for the 10th time. Weird fucking problems that make me feel even weirder and freakier for having such a hard time dealing with

121,"So I'm a mature student, for personal reasons I have recently got back into education and I'm doing a HND course currently.

My friend has come into some money and has decided to buy a 3 bedroom house nearby. He offered a room to me and I was excited to finally get out of my mums house and the toxic environment.

It's still in the pipework currently, he has made an offer for the house and so I enquired about how it would work.

He said if I could afford to pay rent he is happy to take me, he gave me a ballpark figure of £600 and this excited me ""£600 between the two of us? I can totally pay that"" This was obviously a guess on his part, remember this is idle conversation and not a contract agreement, he made the offer for the house and will have work done on it over 4-5 months.

That's when he turned around and told me that if someone is living there he basically wants them to pay for the bills.

I was excited and found this strange at first but then ignored it.

But I have been thinking about it, and it seems unfair to me.

I know it's his house and he would be the landlord and based on brief searches, I understand that £600 can be cheap in some parts.

But to bear the brunt myself seems unreasonable. If 3 people live in a house, they should split the bill 3 ways. If 1 person is running up costs. Why should I pay for them? Maybe I don't want the heating on because it is costing me money? Maybe I don't want superfast broadband because it is too much.

I feel I am being possibly a little naive here, and if that's his decision I respect that and will have to decline it, upsetting as that may be.

He is my best mate and I would hate for this to become an issue in the future and possibly ruin a friendship, so I am treading lightly. Both of us are new to this after all, if he wants to do it that way then so be it, but I feel that paying his bills seems unfair. I feel that if share a house then you should share the load.

If no one lived with him he would have to pay for it himself, so just because others live there why would they now pay for everything.

I dunno, but it really has put a dampener on things for me, I don't want to hear the old ""money/business and friends don't mix"" I am aware and that's why I am willing to decline his offer.

Can anyone shed some light of this? Am I being silly? At the end of the day, I was sober and he had a few drinks, this isn't set in stone, and it was just a conversation, so obviously there is a lot more to work out.

I am just trying to figure out whether this is okay or not, I mean sure, he would be a landlord technically if he was to rent the room to me, and yeah it's his house, but from what I have read, in the UK the high rent is due to supply and demand and landlords wanting to pay off the mortgage on the property they have bought.

His house will have no Mortgage.

Obviously we need to have a more serious chat about this, but I want to go into it for some more knowledge. ",25Nov2018,1
122,"Some background:

I have a friend who I really enjoy talking to over text but after an incident with them, we kinda have grown apart. However, we started talking again and it seems like all is forgotten and things have been restored to how they used to be.

However, during the phase of not talking, I didnt really attempt to talk to them or engage in conversation. The incident was my fault and I wanted to give them space. Eventually they reached out to me and we started talking again. However, in the past, I was really clingy with this individual and I talked to them a lot. They left me on read at one point and I desperately sent messages to get their attention for which they replied with an angry rant. Ugh I was stupid. Now that things are working again, I dont wanna make the same mistake. 

Sometimes they reply with short phrases like ""yeah"" or ""ok"" and the convo really has no where to go unless I bring up a new topic. They dont really ask questions or start a conversation. So should I just leave them on read when the convo gets stale, or should I start up the convo again? Would it be rude to wait till they respond back? Should I reply with something when the convo results in a ""yeah"" or ""cool"".  Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

Maybe this would be better for r/relationship_advice, but I don't know. I'll probably cross-post it there too.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a girl I've known for about eight months now. Let's call her D. I met her after moving to this area and getting a job at the same place she worked. We pretty quickly established a good rapport, and before long we became good friends. She's a wonderful person, who just brings an air of positive energy to everything she does. She's nerdy, high-energy, wildly unfocused and so, so genuine and real as a person.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple months after I met her, D asked me to go with her and a few friends to a convention in our local area. It sounded like fun, so I said yes. That, as you may have guessed, was far from my only reason to go. By this point I'd already started to become very fond of D, and I took this as a chance to get to know her a little better. The convention was a blast, I ended up meeting a lot of great people. Even someone who I'd end up dating for a couple months, though it didn't end up working out. Let's call this person Y.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I hadn't expected to get in a relationship, especially with someone I'd only just met like Y. But the whole time I was involved, I couldn't stop thinking about D. I hadn't said anything to her before, since when I first met her she was in a relationship, and at the time of the convention she'd only just ended things with her boyfriend. She clearly still wasn't over it, so I decided to keep quiet and respect her personal space. That's when Y told me she had interest in me, something I hadn't expected at all. I made the mistake of telling Y about my feelings for D, and was then half-convinced there was no way she would feel the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, things between myself and Y didn't work out; our needs were incompatible. But like I said, my mind and heart never fully moved away from D. And now that it's been long enough and I've fully moved on from my previous relationship, that desire is getting stronger again. I'm not a mind-reader, so it's hard to say for sure, but at this point I think that D might be at least mostly over her prior relationship and the way it ended. She certainly talks about him like she is.

&amp;#x200B;

So there's me, with a growing longing for something more with this girl, and there's her, possibly ready to move on with her life to a new relationship. Especially over the last week or so, I've had more and more persistent thoughts. Telling me that I should do something, say something. I even asked D to come see a movie with me tomorrow, and she said she wants to.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just terrified. I know I won't be able to sleep tonight. I'm scared I won't be able to bring myself to say anything to her, and that this will just stay bottled up forever and poison my mind. I'm scared that if I do say something, I don't know how she'll react. I think I could handle rejection; she's a good person, and I can't imagine she'd want me fully out of her life just because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think scares me most, is if I say something to her, and she's receptive to it. Her happiness means a lot to me. Every moment of my life is just so much better for her presence in it. Every smile of hers I see is the most beautiful thing. Every laugh of hers I hear brings joy to me in a way I can't really describe. And yet I'm scared more than anything that I could mess up, and ruin all of that for her. I don't want to be just another guy who comes into her life, makes her feel loved and cared for, only to break her heart again.

&amp;#x200B;

Every moment is consumed by me thinking about this, or trying to distract myself from it and failing. I have a bad habit of overthinking things so much that I become paralyzed and don't know what to do, and this is no exception. I just don't want to be thinking about this for so long that I don't get the chance to decide.

131,"Hello everyone. I'll warn you before I even begin this post that I'm an awful narrator, and english is not my first language. Those two don't go well together. Sorry. Anyway, off I go with my story.

It all started when I befriended a person when I got into my school a year and a half ago. We’ll call this person **S**. I had heard rumors about her being a liar and such, but I quickly dismissed them: I couldn’t afford to care about what happened in the past of a person I had just met.

A few weeks ago, the school had a camp-program-thing, and we were split into groups. My friends and I got lucky, and got to be on the same group. **S** was amongst these friends. Early into the trip, another female friend called **A**, (who is also a close friend of **S)**, pulled me aside, and warned me. She told me that **S** was obsessed with me, and told lies about our relationship. **A** said that **S** told her female friends that she and I went on dates and such (which is not true!). 

Said obsession was quickly noticed once pointed out. **S** was, for lack of a better word, hunting me down, trying to be with me at all times, and if possible, alone. Needless to say, I was not comfortable with this. Due to this, I got a friend of mine, **O**, to stay with me at all times. According to **A**, **S** saw **O** as a Cockblock. Kudos to **O** for existing.

Fast forward to today, and I’ve found out through **A** that something similar has happened before. Apparently, **S** used to be obsessed with this guy **H**. After **H** said he did not want anything with her, she proceeded to try to ruin his reputation with lies. Quoting from **A**, “She literally tried to ruin **H's** life when she was obsessed with him, she made so many lies and rumors that made him look like an ass”.

I do NOT like **S**. I like someone else (I will not bore you with that). How can I tell her that I just want to be friends, without causing any negative repercussions? Should I maybe just be patient, and hope her liking of me goes away? Or should I do something to make her not like me?

132,"I used to be with this guy who I thought I would end up getting married to (he started talking about getting me an engagement ring). His mom loved me too, and in looking out for my health they both decided to gift me a years worth of gym membership, to be paid monthly (they’re loaded, and I say that as a matter of fact, so money if not an issue for them but I always made sure to let them know that I am extremely grateful anytime they do something for me, big or small).

Some time after, he really hurt me and broke up with me. His mom apologized on his behalf for his behavior, and I even told her it wouldn’t be appropriate for her to continue paying for the gym membership, but she insisted and told me that this was a gift she wanted to keep her word on, and so I graciously accepted.

It’s been 3 months, and now I receiving calls from the gym’s corporate office that the credit card on file is no longer working (even though the gym pass still works, although I’m not sure if that will be temporary). I don’t know if this means the mom cancelled the credit card on purpose, or if maybe her bank simply issued her a replacement credit card as one of those routine security measures and maybe she forgot about the gym membership? 

Regardless, I don’t know what to do. I was really looking forward to continuing at the gym, especially since it’s helped me a lot with recovering from the depression my ex put me through.

Anyway...Today I walk into work &amp; I’m immediately bum rushed by this relatively new coworker; who pretty much told me that we’re hanging out after work. Typically, I’d be ok with that, however this particular coworker is about half my age &amp; is somewhat of a recovering addict. Her boyfriend just so happens to work at the same restaurant as us; just in the kitchen...yet, he’s also a recovering addict &amp; he too, is about twice my age. 

(I’m 27 - Just to put that into perspective.) 

Mind you, I’ve tried to hang out with them in the past a couple of times, but each of those times...I just felt uncomfortable in their presence. Like. They would undress in front of me, get really touchy, feely with one another in front me....Like....Just really weird shit. 

But yeah, back to the main topic of discussion, today she kept pushing for me to come hang out with her &amp; no matter how many times I would decline her offer, she would keep pushing. At one point, she even tried to “Guilt Trip” me into hanging out with them. Saying things like, “You’ll hurt my feelings if you don’t come” &amp; “I’ll never ask you to come over, ever again if you don’t come over” etc. 

So, when my shift was over tonight, I slowly gathered my things &amp; sat near the front door &amp; I noticed that her bf was watching me. Like. I kept getting hella weird vibes, again, &amp; I decided to make a phone call to take my attention off of the fact that; this 40-something year old man is watching me from a table. 

Eventually, I left the restaurant once his attention was elsewhere, but, the fact that I had to leave in such a manner is kind of making me feel like I’m an asshole. Even though, I kept making it clear that I did not wanna hang out with them.

137,"(For perspective, I'm an 18-yo high school senior with a part-time job who is still living with his parents.)

For maybe 5-7 months, my mom has taken money from my savings account about once or twice a month, either asking for some beforehand or doing it without my permission and afterward telling me she ""had"" to take some, but she'll return it and it's really getting on my nerves.

I learned about her habit when I got my debit card last year in December after getting my first job. I checked my savings and checking accounts' histories and saw some big transactions I didn't recognize in my savings. I asked my mom about it and she told me she'd taken money from me and returned it before, so she has taken my money behind my back with no intention of letting me know before. I wasn't okay with that, but I didn't say anything.

Well, I thought my mom wouldn't need any money from me after that because iirc, the transactions were from years ago, but I was wrong. At first, she continued to just take it and tell me about it and inform me that she'd return it next payday, which REALLY pissed me off. I eventually had to tell her to ask for consent first. I still didn't like that she needed so much because she'd take $250-500 each time she needed some. It didn't make sense to me that she needed all that. One time, I think it was in April, I asked her what she'd been taking my money for and I'm unsure I remember what her answer was, but she may have vaguely told me it was for things she needs. I definitely know it's for necessities according to her, though. It was still so confusing to me that she needed hundreds of dollars because I always thought we were living comfortably. Anyway, she told me she would become financially stable soon because she'd work more (I think she hadn't been working much because of chronic pain) and wouldn't need to take from me anymore and I believe she stopped shortly after that. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago and my mom had to take some money again. Guess how much? $500! Now I don't remember if she even got my permission first that time, but I recall clear as day that I did NOT grant her permission to take the $350 that she called me about less than 3 hours ago. I'm really getting fed up with this. In my mind, she shouldn't need so much money from her son when she is a grown woman (aged 54) and it's unacceptable for her to ever go ahead and take my money without asking first. To me, it doesn't matter that she's returning the money asap because she would lose her shit if I were to swipe her debit card from her wallet and buy some gas with it before telling her about the transaction and stating I'd pay her back and I believe no one's any different.

But now I have learned that she has started cutting herself. She called up one of us when she did it, and as that was going on the bf walked in and was like (paraphrasing, not a quote) ""You want to feel pain? You do this to feel pain?"" and then proceeded to rub shaving cream into her wounds.

I am now sufficiently worried, and have asked my friends if someone should say something to her, but the general consensus is that everything has been said that can be said and she just needs to figure it out on her own.

Should I just leave it?",25Nov2018,1
145,"Last night I found out one of my best friends slept with my ex girlfriend about a week after we broke up, (2 year relationship) me and her left on good terms and are still friends. I know I probably shouldn’t be upset about this since we aren’t dating anymore, but at a party my friend and my ex were being kind of flirty, I just ignored it because I would never have thought he would have done anything with her, (considering he is 20 and she is 17, gross right?) so after I left the party apparently some people told him he shouldn’t go any further because they knew he would be breaking the bro code and ultimately our friendship, but he went ahead and did it anyways. He told her that I have been sleeping with multiple girls after we broke up. (I haven’t even talked to any girls since we broke up, and he knew that) he even tried to get my other friend to join in. Pretty much all of my friends knew about what they did and no one told me until my ex finally told me almost a month after. I don’t know what I’m asking from this community i just don’t know what to do. ",25Nov2018,1
146,"Okay, saying this, only a couple people has literally said I'm ugly.

People also only talk to me if they need something, considering I'm one of the smartest kids on my hallway. 

I want to be pretty, but it's like every single thing I do to be different ends up with teasing from other people. Middle school really does suck, and I have no self-confidence anymore. So, yeah. People can say that I'm pretty, but I know that they're lying. It's been a long time since I've heard people say I'm pretty.

I want him to seek therapy. This is the first time anything like this has happened. As a kid, if I did something like that, he’d hit me, but I was never left with bruises and blood on my face, never anything to that extreme. My brother says he was knocked to the ground by my father and punched repeatedly in the face. My mother tried getting in between the two of them, but even then my father tried going around her and would not stop. Got my brother to take pics and send them to me. It looks bad but not horrible. I called my mom out of anger. It’s clear that neither of them are going to take responsibility for this. I already told our older brother, and I plan on making sure my father knows we don’t approve of this kind of behavior. What else can I do?

I really do love to write but, I think they might be correct about this. But, they are also not supportive of my writing at all even when I had A's.

All my friends have relationships where they can be open with their parents and where their going even if its to a party. I was caught at a party earlier in the week and have been arguing with my parents ever since. I am truly sorry for having to lie, but I stand by my opinion that I was simply enjoying my life safely. My mom as a strongly different opinion and has taken away my car and cell phone. I just want to have a strong relationship with my parents where they understand that I am responsible and can take care of myself, but they have lost all trust in me because I lied my way around them. How can I fix this? What can I do? ",25Nov2018,1
150,"So, I’m 17 and have liked girls for a long time. I’m comfortable to tell my close friends but not many others. 

I feel like I’m missing out on the dating experience as a teenager. I’ve been asked out three times, hit on multiple times, but I turned down every one of them, not because I didn’t like them but because I didn’t want to involve them in my mess. I’m not out to my mom (or dad but he’s not really involved in my life and really hates gay people so he’s a whole separate issue) and I don’t like the idea of keeping my relationship secret since I’m so honest with my mom. I tell her everything, it wouldn’t feel right to lie about someone so important to me to another person who’s also really important to me.

I had a girlfriend once, I kept her a secret. It was extremely stressful to meet with her, go on dates/hangouts, and just be intimate in general. We couldn’t hug or hold hands in public because  everybody knows each other here. My mom knows a lot of cab drivers, they’re literally everywhere and they always snitch on me when I go out even though I’m a pretty good kid. My mom found a note that my girlfriend gave me that had “I love you”’s and “marry me” on it and grilled me on who it was from. I lied and said a boy even though it clearly was from a girl. Feminine hand writing, hearts everywhere. The way she freaked out at me prompted me to break up with my girlfriend despite us being good together. It had a crazy negative effect on the both of us but I was too scared to risk being found out.

These are the reasons I’m scared of coming out:

• I’m scared my mom won’t accept me. She’s doesn’t hate gay people, she’s nice to everyone but she has expressed in the past that it’s weird and doesn’t support it. Though she’s very wishy washy when it comes to the subject sometimes saying she doesn’t care. Her reactions are unpredictable.
• my older brother died a while ago and I feel, since I’m the only child and a female, that I am obligated to give her grandchildren biologically.
• I want my dad to be involved in my life and am planning to sort things out with him but I fear that he’ll completely shut me out if I come out to him.

I’m gonna turn 18 in May. Graduating soon. Not financially stable (little income). No car. Maybe only one reliable friend. There’s a girl I’m talking to atm, she’s wonderful but I’m refraining from pursuing anything because of all of the above. Im sick and tired of stopping myself from living my fucking life. 

**So my questions are: Should I come out to my mom and dad? And if so, how should I approach this? Should I just ask the girl out already?!**",25Nov2018,1

158,"My mom has a damaged ego and is excessively selfish. She's rather hurt others (emotionally/mentally) and even call the cops on her kids than face her demons. She's an authoritarian.

My dad was raised by racist rednecks who grew up in a podunk town. He's obnoxious, belittling, bigoted, and vain when it comes to politics. He's bigoted towards religious beliefs, political beliefs, and cultures. He reads Fox News. He acts as my mom's bitch anytime she's ""getting onto someone"", taking her side regardless. He's immune to anything the kid says to him, doesn't reflect, and continues to become more aggressive.

Both their imaginations suck. They suck at noticing patterns, coming to conclusions, and seeing possibilities. At best, it's like out-of-touch teachers in their 40's trying to figure out why students hate school. At worst, it's like two five year olds coming to the most egoic emotionally biased conclusion towards a ""bad guy"".

I told my mom I'm unsure whether I believe in a god or not. Rather than being tolerant, she behaved in a bigoted and arrogant way. 

This is what was said via text:

Her: ""Do you believe in God""

Me: ""I think there may or may not be a god. I'm not sure. In either case, I think people take the bible too literally.""

Her: ""Great. So now you're going through the same stupid phase or crap that *brother's name* went through. Hope you come out on the other side the right way ....on the Christian side. Thank God *brother's name* made it. I guess I'm going to have to start praying for you to make it now""

Me: ""Geez. That's so bigoted of you. Have some religious tolerance.""

Her: ""Not when it comes to my own kids where I raised them better than that and just got down worrying and praying about one of them. But to ha w to do with with two  ? That's not normal and a problem.""

159,"It sounds so stupid to put it in text, but it is what it is. I (26yo F) was into this guy. At first it was really just a physical attraction if I'm being honest. But we hung out once, had some drinks at his place. The whole night I was wondering why I was even there, since his friends were around and he didn't seem much like my type. But his friends left and went to bed and we stayed up talking. And for the first time that whole night I felt like I was getting to know the real him. He opened up to me about some pretty deep stuff and talked about things that he was passionate about, and I really felt like I saw something in him. Just to clarify, I'm a very picky dater. I don't settle or try to see something in someone that simply isn't there. But I saw HIM for the first time. I mean the way he lit up when he talked about certain things that I also feel strongly about just got me. And I genuinely felt a connection with who he really is. Nothing physical happened, and I went home feeling like I finally met someone that's worth my time. 

Fast forward to the weeks that follow and the guy won't give me the time of day. I tried to ask if he wanted to hang out a few times, excuses followed. He is NOT a busy guy in the slightest btw. Well yesterday he invited me to come over this Sunday, but then later in the evening snapped me pictures of other girls he was with at his place, and with the caption he put on it it felt like he was rubbing in that he was surrounded by other women. So I just deleted him on social media. I feel like he was stringing me along the whole time, and that the person I saw that night when we talked was a glimpse of who he really WAS at some point. But isn't anymore. So I'm trying to get over this idealistic image of this person that put himself out there for a change. I've been avoiding asking for advice on this, but it just sucks to think you see something in someone that is amazing and be disappointed when you realize that's not who they really are day to day.

162,"Look, I won't lie, this is fucking weird.

So, for the last week or so, my crotch (just my balls, more specifically) have smelled terrible. It's not BO--I don't know what it is, but it's something else. I do know what it's not:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Body odor (I have body odor, believe me. I'm a young man. But this smell.....this is not BO. It's something much, much worse)

\-STDs

\-Diet (my diet is the same as it's always been, and the smell is only recent)

\-Masturbation (when I masturbate, I use the same lube I've used for years, and my masturbation habits haven't changed at all)

\-Soaps/detergents/shampoos\* (I wash my body and my clothes with the same brands that I always have

\-Clothes (I've tested all my clothes; it's me that stinks, not my clothes)

&amp;#x200B;

\*About the shampoo part. A few weeks ago, the smell showed up for the first time (but only for 2 days). I didn't realize it at the time, but I had washed my crotch with Old Spice body wash and forgotten to rinse it off (my hot water heater is broken, so I always get out of the shower as fast as I can. Sometimes, this results in me forgetting to rinse soap off of some areas of my body). I used a towel, yes, but it didn't wash it off as well as water would have. I noticed the smell,of course, but I didn't put 2 and 2 together until the next time it happened, about 2 weeks later. Again, it happened when I forgot to rinse the body wash off my crotch, and again, it only lasted about 2 days. And again, yeah, I was too stupid to put 2 and 2 together.

Fast forward to a week ago. I forgot to rinse again (finally put 2 and 2 together though, thank God, so I'll never forget again), and the smell showed up about 24ish hours later. Only this time, it hasn't gone away. I'm telling you, it's fucking putrid. I can't even be around people because it's so embarrassing. You can't really smell it from across a room (I hope), but once you're within 5 feet or so, that's all you smell. And it's all coming from my balls.

I don't know why it would be the body wash, since it's the same body wash I've used for years and this hasn't ever happened before up until a few weeks ago. But it's ONLY happened when I forgot to rinse off the body wash, the only inconsistency being that this time it's lasted a week rather than 2 days like it did both times before. I'm honestly not sure of that's the cause or not. I wouldn't think it would be, but it seems like too much of a coincidence not to be. I don't know.

Both times before, the smell went away after 2 days of waiting and 2-3 intense scrubbing sessions in the shower. There were 2 weeks in between the first and second time, and even more than that between the second time and this time. So I know it went away, it just came back is all.

This time, it's lasted going on 7 days, and probably a dozen showers. No matter how hard or long I scrub, it just won't go away like it did the last two times. I can sort of dull the smell for about an hour and that's it.

I have normal hygiene and aside from my smelly balls, am in perfect health. Not overweight. No diseases. No injuries. Nada. Just a crotch that smells like shit (not literal shit; worse actually).

There's no rash or redness. Nothing hurts or is irritated. Just minimal (and I do mean minimal) flaky skin and the smell of death on my albino milk duds. Other than that, everything is normal in the land down unda'.

Worst part is, you don't get used to the smell. It's always there.

 What do y'all think it is? The body wash theory makes sense, but it's never happened up until a couple months ago, so I'm not entirely convinced. But I don't know what else could've caused it either.

But most importantly.....how the fuck do I make it go away? After straight up washing it didn't work, I tried to at least cover it with deodorant, cologne, even straight up Febreeze. Nothing masked the smell. Right now my only legitimate strategy is just more time and more showers. Ain't working though.

Help me. God, please, help me.

Anyway, I'll quit talking about my balls now.",25Nov2018,1

I enjoy chilling a lot. Even when I don't smoke weed, I don't seem to get the hard tasks done. I'm easily distructed by other things like naps and social media.

164,"I feel like I’m on a rollercoaster all the time. I can be happy for a little while and then I just plummet for what feels like forever. I can count more bad days I’ve had than good. I feel miserable and stressed all the time. I’m to the point where I don’t like being happy anymore because I know it will only end and I will be miserable again soon. 

I despise school even though I used to love it. I have so much work that is due because I have been out for a long time, and I haven’t gotten halfway through all the work. I tried doing it while I was out, but I never had time. I regret being out. I was struggling even before I was out because I didn’t understand it, but now it’s going to be a thousand times worse because I’ve missed almost two weeks of school. 

I’ve started getting panic attacks a few months ago. I didn’t know what they were then but I’ve figure it out now. I hate waking up in the morning because I know every day is just going to be terrible. Everything makes me anxious. I think about school all the time. All the work I have to do. My grades falling. Everyone becoming more disappointed in me. 

And I’m just so tired. I’m exhausted all the time. I’ve lost motivation to do a lot of things. I stress eat constantly. I can’t get to or stay asleep. And I can’t focus. 

I’ve dreamed of becoming a doctor since I was a kid. It’s all I’ve ever planned on being. I don’t know any other options for my future. But my dream is never going to happen and I dont know what to do anymore. Nothing else interest me other than medicine. But it doesn’t matter because I’m not going to accomplish that dream. 

I used to be a straight A student. Maybe one B every now and then. But now I’m struggling to keep my A’s. I don’t understand my AP chemistry class at all, even though I did really well in honors. I try hard on my work. I spend hours staying up trying to understand and get it right. But I usually just end up going into a panic attack over not understand the material. No one can explain it to me because they don’t know it. My teacher doesn’t understand that I don’t understand because I don’t even know where to begin to ask questions. My family doesn’t have the time or money to hire a tutor either. Colleges don’t want people who get bad grades in classes and on exams. I’m not even going to the college I want because the college I plan to go to is so much cheaper than the one I want. 

I know I should probably talk to someone like a therapist, but my family doesn’t really believe in them. I don’t want to be put on medications either. My family is very against medications like anti-anxiety meds and such. I daydream about falling off bridges or being hit by a car, which I know is bad. The only think keeping me from doing it is the feeling that I would inconveniencing my family more by making them deal with what’s left of me, and the hope that it might get better one day. 

But I doubt it will get better. I’d be even more miserable than I am now when I get to college. But I don’t know what to do with my life if I don’t go. It would be a miracle to get into med school. But that’s unlikely because med schools want the best, and my best clearly isn’t good enough. 

I’m sorry about my terrible grammar and for this to be in order all over the place. I’m crying and have been for three hours, and I’m struggling to get my thoughts in order. And if this isn’t the place for this I’m really sorry. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I have so much work I need to do but I’m so tired. 

I just want some advice on what to do please. I don’t have anyone to talk to and I’m desperate at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

In the Bay, I have a lot more friends. I spent 3 years in college not really feeling like I had a support group and a solid friend group, but now I finally do. I don't want to leave this area so soon after finally being able to call it home. The past semester has only been the best semester of my life (I'm currently a first semester senior). Most of my friends here at guys, so it would be a bit hard for me to meet new girls. This is my biggest concern. I do prefer SF over Seattle as there are more things to do and the weather is much better.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my job can have me be in Seattle. I don't have as many friends, but I know a lot more girls. I've never been in a long-term relationship, and for the only times I've had sex, I've felt like it was because I was horny and not actually into the person I was doing it with. I'm someone who is highly motivated by sex (which is probably not a good thing tbh), and there's a girl that I am kind of into that is going to be back in Seattle as well. I have a decent friend group there, but I am much closer to and get along better with my friends in the Bay. The Bay is more expensive than Seattle as well, so Seattle has that edge.

  
Deep down, I feel like I shouldn't move to a place just for the prospect of having sex and that mentality is toxic and I should go to the place that I feel most at home at (which is the Bay). But the fact that I know so few girls in the Bay just really frustrates me and makes me feel down on myself.

Over the summer we got pretty close. Whether we're friends or a little more than friends I'm not quite clear on, but we've been friends for almost two years now. But it was over the summer that we got close. We texted almost every day for a good few months (they always started the conversations) and the conversations for the most part were really nice and pretty lively. But as the summer was sort of ending they talked a little less often, which I expected because sometimes they talk a ton and sometimes they dont, and so for the past few months we've talked about once a week. But then over the past two months or so when they talked to me the conversations were really hard to keep up (like I said, ""yeah"" and ""lol"") no matter what I do. 

I dont think it's a matter of them just not wanting to talk to me, since they still are the one starting the conversation usually, and when we hang out in person they're still just as friendly and kind to me. 

They usually start the conversation, and when I try to it's a little more difficult for me. Because when they start the conversation I can kinda say ""hey, if they're talking like this because they don't want to talk to me it's not my issue, they texted first"" but when I start the conversation it almost seems worse and I can't shake the feeling that I'm forcing them to talk to me. And it might just be in my head, but I feel like the conversation quality is almost much worse. 

This person is really passive and laid-back so its possible that they're just being their passive self and don't necessarily realize they're making a difficult conversation. 

I've thought about sort of talking to them about it but there's so much else going on in my life that emotionally I feel raw, I'm constantly ripped apart in my home and the little conversations we had was a little bit of light that I had and it feels like it was ripped from me. Because I'm so emotionally raw, I feel like a confrontation would make things much more difficult which is why I've avoided it at this point. But I kind of feel like the fact that I'm trying to keep up a conversation rather than enjoying a conversation with a dear friend is adding to my emotional state. 

Like I said, I dont know of they realize entirely what they're doing so I feel like stopping conversation with them would just hurt us both unnecessarily. Really they're very very kind and sweet and I don't think they'd do anything to purposefully cause me more pain. 

I don't know if this is important, but I do have anxious attachment issues, but I try really hard to keep those from making a difference in these relationships and I feel for the most part that I have been successful 

Is there any easy or simple solution to this issue? Is there anything I can do about it at all? ",25Nov2018,1
176,"My sister is 26, I'm 33. Our relationship was originally very strong. I moved out when I was 18 and up until she moved out of my parent's house @ about 23, she used my place to hang out with boyfriends and friends...just generally a place of freedom. After she got her own place she stopped coming by altogether. I called her out on it and said I felt used, she denied it and got angry. We seemed okay for years until she got married and had her own child. I never see her unless it's a big family thing. When it's her birthday or my nephew's birthday I leave their gifts at my parents' house since I know she will be seeing them multiple times a week. She never thanks me for or even acknowledges that she has received a gift. 

Should I ask her what the fuck her problem is? We don't have much of a relationship anymore, but she seems like nothing is wrong when I do see her. Because of this I feel like I am not losing a whole lot but it does hurt and leaves me wondering what I did wrong...",25Nov2018,1

178,I’m 15 and a sophomore in Hs. I was a slightly annoying but happy kid but got depression and anxiety in 5th grade when my parents split. I became much weirder and more annoying. I was easy to make friends with at first because I made good first impressions but people usually got sick of me and distances themselves. I developed this habit of blaming other people for how I act (ex. Parents fought all the time and I learned from them or OTHER people are weird nOt mE!!!) Middle school was hell because I got bullied and I didn’t understand why so my depression got worse and I became suicidal. One specific girl would bully me and I was nothing but nice to her. And another group of girls faked a guy asking me out because I didn’t have a boyfriend in middle school. It got better when I got to Hs and I thought I had changed because I made more friends and this is when guys began to be interested in me sort of. But this stopped when my friend told me “people say that you talk to a lot of people to seem cool and that you aren’t genuine” which I don’t think is true because I’m just friendly. I also became friends with a popular girl and recently she’s been rude to me and I’m beginning to feel the same helpless girl I was in like 7th grade (which may not be the case but it’s like the same terrible experience is repeating when I thought I was done with it) I don’t know what to do I need serious help and advice. ,25Nov2018,1
181,"NOTE: *Pardon my English !* 

Few weeks ago, I made friends with a girl from my class (I'm in uni!). I noticed she wasn't in the course WhatsApp group that we've created since Day 1, so I took the chance of adding her in it as well.    


Afterwards, I then invited her to join the study group to study together, she came and I got to know her a little bit better. &amp; the next day, we started to text each other. We instantly clicked ! We share our hobbies, talk about everything under the sun. All that good stuff.  


 &amp; yes, I know you might think I would fall for her but nah, I know my place and I'm seriously waayyyy out of her league so I kept it strictly platonic.   


So we decided to have a study group again, but nearing the day, all the other friends I've invited couldn't make it I told her now it's just us two for tomorrow. So being myself, this was the words I told her ""NOW ITS JUST US TWO TOMORROW LEGGOOO!"" But apparently, the day came and she said she wasn't comfortable with just us two. So I understand and told her it's okay, next time then.   


I thought we were both cool with it but on the next two days, where we had our classes, I tried making eye contact to wave at her like I usually do but she immediately looked away and/or avoid looking at me. 

*Honestly tho, in my mind was like WHAT IS GOING ON WHAT THE HECK NO.*   


Now she is a quiet girl, doesn't talk to a lot of people in the class &amp; I understand how she felt. I'm the same too. So after class, I tried texting her normally to see if she would even reply. She did! But it doesn't feel like how she used to reply me before all this happened.   


So here is where I need the advice,   
I'm not sure if I'm overthinking or over complicating things in my head but what should I do ?   
Would it be better if I ask her if there's a misunderstanding going on or just ignore and let it be ?  


Honestly, I really enjoy texting her! She's like the girl best friend I would never even have in the first place..

182,"In nearly the last year I've been changing around a lot of the bad self care habits I made from when I was younger and used to have a stressful home life. My home life was pretty stressful from middle school through high school with my siblings getting into serious trouble, my mom's abusive bf, and having to take on some more serious responsibilities at the time.

For comtext, I used to fall asleep with textbooks on my bed, had giant stacks of papers/stuff all over my floor that I had to stretch over to get out the door. During these stressful years I dealt with general anxiety and frequent panic attacks. I ended up struggling to take care of myself.  I remember at one point I had stopped brushing my teeth at night because I would be too tired after the panic attacks, fall asleep in the afternoon, wake up in the middle of the night, and fall asleep after eating.

Point is I didn't grow up with a lot of structure or regularity to make a good routine for my self care. Since going to college and seeking help, my overall situation has improved significantly. I really do feel like this is something I can accomplish now. I'm also inspired to do more for myself because of a good friend of mine who always takes so much time amd effort to take care of herself.

It's amazing how much she does. We're pretty similar academically but somehow she just has more energy to put into herself. Sometimes it feels like I don't really have the time to take better care of myself. I know it's about prioritizing but I just feel tired from doing anything more. I do more extracurriculars than my friend does and because of other health stuff have doctors appointments sometimes but on my slower and normal days I still don't do much for myself. Or sometimes I do feel too tired for even just washing my face or remembering to floss/use mouthwash, usually just a small detail of getting ready I forget to do that's something like that. 

I have a relatively streamlined day but I am a student so a lot of my focus is on classes and school work. I am also working on getting a better balance because I pretty much take notes or work on stuff until I'm done with it around 9 or 10 for most nights.

I just feel that if I can get better about taking care of myself and be more organized about it I can be more efficient with my other things, be less tired all the time, and make enough structure in my life for other things I want to do like exercising again. (o the infamous to do)

I'm curious about how you guys have built your own routines and maybe what little or big ways you guys try to have time for yourself when you're feeling busy or stressed.",25Nov2018,1
183,"So this weekend I’m out do town. I booked a fairly nice hotel. When I arrived I decided to look around and for some reason I checked under the sink in the bathroom in my room. I pull out a small stick unable to identify it until I pulled it out. 

It turned out to be a syringe with the cap on. 

I immediately threw it down on the counter and washed my hands a few moments later. Not sure what to do , I put it right back where I found it and haven’t touched it since. 

I’m worried about two things...

Could I have gotten infect just by touching the case ? The needle did not dry blood nor was it exposed. 

Also, I didn’t want to throw it in the garbage as I assume the cleaning staff would assume I was doing something I shouldn’t have been. Also if I tell them there is a needle they might not believe that it was there when I got there. They do daily cleanings and would probably believe their staff over some random guy.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 months ago I was in the city with my mates and we were handed a ticket just like these to go for a free personality test at the Church of Scientology. I didn't want to go cause I knew it was bs but a friend of a friend that had been in the church of Scientology for nearly a year insisted on us going (I don't know exactly how he ended up in the church of Scientology but all my friends said he was so i went along with it). It ended up to be a 200 question multiple choice test that my friend did with a woman whilst we all watched over him. It took ages and in the end my friend got a chart of his personality traits or whatever. The woman then asked us all to write down our details which I didn't think much of at the time but now I realise it was a mistake. Every fortnight or so I get these Scientology tickets in the mail and its really creeping me out. I have since been back to the Church of Scientology but they said I was not on their mailing list or anything. I don't even know if this is anything significant but I'd rather not get them in the mail considering all the crazy stories that come from the church of Scientology. Is there something I can do or am I just stuck with getting these creepy personality tests in my mailbox?

She's been saying extremely sexual stuff really hard right off the bat and it feels wrong to talk to someone like that who I've never even stood face to face with.

Now, I can't really go along with it because I'm not old enough to drive on my own yet (she lives in our state's major city and I live about 10 miles away in a suburb).

188,"My roommate and I are acquaintances who were originally going to live in a 4-bedroom home with two other friends, but by a series of unfortunate events ended up living in a 2-bedroom apartment together. He is a perfectly nice person and by most accounts a very good individual to live with: clean, not overly demanding, etc. The one thing that is causing me stress is the feeling that he has ownership over the whole apartment, and I never really feel welcome in the common space. 

We went splitsies on most of the furniture, but he bought the TV and game consoles that he uses. This is fine; I don't have a particular need for a TV or consoles, though I do use them from time to time since they're here. The issue is, whenever he's home, he has the TV on and is using it. This seems fair, since it's his TV. However, he just uses the TV for whatever he wants and never really asks if I want to watch anything, or play any games with him, or participate at all. Maybe once a week he asks if I want to watch a movie with him, but that's it. He also uses the kitchen to cook a lot, and so will spend hours walking between the kitchen, dining table, and TV, essentially dominating the entire common space while not really making me feel welcome by making conversation or inviting me to participate. He's often grumpy or tired or doesn't want to talk, and I'm kind of a shy person as is, so I don't push socializing. So, I basically end up just shut in my bedroom most of the time, while he lounges around in the other room and cooks and uses the TV. 

I don't know if there's anything I can do to fix this situation. It's not like I can ask him to stop using his own TV or cooking in his own kitchen, so I'm not sure what to do about the fact that I never really get to use the common space myself.

189,"So I am just turned 24, I have been attending school on and off for about 4-5 years and just recently decided to go back to school full time. So I left my job as a sales specialist at a Blue hardware store (making +$18 with an offer for a manager job if I stayed), moved states and took a part time job at a different store. As long as I stay full time I feasibly could have an AS Gen Studies by July-ish, and a Bachalors in 2-3 years depending on my major (which I'm leaning towards Comp Sci, but really no idea). But, the mangers at my new store are wanting me to take a manger job.

I'm just honestly torn, my brother is really wanting me in the same field he's going into (1yr older, working on BS in Comp Programing), and I feel the need to get a degree (blame society?) But this is my first semester attending college full time, and I'm really not a fan. The other option is I could take this manager job, and work my way up. There's locations all over the country, there's even the Orange one if need be. I am also sure to maintain a relationship with my old managers (never know).

190,"Hey I'm new here but I wanted to ask for some solid advice. My little brother in high school is starting to steal things. A few months ago, he was caught by my parents for stealing a thanos glove fro. target. The reason he said that he did it was because he wanted it. 

Side note: he is also very frugal. I think part of why he steals things is because it's cheaper to steal it than ask for it. 

We ended up returning the glove but my parents were very pissed off. Today, I found out my brother stole a mechanical pencil from a statiornery store. I confronted him alone because I didn't want my parents to get angry but he denied it. I said, ""did you buy anything from [insert store name here]? He said no but on the way back home I saw him open a package with a mechanical pencil in it. 

Later on, when my parents were gone, I went to check his backpack. Sadly, my assumption was correct. I found the opened package along with the pencil. How do I stop my brother from stealing?

My roommate suddenly became interested in casually using cocaine during social events, and only seemed to bring her up in ways that sounded underlyingly negative. They use every opportunity to incorporate drugs and alcohol into the situation, and she's generally obnoxious. He then began using cocaine on his own for no reason in particular, which she had given him. 

He brought her over to our place, where I have two other roommates, and they stayed up yelling in the kitchen as my roommate upstairs tried to sleep before work early the next morning. She brags about keeping Valium hidden in her cigarette packs, yells with a tone of voice like she's having a consistent orgasm, and generally sounds like she JUST arrived to college despite being a fully grown woman. All her conversations are based around subtle brags that are obvious lies and eyerolls.

I feel like my roommate is easily manipulated, and this girl being in my house while pressuring my roommate to drink or snort coke before work just feels gross. It feels uncomfortable and I don't think she's even remotely a positive influence. It's getting to the point where her influence makes me not want to be around my roommate.

Is this something worth bringing up to him, or potentially telling him that she makes me uncomfortable being in my own home?

198,"Lease ends in Jan and ive already checked out a room and they'd like me to move in. I don't want to make any decisions too quickly and want to check out more places but this is what I'm looking at so far. the pros outweigh the cons but the main con is something i've always been afraid of so i can see it being a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:**

\-walking distance to two grocery stores (one thats pretty similar to whole foods but not a chain, and one thats comparable to food maxx), drug store

\-five min walking distance to both the bus i'd need to take to work, and the bus my boyfriend needs to take. This would take two hours off of my daily commute compared to where i live now.

\-closer to my boyfriends house 

\-close to the gym i want to join

\-walking distance to my favorite Japanese restaurant and other shops and restaurants i go to often

\-house is clean  and well decorated and roommates would be close in age to me

\-already have the go ahead to move in so it would take away the stress of having to find something

\-laundry on site

\-cute backyard

\-street parking

\-most of the house has nice hardwood floors minus my room

\-good size room

\-already furnished so i wouldn't need to worry about buying furniture because I don't have much besides a mattress

Basically location wise it ticks off all the marks of what I want to be accessible

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\-Right next to the freeway. My room is the closest to the freeway and I'm a light sleeper. 

\-I'm also deathly afraid of the idea of anyone being able to walk by and look in/break into my room. 

\-i prefer apartments over houses because living above ground level feels safer to me

\-window facing the freeway is boarded up with wood. the window isn't broken and i didn't ask yet why the board is there. maybe the current roommate is using it to block light/sound

\-room is dark and kinda gloomy but tbf i wasn't paying attention to if the shades were pulled so that's my fault

\-carpet is a hideous shaggy brown

\-idk what happened to the mattress that is currently there 

\-shower is in a room separate from the house and its not terrible but just strange. 

\-haven't looked at anything else

main con is how close to the street /freeway the house and especially my room is and because im frightened easily and sleep lightly i can see myself being woken up at 3am thinking there's someone outside trying to murder me. it might sound silly but i'd consider it pretty close to a phobia.

Well, he comes home, and he’s super pissy.  He goes straight to the bedroom, and doesn’t even acknowledge me.   

I give him a few minutes to chill out, and then I bring him his plate.   Wasn’t sure if I should, but I did.  He tells me he doesn’t want to see me right now.  I ignore him and ask him if he’s eaten today.  I didn’t want to bring up anything work related.  He said no, and that he just wanted to be alone.   Well, I keep pushing it and he smacks the plate out of my hand.  He screams at me to get the fuck out of his room.

Penny is bonded to my soon-to-be-ex-husband more than me. But penny is a puppy mill rescue and the only dog in the world she likes is tank. They have never spent more than a few minutes apart at the vet when they take tank back to get shots, and she whales and panics and cries the whole time.

Tank doesn't need Penny, he just needs another dog there for his anxiety. But Penny needs tank.

210,"Hey everyone, 
I’m a 19 year old female and I’ve struggled with dating a lot recently. I’ve never had a bf, hell I didn’t even kiss a guy until I was 17, and I honestly just find it all uncomfortable. Little back story, my parents were together almost 20 years and my sophomore year of high school they just cut off communication. My dad was living in our guest bed room and the whole situation was absolutely scarring for me. They didn’t officially get divorced for another 3 years so it was terrible is all I can see. Fast forward to this year and my dad tells me that my mom cheated on him and they tried to make it work for another 5 years after, but obviously that didn’t turn out well. Anyway, I’ve been asked so many times for so many different people about my dating life. I always say no and that I’m just trying to work on myself or some bs excuse, but honestly I am terrified of dating anyone. Having watched my parents go through 20 years of marriage and it just ended like is hard for me. That’s so much time to spend with someone and it all just ends up a waste. I’m scared of commitment and having the same thing happen in my life and I know I don’t have to be like my parents of live a life like there’s but it happens to so many people and the idea of commitment scares me to no end. Sometimes I truly believe I’m better off just living my life alone, but I never want the pain of my parents divorce to stop me from trying, it just always does though. Have any of you gone through something similar? Did anything change your mind or make you more at ease with dating? Sorry if my story is all jumbled. ",25Nov2018,1

212,"Hey reddit

&amp;#x200B;

So I just turned 18 and I live with pretty controlling parents. One of the most controlling things about them is how much they restrict my driving privileges. This is mainly my mom that is so worried. She has 2 trackers to watch my driving (one in the car, one on my phone which I've learned how to fake my GPS location) and has very tight restrictions on my driving. She hardly ever lets me get on the interstate and rarely lets me go more than a 30 minute distance.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that upsets me about this so much is that I have never been pulled over, never gotten in a fender bender, never gotten a ticket, etc since I got my license at 16. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere around May-July 2019, my friends are planning a roadtrip that could take anywhere between a 4-8 hour drive. I am determined to go, but my problem is that I'm worried if I tell my parents ""Sorry, you aren't telling me no"", then they will say ""Okay, we will stop paying for your car insurance."" ""Okay, go find another house to go live in."" ""Go pay your own phone bill (we are on a family unlimited data plan)"" ""Go pay for your own college"" You get the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me feels like my mom would not go to this extreme, but I also could see it at the same time. She is VERY attached to me, and I think that if she did these things then she would regret it because I would (purposely) rarely talk to her and rarely see her. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think I should do in this situation? I honestly want to take the opportunity of going to a college 2 hours away and living on campus so that this would not be a worry, but I also don't want to leave my friends back home. She needs to eventually realize that I'm ready to grow up and ready to start splitting off from them. ",25Nov2018,1
213,"So
There’s a girl that I REALLY like. But she and I have been friends for a long time and I don’t want to ruin the friendship that we have. Should I tell her my feelings about her?",25Nov2018,1
215,"I’m gonna try my best to be brief. 

I met a lovely woman, we both fell in love very quickly and started spending all of our free time together. For me that wasn’t much, since I’m a consultant and have to both work a lot and travel each week. 

After a month she starts having real wacky roommate problems, so when I’m out of town she stays at my place (closer to work anyway). After a week of this, the “why don’t I move in” happens. I’m hesitant, but agree. 

Fast forward to month two and a half; I’m completely smitten and in conversation as her to marry me. She says yes and then glee (temporarily) ensues. 

Over the next six months, everything starts to unravel. Before leaving for a work trip, she tells me how she spends her days while I’m at work pacing around the apartment telling herself how much of a horrible person she is (she stops working shortly after we get engaged because of a work dispute that seemed reasonable at the time). As she’s telling me this (my flight was in about an hour mind you), she goes from frantic to catatonic. 

I make up a lie about my dad (who does have heart problems to make it believable) having heart problems and I can’t fly out. I then take the next three days off work trying to cheer her up, to little avail. She flips from literally the most sad person I’ve ever seen to anger to just, nothing. 

Months pass and she becomes agoraphobic. Won’t leave the house for anything. I try getting her to go and every step along the way is hell. To the car, in the car, once we get there. I end up having to make excuse after excuse on friends, family, work because she’s an angry wreck. 

At some point in here she turns on me (I think it was once we got our puppy). We come back from a friend watching our 4 month old puppy while we go to a music festival. Our puppy was anxious and didn’t eat much. She took that as them not feeding her enough and proceeded to SCREAM at the top of her lungs at me while we drive away. I didn’t see that friend again for over a year because of this incident (our friendship, and all of my friendships, have taken a huge hit to the point of not existing). 

She starts getting more and more angry now. There was several months of me spending 100% of my time (I got given two months off of work because of a project from hell happening at the same time as all of this. My work thinking they were the cause of me burning out, gave me time off no questions asked. When in reality, my fiancé was draining me more than work). All of my time was spent trying to make her be some level of happy. But what it really was, was her screaming at me all day, saying the most hateful shit you’ve ever heard (opening my eyes after sleeping and seeing her looking right at me telling me how much she hates me is something I still struggle with). 

We repeated a cycle of her being hateful, me taking it until she exhausted herself around 9pm, she’d be apologetic and lovey. Then wake up and do it again. There’s lots of painful memories I can’t shake from here. Including her stopping us in the middle of sex to scream at me for doing it wrong and being a bitch. It’s been over a year since that, and I am only finding it harder and harder to have sex (we got married 6 months ago and haven’t had sex). 

At some point she improved and improved and improved. She’s not 100% better, she still has massive anxiety, but not like before. But now I’m a complete mess and things she still does, but not to the same degree, trigger me to cower or flip to anger. The worst of this all happened a year ago, but there’s still been outbursts. Like when we were just starting our cross country road trip to move, and she screamed at me at the top of her lungs while driving down a busy expressway with a uhaul on the back. 

I want to add that she’s a tiny woman (5’2”) and I’m a pretty big dude (6’3”). She terrifies me. I’ve lost most of my friends through all this, first because of me being a flake from issues with her, then because I am just no longer a friend to them. How could I be when I’m emotionally exhausted and have become self loathing? 

I gave up all my hobbies through this. Friends, reading exercising; lots of healthy habits I made while getting out of a really shitty childhood. But I had no choice, I never got time alone and she’d always monitor how long it took me to get home or where I went. 

I’ve come to realize through therapy that I have a lot of unresolved problems from my childhood (which was beyond fucked). I “cope” very well with stress, because I’m programmed to burry it deep and attend first to everyone around me. 

Well, I’m broken now. I have zero will or want to do anything, when I was literally the most motivated and active person I knew. I’m actively telling friends to fuck off, pushing everyone away. I’m getting in more fights with my now wife. I’m completely irrational and flip from rage to apathy, and back again, in a flash. 

My wife has been through a lot, explaining a lot of her issues. But now I’m holding her back because I’m such a mess. We got into an argument at 8am today that went until 10am, at which point I left the house and sat on a curb somewhere not doing anything but contemplating suicide for 8 hours. 

Then I came home, shut myself in the bedroom and kept telling her to leave me alone. When she wouldn’t, I left without taking my phone. I then found her driving around looking for me at which point I silently got in the car. 

Once we got home I told her I can’t come inside. That I tried working up the courage to kill myself today, but couldn’t. So instead I’m going to leave her to run away. She got into panic attacks, and I left the car with her chasing after me again. 

I didn’t make it far before breaking down crying. I walked back into the house and locked myself in the bathroom. I haven’t spoken to her since. 

I know I’m severely depressed and need help. But I genuinely don’t care. I also know I hurt her and put her through a lot today, but again, I don’t seem to care. I wasted my day, something I hate doing, but don’t care. There’s been so many, so many, wasted days drowning in emotion (mostly hers, but now mine) that I’d be lying if I said it didn’t already add up to a year. 

What do I do? She doesn’t have a job. I’m getting more depressed by the day and have never been so apathetic. I used to be extremely ambitious, and now I just want to burn everything down and say fuck the world. 

She still needs so much help and support. But I’m so burnt out and broken idk if I can give that anymore. Man, there’s so much more I left out too. 

TLDR: my now wife suffers from mental illness, I’ve become severely depressed trying to manage it and now I’m at a loss as to what to do. ",25Nov2018,1
216,"For the record, I'm 28. My mom is 45. 

&amp;#x200B;

So two months ago she announced her and my stepdad are divorcing. Ever since she's been doing a ton of stuff that she would never do, never. 

She is sleeping with 19 year olds, smoking pot, vaping, out drinking several times a week. She leaves my 14 year old brother to watch our 11 and 8 year old siblings while she is out messing around. She doesn't spend time with her kids anymore. She is acting like she's 21. 

&amp;#x200B;

A month ago I started going little to no contact with her after she started making out with a married man at the bar in front of me. I was just done. I don't know if this is some mid-life crisis, just acting out because of the divorce, what. It's like she's sleeping around and drinking and getting high all the time but if my stepdad hits on someone she is disgusted and acts like he shouldn't be doing that.

222,"So hey, first time posting anything but I've just been really confused about some experiences I've had. I'm currently 16. When I was a freshman in high school, I must have been around 13-14, my cousin who at the time was 18 did some really weird things that I can't stop thinking about. We were at a family party and I'm not exactly well liked by my family so I was usually by myself but one day my cousin who I'll call M started talking to me and hanging out. I should have seen the signs but I don't know why I didn't. But, when I was younger maybe around 11-12, M would sneak photos of me sleeping or just in general while I was in a room alone, I found out because I felt like I was being watched and when I looked up, I saw his phone camera at the door frame. I thought it was creepy but I just played it off, it was M, he was just messing around. Then he would get more and more physical with me, now mind you, I was like 4'11 and I weighed around 108, I wasn't skinny but I was small. M, on the other hand, is around 6'1 and he probably weighed like 250, he was huge compared to me. He would want to hug me a lot but I couldn't even wrap my arms around him. Well, it started with the hugs but then he would mess with my hair and he would want our legs to intertwine when we were sitting next to each other. I don't know why I tolerated this but I guess I was just happy that I got any attention at all from my family. I guess this is the part that I'm super confused about. At that party, he sat next to me in the living as always but something was different, he wanted to tell me something but he couldn't, so he took out his phone and typed it. I should also mention that my family is Mexican and he doesn't speak English but I happen to be bilingual. He wrote something along the lines of ""Look, for a really long time, I've liked you and I mean I like you a lot. More than cousins, I want us to be more"". I pretended to not understand what he wrote so I could just ignore it but it put it in google translate so I was forced to go on. I told him that I loved him too but we were cousins and that was just wrong. He told me to forget about that part. We kept typing into google translate and at one point, after he realized that I wasn't going to date him, he asked me for a kiss. I was scared, I felt frozen but I said, okay. He was family, I kissed my cousins on the cheek multiple times, it wasn't a big deal cause that's just how Mexicans are. But he just got up and took my hand and walked me to the hallway, he wanted to make sure that our family couldn't see us since they were all outside but my younger cousin and younger brother were in the living room. At this moment, I could feel my heart pounding, I was terrified, he was massive compared to me, I didn't want to do this but I was so scared of what he would do to me if I angered him, I just wanted to get it over with. As I leaned in to kiss his cheek, my cousin grabbed me and held me up before he attempted to french kiss me. At this point, my flight/fight kicked in. I kept my mouth closed but he would just slobber on me, It was so disgusting, I wanted to cry. I moved my head away and I tried to get him to let me go but he just went in again. Once more, I felt that disgusting feeling on saliva on my face. Even thinking about it now really makes me just want to wipe my face off again and again. After this second attempt, I managed to break free and dash back into the living room so at the very least I was in sight of two people. He followed me and google translate was back on once more. He was trying to pressure me into kissing him like that. I needed to loosen up, It would feel good if I just gave it a try, I had to try it at least once before deciding that I truly didn't like it, things like that. I just felt so disgusted, I wanted him to leave me alone and I was saved just a couple minutes later. His family was leaving the party and so he left. However, he still had my number and after he left he sent me a long text message of how much he loved me and how he would treat me right. I just decided to blackmail him, I told him to never get near me again, don't look at me again, don't get in contact with me again and if he didn't do that, I would tell my family. So that ended that, although I've been wanting to tell my mom for a while since at this point, my family has noticed that my mental health hasn't been doing that great lately. But, he was family, we were supposed to protect each other, I really thought that I had a friend in my cousin. Yet, I'm absolutely terrified of him, I used to have nightmares about him, I was so scared every time I saw him. To think what he might have thought about those pictures he took of me, he must have taken hundreds of me in a room just drawing. Why?  Why would did he hurt me and the trust I had in him like this? Am I just overreacting? Any thoughts are highly appreciated. Cause, I have so many experiences that I'm so confused about. I'm also sorry for any grammar mistakes.",25Nov2018,1

I called the nearby hospitals in case something bad happened to her, but they havent had anyone under her name in the ER. Her bf returned to his car and drove the nearby area to search for her.

We both really like each other and we have a amazing sex life together where we both agree its the best we have ever had. One day i accidentally said i love you i completely slipped as a response to something she said. Ever since then she questions how i could actually love her. She has been in abusive relationships in the past and has told me some really scary stories of fights with exes. I really do care alot about her and love her for who she is and just want to show her that ill be there for her no matter what without coming off as clingy or controlling.

But the problem is instead of working on problems with me. She will quit talking to me for weeks completely ghosting me and ill keep trying to talk to her and tell her to just speak to me, But i always have to wait until she comes around. Im not the person to go on tinder and try and find someone new especially when the feelings i have for this person are strong. I wrote her a love letter and she told me she liked it and she texts me saying she misses me. Often i get that feeling like im going to end up sad and ghosted again when i just want to figure out what the problem is.

Am i putting to much on the line or should i keep trying to show this girl that im here for her?

I now work and it’s something I do dearly want. I fear 2 things. 

a) I’ll offend them by getting it myself 

b) I am not that important to them, honestly this was the greatest gift they’d have ever given me. Something I’ve been interested in since I was just 5 years old.

235,"So I had some major social anxiety. I couldnt go up to a friend I knew for fear of them not wanting to talk to me and them disliking me. 

I am a Male and in my 21 years of life, I have never once had someone I actively pursued as a friend. Well that changed. I have been slightly less anxious lately and am able to make some friends with some internal struggle. There is this one girl in particular in one of my uni classes. I feel it has been mostly her that brought about this confidence In me. I want to pursue her friendship. Honestly, although I am attracted to her, I still find that my want of her as a friend is equal or even slightly higher than my pursuit of her as a romantic partner. I havent really hung out with her and outside of uni. we live in different states when on  the seasonal vacations.  We talked about class and very minimally about real life stuff (if at all.) I have, in shame, googled her and found one of her social media profiles where she mentioned, a couple months after I met her, that she is considering dating again, but finds her life too busy. Like i said, I would still prefer friendship even if there is no chance of romance. Its just refreshing to finally meet someone who is passionate about studying something for the betterment of knowledge.

Well for the first time in my life I have asked for someones number. Not just a woman, someones number in general. She just said sure and I put in my number in her phone. A few minutes later, after we said out goodbyes, she texted me so I could get her number. She actively chose to give her number to me. I, Nervously and without thinking, ended the conversation almost immediately by wishing her a good vacation. There was a mishap and I guess that was my in to start a conversation, but I let her have the last word. 

A about 4 days go by and I ask her how her Thanksgiving went. She hasnt responded and I asked in the middle of friday. It's been 36 hours, just did the math, and I dont know how to play this out. Is 36 hours still a short amount of time to answer texts? Should I text her again? Should i wait until i have another opportunity to ask another question about class or some other holiday? How can I find out if she is ignoring me or she just forgot to respond? What are the social rules for texting someone in general whether it be for romance or platonic friendship? ",25Nov2018,1
236,"Hello,

I need some help on finding out what you feel and what your symptoms are if you been drugged and what the difference is between being drunk or drugged...

On Tuesday I was at a party and I remember taking couple shots and drinking couple drinks with vodka that my guy friend made me... Well after I started on the second cup I became very very sleepy and the room became very weird.. I remember trying to understand what was going on but before I could realize I was already on another thought, i couldn't concentrate. 
My guy friend was telling me something but I couldn't respond to him even though I knew what I wanted to say, the words were not coming out.  I felt very odd and nauseous all a sudden.  My legs were like jelly and I started to stumble all over the place.  
Next thing I know I'm laying next to my guy friend and he is kissing me on the couch alone... I try to push him off but I can't even lift my arms they are so heavy and limp. I start mumbling again to get off and still I can't find the words. Then I'm out of conscious again and when I awake this time my girl friends are trying to help me up... 
I have high tolerance for drinking and I was so surprised I was that drunk.  The next day my girl friends say that they were looking for me and I was making out with a guy and before he could do anything else to me they told him to leave!  So if it wasn't for my friends he probably would of raped me.. I was sick for 2 days straight.. I was nauseated, sweating, no appetite, anxiety, depression, i was very aroused for some reason but sick.. Fast heart beat and insomnia. I told my story to my girlfriends and they think I was drugged.... What are your experiences with that and what were your symptoms during and after. ",25Nov2018,1

238,"  It's somewhat difficult for me to explain my feeling to anyone that I would consider a potential partner however, tonight I mustered up enough courage for me to tell my friend I liked them. They are not in a current relationship so I figured it would be acceptable for me to let them know my feelings. So I did, and like I previously said I'm not the best at explaining things but, I done my best and truly thought that I did a good job at letting them know how I felt. After that it was a quite long conversation that ended in neither rejection or acceptance but, afterwards they went silent and wouldn't talk to anyone, even their mother who was present at the time, which made me feel awkward. 
  I didn't detect any anger so I suppose they weren't upset with me, but as time went on I realized that they may need some time alone. After an attempt to say goodbye the only notion I'd received was a void, maybe upset, glance from them.
  Since then I've been thinking of this over and over and cannot gather what had happened.

A few days ago I asked out a girl and she agreed to go out with me on Monday (which is tomorrow). I was really glad she accepted my invitation and basically said ""ok, I'll reach out to you through text later"".
Ok so on Friday we have a party. We are both participating and this one dude is really hitting on her and I think also asks her out. They go for a dance etc., it doesn't really bother me, because she's a free person and can do whatever she likes, so I brush it off, have some fun, get to know some people and just have a fun time.
Yesterday I wrote her as I said ""Hey, lets meet on Monday, I thought ice skating would be fun and we can maybe go for some tea afterwards."" She puts me on seen. Doesn't reply. I don't text anything else, because I don't want to seem desperate. However, that Seen with no explanation is really bothering me.

So today has been really shitty for me.  And I mean,  really,  really shitty.  I woke up from a horrific dream that affected me and made cry during the day whenever I thought about it,  I took a diazapham tablet just to calm me enough, but all in all,  I've been pretty out of it today.  I made a few mistakes at work but not that drastic until this arvo.  My mum is very verbally abusive,  which is why I'm living independently at 16. And today it was non stop. 
A couple came in to return a 1000 dollar reel for a bigger version,  and they left it on the front counter with me, I put it right infront of me to watch it.  I served a guy,  he bought a $600 fridge,  and I must've missed him pick up the reel and walk out with it.  At the time,  I had received another message from my mum and I was reading it.  This is all on camera, and my manager came up infront of all my teammates and the couple,  she told me it was cause I was on my phone and she was pissed. She said to go get my stuff and piss off,  I wasn't even finished with my job.  She held everyone back to help except me,  I was mortified.  I don't blame her,  I love my manager and I know it's my fault.  Im fairly new,  so it's still really hard for me to fit in,  and I get anxious everytime I walk through the doors, and I  have no fucking clue how I'm supposed to go in tomorrow. 

Ps: 
My manager just called me,  she said the reel was  returned and they copped a whole lot of abuse from the guys'  daughter. But apparently they all stood up for me,  and the couple even said they werent angry at me,  and it was really shitty for a grown man to steal from a young girl.

Ever since I made a new transition with the people in my life at that age, I feel like those people always think low of me and disrespect me. My boyfriend tells me that I’m projecting my inner insecurities on to other people, but I’ve been talked down to by kids, teenagers, family, and by my own peers. My boyfriend’s younger brother at age 13 talks to me as if I don’t know anything, and his mother talks to me like I’m not good enough. I had a friend that always talked me as if I was a sheltered baby, my brother is 4 years younger than me but is always telling me what to do and giving me lectures as if he knows so much more than me, and the list goes on. Growing up, I was a pretty confident person but then I had a mental breakdown when I was 19 and got diagnosed with a mental illness. For the first few years, I was really insecure about myself because of it but now I’ve gotten over it completely and have come a long way. However those people who saw me act differently when I was insecure still treat me that way even though I’ve changed. I also thought my weight gain might contribute to how people look down on me. I’ve gained 50 pounds from my medication, and have been struggling for the past 4 years with losing weight. My boyfriend thinks I’m mainly insecure because of my weight, which might be true but in the meantime while I am overweight, I’m not sure what to do. I’ve also become more independent financially and moved out so I gained more confidence, but then I hear from my boyfriend’s brother ask me like a brat what I even did, as if the job I had was shitty. Honestly, I don’t feel like I have to prove anything to that brother.

A very good friend of mine, who also happens to be my boss, and is 13 years older than me (I’m 22) with a family including two kids, who is struggling with extreme alcoholic tendencies (in secret away from his family, though I suspect highly that his wife knows) and doesn’t know how to help himself, and nor do I know how to help him in any way that I can. 

He is aware of his tendencies and he wants to get himself straight, but is struggling. He recently had a mental breakdown induced by stress, depression, anxiety, which meant he had to take two months off work to get through that while attending counselling. He did, and got himself sorted, or so we all thought, yet has slipped again, but this time is turning to alcohol, which he didn’t last time. 

He is going to go back to counselling to see if that will help, but what advice do you have for him and what advice do you have for me regarding what I can I do as a friend to support him?

I don’t want to see him or his family hurt by his actions.

I'm not short on money at all and could live on anything $25h or more.

Current job. 
Perks: $32h, company van, laid back company, good job prospects in future.
Cons: too laid back company and struggle to get change, having to manage/supervise/be a tech, doesn't  do much formal training but still wins big projects, stressful

Job offer.
Perks: $28h ($32.20h after 3-6 months), full training, just have to be a tech with a future supervisor position.
Cons: company starting up in this state and could go anywhere, possible working night shift and holidays, have to buy a car.

Dad's work.
Perks: $28.20h, fuel paid for, get to work alongside my dad, won't be stressful, eventually take over part of business.
Cons: not a promising career if it goes wrong, have to buy a car, part of the work is doing insulation.

So were hanging out, we were supposed to just chill and play video games. (A little more backstory, this was our ""thing"" we would do for a long time. Hang out just us two, maybe play videogames or listen to music, often get high, and have deep conversations or debates.) So this time, we are kinda in our natural setting and he sorta chuckles and tells me he's been really into conspiracy theories lately. To sum up where he's at in that realm, he basically believes most mass shootings are staged, recent natural/manmade disasters were caused intentionally and that most politicians and all the latest presidents are pedophile's in death cults. He was not shy to admit he has ""totally taken the red pill"". He had reasoning for all his claims so I couldn't really argue with him as his mind has bene made and his convictions set. I was pretty caught off guard and this turned into a debate and he wasn't gonna be convinced. It went on for an hour or so, didn't ever turn into a nasty argument and I left, internally pretty upset. He texted me later sortof apologizing and saying ""...all this craziness is just too interesting!"" or something to that effect.

In his defense, he has a very good heart and is 100% a good person. While he took major issue with identity politics, i know him very well and i know that he is not racist or homophobic or bigoted. He is not a hateful person by any means. He mentioned that he sees himself as a ""classic liberal"" for what it's worth.

Here's where this is causing me a lot of grief and anxiety and where it is affecting my life: My girlfriend doesn't know. That night when i got home from our hangout I was pretty upset inside and I didn't want to drop it on her not only because it was hard for me to cope with but also because I don't want to sully her image of my brother. So i acted like our hangout went normal, which i feel awful about by the way.

He and I are alike in many ways but not alike in major ways, and while her and my brother do get along, she has had trouble dealing with some aspects of his personality in the past. He can be somewhat careless and oblivious sometimes, he's not a great planner, yada yada. I have defended him a number of times before to her and its a bit of a sore spot. 

I don't like to keep things from my girlfriend whom I love very much, especially if its tearing me up inside. I know she will be supportive but i really worry she will have a very tainted image of him after learning it. I know that he wouldn't want that. I haven't really talked to him since that day and i think he knows it kinda turned me off, and he would be right, it wasn't an enjoyable hangout and I now cannot really talk politics or world issues with him because it will instantly fall into his narrative of ""truth"". He is a more domineering and articulate than I am and tends to control the conversation. Sorry, i know this is kinda stream of consciousness.

I don't know what to do. I cant go to my parents because I know he wouldn't appreciate me telling them as he already feels misunderstood and misjudged by them and honestly they wouldn't understand. I want to go to my S.O. but I'm scared of the ramifications. I also don't know what to say to him. I don't know how to tell him that i didn't enjoy our last hangout at all. I do know that i want him to know that I will not be following him down the road he's recently chosen to explore and unfortunately adopt.

Hoping for some insight and advice, i feel so lost.",25Nov2018,1

269,"I love dating and but I need to be single for a while. 
I meet a girl, either we go on some dates or hook up a couple times and as soon as I get any hint of a connection, I am in love with the idea of dating her. I’m really good at dating and I enjoy it, but sometimes I wish I had waited to date them because they aren’t the perfect fit in the end. 
How can I tell myself to wait even when my romantic-ass brain is telling me go go go?

For example: Very recent relationship was a year long, it was good and we ended up mutually breaking up because of life goals(study abroad, careers, etc). But the last 2 months we dated, while I was glad to have her as my SO, I was so happy it was gonna end. Because I realized she wasn’t the one for me and maybe I would’ve realized it sooner had I not been so gung-ho romantic to date her in the first place.

Sorry if it constitutes slightly for a vomit draft, I was hoping you could just read as much as you want (it's about 2500 words) and tell me what you think. The idea is it follows someone who's been split in half to two different people AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHO TO PLAY AS, without the player knowing until afterwards. For most of it, it will offer completely different playthroughs, but they soon meet up and shit goes down, essentially.

Obviously a LOT more detail needs to go into something, I've used placeholder names, and there'll be smaller subplots going on, but I wanted to get the main spine of the story downpat, and see if anyone could see a better way of arranging the events.

277,"I'm going to try t keep this short.

My sister dated this guy, let's call him Asshole, for a few months. This guy:

* Basically moved into our house the day he started going out with my sister; he would sleep here, eat here, and get angry at my sister when she told him he needed to go home for a while or when she told him she wanted to go out.
* Would constantly insult my sister and every time she tried opening up to him, he would make fun of the way she felt.
* Put her in danger constantly doing things like driving over the speed limit, forcing her to go out during a weather alert, and stuff like that. He knew she was scared of open water, and one time pushed her off the boat in the middle of the sea and laughed at her while she panicked and held on to the boat.
* He pushed her friends away, talked shit to her about her relatives, about our father, about me.
* He enrolled to her uni to keep an eye on her, and when he saw she was making friends told her she was dedicating too much time to her studies and too little to him.
* He would get angry, and I mean SERIOUSLY angry, every time someone disagreed with him. Even when he was wrong, he would say stuff like: ""you are OBVIOUSLY not understanding what I'm saying,"" and basically tell the person he was talking to (in most cases, my sister,) that they were just not smart enough to understand his point.
* The straw that broke the camel's back was that he managed, in one single evening, to: say some very disgusting things that were a mix of racism and sexism and that made my skin crawl (and had to do, btw, with people who stalk, beat up, abuse, or kill women), blatantly try to sabotage my sister as she was studying for an exam while he loudly played video games and kept talking to her while she was revising, get angry at her when our dad told her she needed to focus on her studies, because she said to Asshole that our dad was right about it. Asshole waited for out mom (the only person he seemed to be scared of) to start hissing at my sister: ""What the FUCK does that mean, uh? What the fuck does that mean he's right? Are you fucking STUPID?"" The next day my sister failed her exam and broke up with him.

Since then, he's been: calling her crying, calling my mom, calling our 16yo cousin to talk shit about both my sister and me (he told my 16yo cousin, with whom I have a great relationship, that they couldn't be friends anymore because I put strange ideas in my sister's head and made her broke up with him. I've never spoken badly about him to my sister until after they broke up, because she's an adult and a fucking hard-head and she wouldn't have listened to me anyway. My cousin was mad at me for days,) started showing up at my sister's best friend's house and place of work and making a scene, driving past our house several times a day to see who was coming and going, and then calling my cousin to ask him who the guy he saw coming into our house (my aunt's boyfriend) was.

All of that, we can deal with. 

A few days ago, though, he wrote something on fb low-key insulting my sister. He didn't name names, but he quoted a song that basically said she has nothing to offer and instead of giving him problems he should have 'jerked him off with her feet.' She then blocked him on fb and several other social media, and changed all of her passwords. Which lead to what is worrying me: Asshole may be a piece of shit, but he is good with computers. That's literally the only thing he has any talent with. Yesterday, someone read something he'd written on fb and sent a screenshot to my sister to warn her. He basically said: ""people think that they're safe behind their smartphones and computers, but even if they change their passwords they should know that where there's a connection, I can come in.""

Now. This could mean two things.

One: Asshole is committing a crime and keeps stalking my sister and just admitted it where everybody can see it

Two: Asshole is full of shit but knows that someone would have eventually told my sister about that post, and he wants her to be scared. 

Either way, this is unacceptable.

I don't know what to do about this. I told my sister to ignore his provocations, but I'm on edge all the time, and I try to make sure that I can wither be with my sister when she goes out, of that her friends are with her at all times when she moves from the house. I have no doubt in my mind that this guy could turn violent, and this last veiled threat alarms me.

I feel like people owe me respect and shit like that, and it often results in me being toxic and abusive. I'm such a piece of shit (i'm never physically abusvie but i'm manipulative and shit) and i tell myself that i'm not a narcissist and that i just have anxiety or some shit (which i do but i'm also a narcissist) and yeah.

I started to think of her flaws and remembered that she's the ""jelaous"" type. Now, she's not jelaous because she's a shitty obsessive person, no, she's okay with me hanging out with other people and shit, she just gets upset when i talk about other girls as friends and how great they are because she was cheated on two times before this relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

My retarded, shitty, toxic, abusive, nacrissistic self used that and started telling her, ugh, that i've met this girl when i was hanging out and how great she is and that i wanna hang out with her more.

I constantly looked at myself as the victim but that's not the case, i'm a fucking toxic fuck which can't have normal relationships with other people.

280,"So, I (25F) am in a really messed up situation.  Let me try to describe it:

Back in August, my boyfriend and I were eating dinner with his mom after we came over to meet her new dog. For the few months leading up to that, she'd been increasingly rude to me and it was starting to wear on me. As we were eating dinner, she again made several rude and dismissive comments. After that happened, I was in shock and I kind of dissociated. While I was dissociating, I saw her hit her new dog. On top of that, she got mad at me for 'not being tough' with him when he misbehaved. 

After all that mess, I told my boyfriend that I thought what she did was wrong. I asked for a sincere apology and a promise to act civilly. Her apology was shitty, but she did promise to act civil, and regarding what I saw about the dog, I guess I just thought it was a one time thing. I was in denial about it, especially since I had seen her with her other dogs that have since died of old age and she was never like that with any of them. 

I briefly saw her between that day in August and last night, but last night (11/24) was the first time I'd spent any reasonable amount of time with her again since August. 

We again went over to her house for dinner, and she kept making passive-aggressive comments about how she couldn't discipline her dog because I thought she was abusive (my boyfriend told her that I had an issue with it...he was there when it happened in August, but he didn't see it). I wanted to try to patch things up with her for my boyfriend's sake, so I ignored the rude comments. 

After we were done with dinner, she went into the living room and the dog started bothering the cat. His mom again said that she couldn't discipline the dog because of what I'd said, and she allowed her cat to be harassed by the dog. The cat had her ears back. I couldn't take it anymore, so I stepped between the cat and the dog while saying, ""No!"" After that, I sat with the dog to try to give him positive attention after what had happened. The dog again started to harass the cat, and I stood up and again put myself in between the animals. As I did that, I heard a loud BANG. I thought I had knocked something over when I stood up to defend the cat. As that happened, the cat ran away and hid in the bathroom, and I ran after the cat to go comfort her. 

In the midst of all the commotion, I forgot about the loud noise that happened as I put myself between the animals. Later, when my boyfriend and I were talking about the rude things she was saying, he told me that he saw her throw a remote at the dog. I gasped and said, ""What?! When did that happen?!"" He told me that when I got up and put myself in between the animals, he saw his mother throw the TV remote at the dog. 

Later tonight, we came to terms with what we saw. After a lot of crying and coming to terms with how awful she is (these past few months since I called her out have been really hard on us), we have decided to report her for animal abuse. This is a highly emotional and awful thing to happen (reporting your boyfriend's mom for animal abuse and dealing with verbal abuse from her), and any feedback, tips, etc. on how to deal with the emotional fallout from this would be greatly appreciated. 

I also would like advice on how to support my boyfriend through this. He is coming to terms with the fact that his mom is basically an abusive asshole. I am a regular of r/raisedbynarcissists, so I am no stranger to this kind of thing (that, and my parents have mellowed out in recent years and I keep visits with them short, civil, and infrequent), and I came to terms with my own family dysfunction over the past few years, but he is just now realizing how messed up his mom is...anything of support there would be helpful.

Once or twice during it I was close to ejaculation but slowed down so I wouldn’t. For about a minute halfway through I pulled out as I went a bit soft, and I noticed a small bit of fluid either on the inside or outside of the condom at that time, didn’t stop to check at the time. Started again and then came. I went to the bathroom and checked the condom for tears etc, and it was fine. It’s just worrying me about what this fluid was. It was see through, but also a sort of white milky colour. I am 99% sure it wasn’t semen, but after having the two incidences where I nearly came I’ve worried myself about it even though I KNOW I would’ve known about it if I’d ejaculated. My own diagnostic is that it was either pre-cum mixing with some of the lube from the condom, semen, or it was “grool”.

Out of all the drones, computers, electronics, fire fighting and army gear they could have stolen - all they took was my bike (that I kept inside for this very reason), my beer and food from the fridge. Even the officer that came in said that was odd...

I called the police when I came home and had them clear the house after I did an initial search. They got me a police report, which I sent to my landlord and filed a claim for the stolen bike/food through my renter's insurance.

He only thinks about himself and is very rude towards my mother. Whenever he is doing something like watching TV and my mother asks him something important he will often just ignore her and act like she doesn't exist. He also blames every single thing on her even  though she does most of the work at home. Lately my mother lost her temper and got really angry with him and his only response were more accusations of her overreacting and stuff but this really isn't the case, he is just acting like a total asshole. 

My father was quite a social guy until his 30s where he stopped socialising with his friends. For as long as I know him he had like 1 friend and I always assumed it was normal for your parents to don't have many friends. He also does not care about his appearance at all. He wears the same clothing he wore 15 years ago and never bothers to do his hair. Oh and he also accuses my mother for spending too much money on clothing (even though she only spends like 100$ a year on clothing). He also believes that the media is lying to us all and that they are the true enemy of the people and that WE are the fools for believing them.

I say ""conscious"" because I got so anxious I had to take sleeping medication and slept through the entirety of all of it.
I have harsh anxiety, thankfully both my parents are supportive and comforting of me when it flares up. (I'm an only child.) But that's where my seemingly positive story ends, I'm not going to Japan with my parents. I'm going to Japan with other family members, two uncles, an aunt, two cousin's and a cousin's husband. 
Both said uncles, not at all comforting. Aunt and one of the uncles I have memories of them taunting me and ""poking fun"" at me when I had anxiety when I was younger which have stuck with me ever since. (I.e ""We're going to do X if you don't stop crying!!"" X being what caused me anxiety in the first place.) Both cousins, son and daughter of previous said aunt and uncle. Younger cousin has very minimal anxiety, enough to feel nervous but never a panic attack. Older, married cousin, likewise, also not comforting. I had recently had a panic attack earlier this year with the cousin and her husband, crying on her shoulder and no comfort from either of them. Husband has potential to be comforting. Other than that, none of my relatives on that side will be able to help me pass over any anxiety attack I have. (Having comfort is an immediate help for all my panic attacks. I can get over it much quicker and can recollect myself and my thoughts.)

I'm 17 years old! I know I can do things without my parents. I've had small panic attacks on my own and have settled them on my own, but this really is what feels like a giant leap of faith. Going into a new ""world"" of unknown. Not knowing anything, a new language, new foods, new sights, etc. I want to be happy for this trip, but the more I think about it, the more anxiety I get. (Which is also not good because I have slight OCD, I pull out my hair when I'm stressed.) I can't imagine choosing to leave my mom's comforting arms to leave to the check-in gate. We can't refund the tickets either, as this was a gift from one of the uncles. I just feel as if I'm stuck in a pit. This gift was decided without me, saying I didn't want to go but given it anyway.

Second, I am taking counseling, so my anxieties and everything else are being helped. My next ""first"" visit is 3 weeks from now and this is something I do plan on bringing this up to her to discuss. (I took the summer off as a break from school and counseling.)

TLDR: Extreme Plane Anxiety. Leaving my parents who help me cope with it, to go with family who aren't comforting and can't help me. Not so much nervous of unknown places, more nervous of long plane ride and away from my safe people.

Some advice starters:
◇ What are some ways you cope with travel anxieties?
◇ What are some travel tips for long plane rides?
◇ Some things I should bring up to my counselor? ",25Nov2018,1
291,"I broke up with my boyfriend of 1.5 years a bit over two months ago for a few reasons - one of the major ones was that I have feelings for one of his close friends (but my ex doesn't know about it). I know a lot of people will condemn me straight away for even asking this question, so I just want to say that I understand that it is one of the shittiest things to do. I feel terrible about it, and have made myself physically sick and anxious about it for the past few months. It's almost all I can think about. But I think I will truly be happy with this guy, and if we are meant to be together then why should the fact that he is friends with my ex be the only thing that keeps us apart? So I know it's shitty, but please give me a chance to explain.

Nothing ever happened with me and this friend (we'll call him Luke) that would count as cheating, but I'm pretty sure Luke has feelings for me too. At the moment, I am friends with my ex and still occasionally go out with our mutual friends. To paint a picture of what our friend group is like, the boys are close friends but they're also not that 'close'. They see each other every weekend, but they aren't all really there for each other emotionally. For example when I broke up with my ex, a couple of his friends messaged him (not Luke) to ask if he was okay, and that was it. So I feel like this makes it a little more acceptable, because it's not as if they're the type of guys who have each other's backs and are loyal no matter what. My ex and this friend even had a massive fight not long ago and didn't speak to each other for about a year.

But while they aren't a tight-knit group, my ex and I were very close when we were together. We lived together and at one point I thought he'd be the one I was going to marry. But we grew apart, and my feelings for Luke got more and more intense the more I got to know him. I have always known that there is something special with Luke since the first time I met him - I immediately knew that we would get along really well. I felt that cliche 'spark' with him, which I never really felt with my ex.

As I said before, I have reasons to believe that Luke feels the same way about me, but I'm not 100% sure. Regardless, I can't carry around this weight forever, and I couldn't live with myself if I never told him how I felt. So I'm going to do it, I'm just not sure how. These are the options I've been mulling over lately:

\- **Option 1**: Wait until February next year (almost 6 months post-breakup) and come clean to Luke. Maybe one weeknight I could ask him to come out to the bar we always go to on weekends and say I have to talk to him about something? Or wait until we're out on weekends and pull him aside to the quieter part and tell him then?

Possible outcomes of option 1:

\- Luke blows up because he doesn't feel the same way, goes and tells our friends including my ex, and I lose all my mutual friends that I have with my ex. However, I don't think Luke is the type of person to do this. He accidentally found out that something about the breakup that I didn't want my ex knowing, and he didn't tell anyone

\- Luke immediately agrees with me and the only issue I have to deal with is telling my ex about us (not very likely :/)

\- Luke blows up and says I'm crazy, but then has a think about it and realises that we are pretty suited for each other, and eventually comes around (I think - and hope - that this is the most likely option)

\- **Option 2**: Wait a little longer than Feb next year (which I'm happy to do because I really don't want to screw this up), and slowly try and get closer to Luke and hope that something happens on its own. This would be less hurtful to my ex because it would seem as though the relationship started forming after the breakup and that I didn't have feelings for Luke while we were still together (even though that's not true, I think a white lie would do more good than harm in this situation). However, I'm not sure if this way will work. What if Luke doesn't want a bar of me now that I'm his friend's ex? What if he never notices that I like him? Luke has no experience with relationships or girls at all, so what if he doesn't pick up on my hints? Then I guess I go for option 1, right?

I'm just so confused about all of this and I need some external advice. I think I will lose a lot of friends in this situation because I know this is such a scandalous and rotten thing to do to my ex. But I am willing to risk it all for this guy. I just hope he feels the same way or can come around to the idea, otherwise I am going to be completely heartbroken and half of my friends will hate me.

TLDR: I have feelings for my ex's friend and I'm unsure how to tell him how I feel.

Thank you!

Edit: My ex was really emotional about the breakup at first, but now he's kinda getting better and he's even started dating (he hooked up with someone a week after we broke up and then started spreading rumours that I had been getting with heaps of guys even though I haven't dated anyone after we broke up but let's not go there haha). So I think he's really starting to get over it.",25Nov2018,1

293,"Well..  I don’t know how to begin this so I’ll just say I’m 28 m. I’ve struggled with myself since I was about 15 when my scoliosis started to develop and throughout the years progressively got worst.

 I was the type of kid that sat at home all day playing video games and on some weekends hung out with friends, now that I’m older though I’ve lost all my friends.. Anytime I went anywhere back then I’d wear layers of sweat shirts and hoodies to try and hide my hideous spine. This limited me a lot from being comfortable enough to go swimming or on hot days I’d suffer miserably in all my layers.

 I’ve also been incredibly skinny all my life and to this day I am the thinnest person I’ve ever seen other than people in 3rd world places struggling with famine. I’m 6”4 and 126 lbs I’ve tried eating foods to gain weight and even supplements to no avail.

2008 I some how managed to get a girlfriend despite how awful I look and we dated for 4 years, this was the happiest I’ve ever been in my life but I was incredibly jealous and worried anybody else would catch her eye.. after all it wouldn’t be hard. Sure enough the end of 2011 she left me for somebody else. Naturally I was devastated and then started to cope through excessive alcohol and drug abuse.. first time in my life I actually felt like I was suicidal.

4 years ago I got my scoliosis corrected with a spinal fusion, I have two metal rods going along each side of my entire spine. I have no mobility in my spine anymore ( imagine having a broom stick taped along your spine) can only bend from the hips. Now I have this giant nasty scar 

I also have a concaved sternum and this surgery for my back has left my shoulders uneven and collar bones looking weird.. I look at all these people every day and just admire their beauty.. how lucky they are to be normal, how could anyone love somebody like me..

I still to this day wear layers just to look like I’m not as skinny as I actually am, I wear Pyjamas and a pair of sweat pants under my jeans and a hoodie, flannel and a vest just to look some what normal.. even then I’m still a twig and under neath I’m a deformed and scarred up freak.

Adding to all of this I have terrible social anxiety and days where I’m just way to depressed to even get out of bed.. this has had me drop out of highschool, now I’m working a shitty job and barely making enough to survive. I’ll never get ahead in this world and I’ll always be alone.. a miracle won’t happen twice to find someone who can see past my endless list of flaws, even then if it did happen I’d know it’s only a matter of time... I don’t really see a point in living anymore, I don’t know what I’m struggling for other than to get to the next day and continue struggling all over again.

 I know how important physical appearance is in this world and I just can’t compete..",25Nov2018,1

300,"I was brought up with a normal school of thought. I did well in school so my parents encouraged me to do engineering. I never even had a chance to breath and think what I wanted for myself. And by the time, I started, things were already moving too fast for me to comprehend what was going on. So I kept on walking on the same path and I got comfortable. I don’t do too badly most of the time but lately, it just makes me more panicked and I struggle to get work done. The things I do (no doubt) are interesting but I don’t like doing them, so I end up procrastinating a lot. That’s actually how I found you on Reddit. But I also don’t want to live in India anymore and restart the hunt to do what I like. And sometimes I question if it is a luxury to even be thinking such things. My parents and grandparents had such a rough life. In comparison, I have had such an easy one. Maybe I am just whining because I don’t want to work hard. Maybe I resent my parents a little as they forced me to become a certain kind of person. But they have been really nice and also encouraged me to do something for myself if this is not what I want at every point, even though they might be disappointed. Maybe the truth is that I am a coward. I don’t want to fail at doing something I might love and failing at something else is acceptable because my heart isn’t in it anyway. There, I said. That sounds so awful. Also I didn’t realize I suffered so badly from the ‘what will people say’ syndrome. I have always talked to biased people about this stuff.

301,"I hit someone’s car a few weeks ago while pulling out of a parking lot and it damaged their front bumper and front quarter panel. Someone I knew was at the scene and said they knew the girl whose car it was but then he disappeared and I left thinking I could find her through him. Well I couldn’t get in touch with him or her after leaving and I tried to message him via social media but did not succeed. Two days after the accident I got a call from a cop and told him I had been trying to find the girl but to no avail. He said he could charge me with a hit and run but he’s not inclined to charge me with anything because the girl was a day later and had moved the car before reporting. (The parking lot is next to a bar and she is 20 years old and was hanging out at the bar). So he gave me her info and I’ve been going back and forth with her on a few quotes for the damage. We got one quote that was really cheap from a person I found but he girl happened to know.

I told her if the work wasn’t to her satisfaction we would work until it was. Well it turns out that she’s 20 years old, and the Car isn’t hers and she doesn’t pay the insurance but her mother in another state who doesn’t speak English so she is just relaying messages between us and her mom doesn’t want to go for the cheap quote.

304,"So two years ago, I fucked up my engineering. Hated the people, hated the building, got addicted to online gaming, royally fucked it all up(two years in a row actually). So, I took a job at a call centre so I can stop being the useless waste of space I was before. I actually was average at studies before my engineering started(no one would expect me to flunk engineering, and even if I wasn't any genius, I used to genuinely enjoy studying my pre-engineering courses of math,physics and chemistry). 

After 6 years of not doing anything productive/brain simulating at all(3 years of job/being waste of space and first three years of engineering which I somehow dragged to completion), I kinda realised how much I missed studying again. So, I watched the first six episodes of 'economics crash course' on YouTube. I feel like I wanna get deeply and understand to at least a decent level, some subject. So my question is, what is a good subject I can start studying that I will be thankful I studied in my future? I would really appreciate it if you suggest some good textbooks as well. Suggestions that might help me during my masters(if I ever get there) are also great.



Note:I have one engineering year left to complete. My college reopens July of next year, so I'm planning to somehow power through my last year to get my degree. Note that I have how engineering is taught in India. The textbooks are a fucking joke, designed just to help you pass the exam. I plan to do the bare minimum once my engineering starts to get my degree(having a degree opens up a lot of avenues in India,even non-engineering related).

I have a rare skin condition where treatment is mostly ineffective. I’m currently on my last two options of a medication and mental therapy but it’s been a few months and nothings changed, so I have no more treatment options. This could very well last a long time.

I’m a 19 year old female and my skin is covered in spots so it looks like I’ve got chicken pox. I can’t work, can’t partake in a lot of hobbies like horse riding and soccer, and I’m losing my ability to walk. It’s scaring me because I really think I’m at a point where I need a wheelchair or crutches or something. I walk everyday but now I can only manage 3km tops if it’s completely flat. Where I live it’s hilly so I can only manage 1km. Obviously, as a 19 year old I’m expected to be healthier and more active, but I’m really trying. 

I’ve mentioned the idea to my parents of needing assistance but they say “you don’t want to get to that point” I can’t help it. They’ll think I’m being dramatic and lazy. So little is known about this disease that there technically isn’t proof that it’s causing my inability to walk so they struggle classifying me as “disabled”

I stated that since I can’t work, I wanted to sell a magazine where patrons buy for $3.50 and sell for $7 and keep all profits.

321,"Well, the title kind of explains it all. The general answer to this question would ordinarily be suck it up and keep going. I’m a freshman at a charter school in the US. It’s super classical with not much variety from the necessary classes. It’s advanced and my worst grade 95, even while taking all honors classes. I hate school. I’m a religious minority there and school is inefficient and slow. I get good grades, I have pretty good friends but I’m just tired of the hours of homework every night for stuff that I will never need. I’m never going to need to know about Plato or know the full plot of the Aeneid. They don’t have technology or dual enrollment classes. I’ve had to teach myself everything in biology as my teacher can’t teach to save her life. I’m extremely self motivated and I truly do love learning.
I have an option though that I think my parents would be ok with. Drop out at the end of the year and go to community college next year (sophomore year). Attend CC for two years until I’m sixteen then transfer to a state university where I would get free tuition (one of my parents work benefits). I graduate there with a degree and only having to spend for books as it would all be online. Then, and this is just an option and probably stupid, I go back to university, get the college experience and another degree, complementing my first.

322,"Ok so i need to rant!! 

I work at a law firm as paralegal. So basically heres how it is. I work for a junior associate. There is a senior partner in our law firm (I do not answer to her and she does not pay me). She is the most toxic, aggressive, rude and miserable lady I have ever met in my life. 

I have worked here for over a year and I cant even count how many receptionists quit because of her. She would throw a tantrum and scold the poor girls bc they RENAMED a file wrong. Keep in mind, most of these girls are a week or so into the job bc they all just keep quitting after a week. 

I have noticed that she has a personal antagonism towards me. Today, some of my co-workers and I were chatting (thirty minutes before closing hours so we were really free and had not much work to do), she walks in and asked us to stop making so much noise, gave a snide look at me and said ESP you notsobnw. I was like what the actual fuck!?! Bc clearly it was not just me talking. Its a working environment, I understand but she cant expect us to stay mum for eight fucking hours.

This one time, she gathered us all and accused us of eating a cake she kept in the pantry. Not once did she ask if we ate it. She literally asked us to not touch her food. We may not be as wealthy as her but we definitely know better than to steal someone else’s food. We felt so bad but none us spoke up or said anything in our defense bc its hopeless. She would cutoff anyone who tries to talk back. Would literally pull out her palms 🖐🏼 and order us to STOP. 

Its so emotionally draining to work at such a toxic environment because you could get scolded for the littlest issue. I am quitting and have given my notice as well. Im really worried for my coworkers though. We are all so mentally exhausted and tired. I would call this work environment harassment. 

I’m up for any advise or suggestions on how to deal with cunty bosses.

324,"So I work in a correctional facility, and the guy that I work with (let's call him Sean) typically is either fifteen to thirty minutes late every day, or just calls out entirely. My suspicion about why Sean calls out so frequently is because he recently got into a new relationship, with one of the counselors that works at our facility, and she doesn't have to be here on Sundays (which is always the first day of the week for us) so if Sean calls in on Sundays then he gets to spend the day with her. So here's the big problem. My direct supervisor, let's call him Don, is basically best friends with this guy. Like Sean teaches a self-defense course that Don takes. It's impossible to talk to Don about Sean because he just makes excuses and tells me to drop it. Now I have another boss, Don's boss. He runs the whole place. I sat down with him and expressed my concerns, and he seemed shocked. He told me, ""As far as I understand Sean is very rarely, if ever, late. And if he was calling in frequently I would know."" So, to me, that says that Don, who does our payroll, is doctoring the time-clock to pay his buddy for time he's not here for and so the big dog doesn't catch wind of it. I told the big boss that the log we keep would show that Sean isn't here when he's supposed to be, and he told me that he would look into it. That was two months ago. The company we work for just recently hired a new HR director who is supposed to be a direct line to the cooperate office. I'm afraid that if I go to her with this though that it could blow back on me, and could potentially get me fired. I would just leave it alone except when Sean doesn't show up I either get stuck doing everything myself or they send me someone from another part of the facility that doesn't know what they're doing and I still end up doing most of everything.

Somewhat long story, TL;DR at bottom- not even sure if this is the right subreddit to come to, to be honest.

TIFU by calling my girlfriend's Indian best friend the n-word. Within my friendship group, and throughout my life, it's been use exclusively as a way to refer to people are 'part of the group', e.g. how's it going, my n***a?; ""my n***a""; and so on.

I haven't known her for very long, and in the year and a half I've been with my girlfriend, the times we've met we've gotten along quite well. Girlfriend gets phone 'stolen' by her friend and she starts texting me to annoy my girlfriend (as friends do). The conversation derailed to me finding out that she didn't know what Fantasia (as in, the Disney production) was, to which I responded with ""N***a what"".

A few seconds later I make an (in hindsight) insensitive joke, as it should have been clear to me that she didn't take the previous comment well.

Though I have reached out and tried to apologize and she promises me she'll read my messages (communicating through gf at the moment since she won't respond), I'm worried that this will permanently damage any possibility of friendship.

TL;DR: i call my girlfriend's best friend the n-word and make a very insensitive joke, as she doesn't approve of the use of the word even when it is not used in a racist context and now she's furious with me.

Having always used the word in a friendly context, I legitimately am struggling to wrap my head around this entire incident, and I'd appreciate some input from folks who've gone through more when it comes to race than I have: is there any context in which using the n-word is acceptable?

329,"Brief summary of me - I grew up in a religious community that had predictably archaic ideas about women. 

Among some of the more charming parts of it were blaming women for sexual assault based on how they were dressed and encouraging women to say in abusive marriages. I was discouraged from going to graduate school because I was “dating a good man and that would ruin things”. I ignored them and went anyway, but not without some pent up festering resentment about the profound lack of support. I rarely visit my family or where I grew up. 

&amp;nbsp;

I wish I could say this was the end of my gaslighting experiences
But honestly, just about all men are like this to a certain extent, and a lot of them have power. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I was later gaslighted and blamed for some problems at work by my boss. I ended up quitting and finding a new job. Less than a year after I left, my former boss was fired, so I feel vindicated. But I can’t get those years of wasted time back, the relationships that were poisoned, nor do I have a reference for my next job. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve been a few relationships where the men were always trying to twist things around and make them my fault or just overall dismissive of my feelings. I’ve been going online dating and I’m amazed at the number of men who start “negging” me right away. Trying to place themselves above me or doubt my perception of their bullshit. I want to curse them out but I don’t because I know that would make me look like the “crazy” one. 

&amp;nbsp;

Not to mention, the internet is pretty much a cesspool of men saying god awful shit day in and day out. YouTube, Twitter, popular news sights, all the comments are always some ridiculous mixture of woman blaming and racism. There’s just so many of them that All their festering bullshit goes unchecked. I find myself going on rants in the comments just because I’m tired of the one sided fight and ONE sided opinion of men overtaking everything and changing the narrative to suit their favor when they really don’t know shit. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m pissed and I don’t know how other women stand can to see and deal with this shit everyday. How do you cope? What do you do when it feels like everyone is against you?

330,"Hello! Hopefully some doctors, nurses, or people who have had experience with abscesses before can help.

I \[20F\] went to the clinic yesterday after having this large red lump in my underarm that was painful. I had the same thing back in September but it wasn't as big and went away on it's own. I had talked to my mother and she mentioned it could be a sign of breast cancer and to get it checked out. I got there and the doctor explained it was an abscess most likely due to an infected cut from shaving. I have a horrible fear of needles and sharp objects but he explained to me that antibiotics weren't going to do it so he gave me a small local anesthetic and used a scalpel and surgical scissors to create a drainage site. He was able to get a lot of it out but not all of it and told me it would need to drain for a day or two and that was normal of sores this size (was like half a golf ball). So he bandages the site, prescribes me some antibiotics and a stronger form ibuprofen then sends me on my way.

Not knowing how often to change the dressing I decided that it was quite wet before bed and changed it up, expecting to change it again in the morning. When I woke however, my drainage site was healed closed, packing was completely dry and the abscess was clearly not drained. I went to the bathroom and used a hot compress and some squeezing to open the site again. I also spent some time squeezing to get excess fluid out to help speed up the process.

Here's where the issue comes in (aside from having a damn abscess);

There is an area of the abscess that seems distinct from the rest, it is still very firm and when I try to press on it to help steer it to the drainage site it doesn't drain anything. The entire abscess used to be like this before the pressure was relieved with the drainage site. Could I have two abscesses right next to each other and the doctor couldn't tell because of the swelling? Or are some areas of an abscess just more stubborn and take more time to soften and drain? Is there anything I can do to speed up the drainage before the site heals again? It is extremely painful to reopen.

Thanks for any help you can offer.",25Nov2018,1
331,"My (26M) business partner (30M) walked right out in the middle of a business related discussion. As we are about to dissolve the company as mutually agreed a few months ago, for the simple reason that after all our 'efforts' it could not generate a significant cash flow to support us or pay its debts. My partner was a business dev/sales and I'm the software developer. I usually never had enough work, so I shifted the blame to my partner whose job it was to do sales and lead prospecting. I voiced my concerns about his lack of effort until it came to a point where I could take being broke no longer. 

Just for a little more detail, Behinnning of the year I started focusing heavily on processes and taught myself a lot of things about operations and management as previously we'd been work haphazardly without hardly recording and measuring any metrics aside from total sales. My partner fussed and rejected all the processes including my suggestion he should get a CRM. Major fights insured but he agreed when we got a client through my process and things were much easier. Not perfect but easier. 

An example of this is my introducing a ticketing system for feature requests and bug reports. Hell broke loose when I brought to light that one can no longer arbitrarily say ""add this"" or ""change this colour "" on a whim. I can mark feature requests by priority and this touched a serious nerve.

So after a few months of this I had enough and told him I can no longer be his business partner and should dissolve the company but willing to remain friends. He agreed but
oh well. Job situation is great since my mind is more focused even though I had 'other' personal issues. 

Today I get a call saying he wants to keep the company and I should resign. We meet at our local spot and tells me this but I have none of it. A bit unreasonable you ask? Not really, because then he started emotionally blackmailing me. Deep down, I have no idea what he's thinking but he mentions that my ""skills are great in the job market and he doesn't have that. "" which is b*llshit in a way. After I say that dissolution will continue as planned he explains then walks out.

A quickie rundown (will happily elaborate in comments)

* She lies incessantly; illness, life stories, even likes/dislikes
* She steals ideas all the time &amp; ppl think it's her ideas (inc. art, mannerisms, catchphrases, style, etc)
* She just... idk neglects me? Yet she's heavily active around other friends
* She cycles through fairweathered friends like they're shiny new toys;
* Shiny and new, she practically obsesses over them. Once there's no shine, she ditches them for stupid reasons
* Constant one-word replies to messages: cool! nice! ah! lol! i see! all right! just the same five or six words...
* She's quite popular and I know that if I ghost her, I have to ghost ALL of our mutual friends without question they are fiercely and almost weirdly loyal to her (she's relatively popular online)

Anyway what concerns me is that due to a bunch of life stuff that kept me in the house for several years, I don't have many friends (she is an 'internet' friend for lack of a better word, but we're pretty close) and I worry that if I decide to quietly ghost, cos no drama etc, I'll just be like... alone?

I have raised this with her once before, politely. I just mentioned I feel as if sometimes it's like getting blood from a stone, and she constantly uses her fake-ass illnesses as the reason she doesn't bother with me.

I’ve tried suggesting a list of things to pick up as a hobby like journaling, puzzles, writing letters, etc. Easy things to do that would help take his mind off things for a bit, but he hasn’t made any effort to try anything and claims he has no interest in any of it. As a side note, I think the amount of assistance he required during the hip recovery has left him feeling like he needs it all the time and has damaged his sense of independence, which is something I voiced early on to his sister. 

He’s also lost his appetite quite profoundly, to the point that he’s been dropping weight quickly and hasn’t been eating regularly or well. He mostly eats frozen dinners or food from a can. I’ve offered to prep his meals for him but he’s resistant to that idea. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has suggestions for ways to help him out of the rut he’s been in lately. I can’t begin to put myself in his shoes and the emotional turmoil he’s going through, but I do think there’s some healthy and creative ways he can engage his mind besides sitting there and worrying himself all the time. Any thoughts would be appreciated. ",25Nov2018,1
347,"It seems like after high school, time flies alarmingly fast. Like the days all melt together and each say I feel like is lost because as an adult I’m always anticipating what I need to buy, what errands I need to do, what I need to pay for, what needs to be done at work (8-5 job), etc.  even if I am trying to spend a day relaxed. Also, I heard it flies even faster after kids which I haven’t had yet (I’m 27) 

I’m at that point where I see FB memories and I’m like- that happened a year ago??

357,"Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in my second year of University and I am debating whether I should take next semester off, save up money and then go travel in Europe for a couple months. What is motivating me to want to travel besides from typical wanting to explore, increase perspectives, challenge myself, is that I have already switched programs once and I am debating switching programs again. I began in physics, switched to business, and now I am thinking about computer science. I feel like I have made educational decisions on the basis of gut feelings without really thinking them through. I wonder if gaining perspective would help me figure out what I want. On the other hand, I have already taken on student loans to go to university, and I don't know whether spending money on things besides school is the best idea. However, the loans are interest-free until I graduate. Another hurdle is that my parents are relatively by the book, strongly prioritize and believe in getting an education. This is not a huge deal as I am paying for everything myself, it can just be difficult to go against people's expectations for you.

360,"So here’s the situation

I’ve always been a quiet and respectful kid. I don’t have many friends that I hang out with outside of school allot but there is one group that I do hang out with often. 

Now on of these friends is the best person I have ever met. She’s into the same types of music as me, hilarious and I’ve had a crush on her for a while now.

Now a few months ago I finally decided to ask her out and it was great! We went out on a few dates and had a good time but about a month later she broke up with me because she just wasn’t ready for a serious relationship. 

That’s ok.

I understand what it’s like just to not want to be in a relationship and there is nothing I can do to change how she feels. We are still friends and even hung out with the group yesterday but I still just can let her go. And while we hung out everything was normal and it was just like we were friends but afterwards I just broke down.

I know that I need to be respectful and let her live her life but I can’t just stop my feelings about her. 

So just how can I be a decent person and just let it go without just negating how I feel?

TL;DR
 a girl broke up with me because she wasn’t ready for a relationship, we are still friends, I know I should but I can’t stop my feelings for her",25Nov2018,1

I’m failing my first semester of college. It’s not extremely hard,  I just can’t bring myself to turn in the things that have been due for me. It puts me in a hole. I feel like I suffer from chronic laziness.. if that’s a thing. 

My dr has put me on a few different medications. Which has caused me to get this gnawing feeling that my insides are decaying from all of the hormones and chemicals (I don’t even take them routinely). My very poor diet combined with that makes me feel like my health is deteriorating. 

I’ve never felt worse in my life. 

My vision of happiness is good grades, a balanced school/work life, healthy eating, and honest interactions.  This hole I am in makes me feel like I am incapable of becoming the things I want to be.

363,"For the past 4 years I have had a very bad stroke of luck and because of so , I had to get 2 open heart surgery , including a heart transplant. I lived with an LVAD for 3 years before receiving a heart..and for the 3 years I was living through constant stress . Not stressed over the fact that I could die at any given moment if my LVAD would stop or malfunction..but rather because of my doctors/clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

When they found the issue they kept me in the hospital in my local town until they couldn't do anything anymore to help me and so they transferred me to another hospital 6-7 hours away.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a closer hospital but the cardiologist whom transferred me knew someone at said hospital so i guess it was easier for my cardiologist? 

&amp;#x200B;

After my surgery they had told me that I had to go there every month but I tried explaining to them that #1 it was 6-7 hours away , #2 I have to pay for the hotels #3 I'm only living off my disability pension and Long term so I wasn't made out of money...but regardless they didn't care and stressed that I came regardless until I manged to push it to every 3 months instead ..to which i've accepted for the 3 years that I was on the LVAD.

&amp;#x200B;

Then in 2016 while coming back from my appointment , me and my girlfriend lost control due to black ice and we're really lucky to have not hit anybody or hurt ourselves. It was about midnight so thankfully not many people on the highways.

&amp;#x200B;

After of which I always had issues driving in the winter time..when I told them about said accident ..(it was a new cardiologist) she proceeded to laugh at my accent ..shrugged off the accident and told me that I was to come in regardless...at the time I was still waiting for a heart and so I just walked it off and prayed that I would get a heart ASAP.

I proceeded to just accept their shenanigans for the next few months until I finally got a call in Dec. 2017 

They had a heart for me and at that very point in time...as strong as I was and as optimistic as I was..if something went wrong and I would've died  , I was OK with it. The way I saw it..I had 3 extra years that I wouldn't of have had anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

But  I woke up..happy and all. Appreciative of the gift I've got..and yes It's not perfect but it beats having an LVAD.

&amp;#x200B;

You would think the stress ends here but nope..for the next coming months afterwards it was constant demands and yelling and intimidation.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of my transplant they have to do monthly heart biopsy on me until the 1 year mark.

&amp;#x200B;

They don't want to give me a heart biopsy via the neck so they go through my leg...because of so...there's only 1 doctor in the whole province besides 1 other (that is in another city so that's out of the question).. that can perform said biopsy and they are blaming me for that..telling me I have to revolve my schedule around his even thought he is only available on Mondays or Tuesdays.

&amp;#x200B;

I also can't drive long distances since my surgery , my eyes are constantly running and my leg hurts(nerve damage) due to a cut they did during the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of so , I have to ask people to drive me to my appointment...but it ain't easy because that person has to have 3-4 days off work to stay with me during the duration of my appointment..but again , they don't care and always shrug it off.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also told them time and time again how much the biopsy hurt me and this one time ..the cardiologist told me to ""tough it out"".

&amp;#x200B;

At the time I'm writing this .. I only have 1 biopsy left until I'm done..but doesn't change the fact that for the past year ..since the surgery..they have been more demanding and at the point where they would yell at me if I had to re-schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to today...I left them a voicemail on Friday stating that I couldn't come in if the freezing rain warning was still in effect..we're now Sunday and they still have a freezing rain warning in effect and so I cancelled. My gf's father doesn't want to risk it.  I'm not looking forward the phone call i'm going to be getting tomorrow morning when they get back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After my last biopsy , one has to think that the only reason I go there now..is for a few blood test...  a heart echocardiography...both of which i can do right here in my home town...but again they insist ""it was to be there"".

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do...when I was waiting for my heart , I felt trapped ..but now I'm at a lost..I'm also afraid that If I transfer me to another hospital and something happens and they need to transfer me that they won't take me as a patient anymore. What should I do? or rather ..What can I do?

380,"Hey! First time poster on Reddit so I apologies if the formatting is wrong (I'm on my mobile).

So, my life has gone in a bit of downward turn when it comes to one of my roommates let's call them B, we have lived together for two years as we both attend the same course and we used to get along like a house on fire. Our house life has always been fairly good, no arguments and our other housemate also gets along well with us but issues started arising early this semester due to him being very closed off emotionally. I would always be very open with him and express worries about things going on in my life to him but in the two and a bit years we've known each other he never let me in to his life, I understand that his privacy is completely his choice, but we wouldn't even hang out. We lived in the same house for  very long time and I would often knock on his door or message him if he wanted to do something like watch a movie or hang out but to no avail. But the thing that broke the camels back was his new liking to one of my close friends let's call her M, M and B have never talked in the years they have been on the same course together, they never even really realised the other was there until a mutual party happened and they began talking. They started acting really close with each other all of a sudden and I was like ""oh that's kinda cute, I'm happy for them"" but slowly it became really clear that B was one of 'those people' the ones that when they want to get in a relationship with someone suddenly they change so much about themselves. Suddenly he wanted to watch films and hang out, but not with me, but with her, which is understandable if he wants to be with her, but also put a big spot light on how little effort he wanted to put into our friendship and how little he cared to try. So I sat down and talked with him about it and he denied pretty much all of it, until I confronted him saying I had asked M and she had confirmed their infatuation and B looked shocked and angry about it, I told him I couldn't be his friend anymore because I never felt appreciated. And so we left it at that. 

Now the issue that still stands is that M and I are still friends, and she wants to be close friends with me (perhaps to keep the peace or whatever) and that's great I like them, but they want to hang out with B pretty much all the time, and if I want to see M I have to see B. I want nothing to do with B as I don't like the person I become when I'm worrying about what they think of me (I become insecure and irrational), I thought yesterday I would invite a load of my friends over and we would all watch movies and hang out, but when I got back with my friends to hang out she was already in B's room and didn't leave for a good while, and when she did she hung out with us for a while when we made dinner, then she stayed 15 mins, did t finish her dinner, and then stayed in B's room the rest of the night even though I invited her over to hang out with me.

It's tiring to try and be either of their friends right now, but I can't avoid them. I need advice on what to do? Am I a bad person for not wanting to be around them?",25Nov2018,1

I have a pretty good fiend that got along great. Went climbing, backpacking, poker, double dates, whatever. No conflicting opinions, never debated about anything. Just nice and chill. We were coworkers but I left that job for a new one. 

Last time he text me it was basically some pics of him and his gf at his party that me and my fiancé couldn’t attend. Told him it looked fun and sorry we could go etc etc etc. Text him a few times about random shit (Okay great people get busy I’ll fuck off for a bit) A month later I realized he stopped responding completely. Then out of no where he text me once about nothing. So I respond like “dude I hope you’re good normally when people disappear some shit really went down” nothing. 

Now the ski season is approaching and still nothing. As it happened, we both elected to go to this new ski resort and ditch the homies. He bought his pass then I bought mine. I guess he could have gone to a different resort but why the fuck would you not just man up and say something? I’m not a clingy person so I’m done texting him unless it’s a call out text. The craziest part is literally nothing negative has ever happened.

391,"My friend is worried about me and says she thinks I'm starting to act like a chav (slang word meaning someone kinda trashy, who participates in dodgy activities, etc), based on how I've spent my weekend. I'm worried this is the case. I don't personally believe this to be true but I want to see if I can get some second opinions. Let me tell you what I've done. 

I wanna start by saying this cousin of mine is also like a best friend to me, he's a really good guy and him and his girlfriend are well liked in the family. 

Friday night I was invited over to my cousins house to play board games (specifically Clue, the one where you have to solve who murdered who where with what) with him, his gf, and three of his friends. I stayed over until about 1:30 in the morning. There was alcohol but literally it was like apple cider, super low alcohol content, no one got even the slightest bit tipsy, I didn't even finish a single can of apple cider. My friend says I stayed out super late drinking, which when you put it like that sounds trashy, but we were literally playing board games and nothing at all dodgy happened. It might've been late, but in my personal view, that doesn't matter as long as we didn't actually do anything bad, which we didnt. If we had 10 beers I would've seen the point but... a half can of 4.5% apple cider? I don't even see that as really drinking. 

Saturday at around 3pm I went to see my cousin play football for this recreational club he plays for along with his girlfriend and a friend of his, to support him while he played. Afterwards, we went and played paintball. I was home by around 8:30 in the evening. My friend says going to football games is trashy... I was literally just going to support my cousin. I do enjoy football but I don't see how going is trashy at all. 

Then today, Sunday, I went to my cousin's hockey game for the same reason with his girlfriend and best friend, to support him. He's now coming in about an hour for dinner with his girlfriend and my grandmother. Again my friend says going to the, and I quote from her, ""trashy hockey game"" is a bad thing. 

In conclusion she basically said I was ""out being chavvy"" all weekend and that she's worried I'm becoming a new person. So, what I'm asking is: do these activities seem particularly bad to you? When I think of chavs I think of going to pubs and getting smashed or just roaming around the streets or sitting at street corners... not playing Clue and going to a football game. But if I'm wrong and I come off as particularly dodgy I want to know... I dont want to be seen that way.

392,"This is going to be a long post, but this problem has caused me so much pain and frustration for the past year and I really want help.

Over the course of the past year or so my college friend group--the people that I considered my very closest friends in the universe--gradually became more distant from me. They said they do not like my boyfriend of two years because he's a ""know it all"" or simply because they don't like his personality or things along that line. They get upset that when we're all hanging out together--my boyfriend included--he seems to pull me away from everyone else. I don't necessarily disagree with them, because he's shy and it's not like they were ever super welcoming or talkative to him to where he felt comfortable enough to mingle among everyone else during a social gathering. But I don't think the blame should be all on him. Everyone in my friend group is naturally shy and reserved so the fact that my boyfriend is being scrutinized for it doesn't make sense.

I'm reaching out to this post because I want to make sure I'm not just looking at it from my perspective and maybe I do deserve being kicked out of the friend group. Once I noticed they were a bit cold I asked them what was up and that's when they disclosed to me that they don't like my boyfriend for those specified reasons. It sucked to hear that but I literally asked for their opinion so I tried to be understanding. I don't think my boyfriend meant to offend them or seem like a jerk but things happen.

I thought good friends were supposed to be able to have normal adult conversations about things that bother them and how to make the situation better but that wasn't the case. They said they still loved me and wanted to be my friend but the next time we all hung out it was weird. Weird as in no one even greeted me when I walked in the door, and many of them avoided any kind of conversation with me. It was nothing the way it used to be before.

What hurt the most is getting text messages from someone I didn't even know very well saying that my ""best friends"" were talking junk about me and my boyfriend at a party I didn't go to because it was so weird last time. This is the very first disagreement or ""fight"" I had with my friends and it resulted in them never speaking to me again and not only that but talking badly about me so other people feel some type of way about me too. It's hard not to get angry and be confrontative with them because the more emotion I show the more they're going to call me ""aggressive"" and make it seem like I'm just emotionally unstable and don't have a right to be mad at what happened...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what advice would be more helpful to me at this point: whether or not you think I'm in the wrong or how to get over friends I had for years. It hurts and it's becoming unhealthy how much I look at social media and seeing they're all hanging out without me. It hurts that it was so easy for them to cut me out of the circle and it totally sucks that no one cares or asks for me when they see I'm not there...",25Nov2018,1

I don't really have many friends, most of them I have met through my S.O. He and my four other friends went to high school together and have known each other for a long time. I've just kinda been accepted because I am in a relationship with one of them.

Three of the four live in our state and we always spend time together. The fourth lives in another state about a six hour drive away. He is the one this post is about. Let's call him tom. 

Tom doesn't really have time to come and see all of us often, but my S.O and I have gone to see him many times. He works for a large tech company and is always very welcoming to us when we come over. He recently returned to our state for Thanksgiving. And we spent time together.

I always thought of Tom as the best of us. He works for a great company, makes a bunch of money, has many friends. But last night after a night of drinking, to me came to me in my kitchen away from everyone else and told me the truth. 

He told me that he was extremely un happy. That he felt so alone and that he was hurting himself. To the point where he didn't want to wear shorts or go swimming because his thighs were so badly cut up. That most nights he doesn't go out with his friends and stays at home to get drunk by himself. That he breaks things and ends up sleeping in his closet. That he really truly wanted to die.

I was so saddened by this. Tom is a good man. He is charming and funny and handsome. He takes control of the room and his smile brightens the day. I admire tom deeply. What made me so so upset is that I didn't know. I had no clue that this man that I care for was so very sad and hurt and lonely. I was shocked. 

I have always been a very straightforward person. When I was younger I was put in a bad situation and would have probably ended up dead in a ditch somewhere if I wouldn't have sat myself down and really changed my life. I don't beat around the Bush. 

It has always been my mind set that everyone needs a good reality check every now and then. But... this was not the time. I told him that I loved him, and that we all cared for him. I didn't know what to say. I wasnt sure if he was coming to me to be comforted, or if he wanted me to be blunt with him. I went with the softer option. 

""You know that we love you Tom. We all miss you so much. Do you think you should come home? Surround yourself with people that will be there to support you?"" 

He replied that he would rather kill himself than move back to our state. That he didn't want to be around his parents. 

I was at a loss. I care so much for this man, and I think of all of these guys as my family. I do not want to loose him. I just... don't know how to properly articulate that to him. After we all went to bed last night, I sent him a message stating that I loved him, and that if he needed me to be there for him all he needed to do was reach out.

First of all let me explain how the uni system works in my country. Uni is free and anyone who wants to go gives tests and according to your marks you can choose a university and field.

I got into uni this year(2months ago) and i have the right to change to a diffrent school if i have high enough marks ,but only once.
Basicly as i got into biology i found out that it wasn t as good as i expected(still enjoyable tho,i guess). I also found out that i m more interested in zoology than other biology fields, which lead me to think that i'd be better of becoming a vet,which has better pays and i would be able to find work easier and close to home.

TLDR; My alter ego fell in love with a girl's alter ego.

About 10 years ago, I created an alter ego persona who was a bit popular in the party scene. My persona lead a music/dancing crew, and our crew went to a lot of raves and parties, all underground stuff. People adored us, the people in this society were always happy to see us. In this particular society, everyone went by characters. It was a chance to be someone else. We painted our faces and/or wore masks and went by fake, fun names. By day I was an office worker with a wife and child on the way. By night I was a party animal. I was faithful and loved my wife.

About 6 years ago-
 I met a girl, let's call her Pink (not her real name or her persona's name). She was clearly younger than me, there were people of all ages there so it was not unheard of. She joined our group. Our group was called ""Remix crew"", but after she joined, people called us ""Pink and the Remix"".  No one in the crew minded or were jealous when she became the star of the show, the face of our crew. She was having fun and so were we. 

5 years ago- people started ""shipping"" Pink and I. Graffiti of us involved us holding hands, some people showed us images they had drawn of Pink and I getting intimate. Pink and I thought it was funny, we never took it seriously. I learned that she was 14 at the time. The fans did not know her or my age since we were always masked in public. Pink started joining our group's day time hangouts where we worked on our music. Pink's real variant was vastly different from her persona: her persona was fun and excitable and energetic. Real Pink was quiet and aggressive and not very friendly or happy.
I also learned that Pink was on drugs. Prescription painkillers I think.

4 years ago- One day, after a night of getting too drunk and partying, I woke in a hotel room naked with Pink beside me. I felt awful, I had cheated on my wife, who had just had our second child. I had never slept with another woman besides my wife before this moment. A few nights later, I went to another party, intending to talk to Pink about the night, but the moment I saw her, the head-hurting guilt I had been feeling vanished. My alter ego loved Pink, I soon realised, and did not love my wife. This, of course, tore me in two. I continued going to the parties, my Alter Ego felt trapped when I tried to wean myself off of it. He had to see the woman he loved, I had to stay with my wife. He met up with Pink at the parties, I know I shouldn't have kept going, but it hurt to be away from my crew. I made mistakes I regret. My Persona continued to be with Pink.

2 Years ago: The underground clubs we went to were shut down. The crew separated.

1 year ago: I lost my wife and our two boys in a terrible accident I would not like to go into detail about.

3 months ago: I saw Pink at a pub. I didn't speak to her, she was drunk. 

2 months ago: after seeing Pink a few more times at the pub, I happened to arrive before her one day. I tried to talk to her, she was short with me.

1 month ago:
After frequent meetings at the pub to talk,  I learned that she was on much harder drugs now. One day, she came back to my place with me. We had one too many drinks and slept together.
I didn't feel bad or guilty. It was the first time in so long that I didn't feel alone. It felt good to have a body curled up against mine. I took her to dinner and out around a few times, but she has made it clear that she feels nothing for me, barely a friendship. She is willing to help me feel less lonely, nothing more. The spark my persona had for her's is still there, but it feels like her persona is hidden away in that drugged up, miserable shell. She's in a group with bad people now. She has revealed to me that one of them touches her, and that thanks to him she has trouble sleeping with men while sober. I love her, I want to protect her and take her in, give her a place to stay and my bed to lie in, give her everything she needs, but she doesn't want it. She is on drugs, letting people hurt her. She insists that my feelings are for her persona, not her. That I don't know her. That she doesn't know me. I feel so confused.

Any advice on how to deal with this?",25Nov2018,1
413,"So I recently was offered a job opportunity that has always been my dream job for really as long as I can remember. The thing about this job, is it will require me to travel all over the united states and possibly to other countries as well. I have been with my fiance for 5 years and he is everything I want in a man. I want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him. However, he has told me that he does not to be with someone who is never home and is always traveling. He has told me this ever since I met him.  

So here I am, having my dream job that I have always wanted at my fingertips but taking this job I will lose the man of my dreams in the process. I guess, I just don't know what to do. I have a good job now. I'm okay with it, it's not what I saw myself doing or really wanted to do for the rest of my life but I could accept it I think. I don't want to make the wrong decision and I only have until the end of the year to decide. which I know is still over a month away but it's been weighing heavily on me.

414,"Hi. I think my father might be abusive, but im not sure if he is, or how to put his actions into words. I've talked to my mother a bit about this a while ago and she says that he's probably emotionally abusive, but she doesn't wanna do anything about it.

417,"I was raped 10 months ago by my friend and her boyfriend and after looking into it I can't afford therapy. My rape has lead to a lot of issues that are affecting my relationship of a few months, mainly that I distrust everyone and sex makes me super anxious, I never really enjoy it. 

I try to be trusting but I just keep getting fucked over by everyone I ever trust. For me it wasn't even the rape that was the last straw, it was one of my ""friends"" undressing me while I was black out drunk /after/ I had told her about it. I don't even really care to make friends anymore because all people ever do is hurt me anyway. I try to trust my boyfriend, but I'm just not very good at it. I have made progress, at first I wouldn't let him drive me anywhere and I refused to be alone with him without my dog present (though really I refused to go anywhere without my dog except for work and the grocery store). He still says that I don't trust him though, and while I try to deny it he is right. I try to trust my boyfriend, but I have a mini panic attack anytime he has my phone and I secretly think that he might cheat on me, even though he has said that he wouldn't do that. I don't even really know how to trust anymore. I thought that I was trusting him by sleeping with one eye open, so to speak, but after having a talk with him I don't know how to do it with both eyes closed.

Also sex is just terrible. In the beginning I was able to force myself to have regular sex but instead of it getting better it's just gotten worse to the point that I can't initiate. The serious thought of me initiating damn near makes me have an anxiety attack and I very quickly lose the desire. Also my boyfriend has stopped initiating too because I freaked out the last couple times. Disliking the sex is honestly a two fold issue, yes the rape messed that up for me but also the fact that I never orgasm just makes it even worse. This is partially my fault I guess, I  can't express my needs in bed because I'm too busy freaking out on the inside. Most of the time I just want it over as soon as possible, and the other times I don't feel like my wants matter anyway. I still want to have sex and be intimate with my partner, but I can't go through another session with nothing but complete discomfort on my mind. ",25Nov2018,1
418,"I work in retail with a background mostly in retail and warehouse work, ranging from general package handling to being an inventory clerk. I live in the US and the most I've ever made is $15/hr, currently making $14/hr after I moved back to my home town about two years ago and got another job. I'm well aware that it's the most I can make in retail without becoming a part of management. My original plan was to work the jobs that I have been while studying for my desired field, but as of now that's pretty much fallen through and I'm looking to get another job. Something that I can pour as many hours as possible into, rake some money in, and get myself back on track.

I'm in my 20's, healthy, and willing to relocate ( within the US ) and work literally as many hours as I can get. I'm no stranger to getting dirty and I'm perfectly capable of constantly lifting 80-100 pounds. My goal is to find something that, ideally:

* Pays at least $13/hr
* Tons of overtime that's either mandatory or optional
* Doesn't require constantly racking mileage in my personal vehicle
* ( Optional ) Requires stints of time away from home, or on-site living while working

The last bullet is there because it'd help me focus on working and also reduce other expenses. Currently the only job types I can think of are:

* Oil Field Worker
* Miner
* Tug Boat Worker ( can't remember the actual title )
* CDL Driver

All of those typically pay well given the heaps of overtime and the often times intense work environments and required time away from home which puts people off, but in my case it's more of an attractive option. While I love my immediate family, I don't have a wife and kids so I can afford the time away from them and likely still call/video chat with them ( although maybe not if on a tug boat ).

I'm looking for advice on where to proceed from here. I'm not aware of any other jobs that exist that fit my criteria, nor how to approach getting the jobs I've already listed above. On top of that my family isn't really on board with me taking such ""extreme"" measures to earning a living, so I have a hard time selling it to myself sometimes. I don't really intend for it to be a long-term life change, but rather for the foreseeable future ( 2-5 years is my rough guess ). If anyone knows anything about the job types I already listed, jobs that I don't know of that would also fit, or general feedback on my decision making process with this, I'd much appreciate it!",25Nov2018,1

But I didn't really do anything to get to that point other than accidentally starving myself and eating small meals. I have no appetite. Diet pills dont work, they just raise my blood pressure. 

My doctor has me on Topamax which is a migraine/seizure medication that has a side effect of weight loss. I read that it is usually good at crushing cravings but the thing is I don't have cravings. All these weight-loss tips and plans revolve around eating less and cutting out food but I need motivation to eat more. Are these pills doing more harm then good since I have such a small appetite to begin with? 

Im honestly at a loss at this point. I hit 249 and jumped back up to 260 and began to give up because it all feels so pointless. I struggle with depression and very low energy so when i make an effort to diet, I end up just starving because I have no energy to cook or meal prep.

TLDR; My alter ego fell in love with a girl's alter ego.

About 10 years ago, I created an alter ego persona who was a bit popular in the party scene. My persona lead a music/dancing crew, and our crew went to a lot of raves and parties, all underground stuff. People adored us, the people in this society were always happy to see us. In this particular society, everyone went by characters. It was a chance to be someone else. We painted our faces and/or wore masks and went by fake, fun names. By day I was an office worker with a wife and child on the way. By night I was a party animal. I was faithful and loved my wife.

About 6 years ago- I met a girl, let's call her Pink (not her real name or her persona's name). She was clearly younger than me, there were people of all ages there so it was not unheard of. She joined our group. Our group was called ""Remix crew"", but after she joined, people called us ""Pink and the Remix"". No one in the crew minded or were jealous when she became the star of the show, the face of our crew. She was having fun and so were we.

5 years ago- people started ""shipping"" Pink and I. Graffiti of us involved us holding hands, some people showed us images they had drawn of Pink and I getting intimate. Pink and I thought it was funny, we never took it seriously. I learned that she was 14 at the time. The fans did not know her or my age since we were always masked in public. Pink started joining our group's day time hangouts where we worked on our music. Pink's real variant was vastly different from her persona: her persona was fun and excitable and energetic. Real Pink was quiet and aggressive and not very friendly or happy. I also learned that Pink was on drugs. Prescription painkillers I think.

4 years ago- One day, after a night of getting too drunk and partying, I woke in a hotel room naked with Pink beside me. I felt awful, I had cheated on my wife, who had just had our second child. I had never slept with another woman besides my wife before this moment.

424,"Sorry for a lot of text. I have a lot to get off my chest. I need your thoughts on this matter..

My boyfriend and I had some hiccups in our relationship. A situation came up with a child involved (previous relationship) and the way he handled it caught me off guard and it panicked me. But I understood his intention and recognized the actions he took to.. well, make it better. 

The affects lasted a bit, i had to cope with the idea that there may be a kid in my life that didn't come from me. Some things hurt for a while even after forgiving the person, too. But it was ok, we were moving forward. He was empathetic and sweet, he started lifting me back up again and i told him i want to support him and the kid if it does end up being his.  

But then he started to quit smoking cigarettes. He's been wanting to do this for a while but failed in the past. Now, with how sick it makes me (allergic to it and also asthma, so double bad), he found more motivation to try again. I appreciate him so much, I try to give him positive encouragement and thank him often. He would smile and seem happy about it. 

Then withdrawals get the better of him and suddenly he's not the sweet bf he usually was. I expected this but not to the extent it's reaching. 
We have far more misunderstandings in our communication, which is so so so flawed or nonexistent now. His irritability makes it hard for me to talk about anything, even joking around like we normally would. He ends up assuming I'm implying something negative or if I AM complaining about something, he explodes it out of proportion. 

Like sometimes I hardly see him cause of his job. I'll complain because I miss him, and he'll start saying passive aggressive things like ""I'll just quit and be miserable and I'll have no money"" ect ect and it ends up this long battle where I'm just trying to defend myself. 
Like dude
I missed you. I only asked for a hug. But even saying that, he hisses something aggressive back. There's no end. 

More recently I had a fit of anxiety over being physically in an uncomfortable situation for hours. I coped until we got home, then i had a break down. I said I was just having a moment, but everything is fine. He's seen me like that before and usually would hug me, roll me in blankets, make me food or turn on a funny show and laugh a lot until i start laughing too.

But this time he ignored me and i just cried in the next room for a while. I thought to myself ""it's fine, i can't rely on him every time. It would only become a problem right now"" 

We ended up arguing the next morning though because i asked him about our plans for that day. He got snappy like i was so wrong for bringing it up when he wasn't in the mood. Then For the second time, he blamed me for all our recent problems because i get upset. Like the previous night of me crying, having absolutely nothing to do with him, he knows i get depressive episodes like that.  but it's still his problem i guess. So i should just stop getting upset in general. 

I shoved myself away from him and he realized what he said. Immediately tried to reel it back and apologize. But it hurt. Even knowing he's just extra mean right now cause he quit smoking 2 weeks ago. It still hurts that this person is being this rude to me.

Last night he misinterpreted a text. I immediately realized it and corrected it, telling him what i meant. But he still freaked out more, basically telling me how terrible i am for him and i put him under too much pressure. 
Our relationship almost ended at this point. 
Then he crashed and said ""I don't know why this is happening. I don't want to fight with you and don't want to make you upset."" And apologized for his aggression. 


I don't know what to do though. Im just forgiving everything and crying in my room. It's only been 2 or 3 weeks of this transition. I don't know if it's all from withdrawals or not. If it is, I just want to take the verbal beating until it wears off and i can finally have my gentle bf back, cause i love him far too much to give up easily. But it hurts so damn much. I feel like i need advice or encouragement, but i don't have friends to talk to on this level. So here i am.",25Nov2018,1

426,"I am 23 living with my parents trying to finish school. I moved back with them in august  2017 after a roommate agreement fell apart 3 weeks before move in with an Alum Fraternity brother. He had someone else move in 3 weeks before I was supposed to because he made some dumb agreement to allow that person to move in at any point in a year period. There was no lease because I didn't think we would need one. He offered me a room, bathroom for only $450/month close to school which is super cheap. I didn't have enough for first, last month and security deposit because in those 3 weeks I had a trip to NYC/Long Island to visit my fraternity little brother and his family. I looked for other places, but to no avail. I needed a cosigner and no one would sign for me. I also didn't want to live alone because I do not do well in solitude. While in NY my dad has a heart attack so to help my family I moved home, which is only 45 away from school. Fast forward to October 2017 my mom us caught drunk at work gets suspended and loses her license (she is  a nurse) so times got tough. She got help and now is sober, which I am so grateful for and has her job back. Fast forward to August 2018, my school tells me I have reached my federal loan limit. I know I made mistakes when younger, I failed some classes, have had 5 majors and used my loan money to pay rent. I have turned my life around and get good grades and stay out of trouble. Due to my moms suspension I was allowed a change of circumstance which helped get money to pay for 2 semesters ( I graduate fall 19). My parents have been big drinkers and never good with finances (kinda go together). I'm a Personal Finance Major and helped create a budget, a spending log of past transactions to break down and show how they spend money. They have never owned a house and my goal is for that to happen. (My parents were so happy and I felt like the best son ever) Last month my dad goes into the hospital with bleeding ulcers and the doctor says he needs to stop drinking or he will get very sick. My dad is 5'7 around 300lbs (49 yrs old) and i know he will die early if he doesn't change. He stopped drinking for a bit, which is good because he has been a nightly drinker until he passes out for a long time. My suspicion rose a few weeks ago and while in the car with my mom, I asked if he had been drinking again. She said no and today I found out she lied to my face. I have a lot of love for my parents and just want to help them, but they lie over and over again. I've been on the shit end of the stick of their lies since I was young and drunk tirades. Verbal, Emotional abuse with overall neglect. I don't have enough money to move, I'm struggling to pay for school and I'm just heartbroken due to my parents.

Later, she said that she had to go, but asked for my Snapchat, but I declined and gave her my Instagram and told her I would DM her later.

429,"I've (33 F) been friends with Grace (27 F) for over 5 years when she first moved to Northern California from Southern California after college. We both met at work and I ended up becoming her first friend when she moved. She was always very nice and fun to be around and for the most part, we had a wonderful, drama free friendship for the first 5 years. We mostly went out to bars, dinners, happy hours, the movies, and every 4th of July I would go down South to to be with her family and friends. A solid friendship. In March of this year, I decided to do something crazy and quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Southeast Asia. She was fully supportive and encouraging. 2 days before my trip, I started experiencing some intense burning and pain in my body, but didn't go to the doctor and decided to deal with it when I got to Asia (I had traveler's insurance). I was gone for 2.5 months traveling, but this trip that was supposed to be lifechanging and amazing ended being awful. When she checked in on me during my trip (which was VERY rare) I let her know what was going on and she didn't say much. When I came back in mid June I started going to see the doctors and they thought they figured out what was wrong with men but it turned out there was more to it than they could comprehend. I got extremely depressed, since this was going on for 5 months of pain at this point and I never felt support from my friend when I would talk about my issue. She kept saying this like ""This is all in your head"" or ""This is psychosomatic"", which are SUPER hurtful things for me to hear especially going through this pain. After much debate, I confronted her at the end of July about this, and asked her ""why would you say something like that... I am not making up this condition"", to which she replied ""I don't know"". After I left that talk... the relationship changed for me. Where my the friend I knew and loved? Why wasn't she being supportive? Whenever she had a problem, I was there to listen to her with zero judgement and always gave her my support. So fastforward to the end of October, I haven't seen or spoken to her in a month at this point, and she texts me asking me for advice on where to go to Thailand since I was there for 3 weeks during my travels. So I am helping her with her trip and then I mention ""Btw the burning and pain came back and I am super depressed again"". She then ghosted me.... and I was pissed but didn't want to call her out on it. Then the day after Halloween she sends a group text to me and a couple of other girls and shared with us that her grandma died, but then started sharing photos of her and her new boyfriend and what they wore to a Halloween party the night before. Apparently she had to fly to SoCal over the weekend to see her grandma, but flew back after she died and went and partied. At this point I am like ""Why didn't she text me back... but she can text the group about Halloween stuff?"" So I did something I probably shouldn't have done but I sent her a private text that read ""I just kinda needed a support text from u too from what i texted the other day. It's been 8 months of this for me. But i know you've been busy, but a quick text is nice too 😊"". To which she replied ""Wait I'm super confused, are you mad at me? I'm so sorry that you are dealing with that again, I know it can't be easy. I was literally watching my grandma die and didn't respond to anyone. I hope you can understand that"". But her grandma died on Monday and I texted her on a Thursday.... so she was definitely ignoring me. So we stopped talking again for another month and I asked for us to meet in person and have a very honest conversation. Here is what I need advice about: I had asked her again why she said ""this is all in your head"" regarding my medical condition and she finally said ""because you're a hypochondriac"". At the time I didn't think anything of it, but now that I have had time to think about it more, I'm so pissed!! Even if I am a hypochondriac doesn't mean you as a friend should judge me or not support me, especially since I have always been there for her and the fact that I kept telling her I was depressed! I stopped drinking alcohol and we now party less together, so clearly something is wrong. She never believed me that I had an issue and that sucks so much. So now I'm not trying to have another talk with her about this again, but I'd rather never see her again. Please give advice on what I should do. ( BTW we also talked about her grandma and I apologized to her for that but she has  NEVER apologized for not being there for me). ",25Nov2018,1

I noticed how he’s a generally sad person, and never talks about it, and it actually helped him to talk to me about it. This is something that’s normal for me and my friends, talking about feelings. But as we kept going, i found out about how he, in the past, huffed rubber cement to get high with friends. This made me extremely uncomfortable, but he said he hadn’t done it in a while, so i proceeded on. Forward to yesterday night, when i told him if he did it again i would end whatever we had. He then admitted he was with the friends he did it with before and they pressured him into huffing rubber cement again, but this time he was worried because he realized the dangers. I really like this kid, but drugs are something that don’t bode well with me. He promised he wouldn’t do it again, but i’m more worried about how his friends are pieces of shit who he needs to get away from and his depression making him care less about his consequences. i don’t want to end things with him, but this is stressing me out just to think about, makes my stomach hurt thinking about anyone i care about doing that. what do i do??",25Nov2018,1
434,"Hey Reddit. I’m an 18 year old senior in high school and my girlfriend is now around one week late on her period. We’ve had sex around 10 times, every time with a condom the entire duration. She says she usually never misses her period, so I’m preparing for the worst and going to say she’s pregnant. 

Now, my parents are extremely catholic and very crazy. I’ve recently been admitted to a very good school which I want to attend, however I need the money which my parents were going to offer. If they find out I got a girl pregnant they will kick me out on the street and disown me I’m 100% positive. What are my choices here how should I approach them?",25Nov2018,1
435,"So a few weeks ago I went to grab some takeout food. A random guy said hi to me like he knew me while sitting with some other people. Without thinking I asked how they were back but kept going into the restaurant. I got a phone call while I was picking up my food so I walked out quickly and brushed it off. I had no idea who he was but figured he had mistaken me for someone else and tried to forget about it. 

Five minutes ago I was walking my dog in my apartment and he is walking up to me. He says hello again and laughs about how I didn’t recognize him at the restaurant. I didn’t catch it at first because again I have no idea who he is. Now I’m kind of a worried that this guy in my apartment complex (not a direct neighbor) thinks he knows who I am.

436,"My name is on the lease and I actually pay my rent on time so I told her no, obviously, that's not how this is gonna work. Me and my friends smoke the occasional weed so if she wants to do drugs I don't care because she doesn't get into trouble with it and I needed a place to live. (Although she lead me to believe it wasn't like this when I signed on the lease)

But recently she's been bringing over like 7 or 8 people with no warning at 3am and they all drink and party and do drugs. So she came into my room last night and I had 3 people in here with me (that I told them earlier would be here and 2 of them were staying the night) and started making a scene saying it would be an extra charge on everybody that 2 of them were minors so I can't bring them over anymore. I reminded her that my boyfriend of 3 years that is here all the time is 17 too, that's a ridiculous request and if she's that worried find someone elses house to have your parties and she still thinks I'm in the wrong. 

How can I explain this to her, or is she right that I need to protect myself because of her choices. I already tried getting out of the lease before because she does shitty stuff like this all the time and I can't. ",25Nov2018,1
438,"Hello all! I was hoping to get some advice and maybe some things to think about that I havent thought of yet regarding this situation. 

Back story: been wanting to leave long island/nyc for years. I am 31 and have lived here my entire life. Did well in university, got a masters degree and graduated top of my class, became a mental health counselor and college professor. Still dont make enough money to move on my own and I'd like to. 

I've always wanted to go into medicine and after taking courses and being in therapy for years, I realized I needed to change my career if I wanted to be happy and have a chance at not living at home forever. 

Started applying to PA and nursing programs. Turned down a PA program because of personal family issues I needed to take care of. Because I work full time and additionally part time, I'm not able to meet the shadow requirements for PA school so decided on nursing. I got into 2 schools (waiting to hear from a third.) And here my is my dilemma.. 

School A) 12 month accelerated program.  Great school, location is not where I'd like to be. It's still in NY and its bitter cold. Expensive but doable with loans. Starts may and would end may 2019 which then I could move south for my phd or doctorate. 

School b) 10k scholarship, southern ivy league which are two things I've been dreaming of since high school. Same cost as school above otherwise and 15 month. Better licence exam rates, job placement, better research opportunities for what I want for eventual doctorate. Starts january 10th. So very soon. Option for possible deferment but would need to reapply to do so and would lose my scholarship. 

I wanted to save up for a bit because working will be tough during it. Thankfully I have a little bit of family financial support and I do have about 3k saved up (had to buy a car recently after mine died). I would give my mom my car while I'm at school b if I go. 

I'm not sure what to do. School b is my dream and both would be the same cost in the end about. Still applying for more scholarships. Just the immediate leaving is my concern and not having a good savings cushion. I would still work a little wherever I go. 

Please reddit, what would you do? Thank you. ",25Nov2018,1
439,"So without going into too much detail, I went through a break up and moved back to my home town a few months back. I have depression and anxiety, which is medicated, so my brain keeps creating situations in my head about the ex and the person I was left for.  I’m not wanting to get back together, so that’s nothing to do with it, the pain is just the betrayal. So I’m finding myself getting angry and upset intensely for periods then I’m relatively okay. But recently I’m getting down about it more often than not. 

I was wondering what ways you have gotten yourselves out of these sort of funks. Any motivational things? I’m gonna basically compile a list to “de-fuck my head” and get myself to my best damn self.

440,"A little further detail:
I am a man living with two of my best friends. They are both beautiful girls. We have recently moved into a new place together, and for the longest time we were the best roommates you could ever hope for. Since our move, things have become complicated. I mistakenly began sleeping with one while we still lived at our last place. She is the one who loves me now. We’ll call her X. 
Since right before the move, I realized I was developing feelings for my other roommate. We’ll call her Q. I never told Q about these feelings until after she and I slept together the first time. Again, a mistake, but I wanted it more than anything. Q told X because she felt guilty, and it has led to a whole host of problems. We all fought over it but eventually made up and decided to fix things to get back to the way they were. Stupidly, I slept with Q more after that, and with X as well, separately. I don’t believe they’ve talked to each other about it since. But now X keeps asking me if I’m in love with Q, and I don’t know how to answer. I am. I desperately am. But I know X only asks because she is in love with me. She has made it clear. So my question is, what the hell do I do? I love these girls with my whole heart and they are friends I am unwilling to lose. I can’t handle seeing Q bring other guys home (it’s only been one, but it was the night before thanksgiving and he was there for our thanksgiving party). Please help. I don’t know anyone who has been through something like this, and believe me it might sound great to someone but it is tearing my mind apart. I don’t want to move out and they both implore me to stay, but I feel like it might be the only way to keep my sanity.

441,I just need some advice on how to go about this. So my boyfriend and I have been together for almost four years. I found out a few days ago that within the first week we started dating he had made out with another friend of his. Also in the past four years he has repeatedly asked girls to come over and cuddle.

(we're both 19 years old). It's been three days and the bruises still hurt and I find it difficult to sleep on my arm. Why the hell would a guy act this way toward a girl? Does he have a violent fetish and enjoy hitting petite girls? What do you think of such a guy? and what should I do? ",25Nov2018,1
443,"As for the medical things, I had a seizure in class in the third week of school. I had four after that and then was diagnosed with epilepsy. I had to take two of my exams the day after spending 48hours in the hospital. Shortly after that I developed pneumonia. At the beginning of October I was the victim of an accident where I got a real bad concussion, epilepsy seemed to get worse. And two weeks after that I got the flu. 

It’s more of a series of unfortunate events that have been timed poorly to where they always happen right before an exam. I haven’t done well. I have two exams tomorrow and I appear to be getting sick AGAIN. My head is extremely foggy and I am worried studying is going to be hard.

The girl that I’m into has been a bitch to everyone for no reason for as long as I can remember and a lot of people don’t like her. She used to be rude to me in past years, but recently we’ve started talking. I don’t even remember how it started, but it did. 

A few days ago she admitted that she’s been into me for a while. I didn’t mention how I feel, because I’m still being cautious, but I’ve also been into her for a while. I’m worried that she’s just setting me up for something to ruin me. She recently said that she was only mean because she felt insecure about herself, and also apologized to me. She’s been nothing but nice. 

It seems like she’s changed, but I’m just worried that I’m getting set up for something. I’m really close to a few other kids in my grade, who don’t like her at all. They all said it was okay if I started dating her, and that they would support me. This was really important just because of how close my friend group is. Even though they said they’re okay with it, I feel like it may strain some friendships and I’m torn on what to do.

Since then we still talk but she keeps going in circles breaking up then getting back together then breaking up again. From what I've heard this guy is very immature, especially compared to the girl, and the relationship is really one-sided, with her basically taking care of his rent, transportation, etc. And she talks a lot about how much she dislikes his attitude and oftens compares me and him. 

My problem is this: I do like this girl but she's continuing to date this guy. I feel like I'm being used emotionally in lieu of the immature boyfriend and I don't really enjoy it.

450,"In August, I decided to attend an out of state institution for a masters degree. It is not the same as my undergrad institution but is ranked as a better school. Originally, I had only applied to two out of state schools for their masters programs and went with one that I felt would better suit my needs in order to get to medical school. At that time, there was a new masters program at my undergrad but I felt the curriculum wasn’t as strong as the out of state school I wanted to attend so I decided not to apply even though the tuition would have been half the cost of the out of state school. That time, life was pretty good and I was excited to start this new journey. A couple weeks before I moved to the new school, my girlfriend and I broke up after she decided long distance would be too hard. This of course devastated me and still does at this point. I continuously miss my old friends and old life I had in undergrad as most of my friends are still at my home undergrad either in other programs or in med school. My parents have decided to pay for my school and not take out loans on behalf of me so I understand the financial burden I have put on them. Life in the new city as been difficult and an adjustment but mostly a depressing time where I just haven’t found a lot of happiness. I am content with my life and grateful for the opportunity but am genuinely not happy. I have tried to find friends and new hobbies and have been able to but still feel very lonely and depressed at times. Recently, I decided to check out the masters program at my home undergrad online and realized their program is a lot like the one im attending now and some of their classes seem more interesting and relevant to my med school vision. Now, I feel even more guilty about choosing the more expensive school and keep wondering about what if regarding my personal life, education, and finances. I had a happy life before and thought I could still have it while in a different state but I feel very wrong about my decision. So freaking lost and confused. ",25Nov2018,1
451,"Hello, I’m 16 and a sophomore. I want to get the full high school experience. Going to party’s, time to time drinking alcohol, smoking weed, etc typical high school shit. How would I engage in all this without letting my grades slip or falling classes?",25Nov2018,1
452,"I am in my mid 40s. I have had a successful career in tech for the last twenty years (support, operations, strategy- not coding). I am really good at this type of work (even though I don't enjoy it) and tend to get promoted every year or so to take on more responsibility, take on more direct reports, etc.

Sounds great right? Except I don't want to take on more. I'm not motivated by climbing the corporate ladder- I'm motivated by learning and doing a great job. I just want to do what I do and not have the stress of added responsibility.

Two years ago I reached a breaking point and had a mental breakdown. This was due to a super toxic environment, including a manager who consistently upped her unrealistic demands and a direct report who was power hungry and constantly trying to undermine everything I did. After healing from that experience, I decided I would find an individual contributor role so I wouldn't have to worry about the stress of managing people. 

When I started my new job, I was an IC. Within a year I was asked to take over the team (of 3 including me). Now it's grown to include multiple programs, 8 people and more and more demands that I don't feel I can handle. I am now in charge of 8 separate functional programs, 3 of which I have no experience in. I'm hiring more senior people to run those, but that doesn't negate the stress of being responsible for these functions AND now managing more people. None of these programs get enough attention from me and thus I feel I'm not meeting expectations often.

I know this is a great problem to have, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity. But I recognize the signs and am close to reaching my mental breaking point again, and I need to have a conversation with my boss about what needs to change. 

And what needs to change? I'd like to narrow my scope of focus. Either move back to an Individual Contributor role, or move off the programs I don't have experience in.

How do I have that conversation without committing career suicide? My manager is C-Level, and has put a lot of faith in me taking these on. She has also put me in our company's program for top performers so I feel she's made a public commitment.

I've managed to get the grades to the level on which I can be accepted into the uni and I'm now sure that I will be. Now, there's another problem, my parents. Ever since elementary school, I never really got to spend time with other people when school was over, instead parents were expecting me to get out of the school to pick me up. They always thought that they had the need to know my friends parents because you never knew if they were pedophiles. I've never had a sleep over, mind you. And at times when I was a couple of years older and went to the cinema, my mother would always spy on me, waiting outside to check if I'm doing alright, even if the movie ends at 9-10pm. Furthermore, my mother would at times just tail me wherever I go. 

Now with that backstory in mind, the problem is that the university is located about 300-400km away from where they live, and since I'm quite responsible, it's my dream university and all, I decided that I'd live alone there and take care of myself. That I'm finally a legal adult with my own responsibilites, I can do whatever I want, I'm liberated. But little do I know, they want to literally follow me and basically become neighbours or that I should just live with them, just so that they can control me, so to speak.

They are also horrible compulsive liars, telling me that they AREN'T gonna follow me, but only now when I'm a month away of being accepted.  


I'm just going batshit crazy right now. I don't know what to do, since I don't think some family therapist won't do (because they're reluctant of getting one, and because they wouldn't listen either way). Is there anyway I can maybe infer some kind of restraining order if I feel ""threatened""? Contact the police? I honestly don't know how to dispose of them, but I'm just gonna say that they're horrible parents that constantly lie to their child, emotionally manipulate and have barely let me socialize with anyone, and NOW they want to follow me when I'm a legal adult?

470,"We are both the same age (24)  and met through a dating app two years ago. After 2 months of dating he figured he didn’t want a relationship with me so naively we decided to stay friends. We met up a lot actually and talk quite regularly. However, I am and have been in love with him for two years. A side note as well- ever since we met he has kept me blocked from all social media (still to this day), and when confronted about it he would avoid the subject and me, scared of losing him would just not bother arguing with him.

Fast forward to last month, he invited me over to his house to watch a movie. I knew his intentions... but honestly I thought maybe he finally felt the same way about me and after some convincing I caved in. Biggest mistake. Not only it was kind of awkward but he made backhand comments about my weight and I had to convince him to give me a ride home afterwards.What makes things worse is that I think he knows I have a thing for me as he has jokingly said to me in the past ‘ I know you fancy me’ and ‘you’re in love with me aren’t you’.

Not gonna lie I’ve been pretty hurt that he just used me like that, and I can’t shake the feeling off. Now he recently told me that he met a new girl and it’s kinda pushed me over the edge.

The only thing that keeps me somewhat entertained is listening to music and finding new albums I enjoy. 

I try coming up with ideas for jobs that I would like but there is always something wrong with the ideas. I'd love to do some freelance work which would allow me to be my own boss and do things independently but I feel like I'm too stupid to pull that off. Ever since I graduated from university with a bachelors degree (that is also useless) I feel like I'm incapable of learning anything anymore, like there is a block preventing me from successfully learning. I'm young and any work I do feels like I'm scamming somebody. The only idea that I had that would be amazing if it worked out would be freelance professional organizing since I love organizing wardrobes, kitchens, etc. but then again in my country and city there doesn't seem to be a need for that or I'm unaware of it? It's really difficult to tell if it would be even a good idea and at the same time this felt like too ridiculous of a job description to write down...

I just don't know what to do, where to start. I guess I need advice on how to find what I love the most and stick with it and possibly try to tie it into a job? Or at least advice on how to not cry whenever I look at job offers?",25Nov2018,1
473,"So this guy, we have history, we were friends as kids and he was almost my first kiss but we got interrupted, whatever. After years of not talking much, he started hanging out with me and my guy friends again (I'm the only girl out of 4 guys in this friend group) we've all been friends forever, but he wasn't as active as he is now. Let's call the guy T, and the other guys are V, K and P. Over the summer, me and V were house sitting for K when his family went on vaca. T and P were over all the time, and after flirting a bit with T, we almost hooked up a few times over the span of two weeks but it never worked out, we were always interrupted, bummer. I didn't like him as anything more than a prospective sexual partner. Fast forward to school starting, and we started spending more time with each other one on one, getting to school, walking around campus and just talking more in general. We started talking about deeper things, and became actual good friends. We didn't talk about sex anymore, and the topic of hooking up stopped coming up. Instead, the flirting and teasing started changing. Instead of touching when hanging out we started cuddling. And the other guys are always there so we're never alone but we didn't do that before. I took the train with him home, and we sat next to each other, and he kept doing this cute shit like making sure some part of him was touching me all the time or covering my phone screen or just doing that childish stuff you'd do to the girl/boy you like. We were playing poker at K's house a few weekends ago and I was tipsy and started touching his back while watching him play, and he takes off his shirt so I could touch his actual skin instead of just the sweater. Yesterday we visited him at work (a laser tag place) and even though the boys had to pay in to play, T got me in for free. He talks more shyly now, and more hesitantly if that makes sense, but anytime we're alone we just have such a good freaking time. This guy is so hard to read, but I overanalyze everything. I have an actual crush on him now, and I want to figure out if there's something here before I wind myself up and break my own heart. If you made it this far, thank you so much. Maybe this is all really stupid and I should just fuck him. BUT TELL ME PLEASE so I can stop feeling insane.",25Nov2018,1
474,"I'm an 18 year old autistic male working at Domino's while attending CC. My boss at Dominos has been upset with me since I am not as fast at tasks as he would like. I do my best but between the multitasking, and how it can be hard to hear instructions over the loud oven I have made my fair share of mistakes such as getting an empty tray when he asked for a small dough tray, mistopping pizzas as well as apparently not being fast enough boxing items when they are out of the oven. Last night it even resulted in my boss asking what's the matter with me and threatening to send me home. I'm trying not to be so thin skinned since at my age I have to start entering into the real world and not be so soft but this honestly makes me afraid to go back to work and wonders how long I can last. My boss can actually joke and be friendly so that further complicates how I'm thinking about this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

475,"For some reason, and I don’t know the reason exactly, I have this strange fear surrounding sex and sexual performance. STDs and pregnancy don’t scare me (at least not more than the average 20yr old) but I actively avoid sex because of fear of performance. At least I think. 

I am currently dating a woman a year younger than me and we’ve been together, officially, for about a month now. We haven’t spoken or hinted about sex at all yet, but I can tell she’s losing interest a bit because of it. I’m also 99% sure that she spoke to a mutual friend (more her friend than mine) about how we haven’t had sex, but I’m not completely sure. 

Part of me thinks I should just end it and start seeing a therapist to sort things out, but I do really enjoy being around her and I am attracted to her. It’s just when I start thinking about sex I get all clammy and anxious. 

TL;DR too nervous to have sex and I’m pretty sure it’s bothering a woman that I’m newly dating. 

Has anyone else had to deal with this before? Any help would be appreciated. ",25Nov2018,1
476,"Hey reddit, I've been suffering from depression for a time now. Litteraly depression not feeling sad. There is this girl(25F) I saw at the first day of university and into since then(about two years now), and there is me(21M). The first day I went to my school saw that girl and met with her. We were always flirting and still for the most of the time you can say that we are flirting but there is the problem of that we are not lovers or anything. We're really close, like really close. We do most of the things together, we take the same courses, we go to cinema and theatre together, we sit and talk. This all seems normal when looked from outside but there are people that think we are lovers. I mean not that I don't want that but I feel like I'm incapable of doing anything, achiving nothing. I can't withstand the idea of not being with her all the time, I can't take it. I miss her and when I went to bed in the night I can't be happy on my 1on1 time. Thinking that what should I do because I do not want to lose her so I can't just go and talk to her as I normally would that would f\*ck our friendship. When I'm with her I feel like I am the happiest man alive and as soon as that part is over I start to feel like shit. That affects my life, I can't study, can't work, can't focus on anything. I've tried everything but in the end everything came to this shit. I've been with another girls but couldn't do it. Felt like shit, I broke up with them, hurt their feelings maybe because of this love. I can't get over it. I am not able to live with it, I've tried to go on with my life and started working twice more but even when I'm working I find myself doing something about her, maybe thinking about her or something else. BTW all of my relationships med-long ones. Arranging to two years. I can say that I'm actually more mature than my equals, I can make good decisions and think rationally but this time, oh boy, I'm about to go crazy that she is not with me.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some things that I want to point out:** 

\*She seems like looking for somebody else as she constantly talk to others guys and going to dates.

\*I'm always daring enough to make her at least think that ""this boy maybe into me"".

\*The thing is that she seems like liking me too, one can understand that from the behaviors of her. As she gets excited around me and constantly asks when I implied something about us what I implied.

\*She sometimes messages to me like ""I need to see you"", ""I saw you in my dreams last night"".

&amp;#x200B;

That the situation, I really need help with this as I am really about to go crazy. Even when writing this there is a feeling that I can not explain to anybody. 

What should I do in this situation, what should my attitudes to her be like? I always try to take her out, not in a creepy way tho, should I continue doing that? Do you think the age gap between us could be a problem for her? 

Any advice will be taken seriously. Thank you guys.",25Nov2018,1
477,"So I'm living on the peninsula of the bay area with my parents and I'm feeling depressed with the idea of living at home. 
Everything is great at home. My younger brother lives here too with his 5yr old son. No problems at all.
But coming close to 31, I need this for me. Even though its expensive as shit out here, I know myself and my habits. I know I can make it out there.

So I'm debt free. No college loans, other then paying for my for car payments and insurance. As well my cell phone. I dont have lavish habits. I'm a humble man that keeps things in perspective. Nothing is holding me back.

I thought about finding roomates which would be fine with me, but my main goal is to live alone.  The cost of living with ppl is obviously cheaper but what if I went through government assistance housing? Programs that helps ppl move out with housing/apartments.

I work full time, finally not a job but a career!  I'm feeling a whole lot better because Number 1 objective is done. 2nd task on my plate is to move out.",25Nov2018,1
478,"Without too much detail, someone fell out with me quite suddenly after seemingly no issues. We didn't have an argument or anything, they just turned around in quite a bad mood and told me they wanted to 'be alone forever' as it suits them better.

This person has had issues with depression, and to be totally honest, I think their heavy workload got the best of them and they are experiencing a dip in mood because of it. Before we stopped contacting each other (about a week ago) I asked them to please not isolate themselves because it's not good for them.

Should I try and contact them again? Maybe just because it's on my mind but I feel they weren't even mad at me - just taking out their depression on me, which I know is not OK but they may need help. How should I proceed?",25Nov2018,1

I am pretty desperate for some reason. Which is weird to say, as I am 14.

I was talking to one friend, 16m.
We were joking about how ""desperate"" we both are.

Of course, I mentioned me wanting dick. I said at one point I would to suck Dick. Alot. And I said how I wanted to get cummed on my face.

My friend, said, I'm pretty sure as a joke, ""you want to suck my dick?"".

Yeahhhhhh, I said yes ;~;

I don't know how it happened, but I ended up sucking his dick. I loved it. He came into my mouth tho, I wanted it on my face tho 🙃

481,"For the sake of not mixing things up, I will call this friend Lisa. For a bit of background, Lisa and I have been good friends starting the eighth grade (we are both sophomores in high school at the time of posting this), and we've always been on good terms. Lisa has always been a really shy and quiet person, having struggled with social anxiety for the time that I've known her, but she's really sweet and probably the kindest person I have ever met. Last summer, her father passed away (the reason how isn't my place to talk about) and she decided to transfer schools, so we started talking less and less.
Yesterday I went to a birthday party and saw Lisa's best friend there--let's call her Anna. Anna and I started talking and catching up (we never see each other often), and after a bit we started talking about Lisa. Anna began to tell me about how Lisa had confided in her that apparently her mother wasn't treating her well; apparently, Lisa's mother goes out with her friends to drink and do drugs often, and she'll yell at Lisa for no reason sometimes. It goes a bit farther than that; Lisa told Anna that her mother punched her once (not to the face, but it still hurt), and once during prom Lisa had to ask a Anna for a ride because her mom was ""out with her friends"". I knew that her mother had been struggling with mental health problems prior to this, but all these other things came as a surprise. When I asked Anna if Lisa has spoken to a counselor, Anna said she's tried to get her to talk to one, but she didn't want to get into detail when she finally convinced her. She's been trying to push her this whole time, but Lisa keep blowing it off. 

This is all very concerning to me, and I want to talk to her about it, but I don't want to confront her directly since she doesn't know I know. Though I feel like it is, is this abuse? How can I get her to talk to me without making her feel uncomfortable around me, and how can I talk to her to convince her to talk to someone about it (I definitely don't want to push her too hard, either)?

Tdlr; I found out a friend's mother has been openly drinking, using drugs, yelling at her, and even hit her once. However, I found this all out through her best friend, and I don't know how to bring it up to her without making her uncomfortable around me.",25Nov2018,1

HOWEVER, my friend in that same English class tells me that he has seen her sometimes just staring at me when I'm not looking. so now I'm thinking hey maybe she does think I'm cute.

484,"Sorry if its long, TL;DR at the bottom.

I have a friend, lets call her P. P has an online boyfriend who she has never met before, and lives in America (we're in England), they've been dating a while- I think maybe close to a year, I'm not sure. I'm not his biggest fan but oh well, she likes him, it's her choice.

Now, when we go out, P flirts with literally any guy who will so much as look her way, sit on their lap, kiss them on the cheek, grind on them when we dance. Even goes out without any form of money because she'll 'just get guys to buy her a drink'. All kinda stuff you don't do if you have a boyfriend really; when I see her do it on nights out I'll get her attention and give her a look as if to say stop, but I don't like confronting her because she tends to fly out of control and has even ran away from us throwing a huge tantrum on one occasion, ruining the night. 

On top of that, P led this guy, on for a month or so, but has now told him she doesn't have feelings and wants him to move on (fair enough), but is spinning it like hes some massive creep because he can't get over her at the snap of his fingers. To put in some context, they were cuddling in bed watching movies and stuff, so not exactly strictly friendly. I see her post on here sometimes about how he's 'obsessive' over her and all this, and its coming close to an all out character assassination at this point honestly.

This isn't the only case either, she's kissed mutual friends of ours on nights out before, and even got really uncomfortably sexual with me before.

She says its just 'who she is as a person' but I guess I'm asking, how do I tell her she needs to stop behaving the way she is if she has a boyfriend, without her thinking I'm just being a bitch.

TL;DR :  I have a friend with a long distance boyfriend who flirts and leads on guys, how do I advise her to stop behaving that way.",25Nov2018,1
485,"Let me give you a little backstory: 

\-My ex-girlfriend (28) is a music therapist and teacher. Incredibly beautiful, smart, hardworking, talented, faithful, the entire package. Although this has been the best relationship we have had in our lives, her past has been rough as far as relationships go. She, coming from a Filipino background, has grown up with some strictness in the family. Her parents are very old-school and have been strict with her, even have made her feel guilty for not doing Nursing as a career path. Growing up, she has been bullied and what-not. Her relationship before me, she described to me as manipulative/controlling/not healthy. She had told me that it was a very difficult time for her. She had lost herself, she had lost her identity, she still gets upset about it from time to time. I tried to be as understanding as possible about the situation and try to sympathize it, all while at the same time, try to pick her up when she feels by trying to show her that her ex-boyfriend is in the past and it's important to focus on the now.

\-I am (27M) a Physical Therapist Assistant. I work with people who have had surgery/hurt themselves at work to help regain their function. That's something both my ex and I shared, is that we were both musicians and in the therapy field. We both obviously care about people and their well being. (And we're both Cancer!) I've never really had much experience with serious relationships. This was my longest relationship of a year, so this relationship being my 4th one, I am learning how to deal with women still. I admit, I have work to do and growing up to do. Everyone does, I'm not trying to say I'm perfect, but I'm certainly far from the worst. I am a hard working, caring, fair individual. I try to be as honest as possible when I can be.

Now about the relationship itself:

I can come off as pretty needy at times. I am someone who is able to give someone their space but you'd have to tell me, I love talking to someone nonstop and I can be overwhelming, I'm sure. And you'd have to reassure me that nothing is wrong with me and our relationship. It's a pretty annoying personality trait of mine that I know can be a major turn off. I'm someone who needs constant reassurance. I don't know if it's because I've been screwed over before or maybe my childhood, I don't know, but I'm seeing a therapist for it. I'm hoping it all goes well, because it's something that I hate having to deal with and I'm sure any partner would hate to deal with. With my ex girlfriend, I noticed that she likes things to be a certain way, and is pretty strong-willed (stubborn) about it. She can also play the victim very well for many things.  
This was not something I have seen before or made a lot of sense in my head up until when we broke up when I took a step back and analyzed the relationship. For example, we were planning a trip to Disneyland and I was very much wanting to take an Uber around because I didn't want to drive around in LA traffic, I didn't want to worry about drinking and driving, I didn't want to worry about parking, and I just didn't want to deal with driving period because I'm on vacation. Her and I agreed to a 50/50 split for the bigger costs because we both make very good money. She wanted to rent a car because it was cheaper and she was ""on a budget"" (despite her having $70,000 saved in her bank account). We would have saved some money renting the car but doing Uber would've been ideal. There were pros and cons to both situations, which I understood, so I offered to pay for the transportation out there because I wanted to take an Uber, she didn't have to pitch in 50/50 for that, but she insisted to pay because she didn't want me to have her under her thumb for paying for things (which in her previous relationships, she had boyfriends who tried to control her just because they paid for this and that.) We ended up arguing for a good amount of time about it, I Just gave in and decided ""Fine, let's just rent the car out."" after she felt like she had to yell her brains out about it. I offered to pay for transportation, which she denied, because I wanted to take the Uber, which she denied as well. So I was basically forced to rent the car just to save $100 or else she would have not gone on the trip, which she has used as ammo against me whenever she gets mad during an argument. She would say ""You know what? I'm not going on the trip anymore, you can go on your own."" and there I go, apologizing. Trying to mend things. We both, without a doubt, love each other. We both had plans for the future and everything, but it seems like she just couldn't trust me with over what she thought was me being unfaithful (which I will explain later on)

The first few months were fantastic, as a lot of relationships I'm sure. As every relationship matures, it begins to have arguing in it. We begin to notice our differences. I'm not someone to give up on someone or capitalize on our differences in a negative way. We are allowed to be different people. And despite us having our differences, our similarities that are very important to us are there, such as: family orientation, music, therapy, helping others, etc. My ex-girlfriend is someone who can be overly sensitive with things or take things the wrong way. To my fault, I tend to say things like ""oh I was just kidding"" or ""don't be so sensitive"", which is the message I have conveyed in the past. I apologize afterwards once I see that it really did upset her. Sometimes she doesn't really show to be bothered by it in the moment until it comes up after in an argument. I'm definitely working on it now, since it makes more sense as to her feeling like I'm undermining her feelings. Although sometimes she can be pretty sensitive to the silliest of things, I try to understand as much as I can and change in that aspect. However, recently, things have gotten out of control. 2 months ago, She was over at my house, we were laying down on my bed and asked ""Hey, can we look at your pictures on your phone?"" And I'm thinking ""Okay, she's obviously looking for dirt or something to argue about. But she won't find anything."" We're scrolling through my entire album on my iPhone, laughing at the random things I take pictures of and things I save. Going far back into things from before, she found pictures of old friends I used to talk to on my phone. A few were selfies of other girls, and there was 1 nude in there of a girl I met over Tinder. These were all rooted deep into the early stages of my 1,500 pictures that I had from the past 1-2 years. These pictures of the girls were from before I met my girlfriend, and I had forgotten they were on my phone. My phone mainly consists of memes, pictures of my (ex) girlfriend, or pictures of my family. Anyway, I deleted the pictures right then and there. She thought it was weird and it started an argument. Her main thing was ""How do you not see what you did wrong? Who in the right mind would keep selfies of their friends? Are these girls your fuck buddies/thirst traps/ex hook ups?"" I kept reassuring her that I had no current contact with them and they were from the past from when I was single. She kept insisting that it was weird and not normal and how dare I disrespect our relationship that way. She was also upset at my initial reaction to when she found the pictures while laying on the bed. I had said ""Oh yeah, those are my old friends. I used to talk to them. I'll just delete them now"". Hence, why she feels like I see nothing wrong with what I did, when obviously she did.

A few days after that, she comes over and I am playing piano while she is singing. I have my back turned to her while she is singing and she randomly stops. While she has stopped singing, I am practicing my part which I can't seem to get. 3 minutes into the song, I stop and I take a break from that part I can't get down. When I get up and turn around, I see her laying on my bed with a blanket over her. I take the blanket off, and she's going through my phone. She quickly locks the phone and throws it to her side. I caught her red-handed. I get incredibly upset because she is going through my phone without my permission. It's not like I have anything to hide, but the idea/principle of it is what bothers me. It shows me that she does not trust me. I got upset and did begin to raise my voice (which does not happen often, but when it does, she does not live it down, despite her yelling at me WAY more than I ever have in my life. In a demeaning manner, too.) asking her ""What do you think you're doing going through my phone?!"" And she's like ""Oh, I'm just looking through your pictures of the Disney trip we went to."" when I KNOW I saw the green text message bubbles when I uncovered her from under the sheets. I opened my phone back up and what do you know, my text messages are the first thing to come up. I asked her ""Why the hell did you do that? What are you looking for? Don't you trust me?"" She kept insisting she was not going through my messages although I LITERALLY saw her with them open. Finally, I get her to come forward with what she was doing and she begins to yell even louder than me ""It's because I don't trust you, okay!?"" and puts the blame on the pictures I had on my phone. She also insists that I have a romantic relationship with all of my friends that are girls and that my boss is my ""work wife"", which is non-sense. She keeps saying that I am holding on to these pictures so I can use them for pleasure and as a ""spank bank"", which is also non-sense because they were just random selfies. I ask her ""Why would I keep pictures as masturbating material if 1) there's porn for that and 2) I have a girlfriend whom I love a lot and am faithful to?"" The 1 nude was someone I didn't even consider being in a relationship nor did I keep any contact with her after a few weeks. She broke up with me right then and there. I told her she can leave, and that was it until a week after when she finally cooled down that we got back together. But during that week that we were ""broken up,"" she was sending me pictures and text messages saying ""Oh, where should I throw away your gifts that you gave me?"" and sending me pictures of when we took that trip to Disneyland saying ""This is my favorite picture of us, look at us smiling..."" obviously trying to guilt trip me and trying to get me to change my mind or hurt me in some manner. She knows what gets to me, emotionally. I am an emotional person, but I have improved on making decisions based not on my current emotional state, but on what needs to be done. Regardless, when your'e in love, sometimes you're blinded by the right decisions. We make up and everything is swell until a few weeks after that....

The next/last episode where we broke up happened last month, a month after our first break up. I went over to her house on a Tuesday morning before work for some coffee. We were sitting on the couch, on our phones, just talking and hanging out drinking our coffee. We were talking about how my cousin and his girlfriend were going through some things and my cousins girlfriend cheated on him. We were talking about how toxic she was and how sad the whole situation was. Right after we finished our conversation about her, my cousins girlfriend went live on Instagram. I said ""oh look, speak of the devil, his girlfriend just went live on Instagram."" and my (ex) girlfriend says ""Ohhh, let's watch it!"" so I turn it on. Her and I are watching the live stream and noticed that she was in a McDonalds sweater and it looked like she was in an office with someone else, so we assumed she was at work. We were laughing, so I decided to comment ""lemme get some food!"". I'm a big fan of McDonalds (But I'm not fat, yet...). Then, my cousin's girlfriend replies ""Then come get some"", and that's when my (ex) girlfriend loses her shit. I mean, she goes full out ballistic. I'm confused as to why she's yelling and freaking out, I don't know what happened. As she gets up from the couch and starts yelling ""WHAT THE FUCK, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!"" I'm replying in a panicked manner, ""What? What happened!?"" She yells ""How dare you message her?! How dare you say that!?"" And I am very confused, because I literally was just asking for food, as a joke. I was only being silly because I saw someone with McDonalds uniform. I always do the same to people whenever I see a restaurant uniform on. No intention of actually going to get it or anything. No flirting, absolutely nothing. I made the comment in front of my girlfriend, so why would I do something shady like that? Later that day, we discussed what happened and she was very upset because (this is where she is manipulating and changing what happened), I was ""flirting with her, catcalling her"" and ""could not take my eyes off of her in the live stream for a whole 3 minutes as she sat there and watched in horror trying to snap me out of this 'in love' daze that I was in."" This is where I begin to notice that she manipulates a lot of situations and warps what actually happened in order for her to appear like she has been justified in her actions and her reactions. Which she has every right to react the way she wants, but to bring me down and exaggerate the scenario is not okay with me. Again, she breaks up with me saying that how dare I disrespect her and our relationship. Why would she tell me it's okay to watch, but not say that I shouldn't type? I can't assume what bothers her. (It's also strange that she's okay with strip clubs and porn, but not with me sending a silly text?)

She has accused me of gaslighting. A LOT. She has accused me of being manipulative. Accused me of being impulsive and inconsiderate. Throughout all this, she has played the victim a lot and it seems like I have always been wrong, no matter what I try to do right. I would try to explain myself, but then be accused of ""mansplaining"" and being a misogynistic pig. I am someone that when their partner gets hurt, I try to be there for them and change when I need to. I was made felt like 90% of everything was my fault, that I was the stubborn one, that I was the one that needed to change and not her. It's weird because we also talked about being in a 3-some (no plans on actually doing it, but were interested), and then one day, she randomly came out during a fight and said ""And stop bringing up the 3some, that's NEVER going to happen with us."" Which confused the FUCK out of me because we were actively looking for another at some point, then she turns it around and says that?! She made me a list of things that I needed to work on, but when I told her she needed to work on some things, she got VERY defensive. And yet, it was always ME ME ME. Basically walking on eggshells, recently. No matter how much I changed or tried to do things right, it was not enough. Eventually, she had enough and left me. And it seems like she still isn't finished shooting shots at me. During every argument, she would try to hurt me somehow. More recently, my friend found her on a dating site not too long ago (which I feel like after a serious relationship of a year and talking about marriage/future/engagement, it seems too soon for that.). She had on her profile that she was an ""emotional abuse survivor"" and to message her if ""they are interested and don't have nudes of ex girlfriends/thirst traps/ex hook ups"". She KNEW that my friend was on that site and that I would possibly be dating again, (But I'm not, I'm trying my best to regain my confidence and sense of self.)

I know I'm a very caring person. Not just me as a person, but in my field, too. I take care of others when they need help. I am someone who is trustworthy and fair to many people, also very family oriented, silly, talented, smart. I want there to be equality. Yes, I crack jokes and sometimes my humor can be offensive, but life is a crazy thing, and being serious all the time kills it. That doesn't mean that someone won't be offended by something so I have to take a step back in becoming more cautious around others. But after all this, I felt like I have lost sense of who I was. My confidence was struck and damaged pretty hard towards the end of the relationship. You can't save anyone, you can only support. Unfortunately, she felt like there was nothing wrong with her. But I guess my thing was...was I actually manipulated or is this me just being paranoid? She kept mentioning gaslighting, but was she doing the gaslighting or was I????? This whole situation is VERY confusing and heartbreaking. This was someone I saw a future with, but my sense of reality is a bit staggered....This whole thing is super childish.

TL;DR My girlfriend accuses me of doing many things wrong and overreacts to the smallest of things. Despite me doing things right, I get no credit for it. And when she tries to show me credit, she quickly shuts that down with a LOT more negativity. She has been hurt in the past and I feel like that baggage was brought with her to this current relationship. She is now accusing me of gaslighting (because I tell her that she can be too sensitive at times.) and being manipulative/impulsive/inconsiderate and having NO foresight in my decisions. What should I do?",25Nov2018,1
486,"My husband and I agreed to let my sister stay with us while she looks for a job and an apartment, but she’s been here three months now and has only found a job. We were a little flexible on the terms and we’re now regretting that.

My sister has some serious mental, and possibly developmental, issues. Here’s the bullet-point version:

* She’s extremely lethargic. She did manage to get a job, but it took her almost a month. She only leaves the house when she has to, and spends most of her time sleeping or laying around.  

* She’s extremely self-absorbed, inconsiderate, and incapable of interacting properly with other people. Her speech consists mainly of long, disorganized monologues that jump rapidly from topic to topic. It looks a little like Asperger's syndrome, but unlike truly autistic people, she seems to know on some level that she's alienating people. She either doesn't care or she just can't control herself.  

* Despite staying here rent-free for three months, she resists getting help and would rather just be a liability to everyone around her. I feel like she deliberately sabotages herself sometimes. For example, she gets lost every time she drives anywhere, but would rather waste our gas than use GPS.  

* She doesn’t understand things like personal boundaries and consent. More often, she’s the one being violated, but sometimes she’ll do it to other people. My husband and I started depending on Facebook messenger after she asked us about a private conversation we had, \*because she thought we were talking about her.\* And guess what? \*We probably were.  

* She has no standards and seems to think it's an accomplishment. We had an abusive and very isolated religious upbringing, but while I chose to rise above it, she decided that she'd rationalize what happened to us, justify the people who did it, and wallow in self-loathing. She resents people who do well for themselves and is very suspicious of the ""high-society"" values we live by, like self-respect and human decency. My husband can be a little snobbish, but some of her friends are so trashy and vile that even I can't be around them.

My husband and I are at the breaking point. We want to help her, but we're very protective of the life we've built, and she's threatening it, even if she doesn't mean to. We need to get her out of our house in the nicest possible way.

**TL;DR: My husband and I don’t know how to tell my sister that she needs to move out, and she doesn’t take hints. To make matters worse, her presence here is a constant PTSD trigger. I’m bracing for an ugly confrontation that may not need to happen, and I'm growing more irrational by the day. Any advice or constructive criticism is welcome.**",25Nov2018,1
487,I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for this but I just need some answers. When I tell people this story they accuse me of lying so I want to know if this is possible. When I was around the age of 7 or 8 my mother worked at a salon that had a wall socket with open wires in the back room. One night I was bored and decided to pretend to be an electrician. I grabbed a metal hair clip and started poking around in the socket. All of a sudden I heard a loud buzzing sound and the lights shut off for about 5 seconds then cut back on. My mom came to the back to ask me what happened and I lied saying I didn’t know. The next day I got curious and decided to try and stick the metal clip in the socket once again then the loud buzzing sound came again and the lights briefly shut off. People say that if this is true I wouldn’t be alive and I definitely would have been electrocuted. Is this true? I don’t think this is strange but according to other people it is. ,25Nov2018,1
488,"So here’s the situation. My grandparents in their old age want to take the entire family on a cruise for a trip together. We used to do a lot of travelling but people have gotten busy with their lives, so making this work is a big deal. My sister had taken lead on planning this and it was supposed to include her and her boyfriend, me and my girlfriend, our parents and our grandparents.

I ended up fucking up the scheduling badly due to miscommunication. I thought we were booking a different trip than what was planned because I was busy at work and not dedicating sufficient attention to this. I told my sister to give my grandfather the go ahead and book a trip for us next year not having fully understood what the dates entailed. 

So my grandfather ended up booking an 11 day trip. My grandmother doesn’t want to take a shorter trip (she’s not budging in this and she’s quite entrenched here in her old age) and my girlfriend can’t take that many days off from work so she for sure can’t make this. Bookings in part or whole can still seemingly be canceled without financial penalty.

I can either: a) still go and keep my family somewhat happy, or b) prioritize spending that vacation time with my girlfriend and say we both can’t go which fucks the family trip and likely results in it being canceled. My sister is pissed in both scenarios because she put all this effort into planning this.

I want to try to prioritize spending time with the family here but that will be at the expense of taking vacation time away with the girlfriend. I was hoping to combine the two and that isn’t possible now.

489,"Two years ago, my wife (27) and I (28) relocated for my work in order to take advantage of a job promotion with my company. Since that time I've moved up in the company and recently was offered a promotion to an executive level with my company, but need to move to Texas for the opportunity. My wife and I have been planning to move back closer to our family and quit our jobs for the last few months, but this role is an opportunity that I likely won't get in another company for some time. I'm torn on what to do. On one hand it would be great to be closer to family and really enjoy where we are living. On the flip-side we are both relatively young and an opportunity like this could propel our career in the future. Everyone that we've reached out to for advice has asked us what we want, namely, career or are we more locale/family based. At this point, I'm not sure exactly which route we prefer.

491,"I’ve been in this group of four friends for a couple of years now and we have been meeting up every week during this whole time and I consider them my three closest.

The first one is someone that I call my closest friend whom I’ve known for almost 8 years now and really care about since he’s been the one person that I can truly trust and that helps me with all of my problems. The two of us are talking the most with each other and have had a close bond during the recent year though he is always busy when I want to meet him outside of the group and is bad at responding to texts.

 The second one is a girl that I used to hang out with a lot outside of the group and usually met up with her a few hours before our usual time, but We haven’t quite Done that as much since summer and is pretty much grown apart. 
 
The last girl in this group is someone that I’m talking to when we see each other but We have never been as close as I’ve been to the other two.

So, the thing is that my birthday is coming up and it happens to fall on the day of the week when we meet up and it is also my first birthday that my family doesn’t have the time to celebrate it and I told my ”friends” about it. The third girl had told me that she can’t come this day because a closer friend of her is turning 18 and that’s more important which I accepted. The second girl though believed that my day was last week and as she usually does lately told me ”I’m not sure If I can come because I have homework” which she will probably do this time too. 

My closest friend out of these is the one that dissapointed me the most. I asked him If he could hang out before meetup since the other girl never does that anymore and I didn’t get the response until a day later when he texted me ”oh, I’m probably not coming at all because my relative is having a birthday party” and that really hurt my feelings because he have known about my situation and just tells me this out of nowhere.

How can I tell if she is using and if she is, what should I do?",25Nov2018,1
493,"Hi, I just want to get this off my chest since I feel like I have no one else to talk to about this..

(Excuse my language, english is not my native language)

The main problem is my dad, it seems like he has anger issues and that has over time passed over to me aswell for some reason. His life is like a loop all the time. He is saving everything up until he unleashed his anger at the end and then  fills it up again. I’ve gotten used to it and can even predict when he is going to get angry.

When he is angry he can do anything, smash my stuff (which is mostly expensive), hit me until he then tells me to go out of the house, he threatens me that he’ll abandon me because I am such a failure and that he regrets having me and everytime he says that there is a lot of anger building up inside of me. Like what the hell did I do? 

Like 80% of the time I didn’t even do what he accused me of doing and the other 20% is for something suuuper small. I still remember that he got really mad at me when I needed help with my studies because my pencil was like half it’s normal length. He was like ”all you care about is buying video games and all that other stuff but no, not pencils, the most important thing” and he ruined my day aaaand I didn’t study that night.

My dad does buy me things, I get almost whatever I want but it feels like the more things I buy the more excuses he gets. For eg. when he bought me a video game and I do something that he doesnt like he blames it on the video game and says that he does anything for me and I dont do shit.

I know that this is just a rant but what I’ve said is just the beginning. 

I live in a very safe country and take the bus to school and back home. My dad said that I have to call him everytime I end so he knows that I am going home. If I forget to call him he gets mad. It’s these small things that make me feel like a little baby. Like I haven’t done anything that have made them feel insecure about me. 
My mom is a bit better but she is very similsr  to my dad.

A couple of days ago we were eating dinner and I ate normally but finished before the rest of my family and you know what? My dad gets mad... why? Well, according to him I was eating fast so I could go back to playing video games...... shit like that makes me go crazy but I can’t say anything since he would lose his shit and maybe throw me out of the window for talking back.

Fun fact, I actually even forgot that I had my playstation on and had no intentions on going back. I did tell him that it wasnt for the ps4 but because I enjoyed the food and just got done before them. He says no and that he hates liars the most. I have gottento the point where I am just silent when he rants because whatever I say he denies and says that I am telling lies. I don’t know what to dooo anymoree. I know that they love me and all that but I feel like shit and get depressed sometimes. I have also built up some sort of anger inside me and I sometimes just want to be 18 so I can leave them...

I might have written too much but that’s how I feel, right now I had played black ops 4 for like 15 minutes and my mom comes in (dad’s not home) and says ”turn it off! You’re not allowed to play for more than an hour”. I said I have played for 15 but she doesnt believe me and turned the internet off. I won’t lie, I am actually really good at playing videogames and have competed for high prized but can’t keep on going because I don’t have the time to play bevause of my parents who say I am allowed to play max 1h per day (weekends only) and I am really passionate about gaming

I don’t only game though, I do go to the gym and I do get good grades.  But I really love gaming and my parents are taking it away from me.

All these things have given me anger issues. Whenever I lose a game I get so mad and can throw stuff. My mom isn’t as ”harsh” as dad but when she turns the wifi off I go nuts and throw stuff (when dad isnt home) I wasn’t like this before and don’t like it. I am getting more depressed and idk what to do...

Please give me advice. I spent an hour on this post. I really dont know what to do or if I am the one who’s wrong in this situation. Thank you

500,"I'm going to try to make a very long story relatively short here. For about a year and a half I've been dealing with an addiction to pills, mostly benzos and pain killers. It got better for a bit. People were aware that I had a problem, but it wasn't something I brought up much. 

In June of this year I was dealing with a lot of shit and started using multiple times a day. It's been like that ever since.  In September I had a huge bender and spent a lot of time high out of my mind. By the end of it, I was miserable. Nothing about it was fun. That's when I found a therapist who specializes in drug addiction to try to get some help, but I don't feel ready to stop. 

I don't have many friends, but I confided in a few about what was going on. I have one friend who I met over the internet who lives across the world from me. We connected over Tumblr or some shit and have been friends ever since. This girl deals with a lot of what I deal with. She had Borderline Personality Disorder, ptsd, etc. Something common in people with BPD is attention seeking behavior. I never noticed it in her until pretty recently. 

We have a mutual friend and I talked to her and we both noticed something weird. This girl was somehow picking up the mental illnesses and symptoms of other people. For instance, she watched something about bipolar and then the next day had a 4hr manic episode (which isn't a manic episode). I mentioned something about self harm and a week later she started to self harm again. 

She's the kind of person who will post things to twitter and instagram about how she has no one to talk to and that she's suicidal. One time while I was trying to get advice from her she tweeted something along the lines of ""always taking care of people even when I don't have support"". One picture had me really worried. The caption was ""fucked up on codeine and weed"". sometimes I'll screenshot one of her tweets and text her to ask if she's ok. She'll say she doesn't want to talk so I back off but then she seems annoyed that I didn't keep probing. So I'll get a text at 1am asking to talk after I tried to reach out three times already. That's what happened when I asked about that picture. 

Now things get worse. I told her about my issue with pills and that I didn't know what to do about it. Yesterday, she texts me saying she needs to talk and then tells me that she's addicted to Codeine now. I asked her how long she had been taking it every day (a couple weeks), how much she was taking (she didn't say), if she was having withdrawals (she said yes). I told her that if she is telling me about her problem a few weeks in, that shows a lot of insight. I have never met an addict who comes clean after a few weeks. honestly though, the pieces just don't fit together in my head. I don't understand how this addiction popped up out of literally nowhere and she's making it pretty public too. I know it can happen, but it doesn't seem like an addiction, it seems like a method to try to get help or attention or something. 

This morning she texted me to say that she talked to her mom about her addiction and that the conversation went well. She also said that she cancelled her order of Codeine for the day. That's great, but overall she refuses to put any effort into finding mental healthcare for herself. I've tried to give her some info, but she usually disregards it or gives up on it. 

So I don't know what to make of this. What do I do? Am I shitty friend? Should I just go on as normal with her? Can I even have her as a close friend right now?  I can't come up to her and say it looks like she's trying to get attention. I don't want to take on someone else's addiction as my life is already filled with addicts. I don't have the means to help if this is a serious addiction. 

TL:DR - I have a pill addiction, now suddenly I have a friend who says she's addicted to codeine, but I have my doubts because she tends to pick up a mental illness and make it her own because someone else has that problem. I don't know if I'm being manipulated by her or if I'm being a dick for thinking this. ",25Nov2018,1

She has no children and has always been jealous of my close relationship with my grandma. She has been an alcoholic most of her life and I believe she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. A few years ago, she threatened to kill my grandparents and got arrested. They put a restraining order against her and changed all their locks and got an alarm system put in. Well after a while, they let her back in. She has been really nasty to me in the past, posting on my Facebook page that she hopes I rot in hell and a bunch of other mean things. I immediately blocked her.

Telling me not to come over without her permission or calling her first. I went there a couple weeks ago and no one would answer the door or the phone. I know my grandparents are ok because other family members have talked to them on the phone. She honestly scares me and I really don’t want my children to be around her or influenced by her at all, so I have stopped trying to see my grandparents altogether. I can’t cut her off without cutting them off and it hurts because my grandparents are getting old and not in great health and I worry they will pass away and I won’t be able to say goodbye.

I can’t call my grandparents’ home without her answering the phone. She has pretty much taken total control of everything.

505,"I'm a 16 year old male. I speak both English and Finnish as my mother tongues and I did my 9 years of basic education in an English speaking school in Finland. Most of my family lives in the United States and almost all of them only speak English. All the friends I've ever had in my life, apart from one, have been English speakers who barely know Finnish.

&amp;#x200B;

I started high school around three and a half months ago. The high school I go to is completely Finnish speaking and there's almost no one who speaks English fluently enough to use it in conversation. During my time here, I've realized that I'm completely unable to socialize, or form any kind of social connection with people when speaking Finnish. I've always been introverted and had social anxiety, but none of that compares to how difficult it is for me to be social when speaking Finnish. I've tried extremely hard to make small talk and to join in conversations but I've finally accepted that it's just impossible for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has lead me to become the quiet student who never talks to anyone and spends all their breaks alone; a role which is far from ideal. I also lost all contact to my old English speaking friends, so now I'm completely alone in this world with no one to talk to in real life. I also have some other problems that have been causing me sadness, but I'm not going to get into that because it would make this post longer than it already is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not being able to even have small meaningless conversations with people has really been the nail in the coffin for me, and it's caused my mental health to deteriorate greatly. My social anxiety which was already terrible has skyrocketed and I developed a self harm habit, which I luckily  think I've been able to stop now, or at least reduce to the bare minimum. I used to self harm daily during the lowest weeks of my life but I've gone for a month without doing it now. And although not serious, I've also started having daily suicidal thoughts. I'm definitely not suicidal as I know that I'm not going to do it but the thought keeps popping in my head all the time and this never happened before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I happened to meet some of my old English speaking classmates on the bus about a week ago, and I was awed by how easy it was for me to talk to them. They were both very attractive girls who I had rarely talked to when I was in the same class as them, yet having a conversation with them was almost effortless because we were talking in English. When speaking Finnish, I could never even imagine making any kind of vocal exchange with females, let alone exceptionally attractive ones, but when I spoke English it was nearly effortless. I instantly felt a connection to them that I for some reason never feel when communicating in Finnish. After the brief conversation I had with these two girls, I felt amazing. It may seem strange to you but having a normal conversation with someone and not being extremely awkward has become an achievement for me. An achievement which I seldom achieve these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have already asked my high school guidance counsellor wether it is possible for me to take more advanced English classes somewhere outside my high school, as the English classes in my high school are intended for people who do not speak the language. This way I maybe able to spend one hour in the company of other people who also speak English fluently. I'm almost sure that it won't be possible though.

&amp;#x200B;

I also thought of going to an English speaking university but I then found out that there are no English speaking universities in Finland and all my hopes of having a future social life were crushed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know for a fact that I won't get used to socializing in Finnish. It's not something I can improve. I went to Finnish speaking boy scouts for 5 years but never said a word to anyone because of my social anxiety along with my strange inability to socialize in Finnish. While everyone else spoke to each other and had fun, I sat quietly.

All advice is greatly appreciated. I genuinely feel that life as it is right now unbearable and I don't know how I can deal with it as every day things just seem to get worse. ",25Nov2018,1
506,"I'm literally just writing this after after waking up. I'm not sure I'm still dreaming or it's reality. Lately, I've been seriously depressed. I'm at the point of my life where I kind of gave. I haven't had a single friend for so long now because I'm just too afraid of people. I just do not trust anyone.

Anyway, lately I've been thinking about a friend of mine. I've met him in 7th grade back in 2004, and we became friends right away. We were friends up until 2012, and that's when I cut him out of my life. He, for some reason, became a super envious person. He was envious of everyone around him. Him and I were not the wealthiest people, but I was just fed up from hearing him say bad crap about fortunate people. Anyway, back in 2012, I was having a conversation with him on the phone, and that's when I made a mistake of telling him I got a new job. His tone changed completely. He was literally asking me all kinds of questions. The pay rate, the benefits, where is it located, are they hiring...etc

After that I just cut him out of my life. I blocked him every where. At that time I was living in another place, and he was way too far away from me. I had no idea what happened to him after that. 

Lately, I've been thinking about him a lot. Actually, I'm thinking about the greatest times we had together. I didn't have the greatest childhood, but I was at my happiest with him. We played video games, went to so many places together, spent the night over. His parents were so amazing too. He was just pessimistic and envious.

Anyway, I stated earlier that I do not trust people. I've tried to have many friends after him, but they all were not good friends. I haven't had a single good friend for a while, and even though that guy had a trait that bother me a lot, I miss the times we had together so much.

I asked my older brother if I should try to contact him, and he told me it's a terrible idea because 1). You cut him off from your life brutally, and 2). The biggest mistake you could ever do is finding your ex friends, because you'll be so surprised of how changed they are from the past.

507,"My life is actually turning into a Netflix original series, and it’s all so melodramatic. These kind of events, I’ve decided, should be limited to entertainment purposes only. 

I met my best friend at summer camp several years back. We hit it off immediately and became inseparable. I was brought on family vacations, and I essentially became the little sister/daughter/niece/cousin to everyone in her family. At one point, I lived at her house for an entire month. This is mildly complicated because I live several hours away from her. Despite this, visitations weren’t few, and they were not too far between.

This past year, though, every aspect of the friendship became one-sided. We stopped calling entirely. I’d jump through hoops just to get a response to a text. Finally, she decided to invite me over after several months of not talking to me. I stayed at her house for a week over the summer this past July. It was a good time, but something felt way off. While I was at her house, she kept suggesting that we go see her other friends. I didn’t know what to say, so I didn’t say anything. It stung a little. The fair was in town where she lived, so we met up with her friends. She introduced me to the girl that I hadn’t known had become my replacement by nonchalantly saying “oh yeah, this is my best friend X” Big suck. Monumental suck.

After this visit, I heard nearly nothing from her. I extended an invitation for her to come see me in a theater production, as she made a point to take the few hour drive and see all of them. This had been planned for months, I knew she was coming. Just hours before opening, she texts me and blows me off to hang out with her friends. I wasn’t too offended, and I just accepted it. I had an entirely different production at my school just weeks later, and she planned on attending that one as well. After blowing me off the first time, she apologized and promised that she’d attend my upcoming play. Surprise, surprise. Half an hour before the show, I text her asking if she has her tickets/how the traffic was, whatever. She tells me that she forgot about it and wasn’t going to be attending. At this point, I’m more than mildly pissed off but I let it be.

A few days later, I received a series of texts. My best friend tells me that she never cared about me, I was entirely unimportant, and that I was a waste of time. She complained about how I was overemotional and mentally ill, despite the fact that she never really took the time to understand or even listen to me. She would ignore me whenever I needed someone to listen. Altogether, just bogus. She proceeds to rip on me and bash on me for quite some time. Extensive text after extensive text, I sat look at my phone quite baffled. After this, it was incredibly evident that she just didn’t care about me at all. Harsh words, man. 

At this point, I was a bit of a wreck. I didn’t know how to respond, so I said goodbye. She then proceeds to tell me that I can’t just cut things off and that she had things she always needed to tell me and that she’ll deliver it via snail mail.

A week goes by, I receive nothing. Until last night. She texted me explaining that she just didn’t feel like writing a letter to me. I was pissed because I spent an entire week waiting for closure or an explanation or something for the abrupt switch. She then proceeds to tell me that for the past three years, she has been in love with me. She claimed that she never cared about me as a friend and just was in love with me. I have served solely as an object of attraction for years. I poured my soul into a friendship that she didn’t care about. It sucks. After that, I just blocked her and left. I feel horrible. I know she probably feels a lot, too, but she cut the friendship out of the picture. How do I react to such a situation? I don’t want to seem homophobic— because I’m not. She gaslighted me and blamed me for all of this. This feels wrong. ",25Nov2018,1
508,"Hello,

My sister came over and she said she wasn't feeling well. I asked what was wrong and she told me. Her boyfriend came shortly after and asked her but she was being very rude to him and didn't tell him. He asked to talk to me. He told me some pretty scary stuff about what's been going on with her and it sounds like she's bipolar or has some other mental illness going on. Ir maybe she just incredibly unhappy about how her life is going. 

Together, they have three kids (she has a son and he has three sons all between the ages of 2 and 5). He works and she stays at home, which he's completely okay with and suggested. He told her that she doesn't have to worry about bills, just take care of the boys (they only have his kids on the weekends and her son is in pre-k) and get her schoolwork done. Everything will be taken care of. When they fight, which is mostly when his boys are there, he said that she threatens to call the cops on him, she runs away, she leaves the kids alone, threatens to hurt herself or him... He said that she said she was going to smother him, drive off a bridge, shoot him, that she'll tell the cops he raped her. She left her son in the car once because he was pissing her off. She left his son at home once to pick up her son because he peed on himself. She'll make up lies and shit. It was really scary and sad hearing this. This isn't the first time her boyfriend has talked to me about her acting like this. At first I thought she just wasn't happy, but it sounds like something isn't right mentally. The boys won't listen to her (or even me), but they'll listen to him, our dad and other men. It's strange because sometimes things are great and they're like a normal, happy couple. 

We had a pretty rough childhood and I don't know if it's still affecting her to this day (she just turned 29). Seeing our parents going through a separation and still fighting to this day, seeing our mom hit our dad, being raised by a single mom, knowing that no one in our family wanted us if anything happened to mom, knowing that our grandpa would beat the shit out of our mom and grandma, our dad being a drug addict for 12 years and not being in our lives growing up but now being clean and harping on us about things he doesn't like us doing or things he feels we should be doing. Our dad and grandpa don't like that she doesn't work even though her boyfriend tells her it's okay. My sister is the oldest of three. A few years back she told me that she could finally be herself and ever since then she's been almost like a stranger in the way she acts, which isn't nearly as odd as her boyfriend says, but she just seems like she doesn't give a shit.

I honestly have no idea what's going on and think she needs to see a doctor, a therapist or anyone who can figure out what the hell is going on. Any help or input on this would be tremendously helpful because I'm scared and sad for my big sister. She has a great boyfriend who does everything for her and she's acting insane. ",25Nov2018,1

513,"## So at my work at a small charity we used to be a group of 3 friends - me (32F), ""Robin"" (28F) and ""Louise"" (31F) who would hang out every day and talk about everything. We all felt like the charity was not run well and that we weren't being used to our full potential, and we had some big battles with our Director over this. But more than that we also considered each other to be good personal friends. Then I went on maternity leave, fast forward a year and I come back to the office - Robin and Louise aren't talking at all. In our office there are 6 people, so this creates a pretty weird atmosphere!

Robin was pretty open with me, she said she didn't know what had happened, that they had been drifting apart for the whole year but that at one point Louise just stopped talking to her and she didn't really know what it was about. Robin recently had a horrible miscarriage and everybody in the office was of course really nice to her about it, even our a-hole Director, but Louise didn't say a word to her about it, didn't even send a message to her when she was in the hospital. Obviously Robin feels pretty shitty about this, and her day to day life is impacted with the awkwardness and also not knowing what she has done wrong to lose a friend.

So a few days ago I went out with Louise and she got drunk and told me that the reason she wasn't talking to Robin was that Robin had said something about her in her annual review which had caused the director to basically tell Louise she had no place working there any more and should start looking for another job. Now, our annual reviews are 360 degree reviews, so everybody gives an evaluation of everybody else. They are supposed to be 100% anonymous. I asked her how she knew who had said the thing (she wouldn't tell me what it was), and she said that the director had ""Used Robin's exact words"" that she had heard from her another time - i.e. he had either accidentally or deliberately let Louise know who had said it. Louise said it had been the worst day of her working life, that she felt stabbed in the back by Robin, that she would never have thrown Robin under the bus like that. She also told me that the director had told her she could not repeat their conversation to anyone, and that he would consider it to be very unprofessional, as the reviews were confidential. Louise is really passionate about her work and to be honest doesn't have a whole lot else going on in her life, so she has been really heavily impacted by this.

At this point I am wondering a few things:

1. Has the director deliberately sought to drive a wedge between them because they are seen as trouble makers (divide and conquer)
2. How could Louise be pushed out of her job by something Robin has said and yet is not really aware of? Surely if it was something that bad, Robin would have known how bad it was?
3. Louise doesn't know this, but she can be a pretty difficult person to work with. I wouldn't be surprised if whatever the thing was has come from multiple people. Perhaps she feels especially hurt because Robin was meant to be her friend, but I feel like she is shifting any blame from her own failings onto the fact that Robin talked about them in the review.
4. Nobody would be told to leave a company based on hearsay, surely? The director must have his own experience of her working style to have come to this decision.

Is there anything I can do about this situation? They both feel horrible at work every day, the atmosphere sucks and they have both lost a friend. Louise is looking for another job but it has been 3 months and she's had no success. I don't know how long it will be until she leaves (she isn't getting fired). Any advice appreciated!",25Nov2018,1

I have a micropenis. It is is 2.25” erect.

I have never had a meaningful sexual relationship with a woman.

I have had sex with men before but decided that I did not like it.

Regardless of male or female partners, I have been chastised and berated at worst and laughed at at best.

The last time I dated someone (which was about 4 weeks), I held off on sex and kept them waiting because I wanted to make sure we emotionally clicked first before having sex.

In fact My therapist suggested that I do that - wait until I know that I feel an emotional connection to someone before having sex so that there is less... pressure?

Before we got naked I told her that I have a small penis and she said “oh that’s ok! Can’t be that bad!”. I think she was expecting like 4” though because when she sees my 2 incher she immediately gulped and then zipped my pants back up. Then she told me she doesn’t feel so good and that she must leave. She then blocked my calls and texts.

I have felt suicidal many times since then and I am not sure even if I can go on like this.

I am 25M and had sex with maybe about 10 women and 35 men and then all fizzled out because of my pathetically small penis.

I have actually never even made it inside a vagina past the lips because of angles and fat pad and such (the 2.25” measurement is bone pressed so yeah).

Is it even worth trying? Is there a site for people with micropenises to find women who enjoy a micropenis? Or should I just give up and become a incel (not sure if correct word).",25Nov2018,1

518,"I'm a 16 year old male. I speak both English and Finnish as my mother tongues and I did my 9 years of basic education in an English speaking school in Finland. Most of my family lives in the United States and almost all of them only speak English. All the friends I've ever had in my life, apart from one, have been English speakers who barely know Finnish.

I started high school around three and a half months ago. The high school I go to is completely Finnish speaking and there's almost no one who speaks English fluently enough to use it in conversation. During my time here, I've realized that I'm completely unable to socialize, or form any kind of social connection with people when speaking Finnish. I've always been introverted and had social anxiety, but none of that compares to how difficult it is for me to be social when speaking Finnish. I've tried extremely hard to make small talk and to join in conversations but I've finally accepted that it's just impossible for me. 

This has lead me to become the quiet student who never talks to anyone and spends all their breaks alone; a role which is far from ideal. I also lost all contact to my old English speaking friends, so now I'm completely alone in this world with no one to talk to in real life. I also have some other problems that have been causing me sadness, but I'm not going to get into that because it would make this post longer than it already is. 

Not being able to even have small meaningless conversations with people has really been the nail in the coffin for me, and it's caused my mental health to deteriorate greatly. My social anxiety which was already terrible has skyrocketed and I developed a self harm habit, which I luckily  think I've been able to stop now, or at least reduce to the bare minimum. I used to self harm daily during the lowest weeks of my life but I've gone for a month without doing it now. And although not serious, I've also started having daily suicidal thoughts. I'm definitely not suicidal as I know that I'm not going to do it but the thought keeps popping in my head all the time and this never happened before. 

I happened to meet some of my old English speaking classmates on the bus about a week ago, and I was awed by how easy it was for me to talk to them. They were both very attractive girls who I had rarely talked to when I was in the same class as them, yet having a conversation with them was almost effortless because we were talking in English. When speaking Finnish, I could never even imagine making any kind of vocal exchange with females, let alone exceptionally attractive ones, but when I spoke English it was nearly effortless. I instantly felt a connection to them that I for some reason never feel when communicating in Finnish. After the brief conversation I had with these two girls, I felt amazing. It may seem strange to you but having a normal conversation with someone and not being extremely awkward has become an achievement for me. An achievement which I seldom achieve these days. 

I have already asked my high school guidance counsellor wether it is possible for me to take more advanced English classes somewhere outside my high school, as the English classes in my high school are intended for people who do not speak the language. This way I maybe able to spend one hour in the company of other people who also speak English fluently. I'm almost sure that it won't be possible though.

I also thought of going to an English speaking university but I then found out that there are no English speaking universities in Finland and all my hopes of having a future social life were crushed. 

I know for a fact that I won't get used to socializing in Finnish. It's not something I can improve. I went to Finnish speaking boy scouts for 5 years but never said a word to anyone because of my social anxiety along with my strange inability to socialize in Finnish. While everyone else spoke to each other and had fun, I sat quietly. 

All advice is greatly appreciated. I genuinely feel that life as it is right now unbearable and I don't know how I can deal with it as every day things just seem to get worse. ",25Nov2018,1

     So about a year and a half ago, my boyfriend wanted to gift me a piece of art from a friend of ours for my birthday.  She does amazing work, she could make a living off of it if she wanted to. She’s someone I could talk to about my weird interests without getting side eye, even sharing some weird interests/hobbies, genuinely fun to talk to. 
     I gave her an old doll of mine the spring before last (it belonged to my grandmother originally, it brought her comfort in her dementia) to remake to my liking/giving her some freedom to do what she wanted with it to make it creepy.
     She had legitimate reasons for it being delayed initially, a move to a new house, unpacking and having to work to get her finances better after things settled. She originally told me I would have it by Halloween of last year, I gave her the base doll that June. Then the excuses started when I began to ask her about progress closer to the time I was supposed to get it. The move, doll and materials are still boxed up, working too much, all reasons I understand. It’s not like I was pestering her either, we’d go back and forth with ideas, just mixed in with regular buddy chit chatting. 
     She sent me one set of progress pictures a few months ago, and told me I’d have it by *this years* Halloween, but nothing since. A while ago I realized that I hadn’t heard from her in a bit which is unusual, and I sent her a message checking up on her (not commission related at all, just a concerned friend). No response. Waited a couple months because I felt like I’d be a pain in the ass if I prodded too much, tried to check in again, nothing. Then someone we both know told me she’s using heroin. (She moved to a shithole town notorious for being rife with addiction problems, not that that makes it certain that she’s using, but I’d say it increases the chance) I’m not even worried about the doll getting made anymore, I just want it back and for her to be okay. She’s sweet, talented and smart. I don’t want her to throw her life away. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know for sure if that person who told me she was using is right, and I can’t get in touch with her in any way (texting, calls, she’s always on Facebook but ignores me). I want to cry. For her, for my being so stupidly trusting in the first place. Should I just give up and consider the doll a loss and her gone from my life? I don’t want her to be another statistic, but at the same time, not my business. I’m at a loss here. I’m sorry if this is a wall of text, not quite sure how mobile formatting works.

For the last 2 years, he has rarely left bed, has let his hygiene go, neglected the dog he brought into our relationship, stopped helping much around the house and stopped enjoying the things he enjoys doing. He lives on takeout food when he can afford it. My reaction to this has been to pick up the slack. I have always seen this as a temporary thing. He'll get better, right? I just need to be the best GF I can be until then.

The worst part though is his lack of motivation to get better. I've pushed him to go to the doc, to start therapy, to get out of bed each day, to take his tablets... the list goes on. You can probably see where this is going. I've made it too easy for him to slip into a rut. I have enabled this behavior to go on. Now his little motivation has become zero. Now I play the role of mom. Now I worry about him 24/7, treating him like a child. Now I am so on edge from having to pick up the slack I snap easily. I anger easily. Sometimes everything gets a bit too much for me to handle. This has changed things. Now it seems I am too far-gone in my habits of caring for him that he has become completely reliant on me for everything. And he has become my #1 priority. Above myself. But more recently.. I'm now shadowing his behavior. I've let my diet go.. my hygiene go... all because it seems like the habit of the moment in our home. I am dependent and so is he.

I KNOW this is wrong. I KNOW I am not responsible for anyone other than myself. I KNOW the obvious advice is to walk. BUT.. what are my options here? Is it possible for a couple to work through codependency? If I start focussing more on myself, detach from my caretaker role... what else is possible? Couples' therapy? How can I break this cycle?? I know this isn't anyone's fault. I'm just looking for solutions. I love this man so dearly and I believe seperately to my dependence.. Help!

TLDR: I am a codependent, and my partner is physically DEPENDENT on me. I'm equally motivated to walk and equally motivated do my best to fix things. What practical steps can I take, considering I really love the person, but do NOT want to sacrifice more of my self-esteem and wellbeing?",25Nov2018,1

533,"There was a shooting at my house yesterday. My brother in law and his cousin were sitting in the car on my driveway, waiting for my sister and HER BABY to get in the car so they can go home, my mom was with my niece pushing the stroller. Out of nowhere, a random guy with a perge-like mask opened fire on them about 20 feet away.  My brother was sitting in the driver’s seat when he ducked and bullets flew threw the windshield. His cousin was hit in the face and shoulder, luckily he survived. We called the police, the ambulance came and they were taking care of it.

The thing that’s killing me is the thought of “what if my sister and niece were in the car?” “What if my mom and sister never came inside the house?” “What if the bullets that went through the windshield actually hit my brother in law?” All these what if’s are killing me. I cant even step outside my house without thinking someone’s gonna shoot me now.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that my family and other relatives are very much against gang related activities. We always keep our distance from that kind of stuff. BUT, as much as i hate judging, my brother in law’s cousin (that got shot) looks like he’a a gang member. My sister even claimed he threw hand signs at a family gathering, a gathering he wasnt even invited to since he’s not even related to us. The one and only time he comes to my house, this happens. A place where it shouldnt have happened. A very happy and loving family put in the crossfire for someone else’s problem.",25Nov2018,1
534,"For as long as I can remember, I have always struggled with loathing my physical appearance. For clarity I am 25F, about 5""3 in height and a size 12/14 UK dress.

Mentally I like my personality, I have lots of fulfilling hobbies and a great boyfriend (soon to be husband) and I have developed some amazing, strong friendships with a few people over the past 10 years. I have had 3 boyfriends leading up to my current S/O. But I am absolutely disgusted by the way I look.

My boyfriend gets the pleasure of experiencing this first hand. I hate my face; my combination skin that covers it, the way my jaw is slightly off centre, my hairline, the space between my eyebrows and eyelids. My hair is quite thin because of genetics. My teeth are straighter than most but I hate smiling with my mouth open  for pictures because I don't want people to have a moment caught in time of how unflattering I look. I hate my figure; I have wide hips so I will never be as slim as I want from the front, I will always have a bit of a tummy. I'm too ashamed to go to the gym and I feel revolting exercising outside, so if I ever feel up to it, I do it in the dark so nobody can see me. I hate my thighs, and my arms, and the way my back looks in anything. 

Usually if I have to make an effort to dress up and go somewhere, it is mentally and physically exhausting for me because I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin. I get so worked up trying to find an outfit that is flattering but hides my flaws. My boyfriend often has to leave the room. I end up feeling/being sick and too afraid to look at the mirror. It usually ends in tears and getting back into my pyjamas. I tend to regress into hoodies and jeans on my days off, which I understand isn't flattering for the most part and I have had negative comments from my boyfriend and friends about my clothing habits. But I like the bagginess of jumpers and the feeling of being able to hide in them. I can't do this for work or when I am out somewhere nice, so in those cases I would spend the majority of my time trying to 'suck myself in' and stand/sit at the most flattering angles possible, or hide at my desk. However I am not sure if that exists as I also hate my side profile as much as my front.

I am supposed to be getting married in over a year to somebody I love dearly, so I can 100% confirm that my feelings about myself aren't with the intention of getting attention or validation from others. I don't think I care about being attractive. I receive compliments from time to time and I just assume people are trying to be nice, or make a joke of me, or are lying. 

None of my friends have ever known that I experience this. At times I find it difficult to be comfortable in the presence of other people socially because I am filled with so much self loathing. I always feel cripplingly embarrassed after going out with people despite doing nothing weird or wrong.

My boyfriend says I have to just like myself (wow I'm cured thanks). He suggested I look into it which seems like a good start. But it just feels impossible because these feelings stems so far back. I have an opinion of myself, and because I hate myself I feel like my only option is to try and change myself. I am trying to do keto to lose any fat, but otherwise everything cosmetic that I could do costs money and as it currently stands I have none of that. I also realise because of my mentality that I am bound to find more issues with myself even if I did follow through with cosmetic procedures.

Is it true that I could find some kind of way mentally to get out of this? I was bullied a lot at school and physically/mentally abused as a kid/teenager which might be the root cause, but I am too scared to do therapy because it upset me and embarrassed me a lot last time. IMHO I just never thought I would be alive this long so I didn't anticipate that I would have to tackle this problem at any stage. Any help would be massively appreciated. Sorry for the long post.

537,"A guy friend and I had a falling out around a year ago. He called me an abusive asshole because he felt as though I was jerking him around, since I’d constantly flake on our plans. It took 2 years of me flaming all the time for him to finally cut me off. I admit I was an ass; I have agoraphobia and I was also weird about hanging out with him cause I was worried my boyfriend would be uncomfortable with me hanging out with guys alone. It turns out that he isn’t. 

Anyways, it’s been a year since that falling out. And the guy just hit me up recently. He acted as if nothing happened, and we didn’t discuss any of our previous falling out. We talked a little bit here and there, and now he wants to chill. 

I feel like it’s odd that he never mentioned any of it? And we’ve barely even talked since. He just kinda immediately jumped to us chilling. I don’t know him TOO well. I’ve chilled with him a few times and it was fine.

538,"So here’s the story. I was born without testicles. I have to be on a testosterone supplement but that doesn’t quite work as intended. Add to it, my penis, honestly, just doesn’t quite work as expected. Due to lack of testicles when erect it points downward instead of out which makes sex difficult. Due to both of these my sex life, which or not being absent, has had some let down. 

But I’ve learned to adapt. I make sure to be fully certain that the woman is pleased. Whether be oral or even toys if needed so my wife and I make it work. 

She also has PCOS and is diabetic. She has very little sex drive either. You would think this is a match made in heaven, which it is. We work really well together and are both super happy with the marriage. 

But I still can’t shake that I’m not good enough in bed. 

Idk if it’s the images of sex that is in the media or what. I have had one girl in the past leave me cause I couldn’t have “ real sex “ and most others cheated on me. Now I personally feel this is the blame for the guilty feelings and the anxiety over her not feeling satisfied. 

When we do have sex she always seems very happy with results, as am I. But I can’t shake this feeling. 

We’ve been married a year and it’s maybe sex once every month or so. 

Other than this, this is legit the dream marriage. Happy, makes each other smile, and I can’t stop thinking about her. But I just feel like I’m not good enough. Which pushes me into feeling like I HAVE to want sex even when honestly, I’m good. Like I said, low testosterone. 

Idk what advice I needed or whatever but I just wanted to vent to somebody. That’s all. 

I do talk to her about it and she’s aware I feel this way. Very honest marriage. But I don’t wanna sound like a broken record to her. 

TLDR. Neither of us are normal sexually. But I feel like I’m not sexing her enough. Worried she will find sex elsewhere even though she has given zero reason to think that. ",25Nov2018,1

I sneak candy at every available opportunity. It's gotten so bad my Dad has to lock up most, if not all, sweets in a filing cabinet in his office. I've considering learning to pick locks to break in to it, but he's gotten complacent and just left the key about. The issue is it's so easy, I just have to wait until he's out of his office, unlock the cabinet, get whatever shit I'm craving, shove it in my pockets, lock the cabinet, casually walk to the bathroom down the hall, eat the candy, and flush the wrappers down the toilet.

As I said in the title, I'm really lonely - not friendship wise, I have a lot of friends (online, atleast) that I spend a lot of time with, but romantically. I want to cuddle with someone, wake up next to someone, share my life with someone, but the problem is that I don't have that special someone. I have spent most, if not all, of my free time at home on the PC ever since I was 12.

I'm 18, male, straight, from Germany. I'm in my last year of school, but finding someone there won't work, as I'm known as ""the odd guy"" by everyone (this is my own fault - when I was younger, I used to behave horribly and sort of aggressively pushed everyone who tried to talk to me away because I was scared of the unknown).

However, I find myself hesitant as the deadline to make a decision draws near. My brother is offering me a great deal, a spacious room with a full bath and all utilities included for very cheap. He even understands that I would be moving in to pursue my dreams of streaming so I would be technically jobless. On the other hand, I don't know if I can just quit my jobs, working for about 8 years starting in high school working as sorta been what I know how to do. So I get this weird feeling of not knowing what to do. If I stayed in my current city, rent is sky high and I would probably have to try and find another roommate ASAP.

563,"I have found the perfect gift for my parents in law, a ”voucher” for a new and popular restaurant downtown in their city. However, I am not the richest person, and i could only see myself being able to put in maximum ~100 euros to this gift. With that money they wouldnt be able to choose like the most expensive things on the menu, but they would afford most of what is on there. Is it bad to offer them the voucher as a gift, since the money isnt enough to get them ”ANYTHING they want”? Is it rude to gift them something where they potentially would have to put money in to ot as well?

564,"I made a throwaway because I embarrass myself with how not good at peopling I am.

A little background on me I guess, i (28yo) have really bad anxiety, and a track record of rejection (which is ABSOLUTELY devastating to me as someone who is constantly seeking approval from everyone around me. I'm in therapy for these problems but it might take a long dang time to get over a lifetime of that stuff)

Im at a point where I'm at a much much lower anxiety level than my historic record (usually running a 7-8, recently at like 2-3) but the fear of rejection lingers. The situation where this is becoming problematic is this: I have a friend (30yo) and I have a crush on them. I have known this friend for well over a decade and if I'm being 100% honest the crush has always been there. 

Recently, this I'm not super focused on how panicked I am about literally everything, this crush is becoming pretty dang strong. Like, butterflies and heart palpitations when they have messaged me... That jazz. We talk everyday, and like I've mentioned I'm a damn adult  and I need to do something about this. Everyone close to me tells me just tell them about it. 

This is where the fear of rejection comes in. I am also very aloof when it comes to other people interacting with me which I suspect is a byproduct of  growing up as an ugly  kid, so I have no idea if they are just humoring me or what? This also where I mention that we live several hundred miles apart from one another, which may or may not matter I have no idea.

I know I'm overthinking everything but that is how I've always been. I have no idea how to even move forward because I am paralyzed by my fear and my experiences. How the hell do you let someone know you like them and why am I so bad at human interaction?!?!

566,"Hi there.

First of all I just want to say I’m writing this from my mobile phone so I apologize for any typos or formatting issues. 

A good friend of mine for about the past 10 years recently stop speaking to me, and I’m not sure why. Back in June we had a misunderstanding over the dress I wore (in her bridal party) to her wedding. She allowed us to pick her own dresses but wanted us to order from a very specific site to ensure the color matched. I had ordered multiple dresses from the site and none of them seem to fit. Frustrated as it was hard to get my money back I had asked her if I could go through a different website is she allowed another girl to shop elsewhere. She had said she was fine with that as long is I sent her a picture of the dress. Which, to me was MORE than reasonable. I did, it was okay.

Or so I thought. 

About a month goes by and I tried texting and calling her to which I get no response. She works in the medical field so I think maybe I’m just catching her at a weird time due to the fact that they work odd hours. 

She finally calls me back and says that she’s upset that I didn’t even try to order from the site she wanted, she’s upset that I ruined her pictures because my dress is a shade darker than the rest of the girls, and that I was getting back at her because she didn’t come to my bridal shower and we had some disagreements regarding my bachelorette party (she’s out of state). 

I let her talk about obviously I’m a little hurt by this because I didn’t try, I just didn’t want her to be burderened by my issues with the website. To which I eventually express. I also stated that it upset me that she stewed so long about this and now I obviously can’t fix it. That in the future if something is bothering her she really needs to talk to me about it and not sit on it. She agrees. We both we’re good and make plans to see each other in the future.

Fast forward a few months she brings up a trip to Vegas with some of her bridesmaids. I just started a new job and a lot of my time off and i didn’t have enough, so I tell her that I may not be able to come but I’ll keep you posted. I tell her that it’s between visiting her in her state, or going on this trip - and I think we might visit her in her state. I asked her about dates that may work for me and my husband to come visit, she informs me that because her schedule is month-to-month, she can only let me know a month in advance two which is fine. 

A few weeks go by, and I try calling and texting her regarding dates/the trip. Nothing.

I tried texting her about the trip asking about it too which I get very cold reply. Almost like I was an inconvenience at this point. I decide not to go due to the reply. 

She goes on a trip with her now husband and I write some stuff on her wall, I even send her a Facebook message telling her about all the great things in area. Nothing. 

I then wish her a happy Thanksgiving (US). Nothing. 

Finally today I reached my threshold. I asked her if everything is all right. Nothing

Now. This is all on Facebook so I can see if she has seen it and she has. I’m sad that she is choosing to ignore me but also annoyed and frustrated because she’s almost 30 acting like she’s 7 and went back on our agreement. 

At this point I’m very hurt and frustrated. I’m not sure what to think and don’t want to say anything that might make matters worse but I feel disrespected. 

Any advice (be kind. I don’t have a tolerance for disrespect) is welcomed.

571,"That is a repost of my old [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/7jggu5/topic_of_trust_and_paranoia/) at /r/intj, modified and supplemented. Then I had received plenty of profound advices, still, would like to hear more of them.

**Figurative situation**: *Person A* has shared some sensitive private data with Person B via a conversation, and subsequently, perceives actions of *Person B* as a hostile acts toward himself (*Person A*). To convince *Person A* that there is nothing to worry about seems like a futile venture for *Person B*. For *B* - to live his own life and to do not care about *Person's A* suspicions, looks like the only solution.

The complexity of this is in that there actually were something that could led to a undesirable outcome for *Person A* from outgoing *Person's B* actions **in the past**, but there is nothing **in the present**.

**Person A** - powerful, prideful, probably narcissistic and vengeful, clingy, sensitive to a critic of any kind (especially outgoing from someone who's not worthy to criticize him), shameless, highly concerned of good public image. A man of a action, if a decision is made, he's hardly stops in a way. That is a decent quality. but on the other hand and in that specific situation - scarcely reconsidering cause of his goal, rushing away like a locomotive, sweeping away everything standing in his way (or perceived as standing in his way, sadly).

**Person B** - seemingly timid, 'head in the clouds', curious (enough to stumble upon such dilemmas), highly sensitive to any form of rigid limitations and unreasonable control (especially from someone who interprets everything in it's own way, from egocentrical views). Annoyed by *A*'s constant intrusion into *B*'s personal life, who's using different methods, and has a little to no respect to others privacy, thinking only about his issue and interests, causing unnecessary trouble to a many, and just can't stop, being obsessed with some wrong conclusion. 

* There is no any necessity in communication between **A** and **B**. 

* There is no point in legal advices.

* Advices like 'why B can't just walk away from A' is not concidered. *Person B* can't just walk away from *Person A*. They doesn't interact at all in life. And a lot has passed since they were associated.

* Any advice recieved is **not** percieved as guidance, so feel free to expound your thoughts, which are totally would definitely be valuable.

**TLDR**: How to get unstuck from a paranoid person that is fixated and aimed on you? (Or to become uninteresting at least)

Regain of trust is a perfect option, but, to a regret, not possible, maybe.

572,"Basically what the title says. I stress and obsess over my grades to a ridiculous degree for no reason, and I want to stop desperately. My stress and standards regarding my grades affect me emotionally (I get super depressed when I get below an A-, I become incredibly upset/agitated/angry with myself if I miss turning in an assignment, I feel constantly on edge when an assignment is coming up, etc.) and physically (I lose sleep over coursework, I have chronic muscle tension in part due to my anxiety over getting good grades). It sucks.

I have no reason for these extremely high standard regarding my grades. My family never puts pressure on me to maintain a certain average, and we only really discuss marks if I bring it up. I don’t bring up my grades with my friends, and they don’t ask me about them. I can’t even get anymore scholarships next year due to policies at my school, so there’s no need to get straight As. And this isn’t my final year of school, so my marks right now really have no impact on my future in any way.

I just want to be okay with getting a B. I want to be able to miss 5% because I didn’t turn in an assignment and not feel fucking devastated. I want to be able to hand in a project and not spend the next 3 weeks certain that I failed and hating myself for it, only to get back an A+ for the billionth time. I want to be unaffected if a prof comments on my work pointing out a mistake.

Logically, I know my grades don’t matter. But emotionally, they matter immensely to me. And I can’t even find a reason why. I’m the absolute first person to tell others that grades are arbitrary, and that they’re useless when it comes to measuring intelligence. How can I believe that wholeheartedly, but still hold myself to such an obscene standard?

Any advice on how to get over my stress? This self-imposed pressure is draining me every day.",25Nov2018,1
573,"Mind you, I have half siblings, but those siblings are 50+ years old. And did not have that close of a relationship to our father who was 87 when he passed. They don't have a that close of a relationship with me either since the age difference as well as the distance between us.

My mother left my brother and I when I was 6 years old. He was 13 at the time. She left home, and I haven't heard anything from her in 18 years.
I don't have any immediant feelings towards losing my mother since I have repressed the memories and I was a bit too young to even regsiterbwhay had happened . Even though she left, I had our father take us in and he became everything we ever needed. He stepped up to the plate and took on the roll of both our mom and dad. 

When I was 13 the next person who had left my life, (this time not willingly) was my 21 years old brother who had a fatal off road accident. Which had left me brotherless, and my father with out a son, once more. His first son had died in a motorcycle accident during his first marriage almost 20 years prior. My relationship with my father grew even stronger. We both had someone to fall back on during this dark time in both of our lives . He was also 77 when this happened and while he was in great shape for a 77 year old I knew he was aging. Even if people  refused to believed his age when they told them how old he was . He was young at heart  and it showed through his demeanor and appearance. 

This leaves me to write about the 11th of November 2018.. Just a few short weeks ago. My father had a slip and fall while he was visiting his home town 2,200 miles away from home. 
While he was still physically able to do things that 90%of 87 year olds cannot do, or doesn't stop the fact that even a simple trip and take someone at that age out. 
I was by his side for almost 3 weeks until I realized the only life he would have been able to live is one in a vegistative state. I knew he didn't want that... 
So I did what my father would have wanted me to let him go. 

So here I am, back home now where my dad an I lived together. Realizing I'm all alone in this world. Relaxing that the ONLY person who had my back was my father. That's it.
I don't know what to do now. I'm not married, I do not have children. All I have are the cats my father and I took took in form the street and the two ducks my dad surprised me with for Easter, 5 years ago. 

I have only been back in town for one day.. And I don't even know where to begin. 
I just wanted to give you guys a backstory of my life and the ones I have lost during , hoping that someone here on reddit can give me some solid words of advice. 
I'm lost, alone, feeling so exposed. I do not have my protector anymore. There is no safe spot I can go to now, a spot where I can sit down with my dad and talk about whatever was on my mind without judgment. Or have that one person, who will tell you how it is with no hidden agenda. 

Those of you who have similar stories please share with me how you cope with being alone. 


Thank you all xx

Ps I will most likely come back to rewrite this. Since it's pretty sloppy.. I just need it on reddit in the meantime.

575,"tldr; I, 22m, have changed jobs at least a dozen times over 6 years. Is this normal?

I started working at 17, now 22, and I've changed jobs at least a dozen times for a dozen different companies. All entry level retail or restaurant jobs, I only have some college education. 

The longest I've held the same job is 6 months in a department store, each other only being for 1 - 4 months, with bits of searching for a job in between. I also worked at the same fast food company for a combined total of almost 10 months, changing location, but of my own volition  (meaning I formally quit, and told the next location I previously worked for the company.) 

I've only been fired once, from a local retail game store, for being ""too aggressive"" when interacting with customers. (I really think it's because I didn't fit in. Also apparently they change employees frequently.)  When applying, I note the department store I worked at for 6 months, the fast food company for 10 but only one location, and maybe one other job, depending on where I apply. I also say I was never fired. Basically I lie out of my ass.

You could imagine what my references are like, practically none. I use two friends I worked with before, and my uncle with a different last name to flesh things out sometimes. I've had great managers and supervisors, but I have trouble forming relationships, and some anxiety in general as well as major depression, sometimes it shows. To the point that I would start crying when I was alone.

I think it's because of this I can't hold a comfortable job. I have always either quit because I was always anxious or depressed around co-workers, my location changed and I couldn't handle walking that far, or fired once. Never did I feel the work load was too much, I work hard. The thing is, I always do a great job. At the department store, I was given a good review by a customer. And another job as a busser, I was told the only bad thing was I move too fast, otherwise I did a perfect job. I follow instructions to the letter and I'm kind.

I realize this is abnormal, and somewhat irresponsible, but how abnormal is it? Do many people change work places this frequently by their early 20s? If employers do see all the places associated with my SSN, they are probably dissuaded. Do they always check? Are some understanding enough to give me chance? What possibilities do I have? I want to find a job I can be comfortable with, and support me through college, so I can actually finish.

576,"I’ve known this person for about 5 years now. We’ve been great friends, but everything took a turn around 6 months ago. Our communication was all over the place and she seemed to not care about our relationship as much as she used to. She started playing games and acting weird. For instance, one day she invited me to her house and said she misses me. I text her later that day and she replies not today. She then ignores my double text. When I do see her she acts like nothing happened and doesn’t even mention it. Another time I decided to go to a huge 4 day events with my friends. She also went to the same event, but we were separated in different groups. She knew that I was there, since we both talked about the event and what we were looking forward to. I messaged her all four days to ask her if she wanted to hang out and received lame excuses until the end of the event. I ended up not seeing her even though we were in a half a mile radius for 4 days. After all that, I’ve discovered she’s been talking nonsense behind my back from our mutual friends. The thing that rustles my jimmies the most is when she asks to hang out the following week like nothing ever happened. I don’t know how to feel and what emotions to express because I really don’t know what is going on with her. This is why I kind of hate her right now and don’t know how to remove the hate.

578,"Hello. I’m in a bit of a family holiday conundrum.

I have two nephews, and one niece. The oldest nephew is 14, and lives with his father. Let’s call him, ‘Michael.’

Michael never calls, or sees our side of the family, except for Christmas. And that’s only because of a court order. 

My sister lost custody of Michael when he was 3 due to drug use. She’s been struggling with drugs on &amp; off for years. He’s been estranged from our family since. We’re supposed to see him every other week, but his biological father doesn’t follow court guidelines, and after years of fighting, my sister got tired of pushing visitation. 

Michael’s father is very rich. 

My other relatives and I don’t have money to fight the courts for more visitation, either, and I feel like it would only make things worse if we tried. 

I am glad Michael lives with his father, because I know he’s being properly taken care of and in a safe environment. However I do not think it is right for Michael’s father to keep him away from us. We can’t help that is mother struggled with addiction. We did the best for her, and still help her, all we can. 

We call Michael all the time. He never answers his cell. There’s always an excuse. We practically beg him over all year-round but we get silence. I’m not sure if he’s distant because he does care, or if his father is forcing the distance.

Usually, my relatives &amp; I give Michael a large sum of money as a Christmas present since it is the one time of year that we do see him. We do so out of guilt, and because we want him to like us.

I am considering putting my foot down, though, in protest to my relatives (who normally give him like $100). 

I think $10 SHOULD be a decent gift instead of the $50 he gets from me. I have two other kids to worry about (niece/other nephew), and I’m on a strict low budget.

My relatives are making me feel terrible for this. They say I never see him so I should pay more. But I feel like Michael could contact me more, too, and that money won’t fix our relationship anyway.

And yes, I have spoken with Michael about our family’s dysfunctional distance in the past: politely but firmly. 

I love him but I feel he only comes over for the money, and my heart is hurt because of it. (He threw away the small gifts &amp; clothing we gave him in the past, and is only interested in name brand clothing or money).
