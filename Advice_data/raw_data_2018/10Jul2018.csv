0,"So I will try to shorten this so it's not a novel because there is a lot of history.  Short story: I did the ancestry DNA test and who my mother thought was my father....is not.  I received the results over a week ago finding two aunts and a 1st cousin that I had never heard of.  I reached out to my cousin and we found out who my father is after speaking with my mother.  I met with one of my new aunts and my cousins, it went well.  I really like them and they were amazing people.

However, I get this nagging feeling that it was more for show and that it was more of a ""venting"" then a getting to know.  My father has been told of me, but is shocked and embarrassed by the situation.  I haven't spoke to him, my aunt has, but as each day goes by I feel as if they hope I go away.  Contact has been decreasing and my aunt was supposed to talk to my father this past weekend about talking to me.  It's now Monday evening and nothing.  I don't want to be a pest and ask how things went, but it does feel like it didn't go well otherwise I think she would have contacted me by now.  

Maybe, I'm just over looking things and I do have a habit of looking at things negatively.  NOTE: I am not always a depressed guy lol.  I just have this sinking feeling and it's getting to me.  I've been wanting answers for 20 some years...I don't mind some wait, but it's hard not to see a correlation between meeting me in person and then decreasing interaction with me.

Any constructive thoughts? Or am I just crazy? LOL",10Jul2018,4
1,"*(x-post to* [*r/careerguidance*](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance)*)*

I am searching for a strategy to carve a way out of my current situation and decided today to try to share my struggles with a subreddit community to see if folks had any insights into how I might move forward in my career. Here is a little bit of information about my current situation.

***Background***

As an undergraduate, I majored in sociology. I don't regret it -- I think it helped me develop a compassionate worldview and I found it quite interesting -- but I did find that it did not allow me to find the sort of career I liked after graduating from college. Despite graduating from a prestigious college, my first job out of school paid just $9.25/hr.

I knew I had to make a change, so I swung in the opposite direction - from very generalized to a highly specialized career. After a couple more years of study, I became a translator. It's a pretty cool job - I get a lot of autonomy and I get paid a pretty high rate per hour -- but I don't work 40 hours a week, usually -- so I end up with a pretty low-average salary (but to me that's worth it because I get more free time than most).

It also has its challenges: no paid time off/vacation, no benefits, and ultimately I am beholden to my clients and the text on the page before me. I may get to translate interesting things from time-to-time, but I don't really get to work on a team, make my ideas come to life, or contribute more of my mind than just my service/specialty and a healthy dose of people skills. I translate a native language, so my prospects are only available in the U.S. Like any career, translating has a lot of perks and some drawbacks, but overall - it's certainly in the top 15&amp;#37; of careers I can be fairly happy doing. I am proud to tell people what I do for a living...

***Where I am today***

...but I am desperate for a change. I have realized that each year I work solely as a translator is another year I was not developing any broadly marketable/desirable skills. Sociology was too broad and translation too narrow - I needed something in the middle, so I completed a master's degree (abroad) in business innovation.

Coming from my previous educational and work experience, the business world was a punch in the gut. I was a minority among my peers, most of whom had undergraduate experience in business subjects. Somehow I made it through the course, but I feel far from being the master of anything. I struggle with understanding the components of a balance sheet or other financial statements, barely understand how investing works, and overall feel like a dud. I know I can learn anything I put my mind to, but the course was geared toward folks with a lot more previous knowledge than I had. I know I can learn quickly but when I look at the jobs available these days, my options are to take a huge pay cut and enter at the lowest level or somehow market myself to get a job that's a bit of a stretch for me and then work my ass off to catch up while in the position. *(Does anyone else feel like the range of jobs these days is bipolar, with ""unpaid intern"" at one end and ""10+ years of executive leadership experience"" at the other, with very little in between?)*

***Where I want to be tomorrow***

I am ready for a change and here are the challenges I face:

* I do not want to work/live in the U.S.

I am American, but I find life in the U.S. stifling to the point that I live a pretty depressed life. I am desperate to get out of the U.S. as fast as possible, which is extremely challenging as I do not have a right to work in Europe unless I am sponsored by a company. To achieve that, I have to prove that I am essential and that my skills aren't represented among European applicants for the same position. This is very hard to do without a strong tech background. (And though my career is specialized, it is America-dependent - I can reassure you there is ***\*not\**** an option to work remotely in my field, though it sounds like there should be).

* I do not want to translate anymore.

I think if I could have any (professional) dream come true, I would be a (successful) social entrepreneur. I would love to be a leader and build an organization from the ground up that has a social mission built into its core from day one. Despite my interest in moving to Europe, I have a very American amount of student loan debt that doesn't disappear upon relocating internationally. Salaries are lower in many parts of Europe (compared to, say, New York or Los Angeles) and as entrepreneurial as I feel in my heart, I cannot just forgo a paycheck to pursue my dream of starting up.

**If I can't pivot into the field of entrepreneurship quite yet, I know the following about myself:**

* My number one priority is relocating permanently to Europe.
* I enjoy working with people, especially in contexts where lots of people from diverse/international backgrounds get together
* I enjoy working in dynamic positions where there is variety day-to-day and a lot of autonomy and responsibility.
* Travel is a major plus
* I really am oriented toward working alongside organizations that have a strong commitment to making the world a better place (NGOs, non-profits, social enterprises, etc.)
* I love writing but have never monetized it
* I have good at communication skills (translating helps build the ability to understand nuance and subtext) but they are not exactly transferrable in traditional ways
* I want to change the world for the better

Knowing these things about myself, I have considered what other things I might pursue to combine some of those personal ideals and strengths into a profession. I could imagine myself being happy if my day involved working on various projects, either as an independent consultant or as a member of a social change-oriented organization. I could imagine experiencing a higher amount of satisfaction than I do now in roles like:

* **Digital marketer/consultant/strategist** sounds the most promising, but I still lack significant tech chops to do that quite yet. (**Also: copy writer?)**
* **Social impact consultant** would be amazing, but I lack relevant experience (outside of some graduate school projects) that would allow me to claim being an expert in the field.
* **Impact investor** \- but my financial literacy is dismal
* **Agile coach** \- my personality style seems well suited toward it, but I have no direct experience with the framework
* **Diversity and Inclusion training** (though I would be more qualified for this kind of work in the U.S. than in Europe)
* **Tour(ism) operator** \- I think I would love designing and running a company that provided unique tours to international travelers visiting Europe
* **Innovation manager** \- but I lack direct experience, outside of practicing a bit in graduate school
* **Project/Program manager**

**Most of all, though, I'd love to be a social entrepreneur. I want to lead, I want to build, and I want to do incredibly impactful things with a team - but can't forgo income to scrape by while I try to start up (I cannot just give up on paying my student loan debt, as much as I would love to).**

***What I need from you***

As you can see, I am stuck between 4 rocks and 3 hard places. I see a few spaces I might be able to excel in, and I got a foreign master's degree under my belt, but I cannot afford to start from square 1, exactly. So I guess I need advice on how to transition into an entirely new field, and somehow leverage my master's in business innovation enough to get a role a few rungs above where my actual professional experience lies. It's like a vicious cycle: My debt keeps me translating because it pays decently, but I would leave so quickly if I found a role that paid enough and allowed me to move to Europe and keep up with the cost of living there and my student loan debt. As you can imagine, this is infinitely more easily said than done.

I feel trapped and overwhelmed these days and would appreciate knowing anything you might be seeing in my blindspot or any advice you might have for me to help me get out of this rut I'm stuck in. Any advice?

Thank you for your help.

**tl;dr - I have a super specialized, U.S.-based career and want to transition into a new career/field abroad, but cannot figure out how to pin down what I want and how to get it. As such, I live every day spiraling in a vortex of existential doubt and suffocating depression.**",10Jul2018,4
2,"I'm 19 and I just got my first job. It's an internship, but it pays a few dollars an hour over minimum wage. I've gotten two paychecks so far, but the only thing I've dared spend my money on is two GRE prep books because I want to get a PhD after college. My parents are still paying for my food and stuff and I'm living at home with them, so I can spend my money if I want. I want to get a few things, but every time I subtract the money that those things would cost from my balance, I feel like the new balance would be too low and I don't want to spend the money. It's irrational because it's not like there's anything I need to save a whole bunch of money for and I'm confident I can get the same internship again next summer. Plus, since I'll have more education by then I will make more money there. How can I get over my fear of spending money?",10Jul2018,1
3,"I got my first boyfriend (20) when I (19) was severely depressed two years ago while working at an ice cream store. We were together for 6 months and one day I said something about wanting to die, he called the police and left me (which I don't blame him for). Five months later in April of last year, he came back from university (for the summer) and we started dating again. Things were going well we were happy, I was getting better at being not depressed than things just seemed to start going downhill after a couple months of dating. (Here's a list of things that happened)

\-(I've never done drugs/drank and never have) He took me to a city where his friend lived, he said we were going to play video games and he was going to smoke which I was fine with. We get to his friend's house and it's a house party with drunk people smoking and I felt uncomfortable, the next day I just didn't feel good and wanted to go home but he wanted to stay and party so at around 7 pm I had a panic attack? (I'm not sure) but I started crying feeling scared and he left with me to a restaurant where I called my mom to come to get me, she came as soon as the call ended and after that he said I'm going to wait 20 minutes for your mom to get here and then I'm going back to the party knowing it was a 3 hours drive, and he left me to go to the party.

\-I wasn't eating much because I didn't like my body and just was never really hungry, he tells me he while I'm trying to eat some food that ""he'd like me better if I were thicker"" (I'm 5foot5inches, am a 32b, skinny, have a small waist and a normal sized butt but a tummy. Skinny fat?) and that made me feel like he didn't like my body but he said he said that because he was trying to get me to eat more.

\-We were sitting in my bedroom painting and he looks at my breasts and goes don't you wish you had breasts to play with (motioning at my breasts) and I was confused why he asked me if I had bigger breasts because that's what I took it as but he said he meant if he had female breasts and I could play with those breasts.

\-On our 5th? date the first time we started dating he asked if I wanted to give him a blowjob and I said no not really and he said well then do you want to have sex and I said no and he said well which one do you want to do and I thought since I said no to both he wouldn't give me an ultimatum but he did and I didn't really want to give a blow job because I have a small mouth so I'm bad at them so I said sex and I was crying while we had sex but he said he didn't know I was crying and that I should have said no again. (I don't think he raped me but I didn't like it?)

\-On our 2nd date we were watching an anime and in the show, this boy character grabs a female character's breast and squeezes it so he thought he'd do that to me and he grabbed my breasts and started squeezing them and I just laughed it off but it was odd to do considering we just met. He says he shouldn't have done it.

\-Almost a year ago we had a talk about porn and we both agreed not to watch it because I felt weird about it because of the other stuff he's said about my body and it made me feel not good and he said he wouldn't, I told him he could because I didn't want to be controlling and he insisted he wouldn't watch it at all. A week and a half ago I found out he's been watching porn ever since we had that talk and lying to me about it. He said he thought if I never found out it wouldn't hurt me. 

\-The reason he had for watching porn about if I didn't know it wouldn't hurt me scares me because with that logic he could cheat on me saying if I don't find out it won't hurt me.

\-Told me he was sad he wouldn't get to experience dating other people if he only dated me which I get but also don't

\-Recently we've been having a lot of arguments and every time he yells at me and throws his phone or when I try to bring up a point in the argument the second he realizes I have a valid point he'll just start making loud noises over me so I can't speak. This has only started recently.

\-We were having a talk about having a threesome sometime in the future like a year and a half to two years into the future, we were trying to figure out how we would find someone to have a threesome with and he mentions his ex-girlfriend likes threesomes which to me sounded like he was saying we should have it with his ex-girlfriend. He says that's not what he meant and he meant his ex-girlfriend likes threesomes because his friends told him that.

During all of this, my depression got worse than it was ever before and I tried committing suicide about 9 times, I'm now doing much better after getting actual help with a therapist and all and haven't thought about suicide or harming myself in quite some time now like since the start of this year. Although he's done all these things he's kind, nice and when I thought about harming myself one night at around 2 am he drove from his university (2hrs away) to me just to help me. We have so many good memories and I deeply care for him but I don't know if I'm just scared to break up because I don't want to be alone (I don't have any friends just my siblings and parents) or if I actually want to be with him. We made plans to move in together August of this year while he goes to university and I would just work (I don't know what I want to go to school for). I'm not the best person either but I don't make him feel as bad as he makes me feel sometimes. 

I need an outsiders perspective so if you've read this far thank you and I'd greatly appreciate your advice on my relationship. :)",10Jul2018,2
4,"I recently moved in to a quad (basically this means I have my own room, bathroom, and lease but share a kitchen with three others) and when I leave my dishes out to soak or dry, the people I share the kitchen with decide to either wash or put my dishes away and they don’t pay attention to where my things belong, and they don’t tell me where they put my dishes. So when they put my dishes away I can’t find them. And they don’t just do this once or twice they do this often. I don’t leave so many dishes out that it should bother them to the point that they feel like they need to wash them. So it really bothers me that they touch them at all. Also, I work nights so my schedule is opposite from theirs. I don’t like feeling like I need to immediately wash and dry my dishes just to prevent them from getting lost. I don’t do their dishes or put them away when they leave them out. How should I bring it up to them? ",10Jul2018,1
5,"I can't believe I'm actually considering this but here's why I even am. We're practically perfect together, we know each other very well and know what's important to the other. We haven't done anything sexually or even close to it but I've been thinking about it and I'm almost certain she has too. It's obviously extremely taboo and nobody could know, which would make it a difficult relationship at least publicly. 

We're talking about taking a vacation somewhere for a few months and while we're there we could tell who we meet that we're married (having the same last name makes that part easy). 

Maybe when we get back from the trip we could go back to not being together, I don't know. I'm conflicted, what do you think?",10Jul2018,0
6,"I currently have a good job. I work from home, have flexible hours, and my salary isn't bad. My co-workers are great and the work is (usually) fairly low stress. 10 years ago, I would have described my dream job as what I'm currently doing. The problem is that I'm not happy. 

I want to do something where I feel like I'm contributing or giving back to others in some way; working for a non-profit, a charity, something where at the end of the day I feel like I may have made a difference. I've searched online at various job postings but they're often vague, the charity/non-profit seems questionable, or the position is part time and not in my area.

For those that are in this type of work, how did you find it? Should I just find companies that support something I'm passionate about, research them to see if they're legitimate, and go from there?

7,"I'm going to be renting a room in the house my friends just bought. There's technically nothing wrong with the room, other than it has a musty smell. However, everything needs to be cleaned, and I'd like to paint the walls, since the current paint is ancient (it literally may not have been painted since it was built in the 70's).

Here's the thing: I fucking HATE painting. Pretty much any sort of home improvement job. I don't know why, because I'm always happy to pitch in to move furniture, but mundane housework or painting drives me absolutely insane.

Right now, the room looks like shit (which basically lines up with the rest of the house). They're going to be renovating their side of the house. I'm personally half tempted to hire professional painters to come in and paint the bedroom and bathroom.

Do you think it would be reasonable for me to pay through labor, if they covered the cost of the paint? Or should the entire cost be on me, since technically there is nothing wrong with the existing paint?",10Jul2018,1

11,"So i've been speaking with a few girls recently, all been very receptive and I've gotten a positive vibe from them. So, I've gone ahead and asked them would they like to go out? All agreed, gave me their personal numbers and continued the conversation. 

1st girl - Went on a date had a great time. She suggested a second date to which i agreed to but when i want to follow up on it, was always busy or had something on or was ''Probably busy until the end of the summer''. 

2nd girl - I chanced it out of the blue and asked her out even though we had little conversation before that. She agreed and seemed keen to do something. Said she's always busy during the week which is fine, weekends best. However, never has a weekend free apparently? Never counter offers either when i suggest something that doesn't work. Also, pretty bad at keeping a conversation going. As in, 1-3 messages a day maximum. So, I'm not going to peruse this.

3rd girl - Met her recently through work, had a great conversation and it was the strongest vibe I've gotten from anyone before. I just felt like we had some kind of connection. Not sure if this is because I'm very attracted to her or if it's genuine but i like her a lot.  I asked her would she be interested in going for a drink, she agreed, gave me her personal number and told me to contact her. I suggested a day to meet up, again she said she's busy and probably busy until after she returns from holidays in a few weeks. 

I don't know if I'm over reacting but its just become so common now that I'm anticipating it before it even happens. So much so, that when i ask someone out, I'm counting down until they're too busy to meet up. It's draining because i can't help but feel really shit every time it happens. Am i doing something wrong? ",10Jul2018,2

However, she abruptly stopped offering me lifts 3 weeks ago (she still drives every day).

17,"I know this will probably just come around to ""only you can help yourself"" but I'm going to try anyways. 


I'm stuck and I feel lost and I just don't know where to go with life. I've never been independent but I want to be because I feel like it's hindering me. I'm terrified of making any decisions myself because my whole life so far has basically been ""impress parents or receive negative consequence"". 


Now I've come to a point in life where I'm 20 years old, and I don't know how to really ""get out there"". I'm socially awkward (no surprise), shy and generally pretty paranoid that everything and everyone is out to get me. I don't have any friends or anyone I can rely on other than my parents basically, and even at that I can't really trust or confide in my mother so.. just my father. 


Anyways, what I'm getting at is that I've come down to two choices.. I can take the path they want me to take, which would be going back to university, with their financial help (which I'll always greatly appreciate but at the same time continues to give them leverage over me), and go from there. 

My second choice is something I know a lot of people consider irrational and dumb/risky, but it would be taking all my important belongings, buying a plane ticket somewhere and just completely starting over. I do have friends I've met online all over which would possibly sway my choice of where to move to. Obviously it would be difficult but at the same time, I feel like this type of challenge, new surroundings, new people, financial challenges and budgeting and a need to get all of this done and sorted out would really help me evolve as a person. I wouldn't be able to rely on anyone but myself. At the same time though, I have big dreams and that path could really lead me to a dark place if things go awry. 


All in all, I don't know what to do. I should definitely start small but I don't know how. 


I guess what I'm asking is how do I become more independent? How do I go about making friends, and finding something else to do other than work and home. A big part of my problem is location, but I need to work on myself and I just need opinions and advice. ",10Jul2018,2

19,"Sorry for the wall of text:

I've recently cut ties with my dad almost completely (he's blocked on my phone and I won't meet with him outside of family events). For the sake of everyone else in my family, I'll be cordial with him at family parties. 

My younger sister has been battling cancer for 5 years and both he and my mom (divorced) have had very little involvement, especially in recent years. I drive her to all her treatments and appointments, take her for all the midnight ER visits, and check on her at least once a week. My sister and I have always been close and I *never* for a moment mind all the work. That being said, any sort of support from my parents would be gladly welcomed.

Instead, my dad began only texting me or calling me pissed off to tell me I'd mixed up her lab work (which he receives remotely through an online portal) or made some other mistake.

Earlier this year, my sister started losing a ton of weight, became chronically nauseous, and ended up in the ER 3 times in two months. She was clearly having a very difficult time physically and emotionally. Her oncologist wasn't addressing the concerns so I recommended she find a primary care physician and a psychologist (potentially at a hospital closer to her school). I shared my concerns with my parents and my dad lost his mind. He was conviced I was trying to sabotage her treatments and he left me a ton of furious voicemails. 

The tougher it got for her, the less and less she would talk to anyone (including me). She stopped answering phone calls and texts. I pushed her harder for both doctors. Meanwhile, my dad decided I had somehow convinced her not to talk to him and his inability to contact her was because of my malice. Once again, I reiterated my concern for her physical and mental health. The nail on the head came when he replied, ""You need to learn to be more optimistic for your sister.""

And that was my breaking point. These past years have been fucking hard, you guys. Like, really fucking hard. And I keet going because I have to. I'm always happy in front of my sister, my friends, and my family, but fuck dude. Most people have no idea my sister is battling cancer because I don't talk about it (when I do, it's usually as a joke). And he, after everything, ignored my concerns, accused me of being so hateful that I turned his own daughter against him, and finally told me I need to chipper up.

I think, in my heart, what he did is wrong. But fuck me, even in my exhaustion and frustration, holding a grudge feels so awful and dark I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Should I try to mend fences (knowing he'll never apologize but just suck it up and be the bigger man) or should I continue avoiding him?

**Tl;dr:**

I stopped talking to my dad after he blamed my sister's response to cancer treatment on my ""pessimism""

I want him to get the impression that I'm cute and fun, so I've been sprinkling emojis through all of my messages. As a bisexual, I always thought it was really adorable when girls would send me texts in a similar fashion. But now I'm worried that it might be annoying to him, or make me seem vapid. Our exchanges have been completely fine, but the worry still remains. 

So my question is to the fellas out there: When you text girls, do you find it cute or annoying when they use emojis? Should I cut back on the adorable shit or keep going?",10Jul2018,2
21,A few years back my cousin was killed in a motorcycle crash. My mom had a tough time with his death because they had been very close.

I don't want to give the gift to her and it make her cry or be sad again.  I want her to have some things of her own to remember him by. I don't know if I should give it to her.

23,"I live in Hawaii and I haven't have a girlfriend for about 10 years. 

I think the general problem is I have a hard time approaching people face to face or in person. I spend a lot of time online and watching movies, etc. I have average to low self esteem.

My profession is a teacher.

Generally I can put forth a good public persona in the classroom, but the profession hasn't really helped me to develop confidence in my social life with is totally separate. I tend to ""be myself"" and not use any special persona like I do in the classroom.

I have friends that are mostly like me, kind of introvert intellectual types. I have tried online dating with no success, and I sometimes go to mixer events but I just seem to meet a lot of random people and there seems to be no ""spark"" with any of the girls I meet there. It's almost like there's just too many different people at these singles types events.

I used to have a large group of friends but I've since stopped because I got tired of meeting hoards of new people, and it also takes a lot of time that I need to devote to working and studying.

Sometimes, I will eventually meet a girl through socializing that seems to like me but it usually seems short-lived for various reasons. I also suffer with depression (ongoing treatment).

What steps do I need to find a long-term relationship that might eventually lead to marriage, kids, etc.?

24,"Hey there.
My name is Bill and I'm 16 yo. I had a conversation with some friends that made me think some things. So the conversation was about our future and I noticed that my friends had a pretty clear view of what they wanted to do with their lives. The problem I have is that  the things I would like to try and do might not work and I might be broke for the rest of my life. I don't know if I'm supposed to go for a job that I don't enjoy while earning a hige salary, or if I'm supposed to do the the things that I like and possibly never have money. To give you an idea of what I like, I would love to be an actor or a singer, but I know that in these industries it is extremely hard to succeed, thus probably never being wealthy and confortable. Of course there is a chance that I succeed and I make money from the things I love doing. You see the only reason I even care about money is because I come from a family that is not wealthy and my parents work their asses off just to provide the basics. And choosing a job with a good salary is the only way to help my parents after they retire. So it is a very big decision for me, doing something that I enjoy that might not make me wealthy and don't help my parents as much as I could, or doing something I don't enjoy so I can provide my family with money.",10Jul2018,3
26,"Sorry for the layout but I am in mobile.

As the title suggests, I'm quite the loner. And that has always been fine for me! I've always talked to myself more than anyone around me.
I grew up in different homes as a child in different towns so I was never able to be close with any friends, through the years I went through my fair share of trauma (too deep for an internet post) and learned a lot of negative ways to counsel myself through the lows in my life. I fell into a long term drug dependency on prescription downers that I now have switched for weed (very dependant on it) and have luckily managed to kick my daily drinking habit after going through rehab for it. Obviously having a strong dependency still makes me annoyed though, but I go crazy without it and have learnt to go with the lesser of the two evils.

All in all my life feels a complete mess.

I've made some pretty terrible decisions for myself that have now rendered me to the point of giving myself: one year to not feel how I do, or I'm done. 
It's just too much for me to handle alone and I've come to a point in life where I really don't want to live in my head anymore. Deep. I know. But my mind has been made up and I will stand behind that decision.

So with this one year left for me to truly try and change my headspace around- I need some advice. How the hell can I do this alone? And can I??

I haven't been able to find work for 7 months (minus a few temporary factory jobs I really did enjoy but didn't get called back in for the past 3 months) so money is an issue for me. My partner helps by paying our immediate bills and food, but obviously I feel horrible about it. He's very aware of my past, my current situation and he is happy to help. I just don't like how long it's been going on for. It's put me in a place where  I'm seriously looking at trying to get my own place, applying for a benefit and leaving him. Because I feel like it's just bringing him down with me. And I love him.

So without money I can't afford therapy. And because my partner makes more than the limit the government set for free mental healthcare with a counsellor in my country, I'm not entitled to any free sessions. But he can't afford to hand out $135p/s for an hour with his own bills and mine on top! Neither can I! I've sold everything except my car at the point to keep paying my bills.

At I just don't know what the hell to do. I've kept myself busy with deep cleaning, nursing succulents, finishing our gardens, painting the house! I go to the doctor ever three months for my medication for depression and anxiety, and always ask about anything that I can go to that can help. Last time I was there I was given a number to call for group sessions that cost $100 for two at the retirement village down my road! I feel like I'm just a joke at this point.

I feel so helpless. I feel useless. And I just need to hear someone say that they've been through similar and came out relatively okay on the other side? 

I just want to know that there's hope. Because I really feel like there isn't.",10Jul2018,1

Since then he hasn't contacted me once to see if I'm ok. In fact he hasn't sent a single message, about this or anything else, which is really unusual.

I'm a 16 y/o boy that lives in South America.

I've been playing tennis since I was born, but only because I was obliged by my dad, actually I never loved this sport.

It's been 2 years that I've been fully dedicated to tennis, training 6+ hours everyday, with one goal, get an Athletic Scholarship in the U.S. (I'm ranked 30 on the National ranking) (So I'd **Probably** go to NCAA D2 or NAIA)

But I got to a point where I don't want to play/train anymore, because I don't enjoy it, I never enjoyed it, I keep watching my clock to see that the training is over.

Now I have got the option to **QUIT** and focus on every other thing **I want**, but at the same time I'm lost, because If I dont play tennis, how I'm going to afford college at the U.S.? Are there alternatives to the Athletic Scholarships? If I study here in South America is it possible to get a job in the States?

And I'm afraid that IF I continue I would regret when I get there and if I could handle more years doing a thing that **I DON'T LIKE!**

But at the same time I don't want to give up considering all the money/time I ( and my parents) spent on Tennis, and how far I've gone until now.

Tell her I was just waiting for the bus in the air conditioned mall after doing some grocery shopping and now I’m going home.

I get on the bus first, find a seat, then the woman gets on and sits as close to me as she can. When I get off the bus, she mutters something else about stalking.

When I turned 18, we had just moved out of our house (my dad couldn't afford it being divorced) so we crashed at his girlfriends for a few months. September rolls around and we finally get an apartment with my brother. All in after rent, internet, cable and electricity he pays $1200-$1300. 

Fast forward a few months to say maybe February and he starts getting on my back about getting a job and having some responsibility, fair enough, I'll comply. I get a job in April, start paying my own phone bill and pay for a good amount of my food. 

Let's roll back to what I said earlier about how he sold the house because he couldn't afford it. He made about $60,000 or so after the mortgage and credit card debt. We didn't stay anywhere for a good 3 months and he never had to pay his girlfriend rent.

47,"Throwaway account because I don't remember what all I have posted, or what I intend to post in the future.

I am an exterminator in the Atlanta Metro Area. Today I had an experience at a customers house that has me wondering if it is something serious, or if I am overreacting (or, rudely inserting myself into someone else's business).

I had a termite bait install at the house of a customer who has been with our company for about 4 years now (other technicians- I never met her). When I first knocked on her door, she came to open it quite quickly. I became worried, because she had what looked like a possibly black eye, and large bandages around said eye. ([This](http://natmonitor.com/news/wp-content/uploads/harry-reid-bandage.jpg) is as close to an approximation as I can find, minus the one bandage going directly over the eye). She also had a somewhat timid demeanor. She was maybe late 20s, early 30s. She had two young boys with her, maybe aged 4-6. One was her son, and the other was there on a playdate, which the taller boy told me. I didn't quite think to mention the eye right away, because the two boys were right beneath her, I don't want to say anything in front of the kids (we all know how kids talk).

The type of work I do is usually entirely outdoors, and mostly alone, so I had a lot of time to think while working around her house for 40 minutes, and at one point she was out on the back covered patio trying to gather up the two boys, as they were talking to me, and I assume she thought they were bothering me. She was very submissive, and nearly let the boys walk over her.

I was finished, and went back to my truck to write up the paperwork, and I was trying to figure out how to ask her if she was alright, and how to politely ask her about her eye. I got up to the door with the paperwork, and knocked three times- waiting around 30 seconds inbetween knocks to not become an annoyance. I went around back to see if she was on the patio, with no luck. I went back to the front door and knocked again, and still no answer, but I could hear the boys playing inside. I didn't see, or hear of any man, or other woman in the house at the same time. I left the paperwork on the door, and sat in my truck to see if she would come get it.

Since then, I have been mulling over what-- if anything-- I should do in this situation. I may very well have seen a battered woman. I also may have merely seen a woman who was hit in the head by something innocuous such as a soccer ball at a kid's game; whose demeanor, and lack of answering the door were because she was a tired mom at home with two rowdy boys.

I'm leaving for deployment in x amount of months, so if I do plan on calling the police or escalating the matter, I am not worried about any kind of personal repercussions that may come from it. I just don't want to interfere in someone's life unnecessarily, or jump to wild conclusions, and possibly get her SO in unwarranted legal trouble.

50,"I’m a fairly regular guy in my 20s looking for a way to improve the world. I don’t really spend much money on myself, and I have 2 ideas on how I want to spend my extra money, both helping people a social worker might see often.

1. I want to adopt kids who are too old to typically find a good foster family. A friend I had in high school got thrown into the system at 16 and couldn’t find a home that wasn’t abusive until her social worker actually adopted her. I want to help people get out of that system and into the world.
2. I want to help young adults who are trapped by their parents. People in the 18-23 range who have been abused consistently their entire lives and are desperate to get out but don’t have the financial independence to do so. I hadn’t considered this until recently when someone on a dating app told me she’s trying to marry herself off to whoever to get away from her father. I’ll be moving out of my parents house later this year and I told her she can stay with me at LEAST until she’s financially independent. (Don’t worry, no creepy sex favors). The way I want to expand on this is to buy apartments and “rent” them out to people in similar situations for basically nothing, first month totally free probably.

TLDR: So my real question, where is the need/impact greater? A home for older kids/teens or help with financial independence for young adults? And practically speaking, how challenging would it be to “advertise” to people who want to escape abuse?

When she gets home from a hard day of work in her retail job, she comes home, fills up a glass of wine and watches Netflix/movies and then goes to bed. Two days or so a week and maybe a weekend she will help baby sit my nieces and nephews at my older brothers home. At first she was living with them for a year, but they quickly had another baby and chased her out of the house. I don't judge my mom, I just feel sad and depressed everytime I see her. She doesn't try and seems to have given up. She expects me and my sister will just carry her in life until the deathbed. 

Recently I had the conversation with my mom about my feelings on the matter, and she simply said something along the lines of ""Well friends/girls will know you are taking care of your mom cause she can't take care of herself..."" So I told her I am not signing another lease after this year is up. I'm 26 years old, in the midst of my prime years and I feel like my life is being wasted.

Just sucks he left us all to babysit my mom. Sucks even more she won't take up the reigns and take care of herself while she still can. 

I live in Oregon, with my other siblings near by. It's expensive here, but just barely doable by myself in studio (Cheapest $795/month no laundry) so I would be paycheck to paycheck for sure.

I believe it is time for me to take care of myself, after many years of real world practice with debt, bills, taxes and what gas/groceries actually cost in the long run. I'll probably have to cut my beer budget, so be it.

she hardly gives me shifts - around 3 hours a week sometimes but can give other part-timers 3 or more shifts per week. mind you, i’m having my holidays so i am able to give more availabilities than usual. also, i used to not like working closing shifts cos you have to do it alone and handle everything yourself - cashiering, cleaning up the store etc. i told her i get anxious sometimes but she has shamed me by telling me to “not give me excuses” and asks me to work closing shifts. don’t worry, i have receipts lol.
she says i’m doing sloppy work but i asked my other colleagues and they say i’m doing just fine. she gives me mixed signals too, like when i’m shift with her she talks to me normally and doesn’t really make noise at me - she usually does this in groupchats infront of everyone.

there are times when i work at other outlets and it was fine. i tried to request for a transfer to other outlets, but am always turned down because “there are no more slots available”.  i don’t want to quit because my pay is quite reasonable and there are staff discounts too. 

pls help. :(",10Jul2018,1
59,"I am 22, and have some friends, but not the type that would ever go to a club. There's a country-style club near where I live, and I've never had a club experience. Although it is sad to admit, I have never even been drunk. I feel like at 22 years of age, I need to finally integrate my shadow. I imagine there are many reasons I am so underdeveloped and anxious, most of which are mysterious to me,and always will be considering the vast complexity of the universe and of these types of things.

60,"So I’m currently in a job that I’m decently good at, it pays the bills especially in this expensive area I live in, but I don’t love it and have started looking for a better job. In the meantime though, I’m thinking of pursuing some of my passions. I just don’t know what to do or where to take them. 

I’ve always been a creative/artistic person so enjoy writing, acting, and dancing. I used to write a lot and would get complimented by my teachers and professors on my writing. Now that I’m out of college and work 9-5, and what with keeping up social obligations, I’ve stopped writing much at all. I also have always loved dancing since I was younger and still love it now and do it regularly, in my early 20’s. I was thinking of looking for a freelancing writing or a part time dance instructor job while I find a new job, for fun and to supplement my current income. 

On top of this all, have an idea for a side project to open up a unique coffee shop in my local area, but don’t know whether to pursue it or not. Especially with how much effort it would take. I don’t have any savings but do have a possible connection/investor.

I’m just at that age where I want to do a lot of things, but also have to stay stable and pay the bills/avoid getting homeless so I don’t know what to do. It’s silly because I also want time to socialize and “live my life” and go out like any young person, and travel, but I just can’t possibly do it all. 

Would anyone have any suggestions? I don’t know which path(s) to take in my life currently and I’d really appreciate any wisdom/insight. Thanks so much. ",10Jul2018,1
62,"This seemed like the best place to post it. Alright, so I (m) live with my best friend (m) and my gf in a 3 bedroom.  To start from the beginning, I came back from finishing 4 years in the USMC in May last year. Coming to home, I no longer had a room and slept in the living room. My best friend and my gf (She wasn’t my gf at the time) were also unhappy living with their family and wanted to move out to get some space. So we immediately got to searching and by July 1st we had moved in.

It wasn’t the best place, recently renovated 3 br, small bathroom, in the attic of a house. It was hot as hell, but it was our space and we were pretty content with it for 1800, (live in Yonkers, NY). So not even 2 weeks in, my best friends mother got the lights shut off at her house because it turns out she hadn’t been paying bills. So 3 of his siblings came and stayed with us, 2 girls (9 and 15) and a boy (12). They were the messiest things ever, jelly in the cabinets, food on the floor, juice spilled all in the fridge. There’s no real words to explain it to you all. So it was extremely difficult to keep the house cleaned because all of us worked at the same job with the same hours 10 am to 7 pm. 

Me and my gf tried to be understanding and didn’t complain but just tried to keep it as clean as possible, but we were no match for the 9 hours of alone time they had to make messes. We talked to them. And we ended up talking to my friend. We came to the solution of chores but that didn’t even last for the long, the problem being that my friend babies the hell out of them. If we yelled at the or enacted any kind of punishment, he would get mad at us, but he never scolded them at all cuz he didn’t want to hurt his feelings. 

At this point in time they were running up our con ed bill by leaving everything on and we were now infested with roaches. This hardly effected my friend because apparently he’s used to living in infested houses, and he mostly never paid for con ed because of poor money management, often times making us late to pay rent because he lived pay check to pay check. This continued with countless conflicts until around Feb this year before his mother finally took the 2 girls. Not long after that, the other brother(18) starts visiting often.

Again trying to be understanding we didn’t complain. Eventually we had a roomie meeting, where my friend asked us if his other brother could stay, to which we agreed under the conditions that he gets a job and helps pay bills(he doesn’t go to school) and he can’t get a job, then he cleans around the house everyday and cooks for everyone. Now by this time, my gfs brother(16) also moved in with us due to family problems. We got into arguments because I didn’t like how packed the house was getting, but ultimately he’s not really even a factor. His messes stay in his room(my old room) and he cleans whenever me or my gf tell him to and sometimes I forgot he’s here.

Back to my friends other brother, he didn’t do anything we agreed for him to do and no matter how many times I told my friend and he responded That he’ll talk to him, nothing was ever done. He was basically a bum who slept on the couch and got up to play video games all day. This continues until around May, where he was finally kicked out after my friend tried to get him a GUARANTEED job at our place ( my friend is a manager, his cousin is a manager and almost all the employees know him.)  and he didn’t show up to the interview (where the interviewer was his own cousin). With him gone we were still stuck with the 12 year old who is home all day because of summer and just makes messes and doesn’t clean despite how many times we tell him.

Also as I am writing this, the 18 year old brother is sitting in the living room for the 2nd night in a row so I already know where this is going. Me and my gf are planning to move out as our lease is up, but my friend would have nowhere to go, as his mom doesn’t want him living with here, wherever the fuck she is. Because of this he asked us to stay until October, when our other friend gets back from the military and they can get an apartment. But I just personally don’t know if I can make it that long, I literally stay at work for an extra hour because I don’t want to come home. Is t fucked up if I just leave as soon as possible and let him figure his own shit out?

TLDR: moves in with best friend and gf, best friends whole family has basically been living with us. They run up con ed bill reaching 200 at one point, and their messiness has caused us to be infested with roaches. No problem with my friend himself but with his siblings. Friend wants us to wait till October to move out, but I am extremely unhappy do not know if I can wait. Is it fucked up to leave Asap and let him deal with his own family issues?",10Jul2018,1
63,"Context; I’m a very introverted person but I have social skills and I like being around people. I just need time to recharge and I’m selective about when I hang out, I don’t do well with forced time with others. I shut down often if I don’t have an out to recharge from socializing. 

Additionally I grew up with 0 familial guidance or support and a what a lot of people would call white trash I guess. My mom was a foster kid who ran away from the system and my dad was never in the picture. I have a somewhat functioning relationship with my mom now but we’re both very socially anxious so we don’t talk all too much when we’re in the same room. 

With that being said I kinda understand how family systems work (I know the difference between niece and cousin) but like I don’t really know or understand the bond because I haven’t had that. 

Fast forward to now and my SO is a proud Latinx from a proud Mexican family. The families are huge and I don’t speak the language and the cultural significance of family is magnified and it takes a whole new set of social norms to navigate it. 

My SO is very important to me and a large part of why I fell for them is because they are so family oriented and ideally I want to start my own family to break away from generational white trash. So my intent is there. 

But I am insanely overwhelmed anytime I hang out with her parents. I think I just get in my head and give them power that they don’t have, I become so focused on being polite and agreeable that I forget to be myself. Like just being in the same room as them makes me incredibly tense and I have no idea why. Like I freeze and I don’t know what to say and it just gets more and more tense.

I’m starting to think her parents are seeing that I wasn’t just shy the first few times we hung out and think something is wrong with me. 

I guess what I’m asking is any advice for talking to parents/family members?",10Jul2018,3

66,"I thought I was over her. In fact, I thought I had been over her for 3 years now. But I’m not.

We have known each other for 6 years now, ever since the 8th grade. We had some on and off “crushes” between freshman and sophomore year, but nothing that I thought was significant; nothing that I thought was anything more than a middle school fling.

So, I moved on. I started liking other people and likewise she started dating this guy junior year. We became best friends. Me and her told each other everything and talked very often, even when her and this guy were dating. Honestly, I didn’t even think anything of it, I was glad to have her as a friend and I thought she thought the same.

Fast forward to this year, senior year. I find out that I was her first love. Ouch. That’s a big one. I had no idea, how was I supposed to know? I also find out that she never got over me. I found out that, even though she is in the middle of a two year relationship with a guy that she loves very much, she still thinks about me often and wishes that I was the one. That explains her trying to cut me off so many times. 

Now I find myself having the same feelings for her that she has for me. I do admit, we have significant chemistry, something not nobody else will ever have with her. I don’t know what it is, and I wish I could explain it but I can’t. I now find myself wishing that I was the one that was with her, wishing that I hadn’t made the mistake of letting her go so long ago. I don’t want her to break up with her boyfriend for me, especially because we’re both going to college in a month. I merely wish that things were different.

69,"sorry in advance for the self deprecating and whingy post. i literally just made this throw away because i couldn't get an appointment with a psychologist and i see some genuine humans on here giving good advice so i thought it just try it out.

long story short, i've suffered from on and off severe anxiety since i was a teenager. seems to get worse and worse as i get older and i can be really bad at taking my medication on time so inherently i throw myself out of whack every now and then and this is most likely one of those times (i suck at routines!). 

anyways i have a partner, been together almost a year and hes an MVP, i have no complaints from him. hes genuine, caring, patient ect ect all the things you want from a boyfriend. i did however have a very bad relationship from two/three years back that i cant seem to shake from my mind. (emotionally and psychically abusive, cheated, whatever ect ect). anyways i have this horrible fear of being abandoned. i will be with my partner, have a great day, go home and then ill get paranoid, start thinking he is going to leave me, that he realised that im a horrible person, start thinking he cant stand me and all this ect ect and work myself into full on breakdown and i end up losing my shit for about two hours until i calm down and my rational self is like HEY shut up nothings wrong. i constantly think he is going to leave me. we have had comversations and he says he doesnt want to. he knows that my last relationship has impacted the way i am today. he is very understanding but i can tell he is sick of me being like this because I KNOW being around someone like me when i have my bad phases is very draining. can someone please just give me some insight why i would be so paranoid? im very upset about this and i feel really alone and horrible about it all. 

i do have a selective group of friends who care about me but ive made myself believe im all alone in this and that i have no friends. i have major trust issues too (not in my relationship really but my friendships). i could give more background history on my situation that happened a few years ago but im not sure that internet people really care to hear it and it could be long uhhhhhhh i dont know can someone just show me the light at the end of the tunnel?

70,"I'm a 17 year old girl who started my first job as a service clerk at a grocery store in May. My jobs include bagging, carts, bottle rooms, trash, some stocking, etc among other things.

I've posted about this before going into details about how the person in charge on night shifts seems to really dislike me. I'm always nice and so everything I need to do but not at the speed that she prefers. She's technically not a manager but is in charge most nights aswell as when the manager isn't around. She doesn't have the power to fire employees but she can report things to one of the managers or the store director.

First I'll talk about a few things that have led to be really disliking her. She always micromanages and gives me a play by play of everything I should do and feels the need to remind me of everything I need to do all the time. Im currently the only female service clerk and she's told me multiple times that it's a man's job and once I turn 18 I need to become cashier (I was already planning on doing so because I hate carts lol) but by saying that she basically insinuates that I'm not doing my job well enough. Let me add, that no one else has showed they think this and my manager aswell as the store director like me. One time a customer was bring extremely rude to me because I told her that I couldn't do something due to it not being in my job description and I litteraly was not allowed to do what she was aiding me. The customer started to insult me so I went and grabbed the women I've been discussing  (I'll call her B) B told me shed handled it but ended up laughing it up with the customer and talking about how work isn't new to them like it is us. They're both olderwomen. Lol. B doesn't resepxt employees much and I've heard her say that everyone who works there are idiots and stupid. 

Anyways, tonight was the worst for whatever reason. B called me to the front end to help bad because large orders were being rung up so I did. Five minutes later she told me I needed to get more carts in so I told her that I knew and I'll go out once I'm done helping the cashier bag (SHE TOLD ME TO HELP??) and then she said ""I know you know. Stop making comments whenever I tell you to do something."" I brushed it off. Earlier the bottle room trash was full and the floor was getting gross. She came in saying that it's ridiculous and that I couldn't let it get that bad. The thing is that I'm 17 and cannot go to the trash compactor without a manager or person in charge..she then told me she was tired me of babysitting me and I defended myself politely. She told me to stop arguing with everything that she said and started to get bad infront of customers. I was extremely aggravated. I started crying afterwards when she wasn't around. I told what happened to a few co-workers and they told me to go to the manager or the store director which I plan to do next time I work! She's had issues with many employees not just me. I was told that a employee awhile back litteraly said ""Fuck you. I quit"" then clocked out and walked out.  A few days ago her and someone I worked with started telling at eachother because he was tired of her telling him to do things that weren't even part of his job. He's my age and she does the same to me! Ever since that happened between them she has treated me terribly.

I know that going to the manager and store director won't help her face consequences for the way she acts. She's been there longer than me and is older than I am. I just feel helpless at this point because she's making me hate my job. I'm working on getting scheduled for day shifts more because she doesn't work mornings/days. I can't quit because I need the money and my family is struggling financially I get paid 10$ a hour which isn't much but more than what most places are willing to pay someone my age. I turn 18 in August and hopefully will become a cashier soon after. I don't know what to do and I'm tired her making me hate my job and nothing I do is ever enough.  She always finds something wrong.

She has a lot of health issues and I thought I first she might’ve been in the hospital or something (I am on vacation, and she never posts much) but the reason I know she is deliberately ignoring me is that her bio changed and I can see that she was active on her meme account.

So let me start this by saying that I really love my family. I don't agree with how they act at times and it really frustrates me.  With that being said let's get into it 

I have an aunt and two cousins ( one is an 18 year old female and the other one is a 15 year old male) and their mother is 48. They are known to show up with often times a day in advance warning so we've all expected this, but they showed up in less than a days advance warning and now we are all messed with sleeping arrangements the whole world. This is also compounded with our AC on the second floor breaking. 

I am a teenager (sophomore In Highschool) and dealing with my 18 year old cousin is the worst. She acts hostile to everyone who disagrees with her and fights with her mother almost 24/7. The main problem here is that I'm not allowed to retaliate or defend myself without getting into serious trouble. For example, the first night they were here I was allowed to sleep in my own bed because no one wanted to (due to the ac) so I went to bed and my cousin left all of her unpacked items on my bed. I moved these items off of the bed and moved her blankets and charger etc just outside the door so I could sleep. 

After I did this she storms into my bedroom and starts yelling at me about ruining her belongings and ""kicking her out of her room"" now I had permission from my parents etc to sleep in my room so this was completely unwarranted. I don't agree with most of her life choices but never really vocalise that because my opinion doesn't matter. What can I do to survive this week?

My parents have been married for over 20 years - and have had a relatively good marriage. My father has always been kind, warm, and staunchly dedicated to mum and to our family. He himself came from a broken home and was determined not to repeat that life for us. My father is also a deeply religious man, and although we disagree on a lot of things I never once thought he would ever cheat.

This may not mean he is cheating, and he hasn’t been acting strange at home either. Just need advice on what to do, how to rationalise this, and how to deal with the situation.

85,"First I like to point out; yes this is a throwaway. I'm using this and a VPN on a different device and location I normally am to avoid someone trying to dox me given the nature of this, and mostly because i'm scared something serious might happened as retaliation from how I feel.  


I honestly don't know, no matter how hard I try to determine, why I have such a problem with it. Normal MtF or FtM i don't have a problem with, its just the whole new ""third gender"" thing that really keeps me rolling at night.   


Nearly every other day it will creep into my mind out of nowhere, and internally i just feel so enraged (irrationally i suppose) about this; particularly that I feel it is unnecessary and causes a lot of things i find problematic.   


I don't know what it is; at first I thought because it was the lack of basis for any biological evidence and seemingly went against science (i keep getting conflicting things of ""its science not social"" or ""its social, not science"", but then again I'm a Catholic; and religion I understand is not particularly the most scientific thing in the world. I then thought about that this completely trivializes people with actual dysphoria or other disorders who deal with this constantly, but those same people seem to support this 'third gender' movement. I then thought it might seem as though they're trying to force people to agree to this; somewhat being shoved down our throats...but then again, just about everything in school was similar to that and i never really questioned too much...maybe because I was young, I don't know...  


I just hate having to be obsessive with this; my stomach just feels like ripping apart, i start shaking a bit, my mind races in anger, I start sweating...i just feel so physically and mentally hurt...and I just don't know why. I don't want to upset the people who apparently believe in this, but at the same time I just cant let something like this go without sufficient evidence (to me its kinda like ""A Muslim wouldn't go to a Shinto temple and follow their customs whilst keeping their own religious beliefs silent"" sort of thing)...but again that problem leads directly back to what I mention earlier about science/religion. I almost feel like someone got gas-lighted on this issue...not necessarily the people who believe it, but possibly me in order to draw anger and frustration at something (maybe some government conspiracy to keep us occupied all the time over something trivial).

87,"He (31M) says we’re not ready yet and the only reason I’m having baby fever is because my friend is currently pregnant. I’ve been wanting this for years and all he can contribute it to is ”she’s having a baby and that’s the only reason you want one”. He says once we’re more stable (really soon he says) it won’t be long but I really think that’s just something he says to shut me up and avoid an argument. He’s good with kids and I know he would be a good father but it seems like we’re both in 2 different stages in our lives. 

It’s getting to a point where I feel like even if he thought we were financially stable enough that some other excuse would keep coming up to make me wait. I’m not going to wait forever and I’m sick of seeing everyone making baby announcements and all my high school friends having their second and third kid and questions of “well when are you gonna have a baby?”. Like I’m not over here desperate to be a mom. 

I love him and I’ve put my all into these 10 years but this is one thing that is a dealbreaker for me. I’ve never really seen a future where he wasn’t in it but this is making me question everything. ",10Jul2018,2
88,"I'll attempt to keep this as brief as possible, but it's gonna be difficult.

I (21M) have wanted to move out for quite some time. I live alone with my father (50 MtF). I had a great childhood, and had everything catered to me - perhaps too much, as I learned absolutely nothing. In cub scouts, we never did any of the activities to get badges - we just said we did. I never went camping. I never got to sleep over with friends, though they could come over all the time. All of this was in the interest of making sure I didn't get hurt, and to my dad's credit, I've never had a broken bone or anything of the like.

But this restrictive parenting didn't change when I turned 16, 18, or 21. My girlfriend of three years broke up with me a few months ago, and my parent was cited as one of the major reasons. I could never go out and do anything without jumping through hoops; the night she broke up with me, I had to text back and forth for five minutes with my dad to get permission just to ride in her car to a restaurant.

I know it doesn't excuse my behavior, but I cite this restrictive parenting as to why I've been sneaking to smoke weed with friends behind my dad's back. I've been caught more than once, and every time I'm caught lying about it, I get threatened with all sorts of things, though none of them come to fruition. Before my current situation, the last time I was caught in a lie, he loaded his gun in front of me and told me he was gonna leave me at the house and ""drive off somewhere"", implying suicide. He didn't, and also threatened me with things like driving me several states away and dropping me off with nothing on a highway, leaving me at a homeless shelter, etc. None of these things ever happened, luckily.

Fast forward to now: I'm on vacation visiting my Mom, Stepdad, and three siblings. My mom left my dad and I alone to pursue this new life in Florida roughly 10 years ago. I went out and purchased a small vaporizer for my own use (regular vape, not herbal), and it was confiscated by my dad who came up for his own vacation last week. Ever since, he's been extremely cold.

My Mom, Stepdad and I have all talked about this and all agree that my father is being crazy about this, and that it would be in my best interest to move out. So, we all sat down and talked with him about it - and of course, he exploded at the notion. His thinking is that the only reason I want to move out is to smoke and do other illegal things - nothing else I do is illegal, mind you - and while that is part of the reason, it's a comparatively small one. I want to move out to experience life on my own and learn to do things I'm not learning at home. At home, I'm just sitting around in my room doing jack shit and getting depressed, because I'm not allowed to go out and do anything. This is an opportunity to make the memories I've been missing, and not piss away my youth in a dark room.

But, it's his way or no way. He threatened suicide again, and I overheard him telling my mom about getting a ticket back early, so it'd be ""a few days sooner to put a bullet in my head"". He confiscated my phone, car keys, and laptop, so I'm writing this on my mom's laptop. I changed the password on my phone and refused to give it to him when he wanted to go through it and all my private conversations, and in response, he's saying that I'm ""gonna have to what happened to my dog at home when it's gone"". I've had that dog since I was 8.

ALL THIS BEING SAID, my dad really did do a fantastic job raising me and making sure I had everything I wanted. So, a large part of me feels awful for putting him through this and lying to him, but another part of me said ""fuck it"" as soon as he threatened my dog.

I've got a place to move out to with a friend all lined up already, though now my issue is getting back to my home state as my dad canceled my plane ticket back. But does anyone have any advice on how to approach my relationship with my father? He doesn't want to talk to me, has already cussed me out several times and told me I ruined the relationship and I'm tearing the family apart, etc. I'm Satan as far as he's concerned.

Thanks!",10Jul2018,8

He's been acting mostly normal, but so was my older cat before this morning.

Am I encouraging bad meowing behavior in my younger cat by 'tending' to him constantly? I want to make sure he's not in pain, but he keeps purring (quieter than normal) when I pet him, so idk if it's just a ploy for pets. If I don't tend to him, his meows get more and more 'dire'.

96,"I'll try to keep this relatively short, but I would appreciate if you would read through the whole thing and leave a thoughtful and insightful response.

I graduated in May with a Bachelor of Arts in Exercise and Sports Studies. I didn't know what I wanted to do after I graduated probably until I started my second semester of my senior year (January). I figured I would try out being a personal trainer at a gym. 

I got a job as a PT at a crappy box gym across the street from my apartment in March while I was still in school. I quickly realized I was worth much more than this place and wanted to work somewhere better. So I shot for the stars and applied for a job in the city (Chicago) at a luxury gym called Equinox. I was hired and started training at the beginning of May. Equinox is the one of the top in the fitness and personal training industry, so I got to see two different extremes within the personal training world.

Ill spare you the details, but essentially I don't want to be a personal trainer anymore. I'm not the type of person it takes to become a successful trainer. I don't want to have clients. I don't want to have inconsistent work and pay. I don't want a job where I worry about work when I'm not at work. I don't want a job that I'm at for 15 hours/day, but only getting paid for 7 of them. I'm not a good salesman. I'm not a naturally pushy person, so it's hard for me to close any sales with leads that I get. And to top it off, I was a distance runner for 8 years through high school and college. I don't know basically anything about strength training and that's pretty much all personal training is. My bosses always talk about finding and selling your value as a trainer to members, but I have little to no value as everyone is predominantly interested in weight lifting. My target population is thin and I'm a bad salesman and don't have the passion to do this anymore. I enjoy drinking beer and stuffing my face with pizza. All of coworkers are health nuts and it drives me nuts.

Growing up, I always said that my worst nightmare of a job would be sitting at a desk staring at a computer all day. I always wanted to be up and using my body as a career. that's I why I got into exercise and sports studies. I've come to realize that being passionate about exercise isn't quite enough for me anymore to want to make it into a career. I also always told myself throughout my life that I would only ever do what im passionate about and not do a job for a just a paycheck, but I've come to realize I need to be more realistic and sacrifice this dream a little bit.

I'm planning on talking to my boss in the next couple of days and confessing all of this and telling her I don't want to continue the job into August. 

The only problem is, im right back where I was before my second semester of college. I'm not exactly sure what I want to do as a career. I've been looking around at local park districts and checking out some of their recreation job openings. I have no idea what the recreation side of the industry would be like though. 

At this point, All I want is a job that pays salary and has me working 9-5 Monday through Friday. I'm willing to change/extend my hours if necessary, im not too worried about that. But I don't want to worry about work when im not at work. I need a decent paying job (personal training is definitely not) that lets me have a life outside of work.

As you can tell, I'm kind of all over the place at the moment.

My big question is: What kind of jobs/careers can I get with any bachelors degree? I'd be willing to just about anything at this point as long as I get paid somewhat well and have decent hours. I'll sit at a desk and stare at a computer if thats what it takes. Im honestly not sure what types of jobs I can do with any degree. I'd like to think that I can just start applying to desk jobs and just learn everything during training. 

I need help!

Please ask any questions and lets have a long and meaningful discussion! Any and all help is sincerely and deeply appreciated.

Best in Health,

102,"I have a friend.

If you were to meet him, the first words you would describe him as would be “socially awkward.” He has trouble connecting with people and he doesn’t quite understand social conventions. It’s evident that he also suffers from some undiagnosed mental health issues and is dealing with some problems in his life.

It’s clear that he just wants friends. This has caused him to become extremely clingy and attached. What’s more is that he really want a significant other. However, as a result of his personality and behaviour, no one really reciprocates the feelings. This has caused him to “cycle” through crushing on people, hoping for a big break. Unfortunately, now his targets are on me.

It’s important to note that he has never explicitly told me that he is interested in me. But he was never very good at hiding his previous crushes and he has told everyone else. He doesn’t know that I know.

It’s been difficult because he’s making so much effort to be my friend and it’s so suffocating. He would constantly message me and would get upset if I either didn’t respond or took a while to. When I’m walking in the halls of school, I’d hear him sprinting to catch up to me or just follow me around everywhere. He’s always asking if I find him annoying. I’ll admit I can get pretty hostile – something I’m working on – but it’s also because of his insecurities. I think it’s reasonable to say I get pretty uncomfortable. I can’t block him because I’ll be seeing him around often and he got confrontational the last time I did (before he took interest in me).

He’s always telling me to communicate my concerns so that “we become better friends” and I feel bad because I’m not putting in the same effort in this “friendship” as he is, nor do I want to. I’m trying to be a little friendlier but it’s only to stop him from being upset. I know this is completely unfair to him and it all stems from the fact that he likes me.

I’ve seriously considered just telling him that I know he likes me and that I don’t, but:

1.	I’m not supposed to know he likes me (no one was supposed to tell me)
2.	It’s extremely tactless and seems really narcissistic to reject him without him even doing anything.
3.	He’s dealing with a lot of issues and I don’t think him being rejected for the nth time right now would be best for his emotional and mental stability.

I feel like crap because it’s as if I’m “leading him on” or giving him hope simply by helping him through his issues and being a lot more talkative to him now. I will be seeing him a lot in the future (we're in the same uni program) so I thought it would be best to learn how to tolerate him and maybe become just friends. The only problem is that because he has trouble making friends, he plans on just sticking around me at school all the time, which is NOT ideal.

At this point, I’m just waiting for him to meet another person to like, but this has seriously been weighing me down.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks. Apologies for the novel I’ve written.

105,"I dunno where to begin. We have been together for a bit longer than 2 years, I love him but he  can be so difficult to be with
Lately whenever we spend time together it's just for things we don't really talk, usually watching TV at his place. Anything other than that he's too tired to even have a simple conversation with
That is until he needs something from me , like if he needs me to drive him somewhere
Or the days we don't hang out, he spends it out with other people... But hasn't had a coffee date with me in ages when he looks bored or like he'd rather be somewhere else
I get so anxious now thinking I must bore him to death, but then I remember other people adore being around me and have fun with me

On top of all that he never does anything for me anymore, even simple things that I've asked him openly to do like compliment me a bit more often or take pictures with me, things that cost 0 money but he has some dumb excuse for everything 
I wish he'd put more effort into making me happy as I put into making his life easier, giving him presents and cooking for him but I'm realizing he's too selfish to do anything that requires effort and isn't for himself

I know I know I should break up. I've been thinking for a while about it. He's holding me back, my happiness, my future, I am fully aware. But I wanted to give it a shot. He's also 26 years old but has had way too many money problems and so hasn't studied a career, that I know he wants to. I want to be there for him and since I'm earning enough, I wanted to help him with that and pay for it all
But I just can't when he can't bother to make me feel special

I know it's over, it just fucking hurts because it used to be so amazing and there are many things I love about him and about us, like how we can literally cuddle together all night and our bodies fit perfectly into each other
But love without effort is nothing

106,"This is a really long story that I will try to shorten as best as I can.  “A” and I have been best friends for 15 years. Our daughters are the same age and we live in the same town. As our daughters got older, and went through all the stuff teenage girls go through, we noticed that when they fought, we fought too. We made an agreement that we wouldn’t let their issues or not issues with each other affect our friendship anymore. 
About a year ago, “A” started to go through some personal stuff that I didn’t agree with on a moral level, but that I did my absolute best to help her through. Was I objective? No. But I was never cruel, just honest and only when she asked my opinion. I believe that she didn’t like the advice I offered and turned to a new friend she made at work, one who encouraged her new behaviors, which was something I was unable to do. I found our friendship to be very one sided from that point on. She would call me and spend two hours discussing her problems, ask for advice, ignore the advice and then do something fun with her new friend on the weekends. It got to the point where I dreaded her calls, because we never discussed anything about my life, I was only a sounding board. Admittedly, it was at this point when I stopped putting tons of effort into the friendship. I was hurt by her finding a new friend that approved of “A”’s behavior. I was hurt that after 15 years it seemed I was easily replaceable.  
All of that I could have and would have gotten over and we would have moved past it. As an adult, I understand that friendship is fluid and can go through bad patches just like a marriage, and can possibly take just as much work. 
Fast forward a few months to something completely unrelated happening to my 14 year old daughter at school. She started being bullied. It started small, with a parent in our town spreading a rumor about her and encouraging other children not to associate with her. A few girls in her class of 25 kids stopped talking to her. Okay. We can handle that. But then it got worse. One particular girl that my daughter has always had an on and off friendship with decided to become cruel. Spitting on her, putting trash in her locker, calling her names, spreading damaging lies and rumors, throwing things at her, having other kids text her and threaten her. Then another girl joined her, and another. At this point, my daughter had exactly one friend left at school, and she happened to be her best friend, “A”’s daughter (we will call her “R”).  One weekend, “R” suddenly sent my daughter a picture on social media of her with 3 of the girls that had been giving my daughter a hard time. Then we found out that “R” had told a few of my daughters secrets to these girls. 
Trying to honor “A”’s and my rules about the kids not affecting our friendship, my husband texted “A” and asked her to discuss with “R” about not sharing our daughters personal secrets with others, regardless of what is going on with them. “A” was happy to comply. All while this was going on, “A” and I were still communicating, texting, calling, etc. We were still friends. 
Then it got worse. ALL but 4 kids in my daughters entire grade stopped talking to her. “R” was one of them. My daughter would come home and cry and cry and cry. There were days she wouldn’t say one word at school, there were days she would call me hysterical from the bathroom and I would have to go pick her up. There were days when I couldn’t get her out of bed. There were many dark days when she was suicidal. Her mental well being became all consuming. We contacted the school and pulled her out. My sunny happy straight A student, star athlete had disappeared into an abyss of sadness. It was all my husband and I could do to keep it together. During this dark time I didn’t hear from “A” once, but I honestly didn’t notice. I was too involved with getting my child well. I wasn’t talking to anyone. We put her into s new school in a neighboring town for the last seven weeks of her 8th grade year and things slowly started to get better. Then one day I noticed “A” had blocked me on Facebook, and all other social media. She blocked my husband too. A few months had gone by at this point since we talked and I was flabbergasted. I never once went to her and confronted her about our daughters not getting along, I never once blamed her or even insinuated blame. I was too caught in the cloud of my daughters despair to do ANYTHING other than help my family survive. (Yes it was that bad, but it would take me hours to put down everything that had happened and reliving it is not in my best interest). 
Here’s the thing.  “A” knew what my daughter had been going through, she had to switch schools for the love of god, the whole town knew. But, not once did she contact me. Not once did she see if I was ok, if my daughter was ok, if we needed help. Not once. I don’t care about her daughters involvement in what happened to mine. What I care about is that my best friend wasn’t there for us in our darkest hours, when I literally needed her the most. In fact, not only was she not there for us, she blocked me from her life. We changed each other’s kids diapers, we treated our kids like they all belonged to us. My daughter almost died this winter and not once did she check in. My heart is broken. 
Yes, I know, I could have texted or called her. But my pride got in the way. I’ve always been there for her, always. I can’t count how many times I have gone to her at 3am when she needed me. The ONE time I needed her, she disappeared. I’m trying to move on. It’s been almost 6 months since we have spoken. I’m trying to forgive her so that I stop feeling angry and broken. I’m trying. 
My daughter is doing much better now. But, she is definitely scarred from what happened. She’s anxious and closed off. She’s young, so I hope time will heal. I, on the other hand, miss my best friend so much I can’t breathe at times. I miss my old best friend. So much. I’ve thought about handwriting her a long letter, similar to this explaining my side and asking her what happened, I’ve thought about making a batch of bloody Mary’s and knocking on her door. I’ve thought about just letting it all go. Why should I be the one to contact her? Why do I have to be the bigger person? 
So, I appeal to you. Help me please. What have I done wrong? Should I contact her? Should I just move on?  I rarely ask for help, but I’m out of options and so damn sad. ",10Jul2018,2
107,"So, I am a 26m and my brother a 27m. About two years ago my brother got into a relationship with his best friends wife. My brother and his best friend have been friends since they were kids, and I too have been friends with the guy (let's call him Joe) since we were kids. My brother was even the best man in their wedding. Well, my brother got tied up with his wife who is a drug addict and doesn't work. She lives off of some lawsuit she won years ago and just sits around at home doing nothing. Joe knows my brother was messing with his wife and encouraged it. Soon enough, my brother ended up moving in with Joe &amp; his wife and have entered into a Poly relationship.

The thing is, my brother is a recovering alcoholic and also recovering from drug use. As you can imagine, this situation is less than ideal. I have been EXTREMELY hard on my brother about this, to the point where I stopped speaking to him months at a time. I have tried to be understanding and even offered to pay for a uhaul and help him find a new place to live. But, I am in Chicago while my brother is 300 miles away, so it's not easy to know exactly what's going on.

My brother and I used to be very close, but this woman is destroying his life, and the husband is encouraging it. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, and in a sense have given up completely.

However, tonight I got bored and googled my brothers SM handle and found his reddit. After looking at his account, I've come across multiple posts of him asking for advice about the situation and also him talking about how horrible he feels about it. This... completely broke my heart.

I need advice, what do I do? I hate having to be empathetic and understanding over such a screwed up situation, but I also want to be a good brother and be there for him. This woman is keeping my brother wrapped up in drugs and alcohol and is stopping him from living his life. She's stopping him from getting out and meeting someone he can actually spend his life with. The times he has tried to dump her, she threatens to overdose and kill herself.

I want to be hard on my brother, because we all want this to stop. But, I also want to be a GOOD brother and be supportive of him. I don't know what to do from this point on, seeing his reddit posts has completely destroyed me.

What would you do? What's your advice? ",10Jul2018,2

111,"Alright I apologize ahead of time for the novel here but I'm desperate as hell. 

So I've known this girl for 4 years now, we met in 2014. We started dating but eventually broke up, then got back together and have been together for a year and a half. Recently I've noticed I'm not happy in the relationship. I just want different things and I feel trapped. We get along rather well but we fight more often than not. I just feel so restricted with her. I feel like I'm not able to make any decisions without her getting mad at me for not telling her, no matter how little the decision is. (Taking an extra shift at work, hanging out with my family, etc.)

3 days ago I brought all of this up with her and I told her I couldn't do it anymore. We argued for hours and hours on end but now I'm here, wanting to end things but at the same time not wanting to end things. The only reasons I don't want to end things are because I do love her and I hate hurting her. So naturally I gravitate towards doing anything not to hurt her. But do I prioritize that over my own happiness? Should I stay and try to work things out just hoping that maybe this relationship can turn around? (We've tried that before and we end up at the same place but maybe this time will be different.) 

I'm going insane with this internal fight of mine. I just need some outside genuine advice. I feel like I'm drowning trying to figure all of this  out. 

Thank you in advance to all who respond. I apologize again for the novel. ",10Jul2018,2
112,"I know it’s probably dumb to worry about this. I’m young (19) and I’m pretty so basically the odds are in my favor. But I’ve never been kissed or anything because guys who are interested me normally are looking for sex only or sex first then relationship. 

Idk I guess I want to be the person who makes someone’s heart beat fast or be the one someone wants to hold hands with. I want to make someone happy and I want them to smile when they kiss me. But it just feels like it will never happen for me.

115,"He just told me he won’t pay for a programe in my university because he loves his luxuries more than me, verbatim.

I was trying to convince him that it was worth the investment, but he insisted that he doesn’t have the money. However he often buys very expensive stuff, like he just bought a $200 wine cooler today, for his $20-$50 wine bottles he buys every week.

He’s entitled to spend whatever he makes on whatever he wants of course, but four years ago I managed to get a 90% full scholarship (no loans) for this uni. He could afford me not having it (he’s told me so before) but we wouldn’t have a lot of luxuries. I’m breaking my back to not loose it, so I told him that I felt like he was just spending the money I save him on luxuries, to which he said “you’re damn right I am and it’s my right to do so”.

The discussion had been going on for about an hour and he kept trying to make it end, he kept telling me that I wouldn’t convince him ever. I actually only managed to get to talk with him about this by telling him that if he didn’t want to pay for the program then I wanted to understand why.

I believe that maybe he just said this to hurt me and make the discussion stop,

Whatever the case is, the discussion did end, I left enraged and with the urge to hurt him back with this message:

You know I depend on you now, but if you love your luxuries more than me what do you think will happens when I don’t?

Typing this I realize that perhaps it’s not the best thing to do, but I can’t help the urge to do it, or to hurt him in some way that shows him how much he hurt me.

But in the end I just what him to know that he did in fact hurt me, and that he’s only causing me to grow distant from him.

What can I do? I feel that if I don’t fix this I will step out of his life as soon as I have the chance, but I still love him deeply and I want him in my life, but it’s hard to if he’s this toxic.",10Jul2018,0

119,"Using my throwaway because said friend/roommate knows my main one.

For quick background, I live in an apartment with me, my best friend (said friend that needs help), my boyfriend, and our other childhood friend. Me, boyfriend, and other friend have lived together for about a year before our year younger friend graduated and joined us. My friend had her ups and downs after moving here, she had left a emotional abusive household to support herself and had a hard time finding a job, which hit her hard. She did meet a nice guy and they've been dating since. At the end of the school year she finally got a job and a daycare, which she loves. However, her boyfriend also left for the entire summer to visit family. 

I'd like to note here that me, boyfriend, and friend all smoke weed on the regular. At the end of the school year my friend said she was quitting because she felt like it made her lazier and moodier, so we supported her completely. In fact, she tried to convince me to quit too, but I declined (I have a illness that causes intense nausea, weed helps a lot with that.) When she wasn't smoking she talked about how great she felt now that she had stopped and I was glad she felt better. 

Then the summer came around and her work changed to only working early in the morning and she began smoking again. And not only started again, but started hitting it hard. She would hit it hard after work (me and my boyfriend usually work into the afternoon and she gets off at noon everyday) then go to bed before we get home, sometimes as early as 4. In addition, her mood has been erratic. On days when I go into work earlier and see her when she gets home, we will go out and do things like eat or get groceries. I've noticed little things make her so enraged that I'm concerned. For instance the other day she dropped a carton of eggs while bring in groceries and then proceeded to scream, throw the eggs out the door of our apartment, say she was going to kill herself, then go to her room and slam the door behind her. She came out quickly, but as someone with depression and who has been suicide hospitals I was extremely concerned, even if she was just joking. It seems like any inconvenience (bad driving, an inanimate object not working right, ect) causes her to start angrily cursing and slamming things around. 

Things kind of reached a point for me tonight when she lied to me. See, I had come home from work and put my charger on the bookshelf in the hallway of our apartment. My friend had been up but after about an hour or two she went off to bed. I hung out in the living room for a bit longer before I saw my phone was dying and decided to head to my room and grab my charger on the way there. My charger wasn't there however and I promptly tore up the hallway, living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and texted both my roommates and asked if they had accidentally grabbed it (Boyfriend is out of country visiting family, so it wasn't him). Other roommate confirmed he didn't take it and friend never replied as she was asleep. After a bit of waiting and my phone percentage creeping down, I knocked on her door, waited, then went in. Her phone was on and she was asleep, but what appeared to by my charger was plugged in to her phone. I woke her up and asked if maybe she has accidentally taken if, but she said she hadn't seen it at all. I went back and continued looking, but was unsure. See, I have a very specific wall charger and I knew my friend had a different kind. I texted my boyfriend, who works at a phone store so had bought all our chargers, if he had gotten her one, but he confirmed he had gotten her a completely different one. I went back in and this time stated she had taken mine, and she paused before saying she had taken it because her cat chewed through hers and her backup was in her car. I said I was sorry that happened but that was my only charger and my phone was almost dead. She paused again, huffed, then said ""I guess you can take it."" I said I was sorry again for bothering her and took my charger back to my room. Then, she had the gall to call me and ask for me to go get her charger from her car. I have a bad time at saying no so I got it, but I'm honestly just hurt she would do that. 
 
I am definitely not a doctor, but I think she may be suffering from depression. I can barely handle my own emotions and I want to sit her down and tell her she needs to seek help. I've attempted to drop hints that she could start returning to our mental health place at our school, but she doesn't seem to get the hint and I am a bad communicator. How can I sit her down and let her know her friends are worried about her without making her feel attacked? ",10Jul2018,9

I'm not in terrible shape or anything, but I'm pretty slight and don't expect I could really hold my own, physically, against most of the people who I'm dealing with.

129,"Here's the link to the photos of the chair now: [http://imgur.com/gallery/cT9uypL](http://imgur.com/gallery/cT9uypL)

**TL;DR --** Girlfriend has owned an antique chair *(pictured in link at top)* worth a lot of money for years. The chair's front legs were snapped by (apparently the third) moving company. Only recovered one of the two front legs. Trying to figure out if it's worth repairing, if we should replace it, or if it even *can* be repaired.  We don't want to replace it because of its sentimental value. Help.

(Originally posted in r/fixit, but may not exactly be welcome there)

**If you happen to be interested at all:** \*\*This is the story all about how--\*\*never mind the Fresh Prince for now. Here's the backstory.

**How the Chair Came to Be:**

My \[M23\] girlfriend \[F24\] (let's call her May) was gifted this chair from a close friend (we'll call her Anne) who decided she would be better-off leaving the chair in Pennsylvania instead of taking it with her to a small, cramped apartment in Oregon following her big move across the country, since she likely wouldn't have the space and probably didn't want to have to pay thousands of dollars just to move a few things so far away. Anne and May hung out together fairly often and Anne knew how much May really loved this chair. As a matter of fact, May had been in love with it since before it was restored, *so*, Anne and May both put some money into having the chair restored. Apparently, the chair is worth well over $2000. I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure myself, but I won't question it, because it's practically priceless to Anne, May, and myself.

May has had this chair since a few years before we had met. She has managed to care for it more than any piece of furniture she's ever owned. When we met, and I first saw the chair in her living room next to this beautiful reading table and globe setup, I fell in love with it immediately. I fell in love with this chair before I fell for May! All humor aside, over the years, this chair has risen in value, both monetary *and* sentimental. In the past few years: May moved out of her apartment and into another one; May moved in with me a few months later in order consolidate living costs; May and I moved out of my small apartment three months after that. Each move, the chair went into her storage unit for a short time, but we handled it very carefully. We even had an accident once, dropping the chair (wrapped in a moving blanket, we're not fools!), but that didn't result in any damage whatsoever, luckily. Since we moved in together, we have accumulated two cats and a small puppy. None of the animals have caused any damage to the chair.

**The Big Move Bullshit:**

Fast-forward to this past March (2018). I landed my first ""professional"" job (previously, I had worked mostly in restaurants) as a Copywriter for a top digital marketing firm in Florida. We agreed to move from Pennsylvania to Florida, but May would stay behind for two months to tie up the loose ends: put in her notice at her restaurant, finish the spring semester at college, do all the packing we couldn't complete in the last two weeks I had there, and sell-off the things we didn't need or want to move down. Meanwhile, we'd work on hiring movers and paying the bills together.

We initially wanted to get a U-Haul, but there was no way we could save up $1800 for the U-Haul $300 for the U-Haul's gas, and $180 for gas in my car, plus the plane tickets down to Florida and back to PA along with all the normal bills and other costs. It wasn't going to happen. Not that quickly. Sure, maybe we jumped a little too quickly, but this job was the best opportunity I'd ever get, and I would have been stupid to decline it.

So, we contacted multiple moving companies. The cheapest offers we were given were quotes of $850, $950, and $1000. Other companies quoted us at $2200+. Then we found a company who quoted our move at $1300 total. We spoke with them a few times and signed a binding contract. They were supposed to arrive the day after I'd flown up, two months after I had started this new job. I was granted three workdays off for the move, luckily it was Memorial Day weekend following those days. They no-call-no-show'd us that day. The next day, they offered a lame apology and kept giving us the runaround: ""we'll be there tonight,"" which turned into another no-show because of a ""flat tire"" on the truck, which was a blatant lie. Turned into the next night, which was beyond our deadline to leave so we could make it back to Florida in time for me to not get fired.

Movers arrived another week later after plenty of BS'ing around and promising to lower our costs. We had friends moving into the apartment who said they'd be cool with directing the movers and helping us complete the job. So, the movers arrive well over a week late, tell our friends that the move is bigger than they had quoted for. They called May, who is not always the cheeriest person, definitely not the person you want to deal with when either party is angry. May didn't make things much better. I took the next call. Movers tell me that there is ""no way \[they\] can do the move for less than $2900."" He'd promised us a big discount. That wasn't happening. We'd already given them a $250 deposit with the guarantee of a $1300 move total. Eventually, he dropped the price to $2700, I told him I felt greatly insulted, especially after I had been cool and very level-headed with him. I am a very reasonable and forgiving person, but this was far beyond forgivable at this point. Then he dropped the price to $2500. I told him there's no way we would afford that at all. I asked him kindly to refund our money since he had gotten so frustrated to the point that **he** even said he wanted to just give us our money back and le*ave mult*iple times to everyone else. I told him to just refund the money and move on to their next job. He said he would do just that. We had to go through our bank three weeks later to get that money back.

We hired a new moving company the next day, after looking into more options. This company quoted us $1800, though they would normally have this move for about $3000 (without haggling), as this was essentially enough to fill up a truck they had close to that house and heading to Miami. We accepted, they had decent reviews, and everything seemed good. We put $800 down. They picked up two days late and at 11p.m. (inconveniencing my closest friend and her boyfriend who had *fully* moved in to the house at that point). They were paid $500 cash then too. A few days later, *another* moving company called May to inform us that they were sold the contract from that other company with whom we'd dealt. But the contract was still the same. Cool.....or....not?

This final moving company said we would be getting our stuff in 2 or 3 weeks. Fair enough, no big deal. They also said that we *may* owe another $100 or so, we initially argued, but they had to package a few things themselves (the TV, May's desk, and the chair). Okay, no big deal there, whatever. In the meantime, we figured that three weeks would be fine, because then we wouldn't have to borrow money from anyone at that point. I would have had it all and maybe $45 to spare.

**HERE IS MORE BULLLLLSHIT:**

This current moving company had not called us in two weeks, so we gave them a call. No answer for maybe six calls over three days, all at normal hours. We let *three more* days go by. One more call. No answer. We're panicking at this point. May already deals with enough of an anxiety issue--this did nothing but exacerbate it, so our life was not exactly pleasant for quite some time. I had gotten let-go from the new job that week because the person who was supposed to be training me had left and that left me far behind, so they couldn't afford to keep me--that's its own issue. Because of this, everything was exponentially more stressful.

The movers call us back one week *after* their three-week promise. ""We'll have it there by next weekend."" By this point, we just want our shit. We nervously wait out another week. Then they call us and say, ""we'll have a guy out for delivery tomorrow if you'd like."" **YES. FINALLY.**

Movers show up. Turns out, *THEY* were contracted by this last company with whom we were dealing, so they were a third-party of the third-party (sixth party? ninth party? I don't know if it's exponential or additional or even mathematical at this point).

Of course, these guys had no right to negotiate the moving contract. They gave us our bill and it said we owed them $1750. May damn near had a stroke. She had the driver call the moving company, and she told the gentleman (I use this term very loosely, he was a terrible pain in the neck to deal with--very unkind). She was actually being peaceful and reasonable this time. Though we had already paid $1300 toward our contracted $1800, we still owed *another $1750.* This made no sense, apparently, they miscalculated. I took the phone and told the guy that it was *their* problem they miscalculated. We had agreed to pay extra packaging fees, for which we never even signed-off, bringing our final payment to a little over $700.

With the help of my stepdad, we talked the unruly bastard down to $950, which was still a crock because we owed them between $250 and $450 less. May and I only had $700 to our names and over $300 in bills to pay. My stepdad and my mom had to take out the extra $250 and loan it to us, even though we had already borrowed some money from him and my mother. The movers unloaded the truck, and for whatever reason, on this 95-degree, hot and humid Florida day, we were carrying our stuff into the house, even though this was supposed to be full-service moving. Whatever.

We came to find that my TV screen was smashed, a few small items were broken, and, the **worst** **of all,** May's highly prized antique chair. The front legs seem like they were snapped-off intently and purposefully. Maybe we're saying that because we're deeply emotionally invested in this whole thing, but in all my studies in criminal justice and investigations (which is what I studied in college, along with English), I figured I had a fairly decent sense for determining accidents and on-purposes *(humor me, I'm a sad man right now).* We only recovered one of the two snapped legs, which was still wrapped in the blanket. The other one only could have fallen out if the chair was unwrapped, ***so the movers know*** that the legs broke off.

**Now What?**

Either way, broken antique. No idea what to do or how much having this repaired will cost. It's been about two weeks since this all happened, and we've finally hit the point where it's not all getting worse--we've stagnated at the bottom of the trough and the only way from here is up, and, coincidentally, just in time for my birthday!

I'd like to be able to save up some money to have this chair fixed for May's birthday/college graduation next spring. I should have a new job similar to the one I just had soon, so I should be able to save the money up by the end of January, if it's not too much.

Sorry for the long rant, everyone, this has just been one of the worst and most stressful points in my life, even though it was looking like a no-doubter homerun. But that's the story. So, do I just save the money, and have it fixed? Do I hire a lawyer and attempt to sue the mover (which can be fruitless, from what I know about protective legislation for companies like these movers)? Do we just sell the chair and let it be someone else's problem and maybe replace it in the future?

I had a bad middle school experience that has given me a ""fuck you"" view on my town and my life. I don't care how my actions affect most people and I'm constantly afraid of losing the two people that aren't family. Basically, I will tell someone if I don't like them to their face. I don't feel regret about it either. And I have tried being my actual self during middle school and it didn't work out. I haven't really shown it since. I know that if I keep up this pattern, it will put me in a hole. In the past year there has been times where I have thought of ways to end it, or even tried. I never told anyone that. There is so much that I want to say or do, that I just haven't been able to. I've been told that I interact with adults very well, but I can't necessarily build a normal friendship with an adult. I know that one day I will probably lose touch with those two people, and I don't want that to happen. How can I be myself and make genuine friends and keep my two friends? I know that I can see them as lifelong friends but I'm afraid I will screw it up.",10Jul2018,1
131,"Sort of long, tldr at the bottom.

I am friends with this girl, I'd say she's one of my best friends at the moment, maybe the second best. I've known her for about two years and we've been close for one and a few months. About eight months or so, I started to notice that she was pretty good looking but nothing really past that. 

Time passed and we became more intimate, up to the status she holds in my life now, and my feelings for her have grown consequently, although I wouldn't really say that I'm head over heels for her or anything, there has been other people in both of our lives during the two years we've known each other. She ended her relationship with her boyfriend (with whom I didn't get along at all) something like 2 months ago.

Two days ago, we were together at a party and her ex was there. We both had a few drinks, I wasn't really drunk, just sort of light-headed, but my judgement was kind of cloudy. I went somewhere and then she was kissing him, so I sort of backed out, disappointed.

Later that night, I was talking with her and trying to get her to leave that dude for good because he really wasn't any good for her (that is true, but I was influenced a bit by my feelings for her and my general despising of him). She said that she missed him and that she had forgiven him for what they broke up about and that she wanted to cry, so I jokingly told her that I would kiss her if she started to. Now, I say jokingly, but at the same time I also kind of wanted to, and had wanted to for a long time.

He came to where we were and said he was leaving, then kissed her and made sure to do it long enough for it to be awkward for me. We kept talking and she started to tear up, so I said it again, she laughed and a tear rolled down her cheek, so I looked at her in the eyes, and went for it, maybe two seconds long. I backed out, she looked at me and then she kissed me back, then we made out for a bit, but I had to go, so we were really confused about what happened. I said goodbye and went home. 

We have started to talk again, and everything seems to be okay, but it doesn't feel as fluid as always. We've both mentioned it and laughed about it but haven't had a real conversation about it. I don't know what to do, because I don't even know where I want our relationship to go, but I think we could be good together. Should I talk to her about it and risk making it weirder, try to play it cool and see if she does anything (unlikely), or just brush it off and keep on going hoping it's just a temporary thing?

Tl;dr: I think I have a crush on my friend, her exbf kissed her in front of me at a party, I tried to convince her to stay away because he's a douche bag, ended up making out and neither of us wants to discuss it.",10Jul2018,1
132,"So I met this guy at a mutual friend's party. We drank abit but weren't tipsy or anything. I don't know much about him but he added me on social media and we texted a bit for three days in a row after the party. I'm not looking for a relationship right now so I didn't initiate the conversation, but I participated and replied the same way I would with my other guy friends. He stopped messaging me on the fourth day (today is the fifth day) and it got me curious as to what just happened? ",10Jul2018,1
133,"As the title suggests I think I may not be all together upstairs. I have an incredibly difficult time of letting things go. So for example the other day I unprofessionally expressed opinion, about a bad experience I had with a service I received from a coworker, at the restaurant I work at.  My boss found out and sent me a lengthy text chewing me out for talking about it with my coworkers for fear that it might get back to that person or that patrons might hear. She told me that I needed to not express my feelings or opinions at work and leave those things outside of the work environment.  I feel upset like there is a knot in my stomach and this sinking feeling. And then I realized it ruined my week. Like I have the next few days off from work and all I can think about is that text she sent me. It’s hard to explain like all I can do is think about it and keep turning it over in my mind. Another example is when I was a kid I baked some cookies with my aunt for the construction workers who were fixing up our house. When they were done I went out and offered them some cookies and they just gave me this weird look and said no thank you. I went back inside and told my aunt and she went out and gave them the cookies. She explained to me that they were just confused about why we were baking cookies for them. But for the next few days after it happened I felt weird and all I could do was think about it. And wonder what I had done wrong. For some reason I stew over things and can’t let them go and I’m worried it might be some kind of mental illness.  Like it happens when people get mad at me or there is some kind of issue. Even after it’s been resolved I just can’t stop thinking about it. While the entire time I just have a sinking feeling in my stomach. I need advice on how to let go.",10Jul2018,1

135,"I broke up with my ex last weekend over some bull shit she pulled. Short story she cheated on me, atmosphere became toxic, better to leave than stay. 

We had been together about a year, mostly living off of my work as the area I lived was tricky to find stable safe work. We moved areas a few months ago as we both wanted to travel. Landed in southern Oregon so I could clear some legal bs I have on my record. They have my license hostage. 

1 month into this program is when shit hit the fan. I got ultimatum about staying and chose to leave rather than deal with that toxicity. 

I do software engineering contracts for a living, so I have a stupid heavy laptop I have to backpack around now. I can do a few nights at different friends places at a time, but I don't want to over stay my welcome. 1 to 2 nights every other week at one friend, and as needed with another but they are 80 miles away. No bus. 

I am in southern Oregon, so it's not the worst place to end up in the streets, but I'm really unsure how to proceed. I need to raise 2 grand to get my license back before I can car. I need internet and power to do work to get said licence back. I am physically restricted to only so many miles walking per day due to previous injuries. I broke my neck and back in multiple places, so say, 3 miles tops per day with pack.

143,"Just a prerequisite:  I know this is high school bullshit. 

I’m 14 and I’m in not-so-popular group. A table where me and my 3 friends sit, with a bunch of people we don’t particularly like. Everyone acts like we’re friends but we only all sit together to not look weird. We talk, but we just aren’t close. My best friend only comes to school ( on average) about 1-2 days a week. My other best friends are chill and are easily manipulated and always try to make everyone happy, even the girls who are practically walking periods and think the sun rises and sets in their ass. So when my best friend isn’t at school and my other friends are being taken away by the “ I can’t walk to the bathroom alone!! You know I have low self-esteem and I’ll kill myself if you don’t come with me!!!” Girls I find myself alone. I don’t mind though because I have another group of friends, the “ weird” guys. I don’t think their weird, and I’m really good friends with a couple of them but that’s just what they are, the same way my small group of friends is the weird girls. So I hangout with the guys at lunch when my friends arnt around and we have a honestly great time talking about school shootings and looking at weird videos online but every time I hangout with them, the girls who think we’re bffs when I’m around a guy come and ruin it. Not only do they act as if we’re best friends and as if they didn’t leave me, but when I’m going off on a tangent on whatever the fuck it’s always “ omg Charlotte!!  Shut up your soooo weird !! Teeheehee!!!” I want to fucking hurt them. I promise you this happens every. Time. So, how do I ( without violence) deal with this?

144,"I want to start off by saying I've never been good with dealing with my feelings.

There's this girl I know from school. I never really talked to her that much until recently. couple weeks back, a bunch of us went on a school trip for a few days. When I was there, i started talking to her a lot more because a few of us stayed in a group for most of the time. I realized that her and I seem to be pretty compatible. Plus, she laughed at all my terrible jokes.

Well that trip has been over for a while and I've felt like shit ever since. I've been hanging out with friends a lot but I can't stop thinking about her. I haven't felt like this in forever. It's fair to say that when it comes to dating, I've always been the 3rd(even 5th!)wheel. I haven't seen her since the trip.

So far, I only see three options for what I can do:

1. I ask her out now.

2. I ask her out when school starts.

3. I don't ask her out in order to avoid any possible embarrassment/awkwardness that could come from this.

I forgot to mention that I have very low self esteem and I'm not very good at being social most of the time.

I don't know what to do. I'm just a dumb teenager who never really feels like this very often. What should I do? Any advice is welcome.

147,"I'm a 17 year old girl who started my first job as a service clerk at a grocery store in May. My jobs include bagging, carts, bottle rooms, trash, some stocking, etc among other things.

I've posted about this before going into details about how the person in charge on night shifts seems to really dislike me. I'm always nice and do everything I need to do but not at the speed that she prefers. She's technically not a manager but is in charge most nights aswell as when the manager isn't around. She doesn't have the power to fire employees but she can report things to one of the managers or the store director.

First I'll talk about a few things that have led to be really disliking her. She always micromanages and gives me a play by play of everything I should do and feels the need to remind me of everything I need to do all the time. Im currently the only female service clerk and she's told me multiple times that it's a man's job and once I turn 18 I need to become cashier (I was already planning on doing so because I hate carts lol) but by saying that she basically insinuates that I'm not doing my job well enough. Let me add, that no one else has showed they think this and my manager aswell as the store director like me. One time a customer was bring extremely rude to me because I told her that I couldn't do something due to it not being in my job description and I litteraly was not allowed to do what she was aiding me. The customer started to insult me so I went and grabbed the women I've been discussing  (I'll call her B) B told me shed handled it but ended up laughing it up with the customer and talking about how work isn't new to them like it is us. They're both olderwomen. Lol. B doesn't respect employees much and I've heard her say that everyone who works there are idiots and stupid. 

Anyways, tonight was the worst for whatever reason. B called me to the front end to help bag because large orders were being rung up so I did. Five minutes later she told me I needed to get more carts in so I told her that I knew and I'll go out once I'm done helping the cashier bag (SHE TOLD ME TO HELP??) and then she said ""I know you know. Stop making comments whenever I tell you to do something."" I brushed it off. Earlier the bottle room trash was full and the floor was getting gross. She came in saying that it's ridiculous and that I couldn't let it get that bad. The thing is that I'm 17 and cannot go to the trash compactor without a manager or person in charge &amp; tells me shes too busy. Then She  told me she was tired me of babysitting me and I defended myself politely. She told me to stop arguing with everything that she said and started to get bad infront of customers. She was also being impatient and had a ugly facial expression the entire time. I was extremely aggravated. I started crying afterwards when she wasn't around. I told what happened to a few co-workers and they told me to go to the manager or the store director which I plan to do next time I work! She's had issues with many employees not just me. I was told that a employee awhile back litteraly said ""Fuck you. I quit"" then clocked out and walked out.  A few days ago her and someone I worked with started yelling at eachother because he was tired of her telling him to do things that weren't even part of his job. He's my age and she does the same to me! Ever since that happened between them she has treated me terribly.

I know that going to the manager and store director won't help her face consequences for the way she acts. I don't expect her to lose her job and I don't even think that's my goal I just want some respect. She might even be wprst me to me after going to them so i can't win. She's been there longer than me and is older than I am. I just feel helpless at this point because she's making me hate my job. I'm working on getting scheduled for day shifts more because she doesn't work mornings/days. I can't quit because I need the money and my family is struggling financially I get paid 10$ a hour which isn't much but more than what most places are willing to pay someone my age. I turn 18 in August and hopefully will become a cashier soon after. I don't know what to do and I'm tired her making me hate my job and nothing I do is ever enough.  She always finds something wrong. The days when she isn't scheduled are always great and I have no problems. They only schedule one clerk per shift so I always have  heavy work load when things get behind she scold me. It's not like I'm lazy and don't do my work. She just wants me to go her preferred speed which is impossible. I've been there a little over two months and I'm still learning and trying to find a good pace. I am usually a outspoken person who has no issue with defending myself but B makes me anxious.",10Jul2018,1

When I first let her know that was a week after her and her BF (of 3 years) broke up he was super abusive emotionally and they had a rough break up. I let her know I understood that she needed time but I just wanted her to know how I feel. Well about a month went by and her and her BF were still trying to make it work and she finally stopped talking to him. During this time we hung out a couple times and went on an actual date but during the date there was no real physical contact but it was a great time. Well about three weeks ago I asked her if she even saw me as more than a friend so I could move on if she didn't really see me that way. And she didn't give me a real answer one way or the other all she kept saying was how she didn't have feelings for anyone and she just needs time. I pointed out how we've only hung out because I set it up and that the next time we hung out I wanted it to be because she wants to hang out. She'll always accept to hang and we talk almost daily but she's never once really shown me that she likes me as more than a friend. I want to respect her space and give her time but I just don't want to pour in all this energy and effort for it to lead no where. Do you think she doesn't see me as more than a friend and she doesn't want to hurt me? Or am I just being way too pushy about this whole thing and I just need to give her more time?

151,"How do you go about meeting new people with the goal of befriending them?

As I grew into adulthood I became sort of complacent when it comes to meeting new people and making new friends. I made a few friends at college, but didn't socialize much with other classmates, because I told myself that it's not worth investing in, as I won't be seeing them ever again after I graduate. 

Little bit about me, for those who are interested:

Male, 27, living in a large city. I was always that chubby, fun kid to be around, but that took a turn for worse when I started high school. I became closed off, incapable to accept all these fresh faces into my life, and so it took me two years to start opening up and befriending my then-classmates. Then I started college, and I was closed off again for some time, until I was comfortable enough. There's a few people I get along nicely in my workplace, but they are 10+ years older and have other priorities in life. Now I'm in my final year, my high school friends have either returned to my home city, or moved on, college friends will soon be moving as well, and I don't even have a girlfriend right now, which will basically make me alone.

I'm more or less introverted, self-conscious, overweight, with a little bit of stutter. I have a problem with eye contact and smiling at other people, even though I love smiling and laughing. Last year I told myself that I'm gonna put the effort into self-improvement, started working out and visiting a therapist. Always hated running, now I can do 10k no problem, even did a half marathon without any long lasting damage. I gained a lot of muscle mass and a bit of confidence with it, had my first proper relationship, and soon I'll be climbing my first 3k. I've never been much appreciative of my own achievements, but these past weeks it seems to me like I did nothing at all the past year.

152,"hey guys, new to the sub !

anyway basically my situation is a bit rugged so, about 12 months ago now, a few mates and i moved out of our home town into the city to continue our studies, i thought i'd made a good decision on roommates so i was happy, (i currently live with a couple another guy. about two months into moving in (october) the guy from the couple began increasingly becoming more aggressive and not nice to his girlfriend, he gets drunk and calls her cunt and fucking idiot, pushes her etc. I'm caught in the middle of this as i don't want to mess with their relationship. 

so that's the first issue i'm having.

the second issue is that they don't eat properly and barely sometimes at all. most of my roommates just don't have a drive to eat well. we do a food shop usually fortnightly and it's usually not enough. I've tried all i can to promote them to eat better and stuff, but it's starting to take a toll on me now. i've lost nearly 10kgs of weight i can't lose to afford as i have an eating disorder. 

our lease is over in september and i might be able to move out then. it seems like a good option for me if i want to be healthy again. the only issue with that is that 1. i don't want to hurt their feelings and 2. most of the furniture in the house is mine (including the fridge and other necessities) and i don't want to rid them of furniture as they can't afford to get other stuff.

155,"I finally went to a professional and I was diagnosed with discouraged Borderline Personality Disorder(BPD) with borrowed tendencies of self-destructive (as a result from childhood trauma), chronic depression (that is linked to my BPD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD).

I have never been complimented or asked out IRL. All of my relationships have started from online interactions (which I hate). I've been ""offered"" to do some shady stuff IRL, but never the way a lot of people have. At first, I thought it was because I'm not skinny/pretty enough. (My friends tell me that I'm not as big as I think I am but I can never believe it.) But I'm more inclined now to believe them.

So I think that it might be my confidence that is the issue (as some people have advised and some ""articles"" have suggested.) But with BDD, BPD, and depression, I just feel like initiating dating IRL would be completely impossible. I'm hella confident online because of my response from people on it and I don't feel the need to pretend to be something I'm not just so I get the smallest modicum of approval from people I don't know. IRL, it's different. And I'm tired of online dating. It feels far too impersonal and quite frankly, overdone. (Maybe I'm just old fashioned or whatever)

I'm taking medication for the depression, which it does help, but I just find it incredibly daunting to think that no one actually finds me attractive or even cool enough to approach me IRL. Is it possible that that is just my brain attacking itself or do I honestly have far too little hope and should just give up on the idea of appealing to anyone IRL anymore?

(Also, for context, I live in Mississippi and am a half Korean, half white young woman. Short, thick, pear shape that wears her ""nerdiness"" on her sleeve (and body since 2/7 tattoos I have are LOTR based) with hair to her hips. I state this so no one asks me repeatedly what I look like.)

(Another note, I know that physical appearance isn't everything. I'm working through that with my doctor since my mother ingrained in me the idea that if I wasn't pretty enough (no surprise since she's the Korean parent), I would never succeed in any areas of my life. It will take a long time, but it's part of the trauma I received as a young girl. So I know that I shouldn't put this much stock into looks, but my brain still does. HEAVILY. So please refrain from advising that I forget about looks entirely. I'm working on it. Please and thank you.)

I tried reducing the intensity of my exercise but eventually had to stop completely. I went to the doctor, got all the (expensive) MR scans and EMNG's done, and what they information I got is that I don't have anything neurodegenerative but I do have nerve damage in my cervical spine and lumbar spine (this was from an injury few years before). I got no specific information, just guesses and assumptions, because they eliminated all the 'bad' options, like MS, and now it's shrug. Basically that this is due to bad posture and not any injury per say, which makes sense because when this started I wasn't doing any new exercises.

By this point I have hardly done any exercise in months and I'm really depressed. I haven't been in the best state of mind before this, but this really puts me at my lowest. Because what I heard from my doctor is that since I waited so long any improvement is doubtful. And what's worse it seems that most exercise aggravate the sensation loss (which is whole body, arms, legs and face). 

I don't see how I'll ever be able to do so much stuff I wanted. I look decent, but I had a whole exercise plan and regime I was doing and whose outcome was to look great, not just 'not-fat'. I won't be able to do martial arts or rock climbing, which are all the things I wanted to do as soon as I started earning enough money. And it's just a matter of time till the muscles I have atrophy and I lose what strength and looks I have now.

I just don't have a lot of hope that will improve and losing the ability to exercise, to do so many different things, at 23 years of age is too much to take. I'd take it differently if I was 50, but I was just getting started with my life and now so many options are closed.

Even if this improves, I don't see how I will ever be able to exercise and relax without worrying if I am going to have to pay for this later. If I am actually hurting myself (permanently) by doing it. I'm becoming a fucking invalid at 23 years of age.

I'd take pain over this, because with my symptoms they never react immediately to exercise. They're usually delayed so I can even figure out what exactly I can't do. they fuck with me mentally because now I can't even remember how my skin felt before the injury. I can only compare both sides, and you can see how that wouldn't work if I get numb in the right side too. I can't do a lot of exercises already due to having a lumbar disc protrusion. I don't have anything to do if I eliminate exercise that involve the upper back/shoulders too. I'm doing physical therapy but it seems even doing that makes the numbness worse.  I can't even do my stretches because I'm not sure if they are good or if they are hurting me in some way.

I don't know, I feel really shitty. I'm not at all happy with myself and I have zero hope for the future. I can't even touch my face without feeling that it's 'different' from what it was and feeling angry/sad/frustrated about it.

And before anybody mentions, yes I'm seeing a psychologist, I have been a lot of time in the last few years, but I don't see how that will help with what is happening to my body. ",10Jul2018,1
159,"So my boyfriend and me celebrates 4 years together today. We made plans sometime last week to use this day for celebration. First a spa, then a restaurant. All good. A few days after we made the plans, his mother calls him up, and tells him that the family is getting together today, to go to an amusement park. The reason for it is that my boyfriends grandfather passed sometime 2 weeks ago. The mother wanted to get the family together after this awful event, so the amusement park was her answer.  So we had to reschedule the restaurant to the day before, and the spa should be happening maybe sometime next week. 

Now, first I thought it could be fun going. I get to celebrate four years together riding on roller coasters and whatnot, and he can get together with his family at the same time. The only problem was...I wasn't really invited. Apparently this was a ""family only thing"" ( am I not family?) and that secluded me. My boyfriend seemed kinda bummed as well, but didn't seem to question it much.

So...here I am. On our anniversary day. Alone. And he is on his way to the park. Do I have the right to be salty about this? Or is it selfish (since they are getting together because of a death in the family)? I just sorta feel bummed. Any advice at all will help. I did ask for advice from my mum as well, and she said his family was kinda selfish. Would be good hearing an unbiased opinion. ",10Jul2018,2

I have 3 Mini Aussies who are all my world. I treat my dogs as if they are my children, so I am absolutely torn at the thought of possibly rehoming them. 
I live in a very small town where I don’t know many people, and I’ve really been wanting to move into a big city. All of the nice apartments that are on the cheaper side only allow 2 dogs, so you can see my dilemma. 
Odin, the dog I would rehome, has never been by himself. He has always had another dog with him since he was born. If i were to rehome him I think I could only justify it by letting him to go to a home with another dog he can play with, a big yard, and someone who will take time to pay attention to him.

I've already had awful self esteem issues before, but this whole ordeal wrecked me emotionally and mentally. She left a lot of lasting damage and my self image shot down way low.

It would of been worse, but my best friend who we'll call Mandel, kept me sane basically, she kept my spirits high and honestly I habe a lot to thank.

We had huge summer plans with eachother, but then it all came crashing down.

Mandle's parents basically flipped out on her and she admited herself into a psych ward.

I felt so bad for her and did everything I could for her, but I feel like I overstepped my boundaries, I would visit her everyday and she seemed happy to see me, but I always feel like she got less and less enthused to see me each time.

163,"Alrighty,
So naturally I’m kinda awkward, If the people I’m with are shy, they’ll all consider me the most confident one as I’ll take the leadership role when there isn’t one. Which usually works out fine. I don’t love doing it, but in those situations I don’t become annoying. Just more confident. 
This means a lot of people who meet me for the first time see me as super confident.  

However I’m really quite awkward around new people, and I tend to do this thing where I massively over compensate by being super loud and in all honesty. A bit annoying. 

I thought I had matured a bit but the other day I met my best friends boyfriend and a few of her uni friends. And hardly looked at them but loudly talked to my friends, being over exaggerated in my actions and loudness. Like I’m mid 20’s. I shouldn’t still be doing this shit. 

I felt embarrassed after, as I don’t know why I do it. I come in like a bulldozer, really change the dynamic of whatever was going on before. It’s like my reaction of being embarrassed is put all the attention on me. Which makes no sense. 

I don’t think it helps that my best friends have a sort of “oh she’s emotionless/super confident” vibe off me. Which means I over play up the confidence when I feel at all shy cause they don’t know that part of me. 

How can I be less shy and awkward? (And therefore not inclined to over compensate) or how can I manage my awkwardness better.

170,"Hey guys.

Basically, I'm a 23 year old dude and have been with my GF for about 7 years - she's the same age as me.

Yesterday, we had a very open talk over how we think the relationship will proceed. She stated that she is not sure whether she can handle living together - not because of me, but because she prefers being alone way more.

I should state that my girlfriend is a bit of a weird one. We've been in a long distance relationship for those 7 years, visiting each other every few weeks. Now, she is depressed and in treatmant for it after much prodding from me to go get help for the way she is feeling. She says she just likes 'being alone', without human contact, so she's not sure if she'll be able to handle living together with me for a longer period of time. Also, she feels like she'd like to just be super passive, lying around not wanting to do anything, even if I would want to do something with her.

There are other problems in our relationship, like her literally having no sex drive whatsoever - but she's eager to 'help me' when I'm feeling horny, so really, it's no problem; I love her for who she is, not for the sex.

So yeah, it got to the point of where we were discussing how, if living together doesn't work out (we will definitely try, at least), then we will, sooner or later, have to go seperate ways.

The weird thing is... I am sort of conflicted on whether I feel worried about that or glad about that? While I can imagine spending the rest of my life with her, the thought of maybe 'being on the market again' and 'being free' sounds rather motivating, and when I woke up today I felt strangely energized.

 What do you guys think I should do? I have no idea which part of me overwhelms, I'm feeling quite conflicted inside; whether I'd like the 'stay together' outcome or the 'break apart' outcome to come out of this. ",10Jul2018,1
171,"Hey everyone!

I just wanted some opinions on what happened to me earlier this week:

After struggling with my weight for most of my life, I've finally achieved a body that I’m happy with and proud of. I’ve worked hard at the gym and at controlling my diet in order to reach my goals. As a result, I’ve finally had the confidence to start wearing crop tops that show off my midriff. I’ve worn outfits like this outside many times, and other than the looks that come with showing this kind of skin, I haven’t had any issues. 

Earlier this week, however, I was wearing an athletic crop top and high-rise yoga pants at the park, which showed a bit of midriff, topped with a pair of runners, which is the usual athletic/casual wear that I've been donning, when I was approached by this young man in his late teens/early twenties. I had seen that he'd been staring at me for a while, but I ignored it because it wasn't too big of a deal. He was quiet at first, and seemed a little embarrassed to approach me, but I acted friendly because I didn’t want to scare him (it seemed like he was afraid to tell me something). Keep in mind that I was just standing around waiting for a phone call, and wasn’t doing or saying anything. I couldn’t hear his first few words because he was mumbling, and when I asked him to repeat himself, he glanced at my stomach said something along the lines of “a lot of men just want sex...”, hinting that my body was basically 'asking for' men to suggest that with me. It didn’t quite register with me what he’d said because I then had to take an important phone call, and he reluctantly walked away right after. Looking back at the situation, I am almost completely certain that he was addressing the way that I was dressed. I know that from the outside, it may seem like I misunderstood, but there's a lot of body language and such that I don't know how to describe, but I just wanted some opinions on what I truly believe was the situation. 

I've never encountered slut-shaming or anything in my life, and I quite honestly don't know how to feel about it. On one hand, I feel so incredibly offended and angry that he even had the nerve to come up to me and suggest to me to change the way I was dressed; to tell me that I should cover up because men can't control their sexual urges. Even as I'm typing this out, I can feel my blood boil. On the other hand, I feel ashamed that I've been dressing like this for the summer and that maybe I should start covering up to stop giving people the wrong impression. 

Can someone tell me: why does society look down on women who have the confidence to show off their body? Why can't it just be because I feel comfortable in what I'm wearing, and that my outfit is simply an outfit; not a provocative message to men? Most importantly, why did he feel embarrassed to tell me what he did, a complete stranger who I've never met before, as if he was ashamed *for* me?

I would really appreciate everyone's insight on this situation. Please leave any opinions/thoughts, as it would really help me wrap my head around the whole situation. ",10Jul2018,2

Last Saturday we were out as a group of friends (6 People). 2 Particular friends (M &amp; F) like teasing each other, but all of a sudden the M grabbed a lighter as F was about to smoke and for literally 1 - 3 seconds he lit the lighter to F's chin.

This has caused burn damage, and the doctor said it could take a long time to heal properly and that it may leave a scar. F is very cautious about her face since she broke her nose 2 years ago, so she is extremely sad!

Later that day, F's dad called M and told him that he will be paying all of the medical bills and that he will be legally persuing him if there is permanent damage (I was told this was done to ""scare"" him and teach him a lesson, I do not know the full extent of words being exchanged).

But M's girl friend took this threat very seriously and is messaging F to calm down and her dad. F told me that M's girl friend is making him be seen as the victim.

#Advice for my friends and I?

 - We know what M did was VERY wrong, we not think he wanted to cause this damage, but obviously we can't deny what has happened.
 - What should we do? F is very mad, which she has a right to be obviously and that she does not want to talk to M and his gf anymore.
 - F is mad that ""no one"" is on her side, we know she is in the right, but we hate seeing friends fight. I got no clue what to do in this situation besides listening to F and let her vent out.

181,"Hey, this will be a long post, so thanks to everyone who reads it and gives me advice!

To understand my situation I have to write a bit of my background story and some information, but I´ll try to keep it as short as possible!

I graduated from school summer 2016 and after 3 months in which I relaxed and had a break, I started my apprenticeship at a federal authority. This authority is located in a different town than the one I lived with my parents. For the first few months, I always took the train because I was at driving school and didn´t take the driving test then and therefore also didn´t have a license.

But because the trains were at least 5-10 minutes (at least) delayed most of the time or sometimes even got canceled without any notification on the website or the app the evening before (and I, therefore, had to take a taxi or ask my parents, who both also have a job, to drive me) and my school would start soon and I would need more time in the afternoon and evening to do schoolwork, my parents suggested me two options: 

Either I lived with them as before and when I had my drivings license they would tribute some money and I would get my own car (you save a lot of time when you drive the route by car) or I could move into the city where my authority and school are located and they would support me with this. 

I choose to move out and after I passed my driving license, I moved into my first own flat and live there now for one and a half years now. 

At first, I struggled with a lot of things like keeping my flat tidy, organizing myself and grocery shopping (only buying what I need, get into the habit of looking for cheaper no-name brands, etc.), but because it was my flat and the first time I lived alone, everyone around me, including me, told me that this was completely normal and I would get used to it. But I don´t know! 

Even though some things got better over time of course, for example, that I just learned to buy smarter (not buying the most expensive items because I assume that a high price equals high quality just but rather try out cheaper, non-brand items as well) and what I actually need in my life and for my flat (when I went to the grocery store for the first time I bought much stuff I thought I would need but rarely ever used), I feel like I still fail.

For example, I set the goal for me that my flat is always on a constantly clean level. Not extreme clean and I don´t mind if something lying around or isn´t immediately put back where it belongs, but I think there´s a difference between messy (which I don´t want either, but as I said if there are one or two items that lye around it isn´t the end of the world) and dirty. 

My goal is to always have my flat in a way that I can let spontaneous visitors in at any time. 

But although I know to achieve this I have to clean and tidy up a little bit every day instead of the whole flat in one day (cleaning a different room every day of the week or vacuum on Mondays and wipe the floors on Tuesdays...) and I have to do little, quick tasks like washing the dishes after I eat, I end up with the complete opposite: 

I just can't stick to it, let tasks that are actually really easy and quick undone and after a few days, I have to pick one day where I clean and tidy up my whole flat.

I also struggle with routines as I stick to them for a few days and then drop it, either because I am too lazy to it and then tell myself that today is an exception and I will skip this part and then the exception add up and I don´t follow it anymore, or because I set up a routine and plan everything out and feel like everyday something gets in the way and messes with it.

It just sucks cause I need to get more organized and I feel like having a decent routine in the day would help.

As I said, I could also be more organized, but the same as with the routines: I often try, but most of the time I don´t stick to it.

I really need to make some changes, cause even though I am a rather chaotic and messy person it really annoys me for some time now to come home to a flat that is messy and that actually needed to be cleaned up.

182,"He's kind of a dumbass, but I didn't mind it before because he used to be a kind person. I know for a fact that him and all of his friends smoke weed, which is still illegal in my country. I know what kind of people he's dealing with to get it.

Over the last two years, he's been turning more and more aggressive, overall, to the point where I no longer wish to be around him. 

Recently when I last saw him he said to this other friend 'I miss just smoking weed', like weed is the grounding from something. 

He's not done with high school yet, and he wants to, for whatever reason, go to a school for adults for the last year and work simultaneously. He says that it's because he wants to get a musical keyboard. Only when I told him that no self respecting uni will accept him then he changed his mind. 

I believe this will be the last good influence I have on him, because we had a serious argument over the phone, when the whole time I was thinking, he'd hit me if we said this face to face. And now I'm just no longer willing to be around him.

183,"Ok. So. I’m on mobile &amp; this is probably gonna be long so I apologise for the formatting :)

I got out of an abusive relationship a few weeks ago, but I felt emotionally dead towards the guy for a while (around a month) before I broke up with him.  This guy lied to me about a really serious mental illness and would repeatedly tell me nobody wanted to hear about my interests or that I was bothering other people when I initiated conversations. This led to me being super insecure when talking to anyone I wasn’t close with, especially new people. I’m constantly afraid I’m going to scare them off, but I’m so desperate for friends that I end up trying to keep the conversation going, creeping them out and scaring them off anyway. I know it sounds like a paradox but basically I try and tell myself that I’m not bothering people &amp; that some want to talk to me but still pretty much believe the opposite. I end up dancing between being awkwardly saying that if I’m bothering them they should just tell me so I can leave them alone and apologising quite a lot, and asking five questions in a row trying to save a conversation. 

The reason I’m asking/ explaining all this is because I recently started talking to someone who I really like and would really love to be good friends with. We do have a few common interests I have already found, such as games &amp; movies we both really enjoy, and he seem awfully kind. I had a kind of insecurity flare up (if that makes any sense) where I told him that I felt I didn’t have any friends, and he pointed out that he was one. It ended with me dumping a bunch of depressive stuff on him and making the conversation ~incredibly~ awkward. We’ve had really good conversations since then, so it seems to be okay-he’s even sorta made plans to come &amp; help me out with a project-but I really don’t want anything like that to happen again. 

Does anyone have any tips for not being overbearing &amp; ‘spammy’ (the questions thing) when talking to someone, or ways to start a conversation without coming across as needy or desperate? I really want to work on my people skills, and really want to continue a friendship with this guy especially.

Or, should i really go for it with a completely different and harder to learn language thats less common where i live, but one that really interests me, like Russian or french. (though the pronunciation worries me a lot, and the difficulty does as well)

My position at work is being transferred from my current supervisor to a person who has been bigoted against me since he found out that I am gay approximately ten years ago.    I have talked to my current supervisor about it and he says that I am just resentful.   I have talked to HR about anti-gay bigotry in general and they say report, which I do and there's never any action.  


Should I talk to the executive in charge of my department and or HR about this transfer and how I will feel like I am in a hostile work place from now on?

He's just starting to work on walking with a one handed walker so he's still needing care. My role in this is really minor as I do not live with them, but close by. Mostly just to give them a break and get him out more. It is unknown if he'll be able to live on his own again at this time. Mentally he's a bit off and his short term memory is pretty bad. 

I've always had some degree of depression and anxiety, but since his stroke it's gotten bad. Just going to their house I get shaky from anxiety. I never used to get anxiety attacks but now do.

I recently went on vacation out of state to visit family. Very close cousin. No anxiety. I actually felt happy. Had people to do stuff with, things to do, beautiful things to see really close by. They've offered to let me move there and rent a room from them.

191,"Backround

I'm a bartender that works for a large club in Sydney. I also work at some of the restuarants within the club. In the recent years I have found it difficult to obtain employment being a student from a regional town in Australia I moved to the city to find work where I found my current job.

The problem

We make roughly 2million a day off gambling and the managment I work for routinely send out invites to our ""most valuable members"" who have spent over $60,000+ to free dinners with alcohol and food provided. The only way to spend $60,000 a year in the club is through gambling.  These (200ish) people that turn up on these nights have a problem and because of this the managment of the club bring them in to gamble more.  The profit we lose from giving away free alcohol and food we gain back through the machines. 

I feel guilty. I make decent money for a student working at this place. However, morally I feel awful that I am somewhat apart of this. I don't know how these ""dinners"" are legally or morally OK as it is fueling gambling problems which destroy families and peoples lives.

199,"I really don't feel good right now but I have many problems, especially with anger but I'm not excuses, however, most of my anger outbursts are completely provoked by my best friend.

Now, before anyone instantly calls me an asshole, my friend is one of those types who constantly goes on about things in arguments despite me trying to drop it (he doesn't get hints, I do think he's got Asperger's or something). I've hit him a few times and I've always felt rotten about it and apologised. In fact, a year ago, we were discussing my anger issue and how he sometimes provokes them. He denies any responsibility for my anger management issues and says that it's all my own fault and not his. Basically, my psychologist said that I should be avoiding people like my friend, who we'll call J.

J said that my psychologist is wrong and that it should be people avoiding me, since I'm the one with anger issues. We kept arguing until I started swearing and I punched him. We made up after.
But today, he really pissed me off. I visited my little sister and while the three of us were in my garden, J asked what dates my house is free (because my parents are going on holiday and I have the house to myself pretty soon and will be having a party) and when I answered him, he said that I changed the dates and they were different from last time, which I'm sure that they weren't. It was always the same times my house was free, I'm certain of it but he feels the need to prove me wrong.

So, he goes through his phone and tries to find out what I said to him on Messenger and claims that I definately changed it. I told him to drop it and he kept looking for it and tried to prove me wrong. I ended up calling him a fucking retard, to which he responded by telling me to shut up. I completely lost it and ended up hitting him again, and it was especially bad since it was in front of my little sister too. I feel really shit.

202,"I really need help with this.

My aunt is in her late 50’s and has never been married. I’m only 16 so it’s really hard to hear all this and process it and know what to do.  I didn’t even know how lonely she was until we were at a wedding and in the car alone and she completely broke down to my brother and I and told us all of this stuff I had never even known. I still feel like it was all my fault for not noticing anything.

Some of the main points were
• She has nobody to talk to 
• She has an immune system disease and she went through chemo by herself
• My grandpa’s death was devastating to her
• My mom wants her to see a therapist but she thinks that therapists are for crazy people and she isn’t insane
• She does things like being on the HOA board so she doesn’t get depressed 
• Everyone around her is married or happy and she regrets her life
• She’ll never find love (she tried online dating when I was younger) 

She lives about 800 miles away, and she comes to visit my family twice a year. My grandpa died when I was 2 and since my mom was married and had me and my sibling most of the weight of his cancer and death I think landed on the shoulders of my aunt. My uncle lives on the other side of the country and never speaks to us, so he did not really care. 

She has a lot of neuroses and things that make her anxious. I think that she has some form of ocd as she constantly has compulsions to pick at her hands, pick things up and put them down, and rearrange things. She also cannot deal with change in any way, whether it’s small, like using a different kind of toothpaste, or big like moving. Me and my mom really really want her to either move in with us into an empty bedroom we have or find a place of her own near us so she won’t be as lonely.

I don’t know how to help her change or how to help her just improve her life but I think the first step is getting her to move down here. That proves to be difficult though as she’s incredibly hard to reason with, and I couldn’t even convince her to buy another brand of shampoo when they were out of the one she’s been using for 10 years.

She loves my dog a ridiculous amount and honestly I think that it would improve her mental state by 1000% just seeing her every day as well. 

Any advice on how to help her please. I am desperate. I don’t want her to live in this perpetual cycle of sadness and loneliness anymore.

Although I attended regular school for most of my life, I did highschool through an online school, where I made friends around the country. I wouldn't say I'm a social retard, but I have my awkward moments, and going to an online school made me sort of push away a lot of my old friends and didnt exactly let my social skills progress.

During my freshman year, I started talking to this girl online, who we'll call M. I fell for her pretty quickly, and she felt the same way later on. Ever since then, we've been really great friends who never officially got into a relationship because of the distance and the fact that it was only online.

Anyways, fast forward to early this summer, we finally have a chance to meet, and meeting her in person reignites the feelings I had for her. We talk almost every night now over text, but there's basically no chance of a relationship and I feel like it's making me miserable. I love this girl but we live 3 states apart and are about to head off to college, where she probably won't have any trouble finding someone, and I have no idea what to do. I love talking to her but at the same time it makes me sad thinking about the fact that we have no future together, so I wonder if cutting off contact and forcing myself to move on is something I should try to do. I don't want to be the asshole who phases her out, especially since it would make us both miserable for the time being, but there's gotta be something I can do to not have the weight of the fact that there might be expiration date for our relationship on my shoulders.

218,"I made this acc just so i could post this. Sorry for really long post i just dont know what to do or if i was wrong. If you have the time you have no idea how much it would mean for you respond.

So im in 8th grade, and up until 3 weeks ago i was best friends with this dude that we can call ""Sam"". So Sam invites me to stay with his family for the weekend at this holiday house with another friend who i was also close with, who we'll call ""Alex"". So we get there and things are looking pretty fun, but on the second of the 3 nights we were staying there, Sam and Alex start talking gossip about people, and i join in. Eventually, Sam decides to say to call out this one guy (Call him ""Sean"") in our group that we thought was annoying. Sam says to use my phone, as Sean already didnt like me, which was news to me and Alex. I got pretty riled up about this, because on top of that, Sean had made countless jokes and remarks to myself and other people about my estranged father.

Sean was the weird kid in our group, and would regularly do weird shit and hurt people to make himself laugh, if that adds any context.

I decide to go ahead with it while Sam suggests things to say, and the final message read exactly this:

\*NOTE I WAS REALLY ANGRY BECAUSE SAM HAD JUST SAID ALL THE THINGS THAT SEAN HAD SAID ABOUT ME. YES I REALIZE THAT WHAT I SAID WAS REALLY MEAN IM SORRY\*

""Yo cunt, can i jus ask why the fuck u so weird. Like you fuckin headbutt, lick, rub and punch people regularly. Its fucked up, and childish as shit. When anybody calls you out on your bullshit, you call THEM weird and then proceed to squeel and punch your way to tomorrow. Like do you actually have some behavioural disorder, because you act 4 and have the tempremant of a 4 year old aswell. And on top of that you think that its funny to make fun of me because of my dad? R u fuckin serious?

Sincerely- Me, \[Sam\] and multiple others who want to remain anonymous.""

I realise what i sent may have been more hurtful than intended when reading through this again while writing this.

Then, the next day out on the holiday house, Sam was acting a bit strange, but i think nothing of it. But while we were in our bunk beds in the shared room, i was asleep with just my underpants on, and Sam takes a picture over snapchat and sends it to the biggest bitch in our class, along with around 10 others according to Alex, and then laughed hysterically with Alex saying ""SHE REPLAYED IT AHAHA"" etc etc.

I ask Alex what it was and he says it was me in my undies. I call Sam a cunt and go back to sleep, eager to fucking go home.

The next day, i ask Sam what it was, and he says it was me under the covers, while Alex is behind him mouthing ""You in your undies"". I ask Alex later on in the day and on the drive home and he said that i was wearing a shirt and pyjama pants in the pic, even though i dont own pyjama pants.

We get back to our city and Sam's family thanks me for coming while Sam says nothing as i get my bags out of the car and head inside my house.

Over the next week at school, Sam, who had been my best friend in the whole school up until the picture, was hanging out with everyone except me. And over the weekend, he invited everyone except me in our group to go to the movies. I asked him why i wasnt invited, and he said he organised it over Xbox, and i dont have an Xbox, so he couldnt invite me, but like 3 other people who went didnt have Xboxes.

i DMed one of my close friends that he had sent it to, and he said that it looked like i was almost naked. I asked another friend, and she said the same thing. I was fucking done so i went straight to my dms with Sam and wrote out how he was a cunt for sending that photo, and that he was a cunt for not inviting me to the movies when everyone else was. (I would type out the whole thing but he blocked me on literally everything, including the myspace we made for jokes, so i cant view our DMs so i may be missing some crucial things).

Basically i called him out for these two things, and he retaliated saying that it was because i ""embarassed him in front of his family"". I asked him what he meant by this and hew said that it was because i didnt go to the playplace area at the restaurant when him and Alex did, and instead stayed with his family and ate my $20 meal, like you're supposed to when youre over 5 years old. I say that that's bullshit, and he then says that ""I sent the picture because you sent a similar picture to the girl i liked"" when i seriously never did anything remotely like this, which i said, to which he replied that i had no proof that i didnt. I just stopped texting him at that point because i was sick of his blatant lying to me, even though we both knew that he was lying.

\[A little bit more context, we had a large group, but only 5 in my class, consisting of Sean, Sam, Jett and Nathan. Nathan was the only person who came from my old school to my current, and did not like me because his best friend ross kicked me from his discord for breaking his rules, so me and ross got into a bit of an argument and things escalated so our old group from primary split up, so my closest friends are the ones who stuck by me, but they go to different schools than me. I would add more context but its a story longer than this one\].

The next day, he didn't show up to school, and according to Jett, he had posted something about me on his second account on instagram, which i couldnt see as his second account blocked me, but not his main acc (So im guessing he blocked me to make me not able to respond publicly or something).

Sam then DMs me that night saying ""I know that you've been shit-talking"" Admittedly i had been slightly, but none of it were lies and it was just showing people the messages that sam had sent and the ones i sent back. I ask him what he meant and he said that APPARENTLY i told one of our old friends that i said that sam should ""Go die"" and apparently i told people that i hope that he overdoses on his antidepressants. I tell him that it's bullshit, i said none of that, especially to a girl i hadnt talked to in months, and then he said ""Wait no she said that she overheard you saying that at the lockers"". MY LOCKER IS 200 METERS AWAY FROM HERS, AND I DONT GO DOWN TO THAT PART OF THE SCHOOL EVER. So i knew he was full of shit, so i asked him who he was fooling, and he stopped responding. an hour later Sean messages me telling me to fuck off, so i ask why, and he says that the message i sent really hurt him. I went back to read the message, and immediately regretted sending it, so i apologized profusely, and then he said ""Sam says hey also"" so i go apeshit. Sam was acting as if he didn't suggest shit to say in the message, and told sean he had nothing to do with it. I tell sean and then sam messages me saying ""youre manipulative, i cant believe you would try to drag me into that message"" or something along the lines of that.

Sam then continues saying that i bully him, but then i asked why he invited me to the holiday then. He then said ""see, youre manipulative and you make people hate themselves"". I decide to just apologize, as it was 3AM, and sean had just started sending messages aswell saying that i made him want to kill himself (this is the guy that kept telling people jokes about my dad who left me). I apologized more than i ever had in my life, and went to bed, hating myself.

I woke up in the morning and told my mum that i was going to school. She left for work, i pretended to put my school uniform on, took it straight back off, got in bed and slept through the day. The entire time i regretted apologising, as i realized that they were just getting into my head, as they had no problem making my life hell, and then they say that i was a bully.

I went to school the next day, and as i walked in to the locker area, the entire fucking class stared at me, not an exaggeration. I went to sit down with Jett, but Sam, Nathan and Sean all told me to fuck off, and kept calling me an ""asshole bully shit who didnt deserve a dad"". So i sat down in class, on a table by myself and did my work. Later on i went over to some kids in my class that i hung out with for the first semester of year 7 and said ""Hey can i chill with you guys for a bit?"" They said yeah and we started talking about shit and hung out for the last few weeks of term, but at lunch i would usually just float around with my good friend Eden with some other groups i didnt know too well. The kids in my class asked what i do at lunch, i said that i hang out with my other friends, and they said that if i was bored that i could join their footy games.

Its the last week of our 2 week break we have, and ive only gone out with my friends from primary school, Eden and my other friend Zac. I constantly feel like everyones judging me and i feel like moving schools to my best friend's school, but its 10 grand a year and my family doesnt have that money. The friends i have in my class are good people, but it doesnt feel the same at all and i feel so alone.

219,"We work in a small coffee shop which doesn't have that many staff members. We only have 2 staff members working on weekdays and 3 on weekends. My 50 year old colleague has been here for the past two months and eventhough she is very hard working and has made some progress since she first started, she still struggles with following the simplest instructions and performing small tasks.
She is very good keep the shop clean as she previously worked as a cleaner, she's not too bad in the kitchen however she will get too upset when she makes a small mistake that can just be overlooked. When I'm not on my break I make sure to do the more difficult taste and let her focus on cleaning tables and refilling displays etc. 

The problem comes when I need to take a break or when the shop gets busy so I need to focus on another task. She will forget how to make a simple coffee like a mocha eventhough we have instructions clearly written on the wall. She will ocnatsnlty keep asking me questions that I either can't fully take a break or can't focus on my own task that it's giving me some anxiety. I have reminded her so many times to just keep calm and not worry about things as she is doing fine and not to get all nervous and sweaty when she spills some milk.

 I have made the mistake of one time ask if her to work faster and ending making her cry so I had to stop what I'm doing in order to console. Now I just keep my feedback to myself in fear of upsetting her.

We've talked about sex and relationships a bit, and she mentioned that she didn't want to rush to have sex with me because she was starting to really like me. We started getting close and we've hung out twice so far. First time was with her friend and the next was alone. We went out to run an errand that she had to do, and then came back to my place, watched TV, made out, fell asleep together. Things seemed to go really well when we hung out but ever since that day we haven't really talked or snapchatted as much as we used to. But she started calling me every night before we go to sleep. I invited her over to stay the night at my place sometime and she seemed open to it, but was just starting a new job and was going to be busy, so I told her the offer is still open and to just let me know when she wants to.

Last year I went on a solo trip to Berlin, I loved it so much that I decided to travel solo to Stockholm this year.
I live in the Netherlands and my trip is supposed to be 4 days. I am now on day 2 and I have a bad case of either home-sickness or anxiety (both of which I have never had before).

I want to go hone early, my booked flight depards on thursday at 20.30 but on fridaymorning I have to work already (plus the rest of the weekend and week after) it really stresses me out and this was supposed to relax me.


Any flight I want to book is either 12 hours long instead of the 2 direct hours or more than 300 euros.
Money is not a big issue, but I am not sure if spending 300 euros to get home a day early is worth it. 


The trains can't be booked online but I haven't tried calling yet, travelling by bus would be 27 hours which would cause me to arrive later than if I went back on my original flight.


I tried to see if I could change ny flight but it would cost me 280 euros to travel 3 hours earlier.


I am sorry that this post is such a mess, I'm at loss and my fiancé and parents can't help from their location. The only thing I would have to do before leaving at this moment is handing in my AirBnB key, other than that I just want to leave as quickly as possible.


Does anyone have any advice? Thank you so much


Note: I would choose to go by bus if I didn't get sick after eating or drinking (even water. It's not food poisoning, this is IBS which gets worse with stress) , buses often don't have great toilets and I need one nearby.  ",10Jul2018,1
226,"Long story short, she was hired right out of college by a smaller company and has been with them for the past 4 years. For the past 2 years she has been fighting depression and honestly, losing. She has gained weight, has no self confidence, and her work environment is stressful, toxic, and she often gets taken advantage of. 

Unfortunately I have been unable to convince her to see a therapist and the depression seems to be getting worse.. The good news is that she is ready to throw in the towel and leave her job (without finding another one right away). 

So besides any additional advice, I am hoping someone can give tips on how to give notice to an employer when you have nothing else lined up. She is worried about being judged and never finding another job (I can't change her mind and I understand). 

I should add that we live pretty frugally and my income can sustain us easily. She wants time off to find herself, get in better shape, and reevaluate what she wants to do with her life. The only thing that has been standing in her way is telling her boss that she needs to quit. ",10Jul2018,1
227,"So this has been going on for some weeks now. And it's really getting on my nerves. I failed my class and i'm going to repeat it. For support, i found a few help courses around the city to help me with my classes i'm weak on. No problems with that yet. 

My mom howewer brings up my younger sibling on this who is 12 y/o.  He is in 6th grade. Let's call him A. Every time i brought a bad grade to home mom would always call A here and nag to him about me. She would insult me everytime f.e. Look at this trashbag? If A would write that test he would've gotten an B atleast i bet! On every test, even our ones where the levels of language is right out of A's level. She even gave him my tests to ""correct"" it, where the only thing he said was utterly bullcrap and had nothing to do with the main tasks. 

Outside of tests, she would always force me to sit at my spot and listen how A is that great, smarter, knows more in life than me (i'm 17 years old!?), and all that kind of stuff till she said that A should go to the help course to hold my hand, sign me up for it and find the rooms where i'm supposed to go. Because apperently i can't make it myself. Aha. Alongside with that go to the box club with me to again sign me up for it and find a job for me. And teach me in my class problems. That just sounds hilarious. She doesn't want to believe me that i can care about myself and just keeps continueing  insulting me and put A on the throne.

We're both in university (I just finished my 2nd year and she just finished her 1st year) and I spent 2 months living with her in her dorm room while my holidays had started and it made me realise that living together makes or breaks a relationship. We had explosive fights at least every other fights with crying and shouting at each other and we're just not in a stable relationship. There were multiple times where I was on the verge of leaving during those 2 months but she would never let me. Not even to go for a walk to calm myself down when we were arguing insisting that we sort out the argument then I go for my walk which would work me up even more.

Now for summer we're in different countries and talking to her stresses me out. I avoid replying to her texts and I can't force myself to have a conversation with her because we've grown further apart.

I tried to end things with her over a video call last week because we cannot physically meet until October this year and she refused to let me end the relationship. Begging and pleading and even threatening self harm if I did end the relationship.

I no longer want to be with her but I don't want her to harm herself because I'm not in her life anymore and I don't know how to go about it.

My wife and I grew up in our town all our lives. We had the obligatory teenage dream of leaving that town and never looking back. We thought we had it all planned out, it was going to work out GREAT.

Our cat got lost after 7 years of having him, our cars both broke down and we had to spend a fortune on fixing them, we've encountered some really rude people around us, our house was not as nice as it seemed and it needed a lot of work done, and many other small, but annoying things. I just want to go back home. I know my wife is open to it but I also know she wants to give it a longer chance. I didn't realize it, but back home we had perfect jobs, great schools, and a great home. We had family closer and we had a sense of community that we just don't have here. I guess you have to leave home to really appreciate it. So anyway, I guess I'm looking for advice on what I should do? Should I pack everyone up again and go back home?

235,"Hey there, so a little back story:
My boyfriend and I have been together for a while now, and he just moved in after he graduated college. It was a risky move for him because he’s a software developer and this is a *very* small town with few opportunities. Like, we have one traffic light. There really wasn’t a choice for me to move out right away, I have a lot of animals that I’ve cared for for a really long time and I can’t move from where I am until I’m able to buy a house so they can come with me.
Anyway.
Our plan when he first moved here was for him to find something he at least enjoyed somewhat and for us to work and save for a down payment on a house so we can move. I wash dishes at a local cafe, I get treated well there but I work really hard and I’m currently being seen to find out if I have fibromyalgia, so it’s really not something I’d like to keep doing for long. I’d like to move back to a city, so that I have more opportunity to work in a more creative field that’s less taxing on me. I’ve also been sober for 2.5 years, and while theres a nice AA community here, I’d really like to be part of a bigger sober network. Point is, I’m itching to move. I’ve been here for too long and I finally have the ability to save for it. 
Boyfriend just got a unicorn of a job. Right in town, he can walk. He’s doing EXACTLY what he went to college to do and enjoys the work there. Five figure salary, benefits, 401K, the works. We weren’t expecting this at all. So while our plan before was solidly, “save up and get out of here in a year”, now it’s, “well maybe two, or three years here is fine.” 
Needless to say I’m frustrated and upset. I’m really really happy he has this job that he likes, but I can’t stay here. This is the town I’ve been in since before middle school, and the whole time I’ve desperately missed living in a city. I’m really tired of living here, and I don’t know how to tell him firmly without making him upset. I’ve been very patient and I’ve been through a lot, I’ve basically pulled my life back together from scratch so that I could move safely and now it feels like I’m just going to stay trapped. Any advice?",10Jul2018,1
236,"For me, it's always been the JonBenet Ramsey case. I don't think Burke Ramsey kill ed JonBenet. 

Everyone focuses on how he acts strangely. This could easily be explained by him being socially awkward and potentially being on the spectrum.

Burke being on the spectrum would definitely explain why the Ramseys were so protective of him without actually being guilty of anything. 

It could also explain why Burke smeared feces on JonBenet's things (some children with autism have a tendency to fecal smearing) 

I believe that the intruder theory makes a lot more sense than Burke Ramsey doing it and that people make him out to be a psychopath  who'd kill his sister without really considering the less sinister explanations behind his actions and mannerisms.

237,"Hey guys, first time poster. 

I recently went on a conference trip with seven of my brothers and the trip caused a lot of issues. We got there Thursday and did not do much. Friday we had a ceremony in the morning and then break out sessions which no one attended from my group because the older kids went to a brewery, which left me staying at the hotel doing nothing. The next day, a different group invited me out. The other group was accepting, cool and I felt more like a brother with them than I did with my own group. The issue is I’m under 21, so cannot legally drink within the USA. Everyone I went with was older and could drink, so this really put me out of the group. In an attempt to fit in I also brought a couple of drinks on the trip

Moving forward, I went out that night with the other group and drank. This caused the president who was on the trip to freak out, although he had allowed me to take a shot two days prior (Thursday night?). 

On the drive home I got car sick twice and he blamed it on the alcohol. After it was just me and him and another person in the car who was on the standards board. At this point he laid into me for over an hour about how I supposedly feel sorry for myself all the time and how I had a supposed alcohol problem. As a college student I’m exposed to situations that have alcohol but I am almost 100% cautious in every situation which it is involved. I drank a lot more in my freshman year and have been constantly improving how much I drink as a result, so his points didn’t make much sense.

He also brought my girlfriend into it saying that our relationship will ultimately fail.

So here comes the advice part: he gave me two options. To disaffiliate from the fraternity in a respectful manner so I can “work on myself until I’m perfect in his eyes” or to stay in the fraternity and ultimately go in front of the standards board, and along with that he would report to the school I’m an alcoholic (which is not true at all. My parents have been informed of everything and are extremely upset. I’m very open with my parents and they play an important role in my life). 

So now I either have to disaffiliate respectfully or be kicked out and go in front of the school for allegations of being an alcoholic, all because my ecstasy taking President has a hard on for ruining me.

Tl;dr went out and drank underage at a conference, president saying I’m an alcoholic and saying I must disaffiliate 

- I know some of the brothers in the fraternity use Reddit, so hopefully this doesn’t reach back to me. Thanks all",10Jul2018,1
238,"This is a long one. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Names have been changed to preserve anonymity. I need to introduce a few people: Jenn is my friend. Brandon is her boyfriend. Nick [34M] is a mutual friend. 

We all practice martial arts at the same dojo. Jenn has been out of the dojo for about two months because of an ankle injury. Brandon continues to attend classes. He’s several ranks above me in one art, as is Nick. Brandon and Nick will oftentimes attend my intermediate class before their advanced class because I am the only intermediate student. It helps me to have somebody to practice with other than Sensei and it helps them in case nobody else attends their advanced class. 

I have PTSD. Nobody at the dojo, apart from Nick and Jenn know. Jenn knows it was because I was raped (though I didn’t go into details, didn’t explain how many times, and didn’t explain the number and variety of abusive relationships I’ve been in). Nick also knows I have PTSD, but doesn’t know why. I told him when I was diagnosed with it because I work best with him and felt he should know in case something happened. His presence helps keep me grounded. (He’s the one who originally introduced me to the dojo a year and a half ago. We had been FWBs for a couple of months at that point, but stopped seeing each other about a year ago.) I opted not to tell Sensei because he’s mentioned before about how he doesn’t know how to handle that stuff, which I already gleaned from his personality. 

A couple of weeks ago, I attended a town festival with some friends, including Jenn. Jenn ended up staying out later than anticipated and ubering home. Brandon wasn’t there when she got home and wouldn’t answer his cell. The next morning, when she tried to talk to him about it, he choked her and threw her into a wall. When she told me she was going to her friend’s place, I assumed she was leaving him. She said she needed a plan. She asked me not to say anything to Brandon, because she thought he’d still be in class that day. I opted to skip classes all week. 

She was back to living with him within a day, because he was being sweet, etc. Over a week later, she hasn’t mentioned it and acts like nothing happened.

I was in class on Sunday and Brandon was there. He acted quite normal... Almost more friendly than normal. I had a panic attack in the changing room, but have gotten fairly good at kind of just shoving that shit down. 

Because five people attended class on Sunday, Nick and I worked together and the other three guys worked together. I didn’t have to interact with Brandon at all. (Sensei at least recognizes that I prefer working with Nick and that we work well together.)

However, I was still staving off panic attacks throughout class and was having trouble focusing. Nick asked me several times if I was okay. He told me that I seemed down and out of it. He laughed it off though, probably assumed I was hungover. 

What do I do? I can’t tell Nick because he has a guard dog personality when it comes to his friends. If he knew what Brandon did to Jenn, he would be beyond pissed and would probably confront Brandon, which wouldn’t be good for Jenn. The dynamic at the dojo would be wrecked. 

I also can’t interfere with Jenn’s relationship. She and I are having dinner on Thursday and I want to talk to her about it. We’ve both been in abusive relationships before. I know how these things escalate. I’m afraid for her and I want what’s best for her. 

I don’t know how to handle finding Brandon to be so triggering. I never worked well with him and was always put off by him, but now I can’t deny how he makes me feel. The moment he goes to “attack” me, I’m either going to panic or disassociate. In tonight’s class, the whole group tends to have practice as a unit. 

I don’t want to quit my classes. I’ve been doing this for over a year and highly enjoy it. Until this happened, we’ve been a great community that gets along very well. I’ve been facing triggers head on, working through them, and practicing my grounding techniques. Plus I would have to explain to so many people (both at the dojo and in the rest of my life) why I stopped going.

TL;DR: My friend’s boyfriend attacked her and she’s not leaving him. I do martial arts with the boyfriend. I don’t think she should stay with him. He now triggers my PTSD. I don’t want to quit classes and don’t know how to get out of working with him to avoid those triggers. ",10Jul2018,1
239,"My parents are successful upper-middle college grads who escaped rural poverty, started a business and provided for my siblings and I. They paid for college and helped me when I purchased my first house. They took me to Disneyland and spoiled us at Christmas. They always remember my birthday and dote on my 18 m.o. daughter. They were also emotionally, and occasionally physically, abusive. 

What follows is a non-exhaustive recounting; I have many pages of upsetting material but will keep it (relatively) short. 

Quick word about me: I didn’t drink in high school, didn’t have sex until after I was 21. 39 y.o. Eagle Scout who holds two advanced degrees. 

From an early age, I was aware that my dad was a very angry person. He worked crazy hours to establish his business and would often come home enraged and flip out on my mom. It was so bad that at age 7, I asked my mother when they’d be getting divorced. I was disappointed when she cried and said, “I hope never.” 

My dad often told me my ideas were stupid. He once sat me down and angrily explained to me that I was a nerd, that I’d always be a nerd, and that people didn’t like me because of it. Once, when I was dropping off birthday invitations to my friends in the neighborhood, I was 15 minutes late returning home and he whipped me with a belt to the point I had trouble sitting in my desk at school.

I would receive the belt for minor offenses on multiple occasions. One time, my sister and I were jumping on the bed and laughing loudly while he was on the phone in the other room. I’ll never forget his rage as he ran into the room swinging his belt like a mad man.

I doubt you’ll be surprised to learn I started having panic attacks and developed asthma. I’d cry at inopportune times because I was scared of everything. My dad would routinely raid my room, pulling things apart to look for non-existent contraband. I’d then be chastised for having a messy room.  Reading too much and not being good at baseball were serious problems in our house. When I was bullied at school and told my parents about it, their response was dismissive. “You need to fight.” 

I’d often be compared to my deadbeat uncle. “You’re going to be worthless, just like him.” I watched as my mom lost her smile. The belting and insults continued; the praise was backhanded. “You’re too smart to be this dumb.” (I’d receive a diagnosis and treatment for ADD as an adult). I was shy and empathetic and well-aware it was a problem. When I refused to kill newborn baby mice in the garage, my father made fun of me at the dinner table because I was upset he smashed them.

Flash forward to college. While in town visiting, my mom picked me up from volunteering for the Salvation Army and nastily asked me, “do you think this makes you a good person?” They told me I wasn’t smart enough to take a bio-med science course (I was), that I wasn’t strong enough to join a fraternity (became president), that I was a liar when I said I wasn’t sleeping with my then-girlfriend (I wasn’t), and that my idea to pursue my passion in business was wrong and that I should go to law school (I did, to disastrous effect). I eventually went back to grad school, which they paid for, and have worked to catch-up and succeed at my profession of choice.

Flash forward again. Now they support politicians who have been accused of assaulting women; they lie about keeping unlocked, loaded firearms in reach of their grandchildren; they make passively racist comments at the dinner table. At a dinner when I was still single, my mom announced she didn’t care who I married “as long as she’s white.”

I wake up most mornings filled with rage at the way they treated me and the insecurities I’m saddled with. I’ve explained the situation to my wife, but she can’t feel it the way I do. When my parents offered to help with our down payment on our first house, I told her I didn’t want their assistance. She talked me into it (we were just getting started and they’d done the same for my sister and bro-in-law after their wedding). I acquiesced but was sick about it. I feel like taking their money makes me a hypocrite when I consider distancing myself and my family from them.

I understand they came from nothing and their parents were children of the depression - struggling in a poor, rural environment that I never had to deal with thanks to their hard work. But I don’t think that makes their behavior okay. They never apologized after their insults or when they hit me and they never offered compliments or praise during the calm moments. I know I was shy and overanalyzed what they said, but they bullied me worse than anyone else in my life.

The worst is behind me, so am I crazy for wanting to distance myself from them all these years later? 

This felt good to write. Thanks for reading.

I give up pretty fast and I decided to stop trying pretty quickly. Thing is, she never tried calling me back, and contacted me this one time regarding an Instagram post that included me in it (it’s of us singing a cover together, imo nothing more than self promotion). She’s not a bad person at all, in fact I admire her. My family liked her so much they still ask about her (if they found out that we stopped staying in touch they’d probably assume it was because of me haha.)
Today she sent me a message after like 8 months of not speaking a word to each other asking me regarding my uncles apartment that he rents out in the Canary Islands. She claims it’s for her friends, which I’m not going to dispute. 
My issue with this is that I feel kind of insulted that she only decided to contact me because of that and not because she wanted to talk to me. Maybe I’m wrong or just making a big deal out of nothing but I personally would never do that. 
I’m kind of hesitant to engage in this, because I don’t personally know her friends and the risk of having my reputation tarnished is definitely there.

243,"Looking for some advice- My mom lives in FL and works a part-time job. She's had issues with her back (she's in her 60's) for many years now and as had surgery in the past for it (back in 2002-ish). She's been having severe pain for the last year or so and finally went to a few doctors which all agreed that she would need another surgery. She works on her feet all day which doesn't help and has an Rx for pain meds which she keeps increasing. She asked for more hours to try to save up money, but her employer won't let her work more than 35hr/week to keep her at part-time (she's been at this job for about 6 years). So two issues- she can't afford her cost for the surgery or the time off she would need to take for recovery. Id help her out anyway I can, but I its way more than I can afford at the time.  

With that said- does anyone know if any kind of financial assistance for this type of situation? She could possibly get financial assistance for the cost of the surgery itself, but she cant afford to take the time off work for the recovery.

245,"My gf (20)f and I (20)m went to go get something to eat yesterday. On the way there she started breaking down and told me she had taken a pregnancy test and it had come back positive. A million thoughts immediately ran through my mind but I couldn’t focus on any of them. We’ve always agreed that if it were to happen we would get an abortion. Neither of us are financially / emotionally ready to have a child, we basically have the minds of 12 yo to be honest. She told me she took a ClearBlue at-home test before she left to meet me because her period was late, and the test read that she was 3+ weeks pregnant. At first I was mad at her. Every-time we’ve talked about using birth control she refuses to use any form of it. I was mad, but It’s her body and her decision and I cant force her to do anything she doesn’t want to do. However; We usually don’t wear condoms even though we’ve had to buy plan B multiple times. I guess we just thought it would never happen and chose to ignore that we were playing with fire. We’ve set up an appointment at planned parenthood for a consultation on the 24th of July. The consultation is supposed to last 6 hours and apparently I can only be with her for the first 15 minutes.

246,"A little background: I'm a student and I have interned at company A for a summer and then part time throughout the year. I know the office, the job and it's in the area in which my family lives. I currently intern for company B and it's the same job but 2000 miles away in a nice city and albeit more expensive. Company A wanted to hire me but I told them I was looking to move away from home for a few years just as a change of pace for my life. I never formally received a contract though. Company B has room for me and will likely offer me a contract within the next 2 weeks. Because it would be a big move and whatnot, I'd like to weigh my options. 

Now the actual question: Would it be frowned upon to ask for a contract from company A to basically compare the pay and benefits with company B even with the possibility that I wont take the offer? 

I just feel like if I end up not going with them, I feel like I'm a tease haha. Working for almost a year and a half and then asking for a contract and not taking one.

248,"My boyfriend, who I live with and have been dating for about 6 years, thinks that I go to bed too early and refuses to leave our bedroom so that I can sleep. I usually get exhausted around 1am and wake up around 8am but he won't go to bed until 5am and will sleep until noon. He says I'm being selfish for taking that room for myself for hours at a time, but he spends /litterally/ all day in our room by himself and will kick me and our girlfriend out of the room whenever he wants. (Btw, we're polyamorous) 
I haven't slept next to either of my partners almost 2 weeks. He's forced me to sleep on our mostly broken futon, while the two of them enjoy our queensized bed. I'm also pretty sure that all of this isn't helping my mental health, as I've been more depressed and easily agitated lately.

251,"*Disclaimer: I’m new to the reddit community, and I’m still not entirely sure how this all works, so I apologize if the formatting for this is strange or if I’m posting this in the wrong location.*

First, I should give a bit of background information about me and my situation. I am a 21 year old female college student, and for the past 6 years I’ve struggled with social anxiety and severe depression. Due to my mental health issues, I’ve had a difficult time forging lasting friendships, and dating has been next to impossible for me to devote any time or energy to. Thankfully, my mental health has improved drastically over the past 6 months, and I’ve managed to maintain a great group of friends for about 2 years now. I’ve also grown increasingly interested in dating, and want to be in a relationship sometime soon. I’ve been on a few dates over the past few months, but although they are all nice and attractive guys, I consistently find myself comparing them to one of my friends, causing me to eventually lose interest. I’ve had a massive crush on this friend since I’ve met him, he’s kind, smart, and cute as hell. I want to tell him how I feel about him, as I believe that honesty is incredibly important, but I’m scared because I don’t know how he’ll react. I know that he used to like me too when he first met me a few years ago, and he showed interest in me for a few months after, but due to my health issues I knew I wouldn’t be able to handle a relationship at the time, and didn’t reveal that I had feelings for him as well. I’m afraid that if I tell him how I honestly feel now that he’ll become upset or uncomfortable and avoid being around me. He’s super close with our entire group of friends, so if I make him uncomfortable I’m also afraid that it will lead to me losing my only friends. I don’t know what I should do, I don’t want to miss out on any more life experiences than I already have, and I don’t think I can move on to dating other people unless I know for a fact that he isn’t interested in me. Should I tell my friend the truth? If so, how should I go about telling him? Any advice would be endlessly helpful.

TL;DR- I need advice on whether or not I should tell my friend that I like him, at the risk of ostracizing myself from my only friends.",10Jul2018,1

253,"Hey guys. Thank you in advance for anyone with some advice. I just learned something about my boyfriend C, and I’m not sure if I should tell him or not. 

For some history, he’s 25 and the oldest of his two siblings. His mom and dad had him when they were both 15. At first his father was absent, but sometime along the way he stuck around and became abusive to my boyfriend and his mom (luckily he ignored my boyfriends siblings). When his parents finally split, my boyfriend ended contact with him and even changed his last name to his moms maiden name. 

I’ve been living with C and his family for about a year now. His sister (A) is only one year younger than me so we’re really close. One night we were having a girls night in. C and a few other members of the household were either working or out for the night, so it was just us home. Eventually me and A starting talking about some more serious stuff. She then confided in me that not only was their mom raped at 14 which resulted in her becoming pregnant with C, but that the man who abused him isn’t his biological father. A said that the father told her this but that A and her younger brother are biologically his. A then went to her mom and asked if this was true, and she said she broke down and confirmed that’s the truth. She also begged A not to tell anyone, especially C. 

Guys I’m at a loss here. The person who brought C so much suffering as a kid isn’t even his dad, but is instead the product of rape. Should I tell him the truth? Before I found this out, me and C would both joke that he has a different dad since C looks nothing like his “dad”. Now I know that he’s not. C is such an amazing man and is the exact opposite of the man that raised him. I’m worried that if he knows the truth, it might destroy him and that this could impact his relationship with his mom. On the other hand, if it was me I feel like I would have the right to know. But I know it’s not me, this is C. And C has been through a lot in life. I just don’t want to hurt him. So what should I do?

TL;DR I found out that my boyfriend is the product of a rape and is not the biological child of the abusive asshole that raised him. Should I tell him the truth or not?",10Jul2018,8

261,"So a little background, I’ve [24F] been at my company for 4 years. I started as an intern and 2 years later I was managing my company’s largest 85 million dollar project. Two months ago, I got promoted to a managerial position which obviously would come with a raise. I’m managing specifically cost on all company projects. So now instead of having one project to worry about, I have 12. My workload has increased significantly. 

I’ve been in this new position two months now and my boss has been beating around the bush when it comes to my salary. When I started the position, my boss said there would be companywide raises and mine would be reflected in those. When the raise came a week later, I realized I was raised at 1 percent. So essentially, I’m currently doing the new job at my old salary which is unacceptable to me. My boss keeps saying he’ll make time to sit down with me to adjust the salary further, but when the time comes he says he has to leave to pick up his kid or he has a meeting. 

At this point I’m really frustrated. The conversation would take 20 minutes maximum and I find it insulting that he doesn’t think he can spare that time to sit down with me despite how much value I bring to the company. I’ve uncovered and fixed incredibly serious issues that were caused by the person who was previously filling this position. 

I think in his mind he doesn’t think I’ll leave and he thinks I’ll wait. I also suspect he still sees me as that intern that started 4 years ago (when he said he would make time to sit about salary he followed that statement up with “how old are you again?, 24 right?”). I’ve been loyal to this company and have watched it grow in the 4 years I’ve been here, as well as watched myself grow as well. But I don’t appreciate being avoided and not even being told hello.

262,"I don't want to say what family member but and older one. 

They live on their own in a house. They find it difficult to walk. They can't go upstairs any more. 

We wanted them to have a stair lift fitted which would have been mostly paid for by the government. They didn't want it because they were worried about the mess and having to run electrics and stuff. We also wanted them to have a bathroom with a a shower that had no step on it, but they said they were worried about the mess and the water pipes. Again it would have been mostly paid for by the government. They grant got withdrawn a while ago now because they didn't want it. They haven't been upstairs for a long time. 

They have an old cooker (about 40 years old) and the oven door open downwards so they have to learn across it to put things in and out and they could fall onto the door and the cooker would tip up and they'd have a serious problem. They don't want a new cooker. We suggested a table top oven with a hob because they wouldn't need to bend over at all and it's way cheaper than a cooker. They said they didn't want one because they are to small. We said you haven't seen it and if it's no good we can send it back. They weren't interested. 

They currently have a top up sim car and they often want 10 or or 15 but onto it which is costing a lot for them. We suggested a 5 30 day contract sim for them, they said they didn't want  A direct debit. It would be so much cheaper though. 

I just don't know what to do. They don't want any help and the other family member who seems to be able to have any influence her them doesn't seem to want to do anything and they know better. They didn't think they needed the stairlift, they don't think they need a cooker. 

This is just a few things. Everything we've tried to do for them has been like this and it's only because we've pushed that some of the things have happened and if they hadn't they'd have a real problem now.

For context, my girlfriend and I are moving into our junior year of highschool. We met online and our relationship has largely been long distance. We have had some instability, breaking up a few times for a few days to a week, only to get back together. This is my first real relationship. I love her to bits and she's easily my best friend. 

I had known something was up. About a week before I found out we had a fight after I asked if she had done anything with anyone else during the periods while we were broken up. She seemed genuinely hurt that I would even think that, she had been 100% candid with me this entire time, etc. I assumed she was being honest and apologized (admittedly, my asking of the question was out of jealousy although it didn't contain any malice).

We both had the fourth off, so we spent a few hours together watching videos on [Rabb.it](https://rabb.it). Everything felt fine until she attempted to copy and paste a link, accidentally pasting ""*i think my nipples are weird, can you tell me if they arent?*""

She initially tried to not acknowledge it, eventually saying how it wasn't her, going to how it had to have been someone else using her laptop, finally suggesting that it was her mom attempting to have an affair usinge her daughter's computer. All throughout were ""you have to believe me's"" and ""I swear on everything"", etc. I left not knowing what to do.

I asked one of her friends later in the day if she had been really flirty or if she thought my SO may have been up to something and she (as well as one of her friends whom she had been hanging out with at the time) immediately stated that my SO had seriously contemplated leaving me for [guy she frequently hangs out with], and that this was about two weeks ago. I took a second and called both my SO and the guy several times. Eventually my SO called back, denying everything until eventually admitting that she had cheated on me with people on Omegle. 

She states that she hadn't done anything else. She seems genuinely sorry, as though she genuinely wants me in her life.

I can't really trust that she's telling the truth, nor do I know how I can ever trust that she's telling the truth in the future. I'm moreso hurt than anything. I don't know what to do. Please help?

267,"At the end of 2017 a very big event happened in my life that caused me to become very depressed and anxious and then a month or two later another big thing happened and it made me even worse.

My best friend deals with clinical depression and has been dealing with it for a long time. I've always tried to help him with it and be understanding with him, even if it meant being tolerant with him for things I normally wouldn't tolerate (as I often worry if he will end up doing something to himself as a result of something I did or said to him, even though he tells me he doesn't think about doing anything to himself). He also is dealing with the dilemma of what to do about getting his high school diploma, as his depression and other various problems has come in the way of it. It stresses him out a lot and I try to help him as much as I can. 

These past few months has felt very one sided though. I feel like I am getting better mentally and I feel like the future can be good, but there are still things I am trying to figure out. There's something that happened between me an him recently and he was confused as to why I was acting the way I was about it. So, I told him why and I told him something that happened to me as a child that I haven't told many people and I told him how I think that event contributed to a lot of my awkwardness and uncomfortable behavior, especially in this situation. He seemed to understand and everything seemed like maybe it could be okay, but he keeps shutting me out as of lately. He expects that I try to help him sometimes and be a certain way for him, but he can't do the same for me at all. 

I try to tell him about my life and he just tells me he doesn't care and says things like he wishes I'd die, but also talk about how much he wants to die himself at the same time. If I try to help him he continues to act like I'm doing something terrible to him or something and he just refuses to stop saying things to me that I don't like him saying. 

I also don't really enjoy hanging out with him anymore because he just refuses to do anything I want to do and expects that I do everything that he wants to do (and really pushes for me to do it, but also he can't directly tell me what he wants to do and I have to find out what he means all of the time and he makes me feel stupid when I'm wrong about it. 

I want to reconnect with some old friends but I am afraid that he will be jealous and it's just going to make me really anxious and stressed out if he does become jealous because I'm just going to worry about him.

277,"Hello Reddit. I am seeking advice on how to proceed regarding parking dilemma I am currently having, that is driving me insane. 

I bought and moved into my house with my girlfriend 3 months ago. It is on the outskirts of a small city, so it is public street parking with many houses also having a one car garage (or at least room to park another vehicle somewhere off the street in the back of the house, by the alley).

This is a very residential owner-occupied street. Initially my girlfriend and I were parking both of our cars on our street, seeing as it is public parking. It did not take long to receive a “Would you mind if I parked in front of my own house someday?” note from a neighbor from a few houses down. I quickly realized, everyone parks 1 car directly in front of their own house and a second car, if applicable, on the side street or in the back by the alley. There is plenty of parking on the side street, so there isn’t really a shortage of parking close by. People just prefer parking directly in front of their own houses. 

My girlfriend and I followed suit and started parking 1 car in front of our house, and one in the back of the alley (previously, I didn’t realize we could fit a vehicle there). Everything was fantastic. 

UNTIL, 3 weeks ago, our direct neighbors started parking in front of our house routinely. They are a couple in early 30s, two people, no kids, 4 vehicles. We have chatted very minimally but they introduced themselves and seem like nice people who keep to themselves. They are parking one vehicle directly in front of their house, one directly in front of OUR house, and one directly across the street, and one in the back off the alley (0 on the side street). Since I get home later than them, I never can get the spot directly in front of my house and end up parking on the side street. 

I previously asked this neighbor if she has had issues with the parking situation just to get a feel from her, and she said she did receive a similar note as I did (from the more distant neighbor asking not to park in front of their house) and that her direct neighbor on the other side also politely requested they don’t park there if there is other parking available. She said other than that, no issues.

Despite her claims, EVERY other person on the street follows this unwritten rule and does not park in front of another person’s house, and in return, gets “their” spot saved. So, of the 9 house, we are the only one that has “our” spot directly in front taken by someone else routinely.

I wish this didn’t bother me, especially since there is plenty of parking on the side street, but it does. I feel like they know it’s annoying, and are just doing it because they think we are pushovers. Also, we have large windows in the living room that look right out onto the street at their car, so it’s a constant reminder. Then again, it technically is all public parking and I don’t want to be the controlling psycho neighbor, especially since we are new and don’t know them well and it seems we both plan to live here for a long time. And they are otherwise great (quiet) neighbors. I tried to approach this with them once and I chickened out. Any advice?

TLDR: My direct neighbors with more cars than people are parking directly in front of our house routinely, and no one else’s. Everyone else on the street follows the unwritten rule of “1 car in front of your own house, 1 on the side street”. They are nice otherwise and it is technically public parking, though we are the only house of 9 that has someone in “our” spot. Should I politely ask them to save me “my” spot, since it’s bugging the hell out of me? Or should I suck it up and park on the side street (my car *is* shittier) and let it go, since it is technically public? ",10Jul2018,1

280,"To cut a very long story short, I had a best friend who I lived with for over a year. He got me through a really shitty time in my life and I honestly wouldn’t be the person I am today without him. A lot happened over the course of the last year and things became a little strained as things developed but we still tried our best to support each other. When he moved out of our apartment a month before I did I was very upset because I had genuinely enjoyed my time there and we didn’t know when we would next see each other. He was pretty cold with me but at the time I saw it as his way of coping. 

However, In the two months since then I’ve had zero contact with him. He’s blanked all of my messages and we’ve gone from talking all day to not speaking at all. He’s just totally blinked off my radar and has ignored me entirely for close to two months.  I sent him a message about our final rent payment and even that was ignored. His friends say he “needs a break” from me and I will admit that that does hurt to hear but I’m trying to be mature about it and to understand what I did wrong and to move on. 

I know I sound so overdramatic but I feel like the friendship is over. I’ve been through a lot of other things in my life lately and I just feel like this has utterly broken me. I honestly feel as if I’m going through a “real” break up. I’ve been crying myself to sleep because I miss him so much and because he is clearly angry at me. I just don’t know where to go from here and I feel like I can’t move on properly. 

Does anyone have some advice for handling this situation? I really feel like I’m struggling without him and so I need some advice on how to move on from a person that once meant the world to you. ",10Jul2018,1

I’m going to try and keep this fairly brief as I’m still trying to process what I’ve just seen. My mum gave me her iPad so that I could look something up for her, and I noticed another tab open for some dating site. I really didn’t want to pry into her private affairs but I just couldn’t help it, so when she was out of the room I went on there to see what it was all about. Turns out it’s a dating site for married people. I didn’t look through her messages at all but her most recent one was received just this morning. Her activity is fairly sporadic, looking at the dates she’s mostly active when my dad is away (he works abroad).  
  
When I was younger I was always worried that my parents would get a divorce because they always argued a lot (and everyone else’s parents were splitting up haha). They still seemed happy though and I wrote it off as unnecessary worrying. I mean, just the other day my mum was talking about them going to NYC this October for their anniversary!

282,"Hey guys hope you’re all well!

For years now I’ve struggled to remember dates of things that will happen and generally am pretty poor at being able to visualise future dates and times.

The first major problem came last year when I got the date of my drivers test wrong in my head despite having printed email confirmation and almost missed it. 

Today I arrived for an interview that was for two weeks in the future - I know it’s best to be early but this was a bit extreme. 

I’ve tried writing things down and printing off confirmations, I tried keeping a diary but that didn’t help. Setting alarms in the morning with an explanation of what I’m doing on that day helps but can’t be done too far in advance very well. 

Have you guys got any ideas about something I could do to help myself be better at comprehending and remembering dates? Is this a common problem? It causes a lot of issues for me and my family/friends but no matter how many times I double check something I will somehow just forget and change it in my head.

283,"So I recently got a window AC Unit as my room on the second floor didn't have working air conditioning for years and every summer has been hell. 

I removed the bug screen and set up the AC Unit in the window, pulling out the side panels as well. It is secure. 

But recently I've had a problem where my cat, or more specifically, my mother's cat, keeps bursting through the side panels in the early morning around 6AM. 

This has been a daily occurrence and annoyance as it disrupts my sleep and potentially puts my stuff in danger. The cat has already knocked over my TV by the window onto me as I'm sleeping twice now, causing me to panic and nearly kick the shit out of my own TV. I'm also worried he could damage the AC Unit. 

My mother refuses to take my advice of simply not letting the cat outside at night. She keeps telling me ""it's an outdoor cat, it's in his nature"". I don't know what that even means, like nothing bad will happen to this cat if it stays inside. 

It's infuriating that she considers this stupid cat's nightly exercise more important than my sleep or making sure the AC Unit she just bought isn't wrecked by this cat. He's already wrecked the weather seal I stuffed between the side panels and the wall. 

So how do I deal with this? How do I make this cat stop waking me up at night. How can I make my mother understand? Is the only solution really as barbaric as drilling planks of wood in front of my window?

293,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this but I guess I need some kind of advice. Warning this is sort of long and there is no small description at the bottom :( 

Basically I live in a nice and quiet neighborhood where we don’t all personally know eachother but we know who we are you know? My problem is that out of no where this gangbanger has appeared in our neighborhood. I’m not he type of person to call the cops if I don’t see anything wrong and I haven’t seen him do anything wrong. All he does is ask people for money which I find disturbing and a threat. But let me tell you why. 

My first encounter with this guy was when I went to the gas station before work which is located right around the corner of my street. As soon as i step out the car I hear a man talking to me saying can i get a dollar. Nothing wrong with that but I just said no, I don’t belive in beggers that much. So he just said like thanks but sarcastically and like he was saying I hope god blesses you and some other remarks. I did notice that he followed me inside the store and didnt buy anything but I brushed it off. Nothing weird about that bc I usually tell myself I am never going to see these kind of people anyways. 

Then the next day I set up a pool for my little brother (2) as it is the summer and its hot. Then we also hear the icecream truck close so I got $2 so buy him something. That’s when I see the same guy from the gas station. He just comes up to me very up close and personal and says can I have a dollar. He doesn’t say why or anything he just says it. It’s not like he looks innocent or anything either he’s straight gang affiliated with tattoos, the way he dresses and wears a black hoodie even though its 90 degrees and his slang. So thats when I tell him I just have money for this icecream truck for my brother and he just like looked at me with this face like his eyebrows going down. He says “what you say!” In an aggresive tone and I am just like in my head I explained to him so I just tell him no and then he looks at me confused and for like 5 seconds he’s just looking at me trying to process what I just said. That’s when I had this feeling that he was under the influence of drugs. This is an assumption I am not sure. Then he walked away and started like talking to himself. After that I definitely didn’t feel safe with just my little brother knowing that he could try to do something stupid or something. 

Then today in the morning I was going to shower and the window is open and I hear like a loud voice saying “hello goodmorning” and I just knew it was him. He was across the street and he ran up to a guy that was on he phone, he looked pretty busy. So the gangbanger dude was like up close to him it made me a lil disturbed but he was like you have a dollar and the guy on the phone was like waving his hand like to go away and the guy just stood there for like a few seconds right next to him. Like the man is busy leave him alone. Then he left and was like talking to himself. 

Then my neighbor who is an old man, had like two granddaughters who are both below the age of 5. It looked like he was taking them to a pool or something and the guy quickly runs up to them and ask for money. He got up close and personal and my neighbor was like no but the guy didn’t leave and it looked like he was talking to him and saying something but he eventually left and my neighbor just looked back at him like “wtf is his problem” kind of face. It’s sad bc I was thinking like what if the guy did something to him and in front if his grandkids. But he just left. 

Do I have a reason to call the cops or am I just being paranoid? This guy just gave me weird vibes for some reason. I have a feeling like he’s going to do something stupid. I am usually not like this but I always see little kids on my street and I fear for their safety. Thanks for reading this, I know it was longer than expected. I will be editing to correct any mistakes bc I am just typing like off of my head. If this isn’t the right place for this, can someone please direct me to the right place. ",10Jul2018,2

297,"So I’m coming up on graduating college at the end of the year in city 1 (I’ll use numbers to make this easy to follow along). I’m from city 2 which is a long way away from city 1. First and foremost, I do not want to return home to city 1. I love my family and all but that just isn’t the place for me. City 2 isn’t a bad option but I definitely have my list of complaints about here as well. Ideally, I’d like to just start fresh at city 3. 

In my head, this all seems so simple. Finding work won’t be the hardest thing in the world. I go to a very reputable university, I’m a student athlete, and I’ve already been receiving job offers from companies. So I’m pretty confident I could find work in the city I’m looking to move to. And as long as I can afford it, I’d just figure everything else out along the way. 

But I know I’m being at least a little, if not very, naive about this. How much work really goes into just picking up and moving like that.

299,"I’m 19. I work in a sit down restaurant as a busser. Yesterday we got really busy, and I had been working hard all morning. I was keeping up with everything. 

I didn’t know this then, but I know now after talking to someone who used to work there, apparently one of my coworkers brings her 16 yr old son into work when he’s misbehaving at home. She brings him in so she and watch him, and she makes him work. 

I didn’t know this yesterday though. I didn’t know anything about him except that he was her son. So when this random kid showed up and started doing my job out of nowhere, it scared me, I thought that I couldn’t do my job right, and that he was there to replace me. Nobody bothered to tell me what was going on. 

I’ve been previously frustrated with this particular shift over something else. A lot of the time I work my butt off and the servers don’t tip me out fairly. There’s no law that dictates how much they have to tip me out here, it’s set by the employer, and he has it set so each server has to give me 8 dollars minimum each time I bus. If I bus with two servers for five hours that’s $16 minimum they can give me. My base wage is $5/h. 16/5 = 3.20, that’s not even up past minimum wage, which isn’t a problem because of course my boss has to make it up to minimum wage if my average ever falls below that. On average I make over minimum wage when busing anyways. However I think it’s unfair when they tip me out 10 dollars each, when I’ve worked so hard, doing everything /except/ taking food to the tables. If I don’t keep up with everything, a lot of the time, they will ask me to do it. I don’t want to work that hard so they can make $15 dollars an hour, whist I’m only make 9.80 / 10 before taxes max. Like why should I? They can step up and do some more of the work. 

Anyways back the the original situation. So kid comes in starts doing my job, nobody tells me anything about why. I get tipped out $22 for a five hour shift when almost every table has been leaving 5 or 6 dollar tips and we’ve been busy all morning. 

Okay fine whatever. Then you’re gonna have someone else come in and start doing my job that I’m getting paid for??? Why??? 

I don’t /need/ help to get my job done. 

So while I’m cleaning off a table, holding the dishes and wiping it at the same time, kid comes over and says, “I can take that plate for you.” 

And I reply, “Thank you, but I’m fine.” Maybe a little monotonous, but there really isn’t time to talk, and I’m getting paid to be here. 

So this kid must run over to his mom to tell her I wouldn’t let him talk the plate?? And she says, “(My name), I brought him here to help.” 

I ignore her and keep doing my job. 

I don’t want any help. 

I’m getting paid to be here and do this job. 

I’m going to do it? 

Okay? 

Somewhere in the middle of this I got frustrated to the point that I was holding tears back, which made the whites of my eyes beet red. (This actually looks somewhat lovely, because my irises are green, and the contrast makes them pop.) 

Frustrated to the point of having to go into the bathroom and shed a few tears. 

Frustrated to the point I have to go outside for five minutes to chain smoke two cigarettes 20 minutes before my shift ends, because if I don’t I will seriously start sobbing the next time someone talks to me. 

5 minutes later the nicotine has done its trick. 

I go back in and finish up. Do 3/5 of the things I’m supposed to do before I leave, and then wow, it’s 2pm, guess it’s time for me to go home. 

Say, “Have a great day guys!” And leave 

The coworker/mom of the random kid who came in says,

“Bye (my name)!” 

Honestly this woman is so immature. 

I’m so frustrated I text my boss and ask him to take me off of this shift.


So I guess I didn’t technically cry at work, but my red asf eyes probably made it obvious I wanted to. 

Now I have to go into work again in about 2 &amp; 1/2 hours and I don’t know how to face my co workers or tell my boss if he asks about why I want the shift changed. There’s probably only about 15 (at the most) employees at this place. And every one of them knows this ladies son. I need this job but so help meeeeeeee.


I probably could’ve just asked what the kid was doing there and why, but I was too busy feeling like I was doing something wrong and that I was inferior at my job. Anxiety is great. 

Yesterday was a bad day. Sorry for the rant. 

So has anyone ever gone through something similar? How did you resolve it? On a scale from one to ten how badly did I handle this situation? How could I do better? Any general advice? How am I supposed to face my coworkers now?

This is really kind of a weird thing to explain but basically I think I don't have any motivation at all anymore. I have *goals* but no *motivation*. I can dream up all the things in the world that I want to do but I have no initiative to actually go do things because I'm so scared that I'll fail and waste my time in the end.

Then when I was in college I got hit with this wave of depression which just sort of made me want to not get out of bed, not go to class, etc. and that depression never lifted. It's been years now. I ended up taking a leave of absence and then dropping out altogether. Now I am back at home with my parents at age 20 and I really just couldn't be bothered to get out of bed most days. I think a lot about killing myself too. My parents don't believe in therapy or medication and refuse to let me go see anyone for my mental health issues while I'm under their roof; they say that all a therapist is going to do is prescribe me a pill to ""make me more crazy"" (I know that this isn't true and when I was at college I had decent results going to therapy on my own, not on their insurance -- but it's their house that I'm confined to now, so their rules).

Again,  cuz i was too scared and afraid. And the older i have been  getting, the  more lies i been making up. Because i didn't want to look  different  compared to the rest of group. I felt and feel like im not  worth to be  connected with anyone. And now looking back to myself, i  really do hate  myself. Because there is no turning back now. Everyone  know fake me, a  liar. I do really hate myself, my cowardice. Lie on  lie. I know that i  didn't use lie to hurt anyone, but what i have done  is even worse i  think. That's probably something i should carry on my  shoulders  throughout whole my life and keep lying, because i don't know  what to  do.  ",10Jul2018,2

307,"About 7 years ago, my brother noticed a cat who had just had some kittens underneath where he worked. I think he fed the mother and kinda looked out for her for a while and then one day he went to go check on her and she had left with all of her kittens except one little black and white kitten. My brother took in this kitten and he's been with us ever since. I guess he'll be turning 7 this September.

At the time, we only had one other cat and she was a few years old and was staying at my parent's house a few counties away. Blue met her a few times but he's never liked her. He was quite a feisty cat growing up until we had him neutered and then he calmed down a lot. But he still had this distaste for the other cat.

I spent a lot of time training Blue and working with him. Through this, he and I developed a bond greater than with my brother. Blue follows me and seems to look up to me as his owner or whatever.

Over time, my brother began taking in other strays. He took in a small dog a few years ago and Blue never got used to her. She's slightly bigger than Blue and he runs or he will try to not make contact with her. She tries to lick him and play with him and he just sits there and doesn't seem to want to do anything with her. My brother also took in two other cats, both female, one was probably older than a year and the other was younger than a year. Blue immediately hated both of them and would growl and hiss at them. They would fight in the hallway and my brother ended up getting rid of the older female cat because she just didn't seem to like being with us. The younger one has been with us still but Blue hates her and hisses and growls at her as well and she does the same to him. That female cat also doesn't seem to like me either and I don't care much for her. She growls and hisses at me when I walk around her but then other times she wants to be around me.

I had also gotten a big dog about 2 and a half years ago. He'll be 3 this Fall. I got him as a puppy and he was only slightly bigger than Blue was when he first came. He's always been playful and wanted to play with Blue but Blue never wanted to play with him. I developed a bond with that dog as well and he's now almost as big as I am when he stands up on his hind legs.

I think Blue is afraid of him because of his size even though he is friendly.

Blue doesn't get aggressive with him, and I tend to think it's because he knows that I care for that dog as well. Blue will tap my dog on the nose if my dog gets too close (just sniffing) and usually only when it goes on for too long, but you can tell he doesn't like him.

I tend to think a lot of this is from Blue being jealous of the other animals in the house. I don't want him to feel that way with the other animals and I've tried getting him used to everyone else but it doesn't seem to work. I've tried petting him and other animals at the same time and made them look at each other while I do it. I've tried giving them both treats at the same time and scolding any of them when they try to steal from the other. Nothing seems to be working to help Blue get along better with the other animals but I haven't given up and I'd like some suggestions if anyone has any.",10Jul2018,1
308,"A few months ago, I saw a claim against me on my Equifax report. It was from an old medical bill, in the amount of $132. I asked for proof of debt, to which they send me a piece of paper basically admitting my insurance already paid this debt. 

I called Equifax to dispute the claim. They removed it. I thought it was handled, until I checked my credit score and saw the same charge, form the same collection agency back again under Equifax.

Now, I'm most likely going to get a federal work-study job from school when the Fall semester starts and I want to quit this place. The thing is that I told the boss that I wouldn't treat this as a seasonal job and also I signed an agreement that if I leave before 3 months I would have to reimburse the boss around $130 for a background check. So, I would have to work through September to make it past 3 months. But I don't mind since it was part of the agreement.

My cousin has always had trouble in school. His elementary school brought this to his parents attention when he was in 5th or 6th grade. I am not by any means a doctor/psychologist, but he also exhibits many behaviors of Aspergers from what I have read about it. He is severely disorganized and his handwriting is unreadable. I'm not sure if handwriting has anything to do with any of this. 

His parents have been neglectful regarding this. Any attempts we made to help him when he was a minor, were shut down by his father. His father dislikes my family. For example, my uncle was helping to keep him more organized a couple of years back (middle school or early high school). His father shut that down when he found out.

My cousin is now 18 and I worry for his future. I want him to be successful, but he may be limited if he has Aspergers or a learning disability.

So heres an old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend\_20m\_cheating\_anybody\_know\_polish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend_20m_cheating_anybody_know_polish/)

of me asking if anyone could help me out translating my boyfriends messages because i thought he might be cheating. and just... wow... I checked on the post the next day and it had 2 responses, so I just left it alone after that not checking again until now (1 week later). I want to thank  [raygarraty47](https://www.reddit.com/user/raygarraty47) and  [Morex\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Morex_) especially for putting in all that work translating everything, thank you so much!

The update:

Not knowing the whole translation yet, and only going by the ""I love you"" message he send her, I waited for him to wake up from his alarm clock at 7, not having slept all night, and told him to tell me everything. Well he didn't lie, he told me he was in love with this female friend of his, and that he told her last night, but she didn't like him back, she liked his friend (who in turn didn't like her). I asked him if he still loved me, and he said no. So that evening when meeting him after a busy day and thinking about it, I broke things off. It was incredibly painful and I pretty much died from sadness, after some talking he started crying as well, and told me he did still love me, he was just trying to suppress it because I had been homesick for my country and talked a lot about going back and he couldn't bear losing me.  But he was right, I did wanna go back, so despite that we stayed broken up. 4 days ago I moved out of his apartment into a little empty dorm room a super sweet girl is lending me now that she's home for the summer. And my mom will picking me up next Sunday to take the long drive back home.

Reading the translated messages now, it's odd, but comforting. There's nothing new in there he was still hiding from me, except just how in love he is with this girl, I'm pretty sure she was supposed to be some sort of ""replacement"" for when I would leave, he either denies this, or doesn't realize where his own feelings come from. We're parting on good terms, although it still hurts a lot. I understand you cannot control what you feel (although I'm concerned that If she would've liked him, he might've started full blown cheating. But there's no use worrying about that now). And I also understand I shouldn't have told him of my plans to leave without actually going through with it, leaving him in that uncertainty. 

So that's where I am, heartbroken and lonely until the moment my mom picks me up, when I will just be heartbroken. But also with this whole issue behind me, and a new life ahead in the country I love with my family and friends.

337,"Me and my GF have been together for 9 months now. Things have not been perfect since the start of 2018, however I think we're showing lots of strong signs of a long lasting relationship, we're always able to come through any argument.

This is the longest relationship we've both ever had, and so I think we're struggling to come to terms with the Honeymoon period no longer being a thing. I'm getting used to her not being overly happy to see me all the time, simply because we're used to each other and no longer feel the need to express it as much, that doesn't mean we're not happy to see each other however.

My GF has been clinically diagnosed with depression since she was about 15. She has BPD, has attempted suicide, etc. She promises me she's better and she certainly seemed it for the first 6 months. The past few months have been awful however. She's happy with me, I know it, but she's really depressed. She cries every time she's with me about little things, that just aren't worth the time of effort. I try my best to comfort her, but I've had 3 months of her crying every time we're together, it's becoming so hard for me to deal with - I'm normally quite emotionally strong but she's beginning to drain me.

She's promised that it isn't me making her cry, rather how she feels deep down about herself and her life. She's just finished College. All her friends are starting university in far away places. Her family is a bit of a mess, though I get on really well with her Dad. She feels fat (She most certainly is not). She's put on a little bit of weight recently, but she's still beautiful to me :). 

I've pledged to start the Gym with her. To eat healthy with her. To help her though everything. But she will never do anything without me encouraging her. I've promised her that starting a healthy and motivated lifestyle will make her happier, but she just doesn't believe it herself. 

Basically, she cries all the time when she's with me cause she trusts me with her emotions. She is really, really sensitive. I love her lots. Her crying is starting to become a tad Over The Top and a little bit draining. I've told her it needs to calm down a bit, I'll always be there for her when she actually NEEDS it, but a lot of the times at the moment, she cries over little things.

I'm not sure what to do from here. We've taken a 3 day break in the hopes that it'll allow us to calm down and appreciate each other a bit. 

TL;DR: GF cries over trivial and small things and it is becoming a little too much for me to deal with. She is very sensitive, which is fine when she is crying over something reasonable, but she cries around me every time we're together because I'm the only one she can express herself to.

341,"Recently I went to a party with a group of friends. The thing is that I don’t meet with a half of the group that often.(and I don’t bother that much tbh) Since we graduated high school we all took separate ways. My guy friends from childhood and I keep relatively together. But I now have new friends from college.
The thing is that in the party, one of my high school friends from the half which I don’t hang out that often(a girl that was my middle school crush, she rejected me and I moved on) started telling as well as her boyfriend that I shouldn’t try to be someone that I’m not.
Let me put you in context. I’m a hairstyle enthusiast. I was born with very curly and coarse hair. But through years of experience, lots of videos in YouTube and trial and error I have managed to have much more better looking hair (imo).
I couldn’t be more upset when she and her boyfriend told me that I shouldn’t be doing this. That I should just embrace the type of hair god gave. The tone that they used was so condescending. They wanted to let me know that I’m not that good looking, and that they are.
I never asked for her opinion, nor for the opinion of her boyfriend. I was thinking to let my hair grow out before she told me that. But now I’m sure I’m doing that. I’ll do it as a reminder for myself l. No one will ever put me down. I don’t know why that specific friend always tries to make me feel as if I’m just an ugly MF.
The first time she did that was when I decided to get braces. She kept saying that I didn’t need them. And now I look much more handsome after braces. I’m starting to think that she doesn’t want me to get better looking.
I have never asked for approval in regards to my physical appearance. But this sort of things get to me.
I’m thinking to make a drastic makeover. Let my hair grow out, buy minoxidil to get some facial hair, and go to the gym. The reason being that it would be nice to not see that specific friend for a year and then meet her randomly just to see her face and knowing that if she dares to say anything more about my looks she is just trying to make herself feel better by putting me down. Should I though?

342,"My situation: 
I’m 16 and about to be a junior in high school. My grades have been decent throughout my high school career, and I’m currently at a pretty nice STEM school. However, I’ve recently been worrying that my grades are not good enough to land me a scholarship at any of the schools I am striving for. I do not want to rely on my parents for money because we are currently in the process of buying our first house, I also have a younger brother that may also need that money in the future. And I do not want to get any loans because I do not want to accumulate any debt. 

My question:
Should I join the military to pay for my education, if so what branch would offer me the most choices in terms of future career paths, if not what other alternatives would I have?",10Jul2018,1
343,"Okay, so to cut a long story short. I found out that my roommate has been stealing rent from us. What i mean by that is that he has been over charging us. Our base rent plus utilities is about 3,200 a month. He has been collecting 3900 from us. Which means that he's taken at minimum 3,600 and at max 3,900. I am 99% sure that he has been taken money, and the reason i'm not saying 100% is because i still want to be wrong. 

I’ve always known that something was shady but I just had to much going on to even care. I found out because recently he’s been super greedy asking me to split furniture with him that I’m 99% sure he got for free. I asked for receipts or at least an email correspondence or text message about the furniture he got off of Craigslist. He didn’t have any. Then on top of that for March-June I would pay 1,000 plus utilities. And in July-August I would pay 500$ a month plus utilities. So I told him let me just pay 1,000 plus utilities for July and not pay rent in August to make it easier on them. Somehow that got lost in translation and his Bitch ass tried to get me to agree to paying 1,000 plus utilities this month and then pro-rate next month. Essentially me having to pay 400-500 more than we originally agreed to. Plus he wanted 350 for furniture that I thought was free on top of that I know he charges the guy with the smallest room 1,500 a month lmao. Which means that our base rent is 2,980 plus 175 parking plus utilities we average about 3,200 in rent per month. So I pay about 1200 a month the other guy pays 1500 a month and the third guy pays 1200 a month also. That’s 3900. About 600-900 a month is being pocketed by him. I’m not entirely sure how much exactly cause I haven’t asked the other guys what they speicially paid the first two months of our lease. Anyway I finally put it all together when I decided to go onto our rent-pay portal and I saw that 493$ wasn’t paid lmao. Which means that I paid 1200 the other roommate paid 1200 and the roommate that pays 1500 directly to the thief he only sent in about 600$ for that. Which means he pocketed 900$ of his dollars and he got so Greedy that he didn’t even care to make sure all rent is paid so that no one would be the wiser. I’ve always had a gut feeling but I just didn’t have the emotional energy to check it out, but his being greedy and trying to make me or the other guy cover the 493$ really pissed me off. I have so much evidence it’s so shitty.

My problem now is do i tell the other two roommates about it or confront it myself. If i confront him myself I'm going to give him the option to fess up and fix it, by lowering their rent and paying the difference that he stole and no one has to worry about having a toxic ass living environment. The problem with this is that I'm withholding it from the other roommates and not giving them a chance to react. I could also tell them and create a very toxic living situation and then mediate it, since i'm remarkably calm. Anyway do I tell them and we fix it together but it creates a horrible living situation. Or do i fix it myself, so the problem gets taken care of and they are repaid without knowing and it keeps the peace till the end of the lease. 

I also work at a law firm so i don't need any legal advice I already know the law and legality of this. I just need advice on whether or not to solve it myself and keep the peace or to potentially make a very toxic living living environment.

My iPhone was in a sealed bag but when I pulled it out after like 4 throws to see the footage, there was some moisture inside the bag. I didn’t freak out since I knew that couldn’t kill it but when I went to see the footage, the screen was turning a light blue and I came to the conclusion that it was getting destroyed. I tried to shake out the water and some came out but I’m sure that made it worse.
I biked back home and when I arrived home, the iPhone was dead. I couldn’t turn it on. I have an old iPod or something so if I want to do this again, I’ll use that.

348,"I am currently in an all boys highschool in my last year, and I'm on the last week of my holiday. 

At school I am very familiar with my year level, but spend most my time with a smaller group. However, throughout this year I realised that these friendships are just superficial, and some people are only using me to do well in school. 

I only started really studying this year (so I am not that smart), and generally I make myself appear outgoing and humourous to others. But it's obvious in reality, I am lonely. 

I still don't understand. I always try to host events, make them laugh often, and try to act like a good friend. And in the end, I am rejected and left alone. My friends constantly bailing on planned events, or just ""can't be bothered"" going. And sometimes I am not even invited to their outings. 

Other than that, I feel like I am not compatible with anyone. I feel like I am brushed to the side until someone wants to use me. And, I feel like if I don't act as a specific character I won't be interesting at all. 

I used to enjoy games such as LOL and CSGO with my friends, but they either quit or play with other people. I now play alone just to pass the time, even though I don't have fun and could be doing something more productive like studying. 

I have been longing to attend a university and meet new people, but as for the moment, I feel empty due to the absence of any intimate friendship. 

I would really appreciate advice, and I am willing to give more context if required.

351,"TaskRabbit was one of the few companies I worked for that I thrived in. As an independent contractor I set my own hours, my own rates, and made a steady income through a virtuous cycle of good reviews and getting hired more because of good reviews. But 3 months ago TaskRabbit was hacked because the company got lazy and had subpar password security parameters in place. They shut down the site for over 48 hours, leaving workers and clients abandoned. They later sent out a legal document stating all our private information was jeopardized including social security number, bank account info, name, and possibly more. But because TaskRabbit is a relatively small company this barely made any news, and the news articles about it didn’t cover how incredible of a thing this was. 

TaskRabbit then shut off phone support claiming they needed the time to fix a backlog of requests due to this hack. 3 months later and phone support is still down. Yet every time I emailed them asking them how they could justify this, they gave me a “I’m sorry you feel that way” reply, which is a non-apology apology and a slap in my face. TaskRabbit’s business model is that they are a middleman and connect me with prospective clients, and in return they take 15% of my hourly rate. Well the fact that they allowed a simple password hack to happen, then left everyone abandoned for 48 hours, then shut off phone support and continue to have phone support off 3 months later, it was too much for me. I kept calling them out to their faces every single day, until they realized I would not stop holding them accountable, so they deactivated my profile. At this point in time I had qualified as one of the top 10% of workers too.

It sucks. I had 500 positive reviews because I am good at what I do. I’d help people move in, host events, and do other random things, all with utmost care and quality. I thrived with the clients. But ultimately it felt unfair that TaskRabbit was taking 15% of my hourly income and they weren’t holding up their end of the deal, including not letting hacks and outages to the website take place, as well as maintaining worker and client customer support. Like if they don’t even have phone support and they don’t code their website properly, what exactly is that 15% of my hourly wage even going to pay for.

So now I feel stuck. It’s the only work I thrive in because my personality type is not fit for a 9 to 5 job. But I feel like I’m signing a deal with a devil and getting into an abusive relationship where I let them take advantage of my talent simply because they’re the only player in town.",10Jul2018,1

354,"My youngest brother is 16 and becomes very noticeably upset whenever his father reaches out to him. For context, my mother and step-dad split five years ago. He was not a good man by any means, he was very physically and mentally abusive towards me and my younger autistic brother (we are not his biological sons), but was a relatively okay person to my youngest and my sister (who are his biological children). Even so, I was mainly the one who always looked after and cared for my siblings. I’ve always been the go to person for them if they need anything, and am now the de facto father figure, as about 2-3 years after the split my step-dad stopped reaching out/visiting. He’s become a deadbeat, and magically happens to lose his job whenever child support catches up to him, with contact being sporadic between him and the kids. If he reaches out at all, he almost exclusively will reach out to my sister who is only 11 and doesn’t fully understand what really happened regarding the split. However this past weekend he decided he wanted to talk to my brother as well. Afterwards he was very noticeably upset, and my mom remarked he should just do what I did regarding my own father (left when I was 4, would reach out every few years when he got the urge to be a dad again, became extremely angry and resentful at 15 and told him to stop reaching out). 

I’m very close to all my siblings, so sitting down to talk with him is no real issue. I just don’t have a clue as to how to go about it or what to tell him. I’m very heavily biased against his dad for obvious reasons, however despite his flaws he at least tried to be a good father to his own kids. He had his dad in his life for a little over a decade, I never really had mine nor do I even have any real good memories of him if at all. I also have some self esteem and repressed anger issues that came about with life under stepdad that I’m really trying to work on, but I feel like any decision I take regarding this will be clouded with the anger and hate I feel towards him. I just want to know that what I feel and tell my brother in case he decides to cut contact with his father is rational and justified, and how do I approach him regarding this? What should I tell him if he still wants his dad in his life? ",10Jul2018,1
355,"Hello all. I’m posting this today because I am in desperate need of advice and direction, and I have no one to talk to about it. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible, and I’m sorry if it’s too long. This is years of my problems rolled into one post, that I’ve finally convinced myself to make. I’ll write a TL;DR summary, but if you could find the time to read the whole post, I would be so grateful. I desperately need help.                      

TL;DR: To summarize, I feel that I have these insurmountable problems that are keeping me from being successful or even leading a happy life. I don’t know how to deal with them or if I even can. One of those problems is chronic laziness/procrastination that affects my education, safety, health, and job. The other is an inability to focus on what’s important (or on anything at all), no matter what it is, which I feel is holding me back from accomplishing what I want to in life. There’s a bunch of smaller issues piled on top of that but those are the main points.                           

I don’t know if I’m stupid, lazy, or if there is something actually wrong with me. I hope it’s the latter but I may really just be an idiot.                          

I have an issue where I just can’t get myself to do things that are important. I’ve been like this as long as I can remember, all the way back to elementary school when I wouldn’t do homework. The best way I can describe it is a feeling of almost dread, like fear but not really, when I even think about doing something I need to do. Through high school, I barely scraped by. I actually almost didn’t graduate, and the extra classes I took online to supply those credits I still put off until literally the last week, and I still did the least possible work on them. I can force myself to do things sometimes, but it’s only in a short burst.                            

This just sounds like laziness to me, but it’s very concerning because I have the same tendency in every aspect of my life, to the point where it can be dangerous.                          

\- My car needs new brakes or new axles that can snap at any moment? I put it off so long, despite how dangerous that is.                           

\- I need to see a doctor over some symptom that could be dangerous? I either never do or wait such a long time.                               

\- At work, a project is due by a deadline? I procrastinate on it until literally the last day to get it done.                                   

So you see that this stupidity of mine not only hurts my education, but also my health and my livelihood.                            

It’s so bad that I was never able to decide on a major in college to stick with. I bounced between several. I ended up having to retake Math 95 and 96, which is basic high school level, and I barely passed with the lowest letter grade because I just couldn’t concentrate and learn the concepts. The last semester I was still in college, at one point I just couldn’t handle it anymore and stopped going about 80&amp;#37; through the semester. I don’t even know why I did it. All I was taking was English classes at the time which have always come naturally to me, I just didn’t want to do the work and I stopped going.                              

This leads me into my other issue, where I’m worried that I may actually be stupid. I don’t feel “stupid”. If I had to put it to words, I actually think that I’m “smart” at least partially. I want to study science, astronomy, chemistry, physics, engineering, all of that is so fascinating to me. I also want to study literature, art, and film. I want to do great things with my life, and I feel like I could. But I just squander every opportunity. I don’t even like to think about the long list of opportunities I’ve wasted, it’s painful to me.                           

Going back to the Math 95 and 96 class. I just could not bring myself to concentrate. Sitting in class, I would find myself focusing on the noises coming from outside, or thinking about something else. Of course, this was even worse in Chemistry, Physics, and more advanced math classes that I took. I just can’t seem to focus on it. Even in English sometimes, when I try to keep rapt attention because it’s a subject that fascinates me, I realize I wasn’t even listening and have no idea what the last four sentences were the professor said.                              

I cope with this at work by writing down all the instructions my boss has for my projects, as he says them. Otherwise the same thing happens, and I’ll only hear half of what he says. I think this also feeds into my other issue, because incomplete information makes me procrastinate even more. Handwriting notes in class helped, but it wasn’t enough.                                 

All of this terrifies me. I wanted to accomplish great things in life. At this point, I just want to accomplish *something.* I’ve been working the same stupid internship for like 4 years, it was supposed to lead to great things and it was so excited to already have a job in “the field”. However I just feel like I’m stagnating. I hate being at home because, although I love them, my family can be unbearable at times with an inundation of religion and politics. All of the projects I want to do in my own time I put to the side, with the same procrastination as everything else. I hate my tiny room, it feels like a cage with no air conditioning and a cockroach infestation, but I can’t move out without money, and that means actually being successful at something. Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality. I want to get married and start a family with my girlfriend in a few years, and be a great provider and father to my future kids, but I just see myself being a complete loser at this rate. I’m scared that I’m becoming too cynical and jaded, losing all that hope and drive that I accumulated over the years. I also feel like an incredibly selfish asshole. I have so many opportunities placed in front of me, I live in a first world country, I have a roof over my head, a car, enough food to eat, etc. And yet I squander it all. I hope to redeem my selfishness by actually accomplishing something.                                  

I don’t think I would ever actually do it, unless my entire family and girlfriend somehow were gone, but I have suicidal ideations all the time. I think if I could change how I am, actually accomplish my goals, and maybe even a few of my dreams, I would be happy. As it is right now I’m only ever happy when I’m with my girlfriend, and this is fleeting and disappears as soon as I go home. I don’t think this is healthy, for me, her, or our relationship.                        

That’s basically it, I could go on about whatever other crap I have but I’ve wasted enough of your time, if anyone actually reads this. If you do, I am so grateful. Thank you for any and all advice you could give me about what to do, how to change myself, or how to live with the realization that I’ll never be smart and that I need to aim so much lower.

Is there any amount of time that my residual record will fall off? or will I have to file for some expungement? I'm really just wondering if this is permanent or not.",10Jul2018,1
363,"So I'm looking for a second job and finally found one that has a schedule that works perfectly with my current one.

But... Their rating from previous employees is less than awesome on Indeed. Some of them read like they're from the same person (similar writing styles) but they have like 15+ upvotes. Management does respond to one review stating that the situation they mentioned (a coworker using racial slurs) was handled and the person was terminated, but they don't respond to the rest. There aren't any reviews from this year, whereas there's about 5 negative from last and 2 positive (that are downvoted) and 1 negative from 2016.

I have an interview with this place on Thursday. Is it unprofessional if I ask about the reviews? I really only need a second job for about 5-6 months and then after that it'll be convenient pocket money, so it's not like I will be stuck there long if it is terrible. Should I just keep the reviews in mind but not mention them?",10Jul2018,1

365,"Okay, so this is my first time posting on reddit. But I desperately need advice. 

I currently live on a military base, in a townhome of sorts, and the neighbors who share the building with me, are just horrible. 

They have 2 pets, neither of which they take care of properly, they barely feed their dog due to ""not enough money"", but yet they keep trying to get a loan to buy another dog?!? They never take this poor thing out, because its very underweight and very noticable, and they know it. So they avoid questions and comments by just leaving it in the house. Which also includes letting it go to the bathroom in the house, and NOT CLEANING IT UP! (This is the main issue I need help with, more on that in a minute) 

They are extremely self centered and rude. they invite themselves over when we are having parties or get togethers, and we are all too nice to say anything. 

On top of being nice, there is a two pet maximum in the military housing, and I do have 3pet, I know, and this doesnt make it better, but most families on this base also have 3-4 pets so I dont feel horrible about it. BUT it does make it hard for me to be able to report them to the housing company due to fear of retaliation. I've always been of the ""keep the peace"" type mentality. 

They have admitted to me that they don't wash their laundry due to no money for a laundromat, and no washer/dryer at their house. I offered to let them borrow mine when we first met but they never took me up on it. So they live in dirty laundry, unclean living environment, and I don't think they bathe either. None of this is really my buisness, so I've always figured if they want to live in squalor let them. 

I have reported their dog to animal control and to housing prior, but she uses excuses about ""the dog is sick right now so shes been throwing up a lot and cant keep it down"" and wont let them into her house due to ""mental illness"" (self--diagnosed, though I really do think she needs help.) So nothing ends up being done. Every animal expert (vet, shelters, trainers) all agree that this dog is being neglected, and think its ridiculous animal control wont help. She does claim to love the dog, but all I can hear through the wall is her screaming at the poor thing, she slammed its head into a dog gate once, and it was the dog's fault?!? 

The final straw though, is in my bedroom I have a window near the wall that I share with them, and I leave it cracked for my cat to lounge on its cat perch/furniture thing, and enjoy the air. Today as I was trying to take a nap, (I'm on pain medication that makes me drowsy) all I could smell was their house! It smells like death, literally. I shut my window after gagging, and then laid back down. I could still smell it. My husband came in and we searched for how it was getting in....It seems to be coming in through the bathroom vent which is in the shared wall connecting our bathrooms or something. I'm not sure how it works. 

Like I said, its their buisness if they want to live like that, but its starting to intrude into my home and its gotten a bit ridiculous. I have reported them to housing but they dont seem to do much. My husband thinks I'm overreacting, but its encroaching into my life, and I cant take it anymore. Plus, they are trying to have a baby, and again, none of my buisness, but I can't stand the thought of a child being brought up in that situation. 

I guess i'm looking for advice, should I keep trying my best to ignore them, and just drown my house in air fresheners, or is there someone I can call? Housing doesnt seem to want to do much, especially since she won't let them into her house. (apparently she had the same issue at her last base, it was reported and they gave her a week to clean. I've heard her complain about how unfair that was of that housing company multiple times).",10Jul2018,1

368,"So this morning I received a phone call for a job I applied to online (El Super). I was informed that I had an interview the same day at 1:00, I was pretty excited especially because this is my first interview out of highschool. So I went there and when I arrived I was brought into a room with a man and woman I sat down. It was pretty normal until he asked what position I applied for, which was for produce, in which he looked unsure. He then talked to the woman that produce was full and if I was worth to put in there even though I was right in front of them. It felt very unprofessional. After that I was asked if I had any experience with cashiering even though they had already seen my resume that I had no experience. What made me even more unsure was that he told me that they do minimum wage ($11.00) for 7 days a week full time and specifically told me not to to even think about asking for holidays off with an attitude. Him and the woman continued to talk about if they could fit me into produce because ""people always leave"". 
All this happened in about 5 mins. As I walked outside I was very hesitant about the job I applied for I was more willing to work for McDonalds at that point. 

Am I overacting? Should I be worried. And most importantly if get a phonecall telling me I'm hired should I even go? If I don't want the job anymore is it bad to not attend work, will it go on my record?

I take him to a doggy daycare where he gets to play with other dogs for the day a couple times a week and he doesn’t mind the people who work there. He loves playing with other dogs but it’s only when random people/strangers are near him when he runs and hides. It’s been happening since he was a puppy, he was a rescue so we think it may be that he was abused at some point in his life.  Is there any other reason he is like this or anything I could do to get him to not be so scared?

376,"So in 2012 I finished my undergraduate in International Relations with a double Minor in French and Social Work (I never advanced to finish my double majors, cause I got into grad school). I chose it because it fit my multi-cultural background.  Until I finished, my main focus had been sports (I was a D1 wrestler), so I never really thought about what I'd do after college.  


After wrestling, I kinda fell in love with travel, and worked at my university's international exchange program. I worked with French students traveling to my school, showed them my hometown, and then studied abroad in France and my french friends showed me their hometown, it was dope. That was about as professionally experienced as I had become in regards to what I wanted to do after college. All my teammates went into sales and made beaucoup $$$... but I thought I was too intellectual for that shit. Stupid me, right?  


My dad suggested I take the GRE and helped me apply to grad schools. I got into all of them -- American University, George Washington, and Maryland. I ended up going to George Washington for the Global Communications master's degree. Great school, top 5 in the country for International Relations.   


I thought I was gonna be a reporter or something, like a talking head on Al Jazeera. I had no clue what I was getting into, but fuck it -- I had no other plan, and my would parents pay for my Grad School if I went. I'm an only child so they've been saving for this all my life, and it would help get me ahead so I did it. I ended up finishing with like a 3.75 GPA.  


This program had no thesis, but had a language requirement instead. I tested out of it because I speak fluent French, and pretty decent Farsi and Spanish as well. I learned NOTHING about journalism, video or graphic editing, professional writing, or anything. No hard skills. Everyone I worked with was very career-focused, was trying to work for the government, and just generally kind of... straight and narrow and not weird (like me) at all. It was boring for me.  


My concentration was International Development so I took like 75&amp;#37; International Development theory courses, and 25&amp;#37; Communications/Public Diplomacy theory courses. A ton of fucking theory. I could talk to you cynically about why international development is bullshit and give you case studies on Rwanda and Grameen Bank for ages, or about whatever theoretical stuff I learned like, 4 years ago. None of it really applies in real life, though.  


I also did like, 3 professional internships that were all research and communications, so I got a decent grip on copywriting and social media management. Any fresh-out-of-college keyboard monkey can do that for free though, and it's all about developing subject matter expertise, and at this point I'm kind of a generalist and past the entry-level positions (though I'll take them, fuck it, I'm broke).  


After I finished, I worked at a USAID contractor for about a year. After they sucked all the work out of me that they could at the low low price of 40k a year (not much in DC), and we finished the comms stage of our project, I was laid off. I kind of hated the place and the work and the monotonous nature of it anyways.  


It was summer 2016, so I went back to my original love -- traveling. I worked for an international service learning company for a summer as a communications guy in Thailand, and then I worked for them again the following summer in Costa Rica leading high school kids on programs. In between I helped a research project in Kenya, and volunteered as a translator for refugees in Greece. Traveled to tons of sweet places. Learned pretty good Spanish.  


Side note, I've been a wrestling coach and music tutor my whole life. I love teaching people things and breaking down things I'm knowledgable about.  


All of those things were great, but now I'm like ""wtf do I do with my life"". I have a master's degree. I don't think my personality fits IR work in Washington D.C. I'm thinking about getting a TEFL/TESOL/CELTA and being an English Teacher abroad. Maybe in a Spanish-speaking country and I could come home and work as an ESL teacher or as a translator (I loved translating, if anyone knows ways of making a profession out of this). Thinking about maybe even moving to Australia and bartending, fuck it. Maybe try and build a career somewhere here, but I feel like I'm stuck in DC if I do that... and lordt I can't handle this place anymore either.  


I really feel like a total sack of uselessness right now though, and just want to get something going in a direction with positive momentum.

377,"I'm 26M, and I want to take my baby half brother (12M) on a weekend trip, maybe let him bring a friend along. It's obviously a much different experience than if I'd go with my friends in their 20s and 30s, but I still find it fun to spend time with him once in a while. I've taken him to water parks and a museum in the past, and he's enjoyed it.

I asked my mom if I could take him again and this time she's complaining about how bored she is, and she wants to come along with us. 

I'll tell it like it is, hoping she doesn't somehow find this: She's an obese alcoholic with a bad hip and a bad temper, and she'll spend the entire trip making it all about her while slowing us down. We'll have to cancel our activities early because she's bored and has no mobility. She'll pick dumb fights with my brother and put him in a bad mood so he won't have fun, then she'll force him into ""mandatory fun"" things he doesn't feel like but she thinks he'll like.

I love my mom, and I do want to go on vacation with her, just not on this particular kind of trip. To add further annoyance to this whole situation, we were going to spend a weekend at a national park for over a year and she kept moving back the departure date at the last minute because she was tired or some other dumb excuse. I was going to drive, set up the camper and everything. But we ended up ever going. And she did the exact same thing with our plans to go shopping in Chicago, only she canceled the freaking day of several times. We still haven't gone their either.

I'm genuinely afraid she'll cancel when I already have days off work and a hotel reserved, and she'll say my brother can't go either because we're just ""postponing"" it.

I don't know what to say to her to tell her no. She might get super emotional and take it personally. And no matter how cold I want to be, she ultimately controls whether my brother can go.",10Jul2018,1
378,"I (23F) just moved to a new city with my partner for a job that I love. It’s great, but I’m definitely missing my friends back home and having people to hang out with.

She invited me to hang out with her friends once a few weeks ago, and while brief, it went really well and I felt like I was with my friends back home. But she hasn’t asked me to hang out since. I know it’s probably my turn to initiate, but I feel really anxious for some reason. I have this idea that she just invited me because I’m new and she felt sorry for me. Also, I feel like too much time has passed and worry that it would be weird at this point. Still, I feel like it’s worth it to give it a shot and ask. We work in a small office and are usually busy/have differing hours, so I can’t really ask at work without either feeling like I’m disrupting or asking in front of everyone there, which seems like I’m putting her on the spot. 

How do I initiate this friendship? How do I get over my anxiety with meeting new people in young adulthood (aka post college)? I’m normally pretty outgoing and friendly, but need some encouragement to get out of my comfort zone in a new city.

379,"I don't know if this belongs in r/landlord or r/legaladvice, so posting here seemed a good starting position (within the realm of Reddit).

There are between three and five vehicles (aka cars) continuously parked on my new property, and my end desire is they not be on the  property.  The variation in numbers is because the lot lines are a little confusing (referencing older land plat divisions, which in turn reference even older divisions, before referencing concrete landmarks and measurements), and government provided aerial imagery is for reference only.  Regardless all five have expired registration, and are in various states of disrepair, ranging from wear and tear from long use to broken windows, wheels, and tires.

The area is low density multi family dwelling in unincorporated county land, with several, but not all, buildings owned by the same company.  The business I acquired my property from divested, to three separate entities, but previously, there were the two businesses owning all the buildings.  My concern is both there may have been pre-existing agreements between the two businesses I am unaware of, and unspoken (to me at least) understanding among the residents about the disposition of those vehicles.  My preference is to not make waves in the social fabric of the neighborhood.  However, I need those vehicles moved, as space is severely limited (major issue), they are eyesores (minor/inconsequential issue), and I can't take care of the noxious weed problem effectively while the vehicles are in the way (middling concern issue). 

I've already checked with the county in question, and the public access website is a convoluted mess that glaringly has a hole in explaining how to remedy this situation.  \[s\]\*But\* if one has the title to a junk vehicle, the county will gladly tow the vehicle and sell it for scrap, in exchange for the title!\[/s\]

380,"      I just want to start by saying that I've always felt very uncomfortable around her mom.

385,"Rant, scroll for TL;DR

At work I’m most trusted by the managers, in the sense they will tell me the instructions for everyone else and to essentially be in charge when they’re not in. That’s great I’m fine with some more responsibility and it’s great to know you’re trusted. 

But the problem comes with my other workmates who I have to give the instructions to. I only ever tell them what to do if it’s been a order from the managers (and usually they ask me to keep everyone in check because they tend to go off a bit when nobody’s there to keep them in line), or if they’ve asked me what to do and are expecting me to either help them fix a problem or expecting me to give them something to do (and then they don’t like it). 

But I always find them either not listening to me and it coming back on me that they didn’t do a/b, and I’m the one who gets complained at by the managers, or they call me bossy and things like that. Which really upsets me because I only ever pass on orders or tell them things if they’re wanting something to do (and there’s always loads to do they just don’t always have the up and go to do it). 

TL;DR: Work mates don’t respect me or accept orders given from the boss delivered through me without being rude to me. 

I plan on progressing in this company, I have my training to go up a level later in the summer, I’m also moving department in a few weeks. I’m not sure if I should be telling my boss to not tell orders through me as they don’t listen or respect the orders coming from me as I’m at the same level authority wise, or if I should just suck it up and deal with it a few more weeks in order to not look bad for when I process up. 

My problem is I wouldn’t mind the stress it brings if I had the authority, or if I had the pay rise, but when I’m on the same pay as them, and started at the same time as them it’s annoying that I’m having to pick up the extra slack. I find myself redoing stuff they’ve done wrong (and been told they’ve done wrong) as I know I’ve been left ‘in charge’ and if something is wrong the bosses will just put more emphasis on me keeping them in track.

386,"I realise this story will have a lot of small details but I just feel like I needed to write it all down get out some frustrations about the current situation.

At the start of the year I started a new job at a company (15-20 people). During my second week there I ended up sharing a bus ride with a girl from work by coincidence. During this bus ride we talked about my first week there and what I did before and how she ended up in my country ( the girl moved to my country \~5 years ago). During this talk she also mentoned her boyfriend of 6 years, who is native to my country. After that talk I realised how nice it was to get to know someone from work and I looked forward to going to work after the weekend. 

Weeks passed and during this time I started noticing her still staring a lot during meetings and striking up conversations during lunch. This is the point where I started developing a crush on her because it seemed to me she at least liked me a little bit. As the weeks progressed a lot of smaller (and bigger) things started happening like: 

* After I got a haircut she complimented me saying it looked good.
* We went on a company retreat and we all drove there in groups (3-4 people per car). She ended up in a french speaking car so I joked with her if it wouldn't be to painful to spent 8h driving with french speakers that she barely understands. Her reply to that was that maybe on the way back we could drive in a car together.
* During that trip she also kept asking about my interests and some personal life questions and her sharing some of her life goals. I actually spend a lot of time getting to know everyone of the office better but I definitly got to know her the best.
* The week after the trip I was supposed to give training to a new person joining our team but I also had a meeting planned with my crush for other work stuff resulting in her also wanting to join the training for some reason and other colleagues saying they where 'fighting' over me.
* After the trip she also started messaging me more on our chat for work related stuff. Maybe not really a sign of flirting but I took it as her trying to talk to me even if it is about work?
* She also drove me to the train station once.
* At some point she was going to some conference for work to talk to people. I contacted her asking how the conference was going and we spent an hour talking ( after work hours) about her day.  I'm not sure how I convinced myself to message her cause i'm kind of introverted and socially anxious doing that kind of stuff but it turned out to be a nice chat.
* There is also one time I managed to convice her to play a kicker game during lunch, which resulted in agreeing that she owes me 1 game a month. This is kind of important for later in the story

I can go on with more small stuff like this but I think the point is that over that period there were a lot of nice moments that could be interpreted as flirting/friendship, obviously there were also bad moments, like her talking about her boyfriend which was hard to listen to.

Until a couple weeks ago, a week or 2 after she came back from that conference, her sister visited. She told me about it before that she was visiting and that she was excited about it because it had been a while since they had last seen each other. 

So on friday I was walking to our office and I happen to notice my crush walking in front of me and next to her was someone else walking as well. So I manage to catch up with them and say good morning and turned out the person next to her was her sister. They agree to meet up later and I go to the office together with the girl, during this I noticed the girl seemed annoyed at me cause she wasn't talking like she did the day before, she seemed annoyed.

I continue my work and at lunch some of us decide to go play some kicker. while heading to the kicker we crossed paths with my crush and her sister. At this point I thought, why not send my crush a message asking if her sister and her wanted to come play a game with us, aying she stilled owed me one this month. She said she wasn't sure because they still had to get lunch. I also told the other people that I invited her but that she was not sure yet. then some other guy decided to message her again on our website, we have a contact that my crush will receive message on during the day, but he decided to use my email for this. When I found out I told her that it wasn't me but the other guy, but it seemed like she didn't believe me. 

After all this it  really went downhill. She seems annoyed whenever I try to talk her in person, even not sitting next to me at lunch anymore.  She stopped following me on instagram and this week I noticed she unliked all the posts she had previously liked, on facebook she seemed to have blocked me (we are still friends but i'm unable to see most of her posts). I know this part might sound very highschool drama but to me it feels like a weird thing to do. At some point I just asked her if she was annoyed at me for something I did but to that she just replied that she wasn't but just busy with work. Which to me honestly sounds like a bullshit anwser but I accepted it. 

I also hinted at it to some other colleague but they ended up asking why I cared so much even resulting in them asking if I had a crush on the girl, which I said was not the case. So the past few weeks I'm just doing my best to ignore her and trying to continue my work. but I'm still overthinking why she suddenly had this change of character towards me.

I think it is also important to know that I realise how happy she is with her boyfriend and that the chances of me ending up with her are very tiny but I still care because it was a nice friendship to have that I currently think is getting destroyed for no reason. 

I guess the point of this whole post was to vent some frustrations about it all and gather some advice on how I can handle, and even fix, the whole situation. The past weeks of ignoring her have made me feel a bit better but I don't think that is the right way to handle it especially if I see her everyday at work.",10Jul2018,3

The spat they're involved in has absolutely nothing to do with us and we've been treating both neighbours equally. We give them lifts, help with moving stuff, and even throw the odd bit of work their way. We don't socialise with any of them and we don't gossip. We're friendly but not friends.  Basically we've been good to them all and never once asked any of them for anything.

As is normal when the lefties want to ask for a favour they asked me to pop round to see them. So I did.

'Watch out for the righties' says they. 'They'll  ask you for everything and give you nothing back'. 'Umm, thanks, I'll keep that in mind', says I. Then as that's all they wanted to tell me, I left.

Few days later the Righties ask me for a lift to the doctor and as we're driving off, the lefties come out and ask me to pick up a prescription from the same place. Two birds one stone - nice.

Get to doctors and righty tells me she'll pick up lefties' prescription. I hate doctors and agree (my bad).

Righty eventually comes out with lefties prescription. We drive back and on the way righty tells me that she needs to go and see lefty and that she'll take the meds around herself. Hmm, me thinks, perhaps righty wants to patch things up with the lefties. I stupidly agree because I'm a dumbass. 

Turns out righty is now holding the meds ransom for a £30 debt owed by lefty. Lefty calls police to report righty, police turn up to act as delivery people for the prescription and go away again. Sorted. I'm left feeling bad, which I can deal with , and everyone else has received the appropriate meds/slap on wrist.

Now the complicated bit...

Next day got a long text message from the righties saying the lefties had texted them saying that we had told the lefties that the righties were 'using us for everything and we were getting nothing back', the same phrase the lefties had used to describe the righties a few days ago. 

Confused? It's a, righties said that lefties said that we said [insert lie], situation.

So now I'm really rather miffed. One of them lying about us.

I go to see righties to assure them that we have said no such thing. I asked to see the message but was told they had deleted it, so no proof. Convenient much?

I don't have a clue which of the arseholes is lying but some twatbag is.

For now I have told both the lefties and the righties that we do not gossip or discuss any of them in any way, ever. They have been told that we will not listen to anything one has to say about the other. I have also told them that if I ever find out that they so much as mention our names to each other, I will start cracking heads. Both parties seem happy with this for now, but still someone has been telling porkies.

I hate to bother the Internet with such trivial bollocks but I don't have a clue what to do.

Should I tell the lot of them to do one, or try to figure out who the culprit is (without any proof).

Any other ideas?

390,"Oh boy, here we go...
The younger sister of my best friend started texting me about 2 months ago, she is 14, i am 17. Now i know what i'm doing here, she doesn't look nor act like a 14 year old. When i first came to my friends house and saw her i thought she was 15/16 so thats why i don't mind the age gap.
Anyway my friend texted me a lot of stuff on the same day she started texting me, he said that his sister was nervous for my reaction and that she was talking with her friends about me.
I thought it was quite funny and started texting back.
Now it was quite clear that she liked me already but just this weekend she admitted it.

My friend doesn't think that its funny anymore at this point and does not want me to have a relationship with his sister. I told her that i did'nt want to ruin the friendship and she told me that her brother would get over it eventually...
I agreed and asked her if she wanted to come over when my parents are gone for a weekend and she told me she wanted to come.
She wants to tell her mom that she is going to my place but i told her to just come in secret so her brother wouldn't find out.

So yes i really like her too, the problem is, her brother and her parents who might think i'm too old or find it weird that i usually came to their place for my friend instead of her. 

Please help me solve this puzzle, i am also afraid for my parents reaction if we do make this official.",10Jul2018,1
391,"I recently relocated, due to a job change, to a new city in a new state. Very exciting time for me but I had about a month between starting work and closing on my new home so I needed a short term rental(s). I’m in a bit of a tourist area so finding these type of rentals at a good price was difficult during the summer. So, begrudgingly I turned to craigslist after exhausting my other options (other than the high price of a hotel). I found an add for a private basement apartment for $50 a night that was available the 17 days I needed. I spoke with the owner and although she seemed extra chatty I didn’t get bad vibes at first. Well I moved in 10 days ago and it’s been problems since.  First issue was no AC and current high temps here are in the 90s and 100s. She dealt with this by using several noisy floor fans. The sheets and bedding looked and felt old and dirty so much so I purchased new sheets. She had to enter the space daily because she had a fish tank in there. There were an excessive amount of her personal items including brushes, family photos, a laptop, and a giant braid of human hair hanging on the bathroom wall (so creepy!). She texted me constantly needing to know when I got off work and would arrive until I told her to stop. She claimed this was for my comfort (ha!) due to her seven little dogs that barked constantly.  There was a “private” entrance through the back gate but she often had the door to the main house open which made it uncomfortable to come and go freely without feeling I was being watched. Tonight I am planning to move out, counting the last $350 I already paid her as a loss, because of all these reasons but number one being I believe someone entered my room while I was asleep last night. The reason I believe this is I had a hanger sitting in a chair near my bed. The hanger was broke this morning as if it had been sat on and there was a dish (I’ve never seen nor used) sitting on the chair. I suppose I could have slept walked and did this but I don’t see that as being the most likely scenario. Upon arriving at work this morning I discovered I left my purse at the house. Feeling super uncomfortable and like my personal space was violated last night I decided to go back and get my purse. Upon arriving I see the door to my apartment is wide open. That was the moment I decided I could no longer feel safe and secure staying here and that money was not worth feeling that way. I’m preparing to leave work and go collect my things hoping I don’t see her. 

My questions are:
1. Am I overreacting?
2. If no, should I call the police and tell them my story about believe she (or someone) entered my space while I was asleep and she kept my locked door open during the day while I wasn’t there.
3. I wrote a note to her explaining all my grievances. Should I leave this for her?

392,"I have some interviews lined up, and I don't know how to address this issue. I went to West Point, and live in a military town. Most employers here are aware that we have a five-year minimum service requirement, and I got out after two years because I was sexually assaulted by my boss. I don't know if I feel comfortable saying ""I was medically retired from the Army,"" although that is true, because I think that might bring up some negative assumptions. I'm also not very comfortable saying that I was assaulted or ""had some EO issues.""

393,"Hello. Apologies for a throw-away; but i'm going to be quite open here and don't want to be tied to my main account.  
This may be a little scatterbrained, as I want to get everything out in one go. 

I'm in my late 20's, and for most of my life have been what I would describe as a functional human wreck.  I have been making moves in the last 12 months or so to try and better myself.  But those efforts are constantly undercut by the fact that I just can't get over the fact that people know, and actively remember, how I was before I started making these changes.   


Let me give some examples, just for my own peace of mind. I am generally described by my friends as intelligent, able to talk, but also generally very misanthropic. I'm not a people person despite my ability to be people pleasing when I feel the need. I have had through my late teens and early twenties some issues with depression and anxiety; but these were generally outweighed by - and I use colloquial language here - my lack of fucks to give about what people thought of me. But they manifested in a number of ways, my house was a wreck, my personal hygiene was terrible (This is even hard for me to write at this point, I smelled terrible for years, this is the main thing weighing on me at the moment) and I had habits of heavy tobacco and weed use. I was 'functional', but I was not thriving, I was someone that - if I had met myself - I would hate. These habits lead to a number of encounters that at the time I couldn't care less about, but looking back on now make me want to jump off a cliff. I had a friends family (not even the friend themselves)  and bosses ask me about showering, I was asked by my landlord about the state of my place, etc. This is rather embarrassing for me to even \*admit\* openly at this point. I was functional in that I would work, I would study, I would have hobbies, but I was disgusting and someone that I would pity, and even did at that time.   


I realised these things relatively recently, and have been making efforts to change. I am tidy, clean, I quit smoking, I started working out and I generally got myself together a little and am currently trying to start a business.   


But I still despite my best efforts cannot get over the fact that people - when they think of me - still imagine these flawed aspects of myself. I don't feel I deserve a relationship because I imagine that when people meet my friends they will get a glimpse of who I was at my lowest (even if my lowest was nearly 7 years long) or be embarrassed of who I was. I don't feel I can talk to my close friends about it, as they never thought to bring these up to me either, they simply let it be. My ""close friends', I feel barely know me at this point. The irony being I have just moved in with one of them.   


These things are constantly plaguing my mind, they have put a stall on my self improvement, I haven't worked out in a number a few weeks, my sleep pattern is fucked, I have been resisting just smoking again, I see myself as a failure based on those previous traits. What am I meant to do here? I Just can't get over the image and embarassing roadblock of who I *was.*   


I have this image of myself in a year or two, having sorted myself out, with everyone just going ''yeah but remember how you used to be? How shit was that? How embarassing was that?"" 

Sorry if this sounds idiotic, but It's been stopping any progress for me for weeks, and I'm borderline falling back into what I was before, and I don't want to let that happen. ",10Jul2018,1
394,"Part of my job is to hire qualified open monded and progressive people. Part of this includes searching social media accounts to get a general feel of the person and make sure there aren't any embarassing past issues that can damage the company and ts image. The best qualified person was a 23 year old asian female but while researching I found on her twitter posts about how she would never date Asian guys and only likes white guys. I was shocked to read this in 2018 and think that this mentality still exists.  Her ideology reminded me Hitlers without the genocide of course. The company is very diverse but we do have a lot of Asian American Males that she would be working with and the thought that she would automatically judge them based in their race is disturbing.

398,"I am studying accounting and am looking to get a job in data entry/payroll clerk because I won't have to deal with physically working much and it will give me relevant experience in my field. 

I worked in a grocery store, and after about 5 or so months I felt like one of my managers was always on my case and, more importantly, I was always sore (back strained) because of all the lifting I had to do in my job (I am quite small). 

I would have given two weeks, but I felt like my managers would have asked me to stay and my mom also would have convinced me not to quit. The idea of working there for a long time was so bad to me that I just quit on the spot. I didn't want to risk being coerced by family and managers to stay in something I felt was bad for me physically and sucking the life out of me. 

When I told my mom she freaked out on me and threatened to take my phone and car because ""I don't appreciate them"" and ""my free ride is over"". Her main concern seems to be that I will have finding a job because I quit without two weeks, but this doesn't make much sense to me. 

1. I have heard that if they contact your former employer, they are only supposed to confirm whether you worked there. Therefore, future employers wouldn't even know. 

2. Is having ""grocery store customer service clerk"" on my resume really so great? Worst case scenario is that I can't list it, and is that really driving HR to hire me? He worked in a grocery store... wow. 

I know it was probably a bad decision, but how much do I really lose from this?",10Jul2018,1
399,"It’s a very long story, so I’ll give the TLDR version.

I recently moved out of a roommate situation five months before my lease was up because the girl I lived with was essentially a hoarder and also let her poorly trained dog gouge my legs jumping up on me with its untrimmed nails and let it pee all over the house without cleaning it up sufficiently (she’d just wipe it up and not use any sort of cleaner, despite the fact that everyone in the house went around barefoot). There were countless other minor issues that led to a sort of death by a thousand cuts and made the living situation extremely uncomfortable for me. 

The final straw was when she left for almost two weeks and hired several pet sitters for her dog without asking me or even giving me a heads up, giving them all keys to the apartment so I was subjected to weeks of constant anxiety about being constantly barged in on by total strangers 3-5 times per day and the sitters left my door not just unlocked but OPEN in a high crime neighborhood overnight. 

Anyway, she got back from vacation and I told her I was moving out, something we’d both discussed doing before since we had a hostile landlord as well. She refused to let me sublet my room even though I’d already found a new place because she was “uncomfortable having a stranger in the apartment” (the irony is certainly not lost on me) and decided that she was moving out too, but not until the end of July. I was stuck paying rent at this apartment for the entire month of July even though I’d moved but thankfully convinced my landlord to break our lease since I found him great new tenants.

She texted me yesterday asking for utility bills from May and June since she always forgot to send me bills until weeks or months after the fact. The sum she’s asking for is far less than what she lost me by refusing to allow a subletter in the apartment and I’m inclined to just tell her to go fuck herself. If I do so, does she have any legal recourse here? Do you think I’m morally obligated to pay her? 

For clarification, the landlord had nothing to do with utility bills and they were both in her name, paid directly to the providers. Honest, objective advice appreciated. ",10Jul2018,2

402,"(TLDR at the end) I dont know if im phrasing that right, but anyone willing to listen thanks (14M). Im in a tough situation any advice or someone willing to read a long story is appreciated more than you think..

I had a crush on someone for around 2 years, and recently I felt I loved her so much id take a bullet for her (ill call her K) even though we werent really friends, we just knew each other and were friendly towards each other. I eventually sent her a message telling her how I felt (she had got my number off our class chat and messaged me random stuff a while earlier), she simply responded with sorry I dont feel the same please dont be sad i hope we can still be friends. Rather than be petty and ask if shed at least date me I said thanks for the honesty, and I was numb for a few hours after, untill eventually I cried to myself listening to sad songs feeling sad for myself, I told my closest friend who had unintentionally led me on to believe that K liked me, but there wasnt much she could do. I pretty much got depression for the next 12 days or so, but my best friend (I'll call her L) decided it may help me if she told her crush aswell, she was also rejected and so we were sad together. After my 12 days L met someone who she felt something for, I wanted to be happy for her but i felt lonely because I had only ever loved 1 person who didnt like me back, and now L was entering what seemed like her 5th relationship even though she was also only 14. I think about 3 days later L admitted that she had feelings for me, and while I was compatible with her (I think) I wasnt really physically attracted to her which I believe is decently important in a relationship. I decided I would try dating as it could really work out, but L and I both said we'd take it slow cos we where scared of being eachothers rebounds. We started talking more like bf and gf untill she asked me why I liked her, I replied shortly expecting her to not want to read a long answer as we always talk crap and I thought this was more for girly giggles than it was serious. After that she seems to believe I am still getting over K, my original crush. After my 12th night I stopped crying every night and didnt think about K that much anymore, it was strange but I was grateful cos I wasnt depressed anymore, I felt a little more like the optimist K always inspired me to be (all though I told myself it comes from me she doesnt even talk to me, to make myself feel better). I admit I may have unknowingly mentally blocked it because I felt L was getting tired of my pessimism,  and when I told my 2 other best friends they didnt give a flying fuck and didn't even respond other than some lowlife horse shit that was almost unrelated. So now here I was thinking I love my besty (L) and im over K, but then I see something on K's instagram, I didnt think anything of it and just liked it as I do all my friends posts. However less than an hour later I was talking to L and she said ""look at ur crush"" and I looked at the post again and thought am I really over her? To test I thought about her kissing someone else and was pretty much in tears after that, I felt like I had just been rejected again. K seemed sad about it other than guilt but she clearly wasnt gonna tell me about it and whenever I tried to find out about what was happening I felt I was bothering her and she gave responses that i could tell were holding back on me, so I told myself to drop it and leave my false hope. I think im in a kind of relationship with L now (my first ever) but I really care for her and that was a large part of why I didnt tell her I didnt feel the same, I thought it would be nicer to her if I gave her a chance (I know its dumb as hell but I couldnt stand to hurt L it hurt just imagining hurting her). But now I dont know if I can stand being without K i may be in love with her again but I feel as much as I tell myself theres a chance one day or maybe she did like me but didnt wanna date me for some reason and she would realise her mistake,  I know it wont happen and I dont like how much it affects and hurts me and my life. What do I do?

TL; DR I got rejected by my 2 year lasting crush, got into another relationship but I think I still have feelings for the person who rejected me, I dont know what to do with myself, btw im very young (14M)
Im lonely, maybe depressed, in need of guidence or someone who cares more then my lowlife friends who dont understand love, maybe im too young for my mind but only 1 person who I dont know that well has actually understood the pain of my unrequited love, everyone around me is too immature to understand

Every time we were on the verge of making the plunge to dating, one of us changed our minds because we were afraid of losing each other.  Each time I think we're finally done with one another she'll reach back out or I'll reach back out and we'll resume.

Anyway I’m mid 20’s and at my mums home for the weekend, during this time she has made some rather horrid comments. She has commented on my weight non stop. And recently just said my boyfriend will dump me if I don’t lose some weight (she’s never met him). 
Now she doesn’t say these maliciously. She says them while we’re chatting about other stuff. When I bring up it’s innapropiate she apologiseses, says it’s from a place of love. Then five minutes later repeats it.

I just got hired as a sales agent for an airline and I've worked for 2 months now. At first I was excited to be part of a big company, to dress professionally and I also made a lot of friends there quickly. 

However, once our training was finished three days ago, everything changed. All of my friends that I had training with all have different schedules so I never see them anymore, the job in itself is very fast pace and I hate the job in itself. 

It comes to the point where I sometimes feel sick before getting to work and where I feel trapped. When I'm at home, all I think about is work and how I'm going to do, I can't be at peace on my free time. When I'm at work, all I think about is when I'm going to get out of there. 

I spoke to my parents and my girlfriend about this and they told me to leave if it causes me so much pain for a rather low salary. If I quit, I won't be in trouble financially since I live with my parents, but I always wanted to help them out with rent and all.

What I'm afraid of is not finding another job for a while, it took me 4 months of unemployment to finally land this job and I've read posts of people being unemployed for over a year. 

I was hoping you guys could give me some advice on what to do with my future. I had several suggestions, like going back to school and doing a technical program in something I might enjoy more, or simply start job hunting again and be unemployed for 3-4 months until I land another job.

So my goal would be a normal friendship with her and to achieve that I made everything so that I dont have to think of her and I could potentially forget her for a while (summer holidays) but I still thinkk of her everyday and I still catch myself imagining a relatonship with her and than Im always sad again. So basically what am I supposed to do now:

1. keep trying forgetting her so I eventially have a good friendship (altough the getting rid of my feelings for her part could fail)
2. idk
3. idk

PS: I do think it  could grow into a nice friendship because she was always very open and I think she actually feel similar in the being understood part(idk) and when she said she only likes me as a friend she also said she was very sorry and that it wouldnt be my fault but that she was just I quote ""emotionally crippled"" (both of us arent that good in socializing(introverts socially akward dont like feeling(we often joke about that they are irrational(they are))))

help what am I supposed to do?? I am currently not talking to her in order to get rid of these feelings (and she knows what Im trying to do and is ok with that)but all day long I feel the urge to text her about several thing (not related to the situation(e.g. damn physics and phylosophy))

412,"This summer I was required to get an internship to go towards my degree that I’m receiving in December. I found one where my bf lives and where we intend on staying and raising our nonexistent family. 

I’m a little over halfway through my internship and I LOVE it. The people are great, the job isn’t the worst, and the culture is a dream come true. And the location is perfect as well. 

I’m extremely interested in working there full time but I’m not sure who to go to about this. The HR manager is who hired me for the internship and she’s largely in charge of those things. My supervisor as well as another coworker and I are relatively close but they don’t exactly have a say in anything. My supervisors supervisor could maybe make things happen for me but I’m worried she’s too busy to focus on this. 

I’m also not sure what to say without sounding like a complete dork lol. I would be willing to be an assistant for minimum wage if it meant I could get hired on full time after I graduate. 

Who is the best person to go to and how do I go about this without sounding desperate?

413,"I'm a 19 year old dude. I'm leaving for boot camp in 27 days. I'm freaking the fuck out.

First thing- I'm still friends with my ex. I still get jealous over her. I don't really think I should be friends with her. Iv wanted to cut her out but I keep finding excuses not too. I don't really have anyone else to talk too. In your opinions how should I handle this situation

Second thing- I have 27 days left to be a kid I need ideas on how to spend them. My friend group kinda disbanded and I don't really have people to chill with anymore so cool meaningful activity ideas that I can do solo besides masterbation would be appreciated.

Third thing- I went to a party on while on vacation 4 hours from my house yesterday. At this party I made alot of drinking buddies I'm probably never going to see again. one of these buddies was super hot and bought me shots because I'm joining the coast guard. It was probably the best night of my life. I came home today and now I'm super down bc im never going to see alot of those guys again. She was really really hot. This experience made me realize I should party more. How do I do that I have 27 days and I have no friends. 

Fourth thing- I'm working a fuckton but my job is a cool do you think I'll regret it if I keep working so much? What should I be doing instead?

5th thing- is there anything I can do to help prepare for boot camp? Any tips besides work out before?

6th thing- is there anything else I should be stressing about?

417,"I'm 19/M, and I really feel like I'm at the worst point in my life so far. Over the last few years I've just been wanting to do less and less. I used to draw, play violin, go to the gym, play video games, and read. One by one those things have all fallen out of my life and I have no interest in doing anything anymore. I try forcing myself to draw Andreas and go to the gym, but it always falls apart so quickly, I get a few lines down or read 2 pages or do one set and it just feels like I have no energy to continue. I don't even eat anymore either. I've lost over 20 pounds in a year, which is not good because I was underweight to begin with.

I talked to my doctor and he says it's not depression because I've managed to keep my grades up in school. He said psychotherapy was unlikely to help.

I really don't know what to do with my life anymore. Life just isn't enjoyable. I've thought about suicide on and off my entire life but I could never do that to my family.

422,"Hello Reddit. So a quick run down of what happened. I'm a 22 year old female. My ex-best friend is around the same age. (not sure if age is relevant) Anyhow, We'd met when we were 18ish at an event and were immediately besties because of our love for nerdy things. I'm quite a loner and a shy person, but she brought out the social side of me. Let's call her Emily. Well for about the next 3 years we did everything together. Shopping, partying, or just chilling, we were inseparable. Unless Emily had a boyfriend, that is. Emily had a bad taste in guys. Her first boyfriend, let's call him Justin I knew her with was verbally abusive and almost drove her to suicide. I'd stay up all night chatting with her basically talking her out of suicide. They spent all their time together having sex. They even did it on multiple occasions while I was in the room. Justin always wanted to have sex with me too. He'd grope me when Emily wasn't around and try to sext me almost every day. Eventually her and Justin broke up after him cheating on her numerous times.

She had multiple more bad relationships after Justin. Her next note worthy one was with a guy twice her age. Let's call him Ben. Ben and Emily met at her work, a restaurant. While she was with Ben she was happy. It was great to see her that way. Unfortunately though she would still sneak out at night and go have sex with Justin, because they both were crazy for sex. I caught her doing this on multiple occasions. She was usually drunk when she did this. She loves alcohol. I personally always have preferred weed and really hated how alcohol makes me feel.

Skip forward a year. She's in a new relationship with some new boy who's her age. We both love to party and my parents were gone for a week and asked me to watch their house. I decide to throw a small get together with my friends. A few hard ciders and some bud, just have a chill time. We planned this entire thing out together for weeks beforehand. It was our time to shine and have a great time. The problem was Emily's parents were also out of town and someone needed to let her dogs out in the morning. So Emily asks Justin to let her dogs out in the morning because of the party at my house. He agrees to. Night of the party only about 8 of the 20 people we invited show up. No problem, we just had excess alcohol. Emily gets plastered way before midnight. Midnight comes around, I'm tipsy, but nothing still very aware of my surroundings. Justin comes over, uninvited. Emily and Justin hadn't talked in about a month or two, since whenever they last had sex. Like I said, she continued to have sex with him even when she was in another relationship, although she hadn't since she was with new boy. He never drinks or smokes weed. That night however since we had so much excess he played some beer pong and got wasted almost immediately. Emily and I decide to go upstairs to my old bedroom and pass out cause shes drunk. I agree and follow with her. We left the door open. Justin comes in that night and first tries to have sex with me. I push him off, so he moves to Emily. Shes quiet about it. They were always quiet about it so i thought nothing of it, especially with their track record. I leave the room and since I'm tipsy tell my so-called other friends that they were having sex and to not go up there.

The next morning we wake up and Emily sends me a weird text after getting home. It's along the lines of "" I had a dream Justin raped me at the party last night. Did you see him do anything to me in bed?"" This is where I messed up. I lied and said that nothing happened. Later I find out that my so-called friends told her that I did see her with Justin. She called me untrustworthy and says I need to grow up and stand up for her. In her eyes I let Justin rape her. In my eyes it looked like another one of their random acts of sex.

We haven't talked much in over a year and a half. She was the only true friend I really had. I fell into deep depression once she cut me off. I tried to OD on Xanax to kill myself. I hated myself for losing her. I ended up in the hospital, but alive. I decided rather than text her I should talk face to face. I decided to nonchalantly go to the mall and walk past her kiosk she was working at. It was brief and awkward, but things seemed like they could have been amended. Customers came to the kiosk so I left. We've briefly texted here and there, always planning to have coffee and talk, but our work schedules never had time to. We both got busy with our lives and now haven't said a word to each other in over a 6 months. I miss her as a friend. We had so much fun together and really brought out the best in me. I miss her greatly. We called each other sisters. I loved her like a sister. What do I do to undo my mistake?",10Jul2018,1

I'm a 16 yr old guy and I just want to stop being lazy and get my life in order. Some examples of this lazyness:

* I do my piss in the bathroom before bed and I'm too lazy to brush my teeth even though I'm right next to the sink
* I dread things like taking out the trash, cleaning the house etc.
* Schoolwork and studying boring subjests makes me want to die (not literally!)

I also stopped going out with friends (or really talking to them at all), and as much as I want to hang out, I just don't think I will have fun at all with the specific people I know (for whatever reason). Honestly I hate seing people and copules having fun because it makes me so envious...

Also I make stupid decisions - recently I forgot about my dentist appointment and I just said ""fuck it"" and never got around to it. I had to get a spine x-ray and after sitting in the waiting room for two hours I realised I had to put the paper I had inside of some bin to get into the queue and at that point I just trashed the paper and left.

Whenever I want to do something (be it going to the gym or whatever else) I think to myself how ""I'll definitely do it"" and make plans and all, but then I just give it all up.

I know I can continue my life this way and everything will probably be 'fine', but I don't want to continue being miserable.

These stupid immoral decisions I acted on are way below me now, I have to live with myself for the things that I've done and I hate myself so much.

MY PROBLEM I have now besides this huge amount of guilt is that this year, at the end of the month of April, some narcissist took me to his house while I was blackout drunk and made me admit these deep dark secrets.

429,So basically i'v been recently finding the whole lifting weights and going through x amount of reps for x amount of sets quite boring and i feel like i'm not getting enough and driving myself as much as I use to because of it. I'm in no ways an expert on lifting but i'm not a complete beginner to it either and I enjoy when my workouts are more fast paced and explosive. I'm not looking to become a massive bodybuilder or anything like that I just want to be able to tone up and have some decent lean muscle all round and to be able to enjoy my workout while doing it. I'm not saying I want to completely give up using weights either as I do enjoy doing compounds lifts and would like to keep continuing with them while also including a more fast paced explosive workout along with that. If anyone follows a plan or can maybe give some advice on this and give me some direction in where to go with my desires it would be appreciated. Cheers,10Jul2018,1
430,"Background: I'm nearly 30 and I've mostly only ever worked at retail jobs, besides a few years at a small town newspaper. I've literally never been a manager, supervisor, or even a shift supervisor before in my life. This is mostly due to moving around a lot. I'm now a co-manager at a shop. Not assistant, but equal. 

Our cleaner has always been shit. He shows up early af when he's supposed to come after close. Today he turned up and cleaned the shop 3 and a half hours early while we had customers in, fully mopping floors and everything. If the customer toilet is nasty and shit stained, he will pour bleach over it for 2 days in a row ""to soak"" and then clean it with a new mop head that he then throws away. During these two days, we have to put the only toilet out of order and listen to customers moaning about it. He constantly bitches about cleaning the toilet and bathroom and moans when I let paying customers use the toilet because ""why can't I just always keep the Out of Order sign on the door all the time?""

I get it. Nobody likes cleaning shit out of a toilet. But that's his job and he's choosing to do this work. It's part time for him and only one hour a day for 5 days a week. 

I've seen him for nearly two years and he's a nice guy. Everybody gets on with him, even the customers. My previous managers have just been bitching about his cleaning for ages, but they've never tried to actually get a new cleaner. 

Should I go for firing/replacing this guy, or just deal with it? I've only been a manager for about a month. My co-manager says he will back me up but he'd never pull the trigger himself. Probably an English thing.

How big of a dick move is this? I've never been in this position before and the moment I do, I replace somebody. Should I wait it out a bit longer? I've already tried to talk to him about how all the cleaning checks need to be achieved (mainly the customer toilet), but he only responds with how it needs to soak and he'll do it on such and such day. 

Advice?

TL;DR I've only been a store manager for a month, and our cleaner has always been shit. Tried talking to him, but it didn't work. Should I replace him, wait it out longer, or do nothing? I don't want to be seen as a dick manager. ",10Jul2018,3

Cons: long work hours, you get woken in the middle of the night to go to the hospital, you have to go to school for 15 years, you’d barely have time with your family, and you have to memorize so much.

The interviewer, the assistant manager said she would tell the manager how the interview went and if she thought I was a good fit. She said it would be a few days (I assume 2-3).

some background above ^. To make a long story short, my boyfriend was sexually assaulted last week when his new upstairs neighbors threw a party and someone snuck into his downstairs apartment while we were sleeping and began feeling him up. When we woke up the guy ran out of the door and we soon followed and confronted everyone upstairs, but no one would own up. The upstairs neighbors were no help whatsoever and are still protecting their friends by not helping us figure out who it was. 

Disclaimer: We have already spoken to the police and filed a report. However, they told us there isn’t much they can do considering we couldn’t ID the guy as it was dark and no one wants to talk. 

At this point we’re past being upset. These guys are genuinely bad people who deserve whatever comes their way. They want to sweep it all under the rug to ensure a “a great year of parties” considering we’re all college students near campus. F that. We want all legal ways to get back at these guys bc they truly deserve it.

435,"So basically, my boss turned up to work visibly drunk, I made a complaint, and after a review period, he was fired.

He had been quite unreliable for quite a while, like always turning up several hours late, leaving early, etc. We would often have to deal with things far beyond our skill level which was quite overwhelming at times, because he wasn't there. There's nothing worse than telling people 'sorry, my boss was supposed to be here 2 hours ago, I can't do anything until he comes'. And then you're bombarded with awkward questions about his whereabouts that you shouldn't even have to worry about. 

On the day of the incident in question, he was several hours late, and turned up smelling of alcohol and slurring words. Despite the fact that it was Sunday, he hadn't yet done the next week's schedule until he arrived. He finalised it at 10pm, 12 hours before we had to work these shifts. Technically I was in the right to make a complaint, for the company's sake. It wasn't the first complaint he's recieved, but it was the final straw for him. He had a review, and got let go soon after. 

The thing is, he was actually a pretty nice guy, and he just lost his job that he's had for nearly two years. I feel sorry for him. A lot of the time, he was actually okay as a boss. It's just that a lot of the time, he wasn't.

I feel really awful for the way I handled it, and I wish that I had been more subtle in my complaint, so that he could have just had a warning, not a job loss. I feel like it's drawn a wedge between me and my co-workers too, because although no one voices it, I feel like they think I'm just some young, naïve kid who doesn't understand consequences for his actions.

I'm not the cutthroat business-y type of person at all, and I don't even think the reality of potentially losing his job after complaining even sank in properly until it happened. It's not even just the fact that he was fired, it's the fact that it was me who put the final nail in the coffin. I feel awful, and I know that I'm going to be known as the one who complained.

I work for my aunt and we both work in the same office. All day today she scolded me for checking my phone when I was switching music. Not just regular scolding, it had an aggressive undertone to it in a way. It felt like every single time i tried to change my music she was right on top of me in a very rude tone. I drove us a long way today back home but during the entire ride she just kept belittling my driving skills. I'm a new and learning driver so I appreciate feedback, but the way she was redirecting me just felt so overbearing and condescending. She kept telling me where and how to stop, like I haven't driven a lot already. I feel as though I'm not explaining this part properly honestly. But it did push my buttons in a bad way, I really hate when adults are overbearing and condescending over me. And then after said car ride, she made me drive to the liquor store for her. She knows I come from an abusive alcoholic past, and her having me drive her there was just very upsetting to me. After we got home, she started smoking weed. I've never seen her smoke before, and her being an adult I'm supposed to trust I feel betrayed right now. This shouldn't be so upsetting to me, but it is. I also feel so betrayed that she's with her boyfriend so much... I know I shouldn't hold her life back, but it feels almost as though I've been abandoned by her.

 Recently, I've been finding her harder to be around. I feel as though I cannot be around her for an hour at max at this point because she gets so loud and condescending to me. Especially after we took a vacation together, just the two of us; I was dying from her personality.  I find her very hypocritical and intolerable a lot. She'll often preach positivity  which is  very ironic considering she's probably the most shallow and hateful person I know. I find this very irking. She also seems to force herself on me in a way? Such as if i dont respond fast enough she tells me I'm giving her attitude or being rude, when that's just me as a person.  I don't want to be rude to this woman because I owe my life to her in a way. I've just been so on edge lately and it feels like she unintentionally presses all of my buttons all the time. She reminds me of myself and my past in the worst ways. I love my uncle more. 

I suppose I just need advice on how to deal with her better, or how to respectfully avoid her more. And how to stop feeling so betrayed. She's probably trying her best but she's just so inconsiderate sometimes... maybe I should go outside more. Any feedback would be helpful. Thank you for reading, guys. ",10Jul2018,1
441,"I [18M] will be hanging out with my closest female friend [18F] tomorrow possibly and this time, it's just gonna be us. I told her that we can hang out in our city's downtown area but here's the problem: I don't know what we're going to do. I don't know where we should go or what to do. I'm scared that I'm gonna say something weird or it may look like a date. I just don't want her to be uncomfortable around me and I want her to have fun, and hopefully would enjoy doing something like thst with me again. It's just sometimes we have bursts of where we can talk and have actually conversation and we laugh and chat, and there are times where conversations just gets stale and trying to start one feels like it won't go anywhere.
