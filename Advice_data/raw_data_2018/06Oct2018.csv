0,"TL;DR - Dreamt I was raped at a liquor store and watched my mother die as she tried to save me. What does this dream mean?

I flaired it as serious because I'm freaked out and afraid it'll happen to me in real life now.

I don't want to go into details with this because I'm still very shaken up, but I really NEED to know what this means for me. Basically what happened was I went to a liquor store and a guy came in behind me and tried to rob the store, but they refused to give him money and thank get produced a gun and told me to give him my money. I said I didn't have anything and in response he put the gun in my face and I tried to hide behind my hands like an idiot. I want to take a pause here to say that whenever I thought about being faced with a gun I genuinely believed I would welcome death, but in the dream I was petrified. Back to the dream, after pointing his gun at me he told me to put my hands on my chest and for me to get on the ground. From the point he violates me, not with his penis, but with his finger. (I'm a guy so there was only one place it could go. Skipping some details after that my mother who saw me go to the store rushes through the door and tries to tackle him, but gets plugged in the chest (shot) and falls on the ground looking at me, crying, and then he stands over her body and shots her in the head. That is the point at which I woke up.

I really don't know why I had this dream, but again it seriously freaks me out. Especially since I have already been molested and that was bad enough, I don't think I'd be able to go on living after being raped, I'd feel too dirty. I say that because I already feel dirty from my molestation in 2011. 

Can someone please tell me what this means?",06Oct2018,1
1,"Okay so basically yesterday night at like 10:30pm I was leaving the library (college) and i saw this pretty girl, I decided why not and go talk to here. We talked about anything, music, movies, politics, Elon Musk, you named it. I asked her if she had a boyfriend and said yes(goes to another college, dating for 7months) , I didn't really cared much of it because I wasn't trying to get her, just trying to have a friendly convo. We talked until 1:30am lol, until I walked to her dorm and say goodbye. I didn't asked for her number or snapchat and said ""I'll see you when I see you"".

What are your thoughts about it? Why would a girl talk to me for 3 hours? To a complete stranger. She has a boyfriend as well lol and if I had a girlfriend who talked to a complete stranger for 3 hours I would be curiosity as to why as well.

We are very much alike, one thing that we couldn't believe we had in common was we like seeing people interact with each other. like watching a boyfriend and girlfriend interact or something. I know it sounds weird but lol It was funny that Someone else is like me in that sense.

TL:DR Talked to a random girl for 3 hours late at night. Didn't asked for her number/snapchat. why do you think she would talk to me for 3 hours, even when she has a boyfriend?",06Oct2018,1
2,"Please be nice if you leave a comment, it's already hard to talk about. 

My friends step child has been struggling with a increase of behavioral issues. He is five and for as long as I've know him (2 years or so) he has been a temperamental kid his parents try to speak amicably around him and keep arguments in texts to save the child seeing that. Like I say hes always been kinda awkward, when you see him it's like you don't know what side of him you'll get that day, is it where hes going to be happy and talk with you? or the day where he will ignore you totally avoiding your space let alone your eye contact? He seems like a smart kid however he has learnt how to be manipulative he will play people against each other and play on their emotions like telling them he doesn't love them, he doesn't care about them. He even mentioned his birth mum being in his fathers car to my friend and she could have sworn he had only told her for a reaction.

However recently his issues are becoming more physical, with his birth mum (a pregnant mother to her second) he would through things at her despite her pleas to stop for the sake of the unborn child. 

More recently hes been taking this aggression to school like blocking another boy from leaving the bathroom until he has shown him his penis. Another example in the Head of the school calling to inform the parents that he has pee'd on another child's jacket. He even wet the bed recently which he hasn't done for years!

It's been difficult to give my friend advice on. I have very little experience with children. I know from a psychological stand point there may be a lack of empathy given his young age how ever I'm wondering if it's more of personality disorder? 

Any thoughts?

3,"Story: Two weeks ago I was accused of stealing company time/money from my supervisor. I tried to defend myself and she replied ""you're insulting to me"". I went to her manager (manager 1) and his manager to report the incident. They both apologized but manager 1 who has taken over the case seemed that he just wanted to sweep it under the rug. I also filed a employee HR form, which is responded within 1-2 business days - it has been 2 weeks.

How?: We use an app to input work time/pto/etc. I entered in 'misc absence' thinking it was unpaid, it wasn't. So on paper/computer it does look like I stole. I told manager 1 I would pay it back and manager 1 said it shouldn't be a problem (also 2 weeks ago).

Now: Today I went into work asking about my case. Manager 1 said there will be a meeting on Monday. I replied with ""is my job secure? are authorities involved?"". Manager 1's reply was ""let's talk on Monday"". I reached out to 4 different HR reps all of which could not help me.

Help: So, should i resign with an email explaining the incident, unprofessionalism and lack of support; or should I wait until Monday (possibly walking into a slaughter and having 'fired for stealing company money' on my record)?",06Oct2018,1

5,"I met this girl last week and we started talking a lot, a few hours later after meeting her we were already hugging and holding hands.
This week I saw her everyday and it was all the same, everything  seemed so good. But yesterday when I was about to kiss her my neck hurted a lot and prevented me. to go for it (She's really short and I'm kinda tall. I thought that I should try it later when we were sitting and that everything.was still fine, but when I saw her today she.was really distant, she wasn't hugging or holding me as usual, so I decided to give her a little of space.
At last when we were alone she said that she was mad and had to go, we were talking and she said that she wanted to say me somrthing but didn't because it was too mean. I persuaded her into telling me amd all she said was ""You are too cuddly "". She proceeded to say sorry but kept saying that that was bothering her.
We always talk in spanish, but sometimes she brings up some words in english, she witched to english for a.moment and said ""Like i don't want to see you, but I do"".
Forgot to mention that I went through a lot of trouble yesterday because I took her home, I'm glad because I saved.her from the.rain. Well I brought this up because she asked why would I do that and that she didn't understood.

6,"So  in general my relationship with my Mum is good. I moved around 100  miles away from her 4/5 years ago so we weren't that involved to really  have issues as we only saw each other couple of times a year. In the  past we've argued a lot but as an adult got past those issues, or so I  thought. So bit of backstory, I started working for myself shortly after  moving away. I don't earn a lot of money but also live a lifestyle  where I don't spend a lot of money. Me and my partner do okay and most  importantly, we are happy. Even though entitled to benefits, I choose to  receive none. My Mum, since I started has put my work down. She's  constantly telling me to make something else out of my skillset or  nothing to do with what I do or questiioning why I do it, how much money  am I making each month etc. Sometimes it gets offensive so I ask her to  stop and to just not ask me about it. I've asked to not discuss it  numerous times. I've always been polite because I don't see her often so  really don't want to fall out. She always brings it back up though.  She's done it at a Christmas meal with my partners family all at the  table, yelling at me “Why don't you become a nurse!?”... My aunties a  nurse so of course I should be that. She has always been like this,  whatever I've wanted to do has not been good enough. I've always been  creative as a child and have yet to see a painting I've done make the  wall while one of my cousins goes straight up. Even gifts she said she's  like have been dumped somewhere and damaged... it becomes so  disheartening. She likes to compare me to my sister whose a cleaner and  how wonderful she is at her job and how hard she works. She even, when I  told her I like to make chutneys, turned to me and said 'Well I don't  have time to do stuff like that, because I work'. It may not seem like a  direct insult, but this is common throughout our conversations, the  reference to her or my sister working as if I'm not. Anyway, so the big  one. So couple of months ago I'm down visiting my Mum and planning on  moving back closer to my family. I'm in the car after a day out with my  Mum, Aunty, Cousin and Sister. I've already been told my tits are gross  and my arse is flat by my Mum in front of them, so the put downs have  already started. Aunty and cousin have been dropped off so it's my  Sister and Mum in the front of the car and me in the back. I'm going to  try be as accurate about what happened as possible, so here it goes.  Moving will require money naturally, so Mum starts making comments about  her loaning the money off my Nan as 'she works'... I make the comment  that I work also and can loan it. She comments again about her working  and I say, calmly and politely. 'Mum, it's insulting when you make  comments that suggest I don't work'. I tell her she's been doing it a  lot and give examples. Immediately her back goes up and she says it's my  own securities. I bring up the fact that during a visit with my ill dad  during that it's also upsetting that she makes out the only reason my  Dad talks to me is because he's still in love with her, not because he  may love me (Whole other story but needed to add in). She kicks off, she  starts yelling and screaming at me saying I only say negative things  about others, how it's all 'poor me' etc. After I say she makes  everything about her and she could have just taken a second to think  about if what I said had  any bearing or truth, just a second to try  understand. She calls me a two faced bitch, so I say but I'm not because  I'm trying to be honest with you about how I feel. She's still yelling  and screaming which makes her mess up and she eventually yells out that I  don't work! So she finally comes out and says it which I point out. I'm  still trying to be calm but I'm getting overwhelmed and worked up.  She's messed up so lost the original argument as she outright says what  she's  been denying, she admits she doens't think I work as I'm self  employed...so she takes a different turn. My partner recently had fallen  out with his parents and there was a ton of shit there, another reason  we were moving. It was a hard and upsetting time but my Mum turns around  and starts saying all of it was my fault. She knows it isn't but now  gets to the point that she's trying to find sore spots and hurt me. I  don't retaliate. She starts saying she won't visit again, so I say  that's okay, so she says it again, so again I say okay, by the third  time I simple say 'Oh no!' because i'm running out of ideas. She ends up  screaming so much at me I no longer know what she's saying and I just  can't take it anymore. My sister told me I started shouting fuck off! I  eventually according to my sister, say fuck you! And that was when I got  out of the car as we came up to traffic lights. I go back to my Nans  house and travel back home the next day. I decide to make the move and  tell my sister to let my Mum know, I get nothing back. I eventually  about 1-2 weeks later move back to where my family is. No one comes to  meet me and no one calls bar my sister. I decide that despite I'm hurt, I  know nothing will change and I'm trying to start a fresh so decide I'll  say to my Mum she's welcome to come round for a cuppa anytime and we  can either talk about it or leave it. Except before I get a chance she  tells my partner she won't speak to me until I apologize for saying  'fuck you'. My sister tells her I was just going to drop it all and she  says she doesn't care, she isn't changing her mind. I never stooped to  personal insults with intent to hurt like she did during the argument,  in fact I tried to keep on point about what I was hurt about, the 'fuck  you' was the worst thing I said and in retaliation to all the shit she  was yelling at me. It's not a personal insult. I say I won't be saying  sorry but that I am sorry I jumped out of the car and didn't mean to put  anyone at risk as it was a stupid thing to do. That was two months ago.  My birthday comes and she sends a gift, I was going to decline it but  didn't want ot make things worse, so text her saying thank you and I  hoped she was well. She replies: Yes I'm fine thanks, enjoy your day and  happy birthday. That's been the only contact. She's telling people she  doesn't talk to me anymore (not at the moment, 'anymore'). She has told  my sister that if it means we never speak again, then that's just how it  ahs to be. I'm now 20 minutes down the road from my Mum and I haven't  seen her once after  moving away from drama with my partners family and  wanting to finally see more of my own. It hurts and it hurts more than  it only seems to hurt me. I've left out some of the shit she said  because it opens up too many stories to explain. The question is, am I  wrong in not apologizing? She hasn't offered to apologize as well and  doesn't believe anything she did was wrong. I've been called so many  disgusting things by her and had her say so much worse to me. My sister  and her have even got physical in arguments but yet my saying 'fuck you'  seems to be the worst thing ever. What do I do? If she can't and won't  stop insulting me after asking so many times, should I really just lay  down and take it? Really need some advice. Thank you and so sorry for  how long it is!

**tl;dr:  Mum won't speak to me until I apologize for saying 'fuck you' after she  repeatedly insults me in an argument. What do I do?**

7,"Not sure how to summarise without it becoming some sort of cliched psych session. I'm happily married, kids, mid forties and got hit by a bit of a brain fuck today. My 70 something mother decided to clear a load of stuff out in the family home. Its been her residence since before my parents got married 50-odd years ago and me and all of my siblings were brought up there. So, she produced a bag of photos and letters from my first serious girlfriend a lot more than i remember so i take a look as you do and it quickly became a bit of a worm hole to the past. 

Its probably worth summarising the relationship as i remembered it before seeing this stuff today. We met at college her - intelligent, beautiful, from an affluent family, privately educated did i mention beautiful, olive skin pretty, sorted just perfect. me naive, inexperienced but we clicked on every level, mutual attraction, intellectually, socially but after a couple of years she studied abroad as part of her degree course.This was pre mobile phones and we lost touch other than letters and phone calls. I visited her for a month over the holiday season and things were really intense, she did write to me a lot but it dried up a bit towards the end, it all ended in despair, she was due to return in June but i hadnt heard from her and didnt until late summer august time. She had met someone else. We met when she got back (we lived quite a way apart when not at university) it was awkward and then the reality hit me. it took me a good couple of years to get over it. She fucked me over was my go to excuse, she was always ""tempted and looking"" is what i thought and ive sort of reconciled it as that until today.  


Today, i read through the stuff my mother produced. Many more letters than i remember some photos. I was a lot more attractive than I remember in fact i showed my wife some of the photos and she said the i was so hot when i was younger (no way i thought that) 

This whole thing has smashed me in the head. What struck me when i read the letters was that she genuinely loved me, it was there clearly written in every letter i read (not all of them), i was clearly unreasonable, particularly when our relationship headed towards the inevitable break where she headed overseas but i dont remember believing this, I was always looking for a reason to believe my insecurity in those moments, especially when we were apart. when together we were fine but i didn't trust her because i didn't believe anyone could love me. This is what hit me today. I spoke to a couple of friends and realised that i have massively devalued myself and accepted it. Im very successful in my work and older and wiser ( i think) and looking back this has been a huge moment of enlightenment.   


But, i find myself frustrated by the past, if i knew then what i know now it would have been so different. I can see how my self image was so toxic and that i was so besotted with her that i would believe any insecurity about her cheating or leaving me, talk about a self fulfilling prophecy, Its also made me realise that i carry some of that baggage to this day and  i don't need to, i have this huge liberating feeling as a result but also regret. Do those feelings ever go away, those photos really tug at me, its 25 years ago but its moments ago in memory. i have no idea where she is now and im not sure i care but part of me has a will to reconcile and apologise to that beautiful and amazing girl because my self confidence could never believe she loved me for who i was,   


how is it possible to reconcile this alone ?",06Oct2018,1
9,I was with this girl and her two kids for almost 6 months. We've gotten into fights and I've moved out and back in a good handful of times more than I'd want to count. Usually withing 24 hours or less. We recently discovered were having a baby. She's having a baby should I say my previous relationship I had I was under the impression that the kid was mine until he was 2. So now I need it to see it in paper. I've always wanted backpack or hitchhiking and kinda of experience the world taking care of you more or less complete freedom but I've been on probation for the last five years and just got home from prison. If I never got involved in this relationship and felt obligated to another person and her persons the 2 kids who I cared for and still do. I would have probably been to multiple shows and fest and states being a deadhead/hippy because that's kind of who I am. I just wanted some input or second thoughts from someone who doesn't know me. I'd hate to wake up at 40 and be like man remember when I wanted to do that one thing and never did.,06Oct2018,1

We tend to flirt with each other an considerable amount, but I also see her acting the same way to other guy-friends. So I’m wondering what makes me any different. She called me her boyfriend a few times. She really does care for me a lot though by the little things she does. She makes sexual jokes to me. We are pretty touchy with each other. But plenty of times I hear her talking about other guys, and how there aren’t many hot guys at our school. And it really turns me off, and makes me not want to ask her out. We used to snap everyday but she stopped snapping back and I felt things are slow in that department. Not sure what to think.

17,"I graduated in 2016 and went straight into college which probably wasn’t my smartest idea. I wasn’t ready but I wanted to make my grandmother proud before she passed because no one in my family has ever made it to college. I wasn’t sure what I was going to major in or anything I was just working towards my AA degree. 


I finished off freshmen year with a 4.0 and was on the deans list, it felt amazing. I thought hey this could be easy. I was wrong. Sophomore year started off horribly. My uncle, whom I was living with, got bone cancer that spread throughout his entire body and killed him 3 months later. I missed so many classes because I was taking him to and from treatments and trying to spend as much time with him as I could. I just couldn’t catch up after. I fell into a deep depression and just gave up. I failed every class I took for those 2 semesters. 



I don’t think I can qualify for FAFSA anymore because of this. I was on their grant money when I failed and I remember getting some letter in the mail about how my GPA dropped below the level I qualify or something. I threw it away like an idiot. 



I already know any of the credits I do have mostly won’t even transfer because I moved from Minnesota to Texas and they have different criteria. I’m guessing I’ll have to start over completely which sucks but I don’t know what else to do. I can’t remember if I took the SAT or ACT, I feel like I HAD to but I cant remember the scores or anything. I don’t even know how to get my transcripts from my old high school and college. 



I could really use some guidance on what I will need and how/if I can go back to college without taking out huge loans. Also, has anyone done online schooling? Like in those commercials you always see. Are they any good? I still need to work full time while taking classes. Thank you. ",06Oct2018,1
18,"Earlier this month my dog jumped the wall into my neighbors yard. The entire street is on a hill so my back yard is higher than the nieghbors backyard. On my side of the wall - the wall is very short. I don't think the wall even comes up to my waist. On my neighbors side of the wall it's a very tall wall. you would need a ladder to climb over the wall from my neighbors yard to get into mine. The height is important because my dog would not jump all the way to the ground unless he was being taunted or something.  

When this happened My neighbor knocked on our door to let us know that our dog was in her yard. She told us that next time she would have to call Animal control because she takes her garden very seriosuly yadda yadda yadda. Flashforward today, I hear my dog barking. I look out of my second story window and I see the neighbor taunting my dog with a piece of meat trying to get my dog to jump into her yard.

I have to say though I don't know if she was being friendly and just wanted to bond with my dog (very friendly dog loves people) or if she was trying to get him into her yard so that she can call animal control. I'v also heard of stories of people lacing meat with posion and than feeding it to other peoples dogs.

20,"I’m a junior in college and I’ve never had roommates before until now. I have 3 other roommates and we are sharing an apartment. We have our own individual bedrooms and we pay our own rent and we split the common area (living room and kitchen). 

Ok, so two of my roommates get mad that i have this guy I’m seeing over at night. They say they need to know who is in the apartment and if someone is staying the night. (Eventhough the guy would be in MY room). Whenever i have someone over, they are always in my room. They say they need to know because it’s for “safety reasons” and that it’s inconsiderate to have guys over late at night on a weekday. 
**Even though, i pay my own rent and utilities.**

So I just told them that I won’t have anyone over at all anymore. It’s unfair to me but I just don’t like having any problems with anyone especially because I’m stuck with them until the summer 

Last night, they texted who has a guy over and I did text “I do” but my message didn’t deliver so it didn’t go through and i woke up with paragraphs of them freaking out. 

Whenever they hear the front door open or close at night, two of my roommates always texts in the group chat “whose here?? Who left??” And when i don’t answer, she confronts me about it first thing in the morning. 

I’m not sure if she was joking or not but one time my roommate told me to turn on my current location so they know where i am. They all share each other their current location so they know where they are so i think she was serious

I could not handle pregnancy, due to my genetics, mental health issues, etc. I just feel like it would be the right choice after thinking long and hard about it.” She continued to say that all women who get abortions are horrible people, etc. 

2.) She constantly parties, is extremely irresponsible, tried to pressure me to drink and smoke. (I stated I was uncomfortable with it, but she still tried pressuring me) 

3.) I’m in a relationship, and she constantly tells me to check out other guys, etc. I think of myself in that position, if I would like my partner also making comments towards other women, and I wouldn’t. 

4.) She lies to her mother constantly. An example is that shes skipped her first period for over 10 days, has 3 F’s, and got angry when the school called her mother. She lied to her mom saying shes been going and it was the schools fault, and she told both my boyfriend and I this. She complains that her mom is taking privileges away, but wonders why.

5.) Despite me trying to talk to her, etc. All she does is gossip. Literally talks about other people constantly, etc. Also, she calls people her “only best friend” Ive tried changing the subject but it doesn’t seem to help.

Maybe I’m overthinking, but I feel like she just has a lot of growing up to do. If anything, I’m probably just growing away from her. What do you guys think? My boyfriend thinks shes a bad influence when I asked him for advice, he’s seen her behavior. ",06Oct2018,1
23,"I recently found out that my husband's very extended family who I have never met are publishing a book of their entire family tree. I found out there is an entire page about me and my family that includes my personal wedding photos as well as photos taken off of Facebook. The person making this book is not even my Facebook friend nor have I ever met them. 

Nobody got my permission to use my photos. Last week my in-laws told me that they wanted to send my photos to this person and I told them I wasn't comfortable with that and would get back to them on it. Obviously they did that anyway. Am I right in thinking this is kind of weird? I have some anxiety issues and I'm pretty uncomfortable with my picture being out there like that. I'm also not comfortable knowing that somebody has downloaded a Facebook picture of my kid and sent them off to be put in some book somewhere. 

So now the question is what do I do? If I make a big deal out of this my in-laws will cause huge drama as they always do. If I don't do anything my anxiety is going through the roof because having my photos used by others without my control is a big trigger for me. I'm so uncomfortable with the whole situation and I feel violated. One photo taken is the only picture I have up on Facebook of my child. (A birth announcement) The other photo is a really ugly wedding photo that my in-laws decided to scan and send to this person. This photo isn't even online anywhere.

What do you think of the situation Reddit?

TL;DR inlaws extended family is posting my personal photos in a book without my permission and it makes me uncomfortable",06Oct2018,1

33,"So I’ve come here because I’m pretty nervous and don’t know what else to do in the time being. 

A few weeks ago I’ve started having slight groin discomfort, at first it was slight aches that lasted maybe a few minutes but now it has become more of a constant slight ache that’s there throughout the day. 

I had an STD test at my colleges urgent care area, a few days later the test came back negative for chlamydia and gon., but the slight ache is still there. They pescribed me some medicine just in case and I’ve been taking it but the ache still seems to be there. This test was only taken a week or so after the unprotected sex so I’m thinking maybe it was just too early.

During the doctors visit  though, the doctor was feeling my testicle and felt a lump on one of them. They suggested that if this discomfort doesn’t go away with the medicine then I should see my primary doctor to get some tests done.

As the days went on the medicine isn’t seeming to work because I assume it’s not chlamydia or Gonn., so now I’m starting to worry that it could be a lot more seriousness like along the lines of testicular cancer.

Now, I would be more than happy to go to a doctor to get it checked out, but I’m 19 and my health insurance is all messed up because of being filed under my father’s medical but my dad is going through his own stuff where I don’t want to/can’t communicate with him. So now I’m trying to get Medi-Cal for myself indenpendtly but that’s going to take some time I assume. After that I have no idea what to do after I do get accepted.

35,"So, I'm in college, and I'm surrounded by people, But I still haven't really made any friends. I've joined  a club, and also was elected treasurer of my residence hall government, so I'm really happy about that. But anyways like I said, I haven't  really made any friends that I regularly do things with. To tell you a bit about myself, I'm a first year student, and I  went to an all boys high school.  I'm quite introverted, and shy, and I have social anxiety, depression, and ADD. I like taking to people though, and really do want at least one friend, maybe 2 or or even 5 or so. 

I'm especially anxious when talking to girls, even if I just want to be friends with them. I want to be friends with girls, but I'm scared I'll catch feelings for one of them, and I know that won't lead to anything good. 

I'm a bit better at talking to guys, but I usually have nothing in common with most of them, I like metal music, I like playing video games, I'm majoring in environmental science. I've met a few people who like metal as well, but they usually like a different sub genre, whereas I'm into the more generic stuff, like Metallica. No one plays the same games I play, and I'm trying not to spend much of my time playing video games so I can focus more on social interaction. I haven't really met many people who are majoring in environmental science, and the people in the environmental science club don't really seem to want to be friends outside of that. People in my classes are nice enough, and I talk to them, but they also don't seem to want to be friends outside of class.

I've decided there's some things I'm gonna try, there's this girl in my bio class who's in the same hall as me, and I'm gonna ask if she wants to study some time. I want to be friends, but again, im scared I'll catch feelings, because I think she's cute. I've takes to her a bit before so I don't think it's just physical attraction. You might wonder why I'm so scared of catching feelings, it's not because I'm scared of commitment, I'd be willing to have a healthy romantic relationship. I'm scared of everything that comes before that, the awkwardness, the very high possibility of rejection, the awkwardness of remaining just friends if I reveal my feelings. I know it's incredibly unlikely anyone would ever reciprocate feelings for me, and I hate having to deal with heartbreak 
G
In general, I'm not really sure why people don't want to be friends with me, I'm not mean, I'm a very caring and kind person. I think I'm reasonably funny. I'm not sure if they can just tell that I'm strange compared to a lot of people. You can obviously tell that I'm not necessarily the most confident person out there. I'm pretty good at hiding insecurity and sadness. 

I guess I'm kind of stumped and overwhelmed regarding what to do about all of this 

I'm worried people's friend groups are gonna solidify and they won't accept new people, so I know time is of the essence.

40,"TL;DR at end  


So, I met this dude online a few months back. We started talking as friends but we got really close really fast, we clicked really well and by my understanding he felt the same. Often he'd tell me that we fit will together and often joked about being 'soul mates'. 

We never got into an LDR due to him wanting to see me first, but things between us became extremely romantic and heated. He always seemed genuine and honest with me, which for how short we had been talking, was incredible for me because I have extremely bad abandonment and trust issues(I also have clinical depression). He made me....want to love myself. He made me want to be a better person. Something I have a hard time wanting on my own. These new feelings caused me to have greater care in who I am, because I had never really given a shit about myself.  I didn't have a single depressive episode the entire.fucking.time.

&amp;#x200B;

He eventually told me he believed he had fallen in love with me while I knew I was.

&amp;#x200B;

And as if out of goddamn no where he just....stopped. He became more distant. He didn't say the things he usually did. Tapering me off to just an acquaintance. We had talked about it in pieces over the last few weeks as more changed but our last one was when he finally just told me that he didn't know why he felt the way he did and he doesnt know why he suddenly doesnt anymore, but talking about that time makes him extremely uncomfortable and he'd rather pretend it didn't happen and just be 'friends'. He kept telling me he felt guilty for making me feel like shit and this was why he preferred to be single but?? I still don't get it. He later told me he thought it was because he was just craving affection but that's really hard for me to believe.

&amp;#x200B;

He's still talking to me everyday but its not the same. It almost feels fake. I've been high off my ass for days to try and avoid having to deal with it emotionally. In all my relationships, I've never had anything like this, and I haven't felt this crushed and lied to before.   


TL;DR, guy I was involved with online suddenly stops having feelings for me and he apparently doesn't know why and wants to pretend it never happened.

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm asking is, has this happened to anyone else? Where someone just....stops for no reason. Suddenly seems to almost hate you. Did you find out a reason? Should I quit talking to him all together or should I carry on with whatever the hell it is that he's doing?",06Oct2018,1

I live in a shared house with me (male) and four girls, and a new guy moved in. Since he has moved in, two of the girls coined calling him by only his full name, and since carrying on this joke they have taken to constantly chanting his name like it was a meme, and in certain situations even singing his name down the road with all our girl friends. Being as he's just moved in and he's a timid guy, I'm really worried that they're freaking him out. He seemed to not care, but tonight they kept shouting his name round the house after a night out while he was sleeping, which would definitely freak me out if I was trying to sleep. I care about my roommates a lot; they are very close friends, but I feel so uncomfortable myself with it as it's just a really weird thing to do. What should I do? Should I try to ignore it, or talk to them about it? The new guy is really chill and I've been getting on with him so it would suck if he left.

The flat decided to go out for drinks, I got ready, met the girls in my flat in the kitchen  and that one girl, left me speechless. 

Unfortuately enough, I can't get easily drunk and the girls did. The gay guy in my flat took care of one girl and basically forced me to take care of the other girl. This girl wasn't a happy drunk, but a person with a tortured pass and felt extremely guilty. She was crying and holding my hand saying she hates herself and don't know why I'm not using her like the other guys. Well I just said to her that it isn't right to take care of the girl with an ulterior motive. I put her in her bed and made sure she didn't choke on her sick.

She then apologised profusely and cooked me lunch once which I was thankful of. But then we got talking and I felt immediately felt closer to this person, we talk at night about issues and about our days.

I will try to be as brief as possible.  

**Some background information** : I'm an introvert, spent the most of my life playing video games, not by choice : had a hard childhood, got bullied a lot (at school, home, and even in the street, mainly because of my look) and that was my only way out. I have some family members and a friend to whom I talk, they're trying to help me, but they can't do much.

**Symptoms** : 

\-**In brief** : Bad memory, can't focus, impatient, depressed, unable to do/understand what others find so easy.

\-**Examples :** 

***\*I can't read books***, I doubt I have ever read one, not because I don't like reading, but because I feel like I'm not learning anything, I do understand the words (I use a dictionary when I don't), but I don't get the ideas, what is going on... doesn't matter how hard I try, and I give up quickly to be honest, because I've really lost hope on myself. All what I'm reading is post on Quora and here on Reddit, and when I ask myself what I've read 5 minutes later, 90% of the times I won't have any idea other than the title...

***\*I can't listen***, doesn't matter if it's a lecture in class, someone explaining to me or I'm watching a video, I will miss the most of what is being told... taking notes doesn't really help, first because of the reading problems, and second because I miss even more when I try.

***\*I forget a lot***, I can look for the same word in the dictionary several time and forget it after each time, I lose my way to places I went to several times before etc...  

\****I can't organize my life***, like I can't plan to do several things, an example is when I want to study, I won't think about other things, I will just do my best to do whatever the task is, fail (the most of the time), get depressed, go to my bed and start beating my self up while crying or watching some stupid videos, I can't find the will to do anything, even eating, sometimes all I eat is ice cream...  

I know that may be ADD/ADHD, or some other known disease, it's just that this information won't really help me for now, I'm looking for things I can do, solutions I can try.

I am just let down entirely. I barely even talked to this person. I wear an uniform so like I am not dressing in any type of way. I have a boyfriend. I even talk about my boyfriend so like that person clearly knows. I said, ""I am good. Thank you"" when he said to go to his room. Gross. I did not know what the fuck to say. And apparently the other people knew about it, other coworkers. No one said well that is a terrible idea. I hate the people I am surrounded with. I hate the people I work with.

52,"Before I start, I know the best answer is probably ""do nothing"" but I want to get out my story and hopefully get some advice.

So this started about 1.5 years ago. I was working on a projects team and the project manager got promoted during a rather large multi year project. Being the individual that knew the most about the project I was asked to take over as the lead until they hired someone for the role. I was also told to apply if I were interested.

I decided not to pursue that position for personal reasons. My son was a couple months old, we had just moved into a new house and this position would require a ton off mandatory over time. 

About a month later, the company hired a project manger to fill the position. I started getting them up to date, and a couple weeks into his training he got called to a new project that he was needed on, leaving my project without a PM again. Again I was asked to continue helping out whilethey assessed the situation to see what was needed. 

Fast forward about 5-6 months and I've still been leading this project without any compensation for it. I had re evaluated my personal situation at this time and had a better understanding of the role, so I went to my superior to see what could be done. They advised me that they were looking to have another PM position created in hopes I would take that. I thought that was great. 

I was essentially given the run around for another 6(ish) months. I kept pressing the issue and getting very few answers. Finally one day my superior advised me that the CEO of the company did not approve the me promotion. At this point I was 90% out the door, but was offered a similar position (and pay) in a different department (for a much better manager).

This seemed like the end of the ordeal and I was finally getting a promotion and pay that is been doing the work for a year and a half already. I was ok with how everything transpired, not happy, but ok. 

My manager immediately posts my old position and they quickly hire someone internal whom I know very well. I was excited for her and was glad to be training her before I left. I was chatting with her today and she let it slip that the pay for this position for her was much better than she was anticipating. She let me know that she got a 20k raise (good for her). I was taken back because I knew what she made prior to her new position.

So before all this took place I was paygrade B and my new replacement was paygrade A. Our salaries were very similar (3-4k) different at that point. I got promoted two paygrades to grade D and she got promoted to grade B. I got roughly $13k total for the promotion and she got $20k for her promotion. Putting her around 3-7k above me.

The question is how the hell do I address the fact that I was doing that job for a year and a half with no increase and they hire my replacement for almost a 50% pay increase?! And is there anything I can do or say to my former manger to let them know how shitty this is while still keeping my job?",06Oct2018,1

Sometimes, though, he has a little bit of a “king shit” kind of personality. It shows up in the form of when he has something to brag about he brags a LOT, and he expects people to shower him with praise. When I or somebody else has something to share, however, he doesn’t want to let us have it. He’ll try to either diminish the accomplishment by turning it into a joke, or he’ll start talking shit and openly downplaying it on rare occasions.

62,"Almost 4 years ago I developed chronic, long term side effects from a prescription drug that I didn't react well to. The first year of getting these problems I never imagined that they would still be here today -- I thought that they would disappear on their own eventually. Two years into having it I nearly lost my sanity and went through a terrible depression. Now, well into the third year of having these problems, I've finally come to a point where I want to try to make things as easy as I can for myself. I'm trying to reconcile my past self with my present self, and I'm constantly trying to figure out better ways to approach life. I still struggle with a lot of things though.

The biggest problem I struggle with now is consistency. I have good days where I am hopeful for the future, motivated to do work, and (in that moment) convince myself that these chronic problems do not have to stop me from living my life to the fullest. I also have bad days where I am the exact opposite of all that I just said, but I tend to have more bad days than good. I'm currently going through a good phase.

With that being said, it feels like I have little to no control over what type of day I'll be having when I wake up, and I'm trying to learn ways that will allow me to steer myself towards more good days than bad.

I'm not even sure where to start when approaching this problem. I try putting the state of my health into perspective, but I somehow always end up being frustrated and then terribly upset about it for some period of time before springing back up just to fall back down another day. I try using my circumstances as a way to motivate myself to do better so that maybe one day I can help others with the same problems, but then I dwell on the perceived futility of it all. I've joined online support groups with people suffering from similar problems, but I've found that they often make me more depressed because everyone tends to just complain about their problems instead of actively looking to improve themselves in any way possible.

I've thought about seeing a therapist, but I honestly have no idea if they're equip to help me with the problems I'm facing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.

66,"Here’s the story:

One month ago I decided to send my broken laptop to a chain repair shop, because that was the only repair shop that was able to do motherboard repairs. 

The chain repair shop works like this: I call the corporate number, and they assign the closest repair shop(chain shop)’s repairman to fix my computer. Then he comes to my home and takes my laptop.

The assigned repairman said that the south-bridge was broken, and it can be replaced with the same exact chip. So I waited for 4 weeks, and the weird thing was, after week 1, the repairman said he can bring the laptop tomorrow, but he kept repeating that day by day. That kept going on until week 2, when he said there are too many repairs incoming, and he is doing his best. He said that the repair would be finished by next week. So after a week has passed, I thought he finished his work, but they did not answer my call at all. He kept declining my call and sent me an automated reply saying “I am busy. Please call me back later.”. Because the repairman’s contact method was through his personal phone, I texted him, but there were no replies everytime I sent him a message.

But on week 4, he called me saying “I managed to attach the south-bridge on the motherboard, but when it boots into Windows, the south-bridge keeps dying, so I think we need to replace the motherboard.”

I told him to replace the motherboard. He said he will be finished by next week. And he would give me a phone call

So I waited. THERE WERE NO FUCKING PHONE CALLS FROM HIM, AND HE KEEPS DECLINING MY CALL. With the SAME EXACT AUTOMATED REPLY.

At this point I tried calling the corporate number, and they said “Sorry, we cannot help you. Our job here is to assign repair shops to do repairs. But I can give you the repair shop’s number.”

So I called that number. The idiot keeps repeating the same fucking words. “Okay, we will inform the repairman to call you back.”. I told them that the repairman keeps declining my call and I need to urgently use my laptop. He said “Sorry, please talk with the repairman. Goodbye” then hanged up.

I am at a total loss here. The repair shop is at an undisclosed location, and they cannot tell where they are located according to their policies.

And I have projects coming up and the video render times on my temporary old laptop is really really slow.

I need to take back my laptop now, but I have no way of contacting the repairman.

What should I do at this point?

I live in South Korea. 

My laptop is an Samsung ATIV Book 8. 

I am a student with puberty.

74,"Orginally I tried to do nursing. Doing the theory work and so on was fine yet when I did placement I found I absolutely hated it and it would benefit no one for me to continue in that line of work.

However I am interested in laboratory work, hence I'm trying to get into study next year for a cert 3 in laboratory skills to try get into traineeships for mineral and soil lab technician roles. Where I am is remote but is mining country. There's also various trainneeships/apprenticeships going that I'm applying for.

Where I work currently is in a hospitality job. What I'm considering if I cant get in for any traineeships/apprenticeships is continue my current work, save, and do the study course while my workplace is offering a cert 4 in management as well. I'm basically applying for any traineeship/apprenticeship (even though I would rather do lab work) so I can get training and work then eventually have some type of skill instead of getting hit with debt through uni studying something I'm unsure about or stay stuck in hospitality roles. 

However if I go towards the direction of staying where I work, saving, studying cert 3 in lab skills, and going for the cert 4 in management. Apply for traineeships in 2020 around the lab tech roles instead. The long term goal is if I'm successful in becoming a lab tech is then go ahead towards university for a bachlors of laboratory science or pathology. Because I eventually want to go towards mineral as well as medical related sciences. Yet make if more ""official"" with a degree only if I get in with the lab tech role first. 

Otherwise go for the other traineeships/apprenticeships and gain a trade/skill that gets me tf out of hospitality. I've meet too many people who for example: become a school teacher get paid 60k first year but also have 60k debt they have to pay back and hate their job, otherwise people with 80k university debt who can't get even get a job with their degree. I only had 7k debt when I dropped out and paid it back so currently I have no debt while the place I will be studying through only has 13 sections at $300 per section and takes a year to complete. The cert 4 in management is free through work, meanwhile the traineeships/apprenticeships are free as well hence why I would prefer those before going back to uni.

Despite that today I found myself thinking how easy it would have been for it to all end. How easy it would have been to just swerve a little to the right and hit the side of an 18 wheeler. How easy it would have been to not put my foot on the breaks when I saw a sea of red lights in front of me. How easy it would have been to just drank myself using an open tab until my body just gave up. This morning, I felt like everything was lined up. I felt like all of it, was about to click. Like if I was on the precipice of happiness. 

Yet as the day went on, every corner was disappointment. I saw the apartment of a friend that I admired, that I thought was in a perfect situation, and the condition of it was sad. And I couldn’t help but think, he should strive for more. And the thought echo’d, the truth is that aside from the unbearable smell, my situation didn’t look any better. I had more potential, yet the situation I’m in is so much worse. 

It’s weird, it’s imposible to comprehend really. The difference, not in my friend’s situation vs what I tough he was in, but in me. I was never a brad Pitt, but I could manage. I had a charm, an affinity for really being able to just talk to a person and have them listen. And it’s just gone. 

Online, easy, I can(or I really should say could) express myself very similar to who I was. I can(could) show my true colors sort of speak. But as time went on, I think even that what’s gone. I can’t explain it, I don’t know why, but it’s as if the me and that enjoyed people just died. 

How easy it could have been for me to just keep driving and never stop. How easy it would have been for me to just throw my phone out the window and just disappear. I talk to my family ever day, and I have a good relationship with them, yet the thought persists that I could easily just go. 

Again, not suicide. There’s no merit to that, if there’s an afterlife there’s just damnation, and if there isn’t then it’s a waste. But just *poof*. 

I should want more for myself. I should be striving for greatness. Yet I have no desire to do so. I should want to be the other me, yet I make absolutely no effort to do so. I know all the reason why I should, but I just don’t. It’s a life that I feel doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things, and I see no reason to believe it ever would. 

The world is moving in a direction where it just doesn’t mean anything. How the fuck can people exist who see no value in empowering their own society. How the fuck can we as people, just want to make our buck and care nothing for people. It’s a fucked situation, and I can’t stop thinking that. 

My life doesn’t suck, I wasn’t abused as a child, and I didn’t shoot my self in the foot with alcohol or drugs. Yet why does it feel so unimportant... how easy it would have been to just never have known this world... ",06Oct2018,1

87,"My husband &amp; I have the Telus hub with their biggest plan (500 gb at over 110$/month). However, since we switched in may from our old internet supplier, we go over in data almost every month. We didn't before we switched. Our internet habits haven't changed drastically except for the fact that my husband is home with me all day, but he's not online as we both work and have a newborn baby. The problem is, there are days where we regularly blow through 30 GB of data a day (according to Telus). This month,  by day 20 in our billing cycle, we are now out of data. If we continued, we'd rack up 1300$ in overages this month!!! 

We do have some smart appliances, 3 smart TV's (sometimes we run 2 tvs but usually one, if any at all), Phillips hue bulb, cell phones, and I work from home w/ 2 laptops (only 1 needs internet) which were connected to dropbox/cloud. I stopped all updating on the cloud accounts last month when we were trying to figure out what could be causing so much data to be used.

You do?”  He’ll also say stuff at random times like “I’m going to stick a finger in my butt and swirl it around.” Then he’ll start laughing really loud and hard. He’ll tell me I didn’t grow up with “real” brothers. 

I used to try to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to laugh but I can’t seem to make myself do it anymore. Instead, I’ll ignore it and change the subject or say something like “can you please just say hello instead?” But he’ll tell me I’m boring and that I take everything too personally. He’ll say “I thought I married a fun person.” I feel bad about hurting his feelings but I want to be able to be myself too and not laugh at things I don’t think are funny.

91,"Alright so here’s the story.

So a few days ago my neighbor told me to make sure to lock my car doors because someone just broke into her car and stole her wallet. So I said I was sorry that happened to her, thanks for heads up, etc. 
Fast forward to today, I was sitting in my living room, and through my blinds I see a man walk behind my backyard. I didn’t really think anything of it because mine and my neighbor’s backyard is extremely close to each other. So I thought it was maybe my neighbor trying to get catch his dog, or possibly of lawn care service provided by our HOA because it was weed eating day. So I just ignored it. About 2 hours later I walk out, and on my table outside, was all my neighbor’s stolen stuff. Like License, insurance information, credit cards, gift cards, everything all laid out on my table. This was in clear view from my neighbor’s house because our houses are so close together. My first thought was that someone is trying to frame me for stealing her stuff. So I immediately took it over. She wasn’t there but I gave it to her mom and her sister. I didn’t know how to explain that I had all of her daughter’s stuff and that it was “just sitting in my backyard”. But that’s what I said. They had a really puzzled look on their face, and just said “thank you” then another guy walks out of their house and I wasn’t positive, but I was pretty sure that was the same guy that walked behind my house 2 hours prior. He goes through and is counting all the cards and says “thanks man” and walks inside.

Like WTF just happened? Did that guy steal from his own family and try to pin me for it? Should I contact the police? I don’t want to make an accusation about something because I’m not sure if he was the one that planted it. What should I do?",06Oct2018,1

Even though its purely for medical reasons (I *do* like how it looks when I tuck my shirt into a long skirt though) I'm still really scared to go out in a skirt. I am naturally very androgynous and have been verbally attacked under suspicion of being a trans woman before. I have even been corned and called the t-slur in a bathroom before. I wasn't even wearing any women's clothes.  

I don't leave the house much at all. If I could go out in a skirt I know I could be way more active and be out for way longer. I'm just really scared of other's reactions. And not in a ""people will laugh"" at me way, but in a ""people will seriously physically hurt me for this way"".

1. I work at a grocery store, I'm cashier, and I work in the front end department. For the past couple months, I've been trying to move to the grocery department and become a stock boy. For the past 3 weeks, I've been scheduled as a stock boy and also a cashier. I was making the transition slowly by working 1 or 2 grocery shifts and about 3 cashie shifts and the plan was soon I would fully move to grocery

2. I have really great relationships with all my coworkers, and I genuinely pride myself in my work 

Recently started going to college while working. I gave my employer a revised availability sheet. But they kept scheduling me during class or late the night before class. It's been stressful. I've been getting anxiety attacks regularly throughout the day since I started school and work. Last Tuesday a few hours before my shift I had a meltdown unlike any I had before. I called my front end supervisor and told her I couldn't come in. She asked me why I was calling out and I felt uncomfortable with sharing, so I lied and told her I just had a cold. Looking back on this I shouldn't have lied, but she shouldn't have asked either. So after I got off the phone with her I waited until my mom got home. I told her I was anxious and how i haven't sleeping. So she took me to the emergency room so I could be seen that day. Overall the experience was needed. I was told that I have severe anxiety and depression. After the appointment my mom took me out to get some food and talk about my next step. We went to a restaurant near the mall. As we were walking to the restaurant I saw my head manager through the window. I  didn't really want to talk to him so we walked over to another place kinda discreetly. After that day I saw him at work and he didn't say anything to me so I assumed he didn't see me. 


Fast forward to a few days ago I was walking past a few employees and my manager. As I walk past the manager says ""Hanging out at the mall after you call in sick huh!?"". All of the workers stopped what they were doing at looked at me. I said ""oh I was just eating dinner with my family"". Then he said "" that's not how it works when your sick, you're supposed to stay home. Not go out to the mall"". I just kinda chuckled and kept doing my work. It was horrible, I felt so guilty. But my coworkers think Im lazy and they've been really distant. On top of that I was trying to get a job change and start working in another department and I don't think I'm being considered anymore since I stopped showing up on the schedule. I talked to the head of the grocery department why I wasn't being scheduled anymore and she was vague and cold about it. She said it's because I couldn't work Thursdays (during class). I told her I could work after class and she was just kinda avoiding the question. 

How can I fix this?

I have a perpetual annoyance towards my mom. She’s been in school her whole life having my dad pay for her tuition each time and saying she will “pay him back and take care of him” once she graduates. It’s been 20 years and she’s graduated and gone back to school 3 times now, being unemployed and acting bedridden for 10/20 years. I can never trust her with anything anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you, stop yourself from becoming drenched in bitterness, how do you stop yourself from seething this kind of ugliness...

&amp;#x200B;

As my user may oh so explicitly imply, I have a tendency to be bitter. And its not something I always enjoy...   
I struggle to cope with this feeling of what I can only most accurately describe as absolute inner ugliness.

It creeps in and I feel like a piece of shit, so then I either go really high (fustration, anger) or really low (fustration, saddness, disappointment, shame, basically sadness due to my fear of anger). 

Problem is that while this isn't a constant, the people who this has a tendency to flare up around are a constant part of my life. I love them but it could be said that I often have other choice words for them as well.. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's really not such a quick simple fix as ""well why don't you express those said choice words to them"" because I do LOVE these people. An honestly, doing this would be cruel, it wouldn't help me, it'd actually hurt me quite honestly and it would most certainly hurt them... 

&amp;#x200B;

So... How do you deal with embitterment? 

  
Reminding myself of whats true (the colour I see the grass to be is green, same-line-of-statement with the sky is blue, what my age is etc.)

Holding my breath and pretend I'm sinking

Punching my legs til I see a bruise or til my weak self can't cause it hurts too much

Is not effective. And most importantly, its not so much helping.

So how does everybody else deal with this..??

At its climax, she broke up with me even though we still had a 3 year lease on a rental house.  Many bills in their name were left unpaid, She started beating me, and threatening to tell police that I had abused her if I didnt give her money. She started using hard drugs, and I would come home to find her with several men in bed together. I had to contact the authorities several times when she would get physical, and finally she left. 

I feel like I cant quite live my life anymore, because even though shes gone, she had a tendency to stalk and obsess over her exes. Even after everything, I only talked to the authorities when I had to, and never pressed charges out of fear. I did not want to have to face her in court, and I do not want to face any retaliation like shattered windows or worse. They never took me seriously anyway because I was a guy. We dont live too far from eachother now (only a couple towns away), because I am unable to afford to move, and I have since setup a really nice life for myself. I feel really scared that I will start noticing things like popped tires on my car, scary notes, or maybe even a formal accusation of abuse if she was ever short on money and attempted to sue. Even if they didnt win, it would be horrible to be accused by them of the very thing done to me.

 I just want to put it behind me, I want to forget this chapter in my life even happened, but is there anything I can do to prepare for if they start harassing me?

117,"So I have a crush on this guy who was my lawyer for about 6 months at the beginning of the year. During a phone call towards the end of our professional relationship, hearing him laugh and giggle at my words, it hit me. *Damn do I like that voice.*

I'm a university student, and I have no idea how old he is, but I'd guess he's in his mid thirties, max.

I ran into him outside his offices the other day and he just happened to be walking his dog. This was the perfect opportunity to make a move, but I got so awkward that I excused myself before giving it a shot. I felt like I was intruding on him somehow, even though we both just happened to be outside the building at the same time.

I keep thinking: What if he's in a relationship? *He used the royal ""we"" when talking about getting the dog*. ""*We* got her for x amount of dollars."" Who is *we*? A girlfriend, perhaps? What if he's gay, or doesn't think of me that way at all? Could he have just been being nice for the sake of professionalism? Is this pushing some sort of unspoken boundary between former clients?

I have no idea how to go forward, because damn do I want to kiss that face, but the only way I know to reach him is through his work contacts. That or ""accidentally"" bumping into him outside of work, but that just makes me feel creepy as fuck. How do you even ask out your former lawyer who could be \~10 years your senior?

I really enjoyed having him as one of my lawyers, and I'm considering going into law myself. Their team sent me off with a lot of compliments about my wit and intelligence, with him specifically encouraging me to take steps to convince the main partner to take me on as an assistant. It's been a couple weeks now, and I still haven't heard back from her (the main partner) so I don't think that'll happen. But now I'm *especially* unsure of if it's appropriate to want to stay in contact with the guy (even just moving to pursue a friendship). I really don't want to make him uncomfortable :(

Mr. Lawyer, if you're reading this - please make the first move ;)

tl;dr - I want to take things past ""attorney client privilege"" with an older man, am too awkward to even pet his new puppy

119,"So I've only been working in this job for about 5 months now. My boss and coworker have honestly done so much for me i feel like i owe them and my relative who got me this job. I have overheard my boss and coworker talking about me and how much they like me and want me to stay, and my coworker has directly told me how much he values me in the company.  I feel pressured to keep this job for the foreseeable future both by them and my family. 

But i honestly don't enjoy it. It feels like i have to sacrifice my personal life while working this job because of how much work i need to do. Working 6 days a week 8-10 hours a day. But when a deadline is coming and im not gonna finish in time basically work until its done. I've worked up to 15 hour days, slept at work and no day off for 2 weeks. 

I've spoken to some friends and my parents about it and they are basically calling me an idiot and saying how lucky i am to have such a high paying job at a young age (19, earning well into the 4 digits per week). They tell me that i should just grow up because this is the real world. Telling me to stick it out while im young so i can set myself up for the future. They think im a child because my reasons for not wanting to travel for work are trivial. Games, missing out on various events i want to go to, being able to relax at home on the computer or tablet etc. While i can see why people think these are stupid reasons to not want to work at this job, these are what i like to do in my spare time. Not having this spare time to do the things i want to is honestly mentally straining over time. I can't relax while im away because work is always on my mind and I can't have the comforts of home with me. 

Am i being childish? Am i just some spoilt young kid who doesn't understand the real word? The feeling of disappointing the people around me is pressuring me to keep this job. But the more time goes on, the more stressed i feel, the tighter my chest feels and the more pressure i feel. I feel like over time this is just going to build up to a point when im just gonna lose it, which has happened in the past for other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

A little context: I used to be a part of my high school's improv club/team. I was part of the club for my freshman and sophomore years before I left for community college. The improv club helped and my drama teacher shaped me into the person I am today, so I wanted to go back and help. I had been gone for a year before I finally had time to return regularly to attend the practices and shows. A lot had happened between then and now.  
Up until last year, we had a powerhouse trio that were extremely talented and also trusted each other a lot on stage (they played in six musicals together). After they left for college, the team basically exploded due to a variety of factors, but one big reason was due to a huge falling out between two girls (We'll call them K and E). They used to be best friends, but over time, they ended up just drifting apart. That led to this huge argument between the two, where a bunch of people took K's side and ended up alienating E.

So, here's the issue. I was brought on by my old drama teacher (who serves as the club's manager) to help the team both in performance and personally, since I know and am fairly close with everyone. I am also both friends with K and E. I understand that they both individually have their issues.   
E is immature (people-wise), incapable of really understanding others, and cannot truly open up about herself. K is egotistical, selfish, and sometimes can be quite inconsiderate.   
Both have their positives, however. E is incredibly responsible, and sets good examples for other people. She can be patient and considerate, which was a part of the reason why she got to be a captain of the club. K is amazingly artistic. She has a flair for the arts and incredible passion. She has bursts where her creativity and passion can be unmatched. K also has the ability to consider things from a much bigger point of view.   
Since they are both senior members of the club, the way they interact with each other affects the entire team. E has a lot of personal issues and stress. Her dog recently passed, and on the anniversary of her mother's death. That along with needing to manage the club, applying to college, and her classes puts her in a situation of incredible stress. However, the way she treated K and K's friends is still not forgivable. E was completely rude, and did not care if she trampled on the feelings of the others.

How can I get E to understand what she did was wrong, and how can I get K to understand that E has personal issues to deal with? I want them to reconcile but I want to remain impartial to them both, so as not to alienate them from the rest of the team and push them further away from each other (+ it's my literal job to remain as impartial as possible).

124,"Hey all,

As a short backstory, I did fairly well high school - got fairly good grades, in sports, kinda put effort into studying, and had a fair grasp on math and science. I'm in my second year of college and tried aerospace engineering last year but ended up switching to mechanical engineering for this year (I found aerospace to be kind of boring and too specific). Last semester, I did not put  much energy into studying and doing well and it resulted in me basically having to retake the semester again, but with mechanical engineering courses instead of aerospace. However, i'm in my second year now, 3rd semester total, and am having second thoughts on engineering.

My buddies are a semester ahead so I have a good look at what they are doing and it looks like stuff that I wouldn't be able to handle, at least understand well. What i'm questioning is whether or not I should stick with it, or figure something else out. If I would drop engineering in total, what other options could I pursue? Looking at what they are covering (Materials, statics, and differential equations, etc. ) looks like stuff I would absolutely hate to spend my time doing. I know it would be awesome to get a degree in ME for a career, however I really don't think I would want to spend my life stuck in an office doing ridiculously hard math problems, writing reports, and what not. I would rather be out doing something, not just sitting at a desk forever.

127,"Hi all,

So, this girl is much younger than I am. She's a classmate at university. We were dating for about a year. It ended over the summer when she admitted to having cheated on me multiple times with multiple partners over the previous month. She has impulse control issues, and I am not always as in touch with my emotions as I should be, so I eventually forgave her and agreed that we could be friends. At one point, we did some acid (lol) and spent the entire night talking, and did end up hooking up again. I realize that this was dumb of me. Anyway, the very next day, she slept with my best friend, and has continued sleeping with him for the past few months. He has told me multiple times that he is very sorry and that it would stop. It hasn't stopped. Suffice to say this has put a serious damper on our friendship. But, he's not really my problem.

My real problem is that for a variety of reasons I have to continue to interact with this girl on a fairly regular basis (we have to work somewhat closely together for a committee we both serve on, among other things - I'm the treasurer, she's in charge of fundraising and events). I can't even think about her without getting furious inside...but I seem to be able to compartmentalize and work with her without thinking about her. Somehow. For now.

This new job market is incredibly tough.  Most jobs either want the freshest college grads or people with 6+ years of experience, with almost nothing in between (that's where I am!)

I've always found it very difficult to go out and socialize on my own.  I've historically had existing friends introduce me to new friends and new scenes.  There's a ton of stuff to do here in this city, but I've basically spent the last 9 months sitting in front of my computer.

I am 22 still live at home with Abusive + Toxic parents. I have signed up for the Job Corps and that was basically my plan to leave for good. Unfortunately the process is taking longer than I expected. . . It's been over 6 weeks since I heard anything back from the Admission Counselor. This place is really toxic for me and I wake up everyday feeling like shit wishing I was somewhere else. My parents threaten me when i tell them that I want to leave home, but on every other day I get called a failure for still living with them at 22. The reason I don't have a job is because I have crippling anxiety (caused by my parents abuse).

I'v been battling mental health issues - in and out of hospitals, rehabs etc. After my last overdose we all agreed it would be a good idea if I moved back in with my parents but they have made everything worse. My mom took away all my Doctor prescribed medication because ""she doesn't believe in drugs"". Without my knowledge or consent she emptied out all the pillbottles on the table and crushed them up and flushed them down the toilet. This led to SEVERE withdraws for about a month I could not get out of bed. I thought I was going to die. And with my dad - the other day was choking me out on the ground after I had a disgreement with my sister. He interrupted our argument midsentence thew me on the ground and was choking me out. I was scared he was going to kill me with him being bigger than i am. He has choked me out several times in my life and he is a main reason I struggle with mental health issues. This altercation ended with my blood smeared on the walls in the living room.

I try to not cause any problems. I spend at least 20 hours in my room on a daily basis - only leaving my room at night after everyone is asleep to avoid arguments or fights that can literally end in my death. due to my anxiety I don't have friends. I don't leave the house. and everything is fucking awful.

I can't keep living like this but I'm not sure if being homeless is any better.

The Job Corps application process can take up to 6months in some cases... I'v already played the waiting game and i don't want to sit in this house for 6 more months.

138,"Hi all,

As is posed in the title, are my parents being unreasonable in wanting me to postpone dating until I have a more established career?

To provide some context, I’ve recently graduated from a top school and currently live at home while I take a gap year as I apply to professional school. Originally, I had planned on going on dates/ finding a boyfriend during this time, but my parents (despite being open-minded on all other matters) seem strongly opposed to it. They believe that I should wait until I get into my professional school of choice before entertaining the thought of getting a boyfriend…

And not to sound as if my tooting my own horn or anything, but I have been told classmates and friends that I am “pretty”. I’ve had really attractive and interesting guys asked me out on dates, guys  who I have been very interested in getting to know, but I have turned them all down as I’m aware  that my parents would not be happy with this (despite some of  these guys having money too … not that it should matter, but to illustrate that my parents want me to succeed on my own terms). My friends are always flabbergasted as to why I turn these guys down to which I reply that “I’m not interested in a relationship right right now” when in actuality, it’s because I still live at home and that my parents have done so much to support me (paying all of my college tuition) so I would hate to disappoint them.  
Now  I know there’s nothing wrong with dating at this age, everyone does, but my parents seem super conservative on this front.  They are fine with me hanging out with friends but the thought of going on a date with a guy is just a no-go which makes this all the more frustrating! Am I wrong to feel this feel? Or are they reasonable in their expectations?

I’ve been thinking about this issue for quite some time and haven’t been able to share this with anyone (even to my closest friends) as I feel this is rather embarrassing. I don’t mean to wallow in self-despair or or whatever, but this is something that has been bothering me for quite some time… I would appreciate your thoughts on this! ",06Oct2018,1
139,"Pretty nervous to post this. My sister is 4 years older than me. Starting somewhere when I was around 6 or 7, we engaged in sexual-like activities. Obviously at first it was just exploration, as she was around 10 or 11, but this continued until I was around 10 and she was 14. As I can remember, I cut the thing off. I remember that I when I did it, it was because it felt weird/wrong. Now, a lot of the details on exactly what happened are pretty fuzzy because I was younger, but I can kind of remember some of what happened. At the beginning it was the usual kind of exploration stuff that happens when you're a child. As I said, I was around 6 or 7 and she was around 10 or 11. It had an obvious sexual vibe to it but I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. I can't remember much of what followed, but I do remember that the last, and in my memory most significant, wave of it started off by tongue kissing. Then it progressed, fairly quickly, to obviously, definitely, sexual stuff. We would sneak it in every time our parents weren't home, and I think I can remember doing some more minor stuff even when they were(they never found out). This would've been around when I was 9 and 10, and she was  13 and 14, I believe(again, all of this stuff is real fuzzy, I could be off by a bit but I don't believe it could've been earlier. Could've been later, though). When it ended, I initiated, but then I told her to stop. For some reason, it just felt wrong then. 

Throughout this all, I was the submissive party as far as I can recall, but it was never violent or aggressive. I was consenting. 

I'm just afraid of making a mountain out of a molehill, but I do have to wonder, could this have had a significant effect on me? Lately I've been feeling really weird about my sexuality. I know my sexuality started a bit earlier than most people, probably right around 9 or 10, and I can't help but feel like this might've had something to do with it. Also, as ashamed as I am to say this, the family and sexuality lines have always been a little blurred for me, especially when it comes to my sister, and I feel like this is probably the root of it. I've had a lot of anxiety and intrusive thoughts surrounding my sexuality, and sexuality has always had a power link for me. I wonder if this is the reason why. 

As for my final questions, was this bad? Was it a form of abuse? I've had people say yes, but at the same time, I really don't want to make a big deal out of nothing. Even if it is, I won't tell anyone about it except like my therapist or something. My sister and I are on great terms now and we've never spoken about it, I would definitely be too afraid to initiate that conversation. I just want to to know if this could've been a significant event that could've had a significant effect on me. ",06Oct2018,1

143,"I’ve been battling chronic suicidal depression and anxiety for 10 years, but it’s at the point were almost any minor inconvenience makes me want to off myself, and my recently assigned medication(Zoloft for clarity) just decides whenever the hell it wants to “work”. I also struggle with being alone(who doesn’t) and usually just try to help others even if it hurts me in the end.

My friend told me to focus on myself and to better myself, but my mental state is just...weird because I can’t see any redeeming qualities about myself, and thinking about “who I am as a person” usually flairs of the suicidal thoughts.

What do I do?",06Oct2018,1
144,"[This was originally posted to r/relationships where it was removed by mods who cited a rule about “general” posts. I’m posting it here because I need advice about this specific situation and evidently it’s not so rare as to be specific rather than general. /snark. Thanks in advance for any and all thoughts and advice. I appreciate it.]

TLDR- I (30+ - married male) want to make a female friend to travel and hang out with; I don’t know how. Halp. (unfortunately, my wife doesn’t have any friends who I can poach who would either be down to take trips with me or who could afford to do it, which is another problem because obviously I also need friends who can afford to do stuff. This is hard my dudes. Help appreciated.) 
**[EDIT- This is not a sinister and needlessly complicated and expensive scheme to bang other women. If I wanted to do that, I expect there are simpler and cheaper ways. However the suspicion in some of the replies illustrates a difficulty I expect to encounter. I really do just want a friend and travel buddy.]**

I am married—have been for the better part of a decade. I am happily married! My wife is also happily married (to me!). 

All that said, I don’t have any female friends. I used to have lots but moved and changed jobs and lost touch and lost common interest. 

I am now in a position to travel quite a lot and would like to, but because of work my wife cannot travel. We try to take an annual vacation together, but the bottom line is that — for me — it isn’t enough. Travel is the thing that keeps me going and happy the rest of the year but my wife’s job is just too demanding of her time to permit her to travel with any frequency. 

I suck at making friends, but I do have a core group of people. Unfortunately they are mostly guys who are settled down and married and can’t do anything or go anywhere for financial reasons work reasons or family obligations. 

I would like to make a friend or two to travel with and, ideally, it would be a female friend. My wife is OK with this. By way of explanation, I think I feel more comfortable being myself around women, it’s easier to have substantive conversations about emotional things etc. Plus, I think I have a bit of a hole in my life for emotional intimacy with a friend (versus a lover/spouse).  I’m also not really super into stereotypical guy stuff, which doesn’t mean I can’t be friends with guys, but it does make it a lot harder to break the ice. And at 30+ it is already hard enough to make friends without having to figure out how to be friendly with a guy who I don’t have common interests with.

All that said, I have no clue how to do this. My wife and I had a couple we were making friends with who are now divorced and moving away. I really wanted to be friends with them as a couple or with the wife and now that can’t happen. 

It feels like I would be hitting on coworkers to try to form a real friendship or relationship so I just don’t because it’s 2018 and it’s not worth the misunderstanding. 

I’ve thought about tinder or bumble but to be honest it feels sketchy and even if it weren’t I worry about other friends and family finding the profile and thinking we are having problems when we are not. 

The bottom line here is “read the TLDR...” but I just don’t know what to do. Part of this, I think, is I want someone to travel with who I’m comfortable around, and if I’m leaving my comfort zone to make friends I’m not going to be comfortable alone with him/her for weeks at a time. So yeah. Smh. 

Joke TLDR- sugar daddy seeks sugar baby for travel, platonic only, you must pay your own way and have a soul. 🙄😂",06Oct2018,1
145,"Last year I moved from a large metropolitan city to a small rural town with a good friend of mine (it was cheaper and I have some family out here). We'd heard that the crime rate was a bit higher than where we were from and my aunt had her house burglarized twice in one year so my roommate and I installed security cameras that would email us with motion alerts and pictures it captured. For a whole year, we'd never had any problems and the cameras would only ever alert us when we'd trigger them ourselves. But last week he and I went out of town for a few days for a wedding and for three days we were getting motion alerts several times a day around the same time. Looking at the pictures the camera captured, it looked like it was just being set off by someone walking right by our front window, weird but we just blamed it on a neighbor getting a new job or something. We thought nothing of it until we came home from the trip and found modeling clay stuffed into our front door locks. Luckily, my roommate's mom was a police officer so he quickly identified it as someone trying to determine if and when we were going to be home. We cleared the house, informed local authorities, and the landlady should be able to change the locks within the next few days. But because law enforcement wasn't able to do anything and our locks won't be in for a while, I'm not sure what to do. I'd brush it off as a ""strange one time occurrence"" if we didn't keep finding clay every time neither of us are home all day (almost like they're trying to figure out a routine? Or maybe I'm paranoid). And to top it off, he and I both keep seeing this unfamiliar red truck driving up and down the street closest to the apartment complex and driving through the complex parking lot slowly many times a day (maybe there's a logical explanation, but it'd have to be a hell of a coincidence). So long story short, what are we supposed to do now? We've already moved one of the security cameras to the front window but because it's so small and motion alerts on it aren't working for some reason (I blame the plants right outside the window and the constant high winds out here messing with the motion detection). We had already been making sure every door and window were locked when we went out and at night, although we are triple checking many times a day now and we've added security bars to our windows. And my roommate moved his gun to safe, close by, but hidden location in case things got to that point. But because this is an apartment unit (with a crazy strict landlady) there's only so much we can do as far as safeguarding. We don't have a peephole, nor can we install one. We don't have a door chain lock, and again, we're not allowed to install one. Hell, even the doors themselves are flimsy. They're all made of thin, cheap feeling wood and the locks were so poorly installed that you have to open and close the door a couple times for it to actually stay locked (it would be INCREDIBLY easy to kick open- there have been days we've come home and the back door is wide open because, even after locking it, the wind was strong enough to open it). But again, we can complain all we want (and we have), but we can't fix it without losing our deposit if not our ability to live there. We definitely aren't allowed to install anything on the outside of the unit such as motion sensing lights or even warning signs. And it's not like we'd be allowed to buy a high end security system. We've been trying to get one of those security alarms you can just stick on doors or windows but the one store in town that sells them is out of stock and won't get them in for a few days (the joys of living in a small town). I guess what I'm asking is what are we supposed to do now? What can we even do to keep ourselves safe and burglars out? We're clearly being cased but we can't do a whole lot more than we have (and even that hasn't done anything to stop these strange things. Even with the camera right by the door, we still have clay on our locks and we see that damn red truck every day at 12 and 2:30 and 3:00 and 5:00 and 6:30 like clockwork). Sorry if this post sounds like a garbled, disorganized mess. I'm so anxious all the time and neither of us have slept well for more than a week now. Thank you in advance, any advice would be amazing.

146,"Hey all, 

As a short backstory, I am in my sophmore year of college and I am currently in Mechanical Engineering. I was in Aerospace engineering for my first year of college, however I switched to ME because I found Aerospace to be too specific, nerdy (the people were not the kind of people I like), and overall not something I wanted to pursue. Last semester, I failed pretty hard because I slacked off, partied, and definitely didn't try enough. That lead me to basically retaking last semester, this semester, just with ME classes. 

However, I am considering dropping engineering completely. Given I am a semester behind already, I get to see what my friends are working on (they are a semester ahead) and the stuff they are doing looks like stuff I could not handle and would hate doing (statics, materials, differential equations, etc). I got lots of factors that make me believe this. As college is going by, I find myself not putting much effort in because I am not super interested in doing this kind of work. I am mostly in this career path because my mom is in the higher education field and has kind of pressured me into engineering. Even last year, I tried explaining to her that I simply do not have the capacity to do engineering coursework, but she talked me back into staying with reasoning that I need to have a good career and make good money in the future. I have a strong relationship with her so she would be pretty disappointed if I were to drop engineering, especially since she has paid for my education and I am out of state so it is not cheap at all. 

Even more so, I am worried about the future if I were to stay in engineering. I am beginning to hate the idea of sitting behind a desk for my job doing math, writing up reports, and occasionally getting to maybe measure some parts for a design I would be working on. One of the biggest reasons I am considering dropping is that I just do not believe that I have what it takes to be in engineering, I just don't think I was made for engineering. A part of me says to stay with it just to have the engineering degree and maybe I could do something not engineering related, but still have the degree. 

Dropping engineering and pursuing something else would be a huge life change, given that if I were to drop I would leave the school I am attending, given it is strong in engineering and not much else I would be interested in, and move back to California (where I live). What would be the right course of action to take here. Anyone been in a similar situation that could offer some advice? ",06Oct2018,1
147,"I recently started renting a house, and I'm currently sharing it with a pair of brothers. The older brother is a friend I go way back with, whose kind and understanding, and the other is an eighteen years old kid who has no consideration for anyone else here. 

The problem? I'm eight months pregnant, just moved here, and the house is disgusting. I'm the only one that has done any sort of cleaning. The older brother is dealing with some major depression, has just recently gotten out of the hospital for a suicide attempt, and I'm trying to be very understanding as he tries to get back on his feet/start feeling better. 

What I'm mostly angry about is the younger brother who doesn't lift a finger. Except to play fortnite while he's not at work. 

He's rude, condescending, and incredibly mean to his brother reguarding the suicide attempt. On top of that, he's decided that he wants the master bedroom after the landlord/house owner/ their dad already promised it to me because I'm, ya know, having a baby and am going to be sharing a room with my baby while I live here. I honestly feel like I have so many issues with him already budding, but the main thing is that he doesn't clean up after himself and my newborn has to live here.

I don't have the money to move right now unfortunately or I'd already be gone. I'm hoping to be out in the next couple of months, but babies are expensive and all my money gets funneled into that.

Fast forward to the end of 2016 and I got a girl friend in nz who I was quite attached too and we dated for the whole of 2017. I always thought that it would end some day, not being pessimistic just realised we'd eventually grow apart as we had diffent life goals and so on. Nearing the end of the relationship the online friend and i got drunk one night and discovered that we'd had mutual feelings for eachother for awhile. 
I foolishly thought the best policy was still honesty and told my current girlfriend the entire situation. Insinuating not that i wanted to break up but I knew that we wouldnt last. She didnt take it well. 
Fast forward to now, I'm still dating other girls and learning to be a better boyfriend and person with every relationship, but a couple of people have pointed out that its a terrible thing for me to do.

It also I was really hurt when he would have weird comments about sexy pics I sent him. Or when he didn’t seem too interested about my day. 

I especially felt bad when I went to his place ASAP after I came back. We did it and he kind of rolled over and went to sleep. He mentioned offhand the present I got him before he went to work. 

He has just seemed weird and distant and his texts never seemed to ask questions or offer any more answers.

155,"So I really need advice but have a bit to say so I hope if your really willing to read it you'll help.

I keep hurting to girl that I love. I don't realize it until it's too late. I guess I need more self awarness but we aren't together anymore(her choice) but we are still two people who care for each other and most the time perfer each other over most everyone else even though we have a rough past.

Sometimes with our past it's best if I'm not around but sometimes we have  ""great nights"" on two of those specific ""great night's"" we had amazing beautiful sex as everything with her is. We took photos one of which she asked me to post in a couples group. I was really excited! Like she wanted to show off something she did with me!!! 

I loved it so much the first night the second sex night I took photos again they didn't mean as much to me because she wasn't as into it. However I was so proud of the beautiful moments we shared together. Now keep in mind this girl owes me NOTHING. For a long time I did nothing but make this girls life worse. Since I got back to town all I care about doing is making her life better. I want to feel how amazing she is, I want to show her all the affection, love, respect, encouragement, appreciation, trust, and devotion I have in my heart for her. Please know I have no reason to lie to you all. I love this girl more than I have ever or will ever love anything else the rest of my life.

She is the mother of my child, the fire in my engine. After 4 years the sex only gets better and better. I only find her sexier and sexier. She's smarter than most people inculding me. Her and my son are the most important things to me and I keep messing it all up.

I'm strong one second and then show all my insecurities on her the next. Sometimes I'm calm cool and collected the next minute I'm spewing my emotions all over the room. Sometimes I make her feel sexy and happy and love and other moments I make her feel let down, ackward, or guilty. I don't want her to feel guilty when I'm hurting. BUT MOST OF ALL I don't ever want to let her down. Her time and trust are the most important things I can earn and I broke one tonight.

Those beautiful moments we shared I was so proud I was bragging to my friend Nat I told you about and I sent him two of the photos. I thought they were the two most tasteful didn't show her privates and didn't show breast. But her but was in them and I wanted to let her know I had done this so when I told her she was very angry. When confronted she asked ""why?"" And i lied I said to make him laugh. Which was stupid but I was frozen and devastated. The thing I had been working so hard to earn, her trust, I unknowingly tossed aside and stepped on.

156,"This is going to be incredible and dense, so I'm going to try to say as much as I can with as few words as possible and hit all the main points.  


A few years back my girlfriend left me, my best friend committed suicide and then shortly afterward I broke my leg and lost my steady job. I fell into heavy alcohol and marijuana use. Because of the combined stress I developed a severe psychosis. Seeing the future, reading minds, believing that cars could talk. - I spent a year living with a friend and then freaked out and moved into my parents house.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got to my parents house at the age of 25, I was still experiencing these delusions, plus I was drinking a lot. Over time living there, I had to buy my mother booze every night. She woke me up screaming, locked me out for no reason, threatened to hit me and my brother constantly. I managed to get sober and recover from most of my psychotic symptoms, save up a small amount of money and then move into a cheap apartment, rooming with a friend of a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother got very strange. He would scream and make monster noises, avoid conversation at any cost, breaks down doors, hangs out with neighborhood junkies, begs for money, never showers, uses drugs excessively, shit in a bucket on the side of the house. The most antisocial kinds of behavior. Instead of helping him, my mother would hit him and abuse him. He would also make sexual noises at me and threaten to hurt me constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've been out of my parents house for the better half of a year, I'm making fast progress in recovering from the incredible amount of trauma I've experienced. I live on social security, and work a part time job working the counter at a slow small business.  


Today my unstable boss threatened to fire me for getting something wrong. It wasn't any sort of big deal, but she was arguing on the phone before doing this, so I suspect she was trying to take her rage out on me. I'm getting written up for not offering someone a senior discount, essentially, which could lead to me being fired.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm essentially a paycheck away from the street, being unable to save up enough money very quickly. I would always have to buy shoes or food or something and never really got a chance to save. Finally I have a few hundred in the bank and I get hit with this potential job loss.

Meanwhile, my mother wants me to watch their house while they are on vacation somewhere and she wants me to make sure to keep my brother out of the house, since he was recently kicked out onto the street. To be honest, his behavior doesn't allow for any kind of helping him. He can be violent and refuses to conversate or shower. He's also very physically fit, so no one can really do anything to stop him except the police.  


Although she occassionally keeps letting him into the house when she is drunk because she feels bad. She essentially can't make up her mind about whether or not he's allowed in the house, and yet still wants me to keep him out.  


I need to find a way to never need my parents again. I can't drive, I can barely afford to save up 100 dollars a month, I might lose my job. I need some way to structure my life so that I can be completely self sufficiant. Most jobs don't even really work for me, since I'm paranoid and traumatized.  


I need a surefire plan out of this situation. The basics are: Save up a few thousand dollars (very difficult with my current pay), learn to drive, keep the friends I have, learn to be happy again so I can actually have someone who loves me.  


I am alone and the world is against me and my parents just guilt me. They helped me when I needed it, but they don't respect me, My mother threw bottles at me, locked me out of the house, made me buy here beer at midnight, never let me sleep and constantly reminded me that her house wasn't my home, but still cries and demands that I answer her drunk calls at midnight.  


I want to help repay them for all they have done, but they are making it impossible for me to give a shit. Plus I'm also scared that if I burn that bridge they will attack me legally somehow, or show up at my house and cause a scene. I need to be done with my family and somehow make my own support system from scratch while being mentally ill. All I have is my sobriety.

157,"So the last year and a half I have been in and out of the doctors and getting tests for whatever is wrong with me. On Monday a doctor decided to feel my spine and realized, ""oh, well, uh you have scoliosis. That's the issue."" I was most likely born with it since I've always had a horrible posture growing up. But I'm so relieved to finally know what is wrong with me yet also scared. I know I have to go to physio and have to get massages on top of starting yoga. Yoga really isnt my thing. I do enjoy meditating for 10-15 minutes but it takes me a while to get into the zone.. But I was a boxer. I love being able to move around quick and be more like a bunny rather then a snail. Lol. I also have heard of swimming to help out strengthening but I can barely swim and the idea of learning how to swim correctly besides doggy paddling, plugging my nose, floating and sinking freaks me out. Hahaha, I'm in no way a swimmer. Could I do dancing or something more.. energetic?

I'm just wondering has yours stopped you from doing anything? I have not worked for nearly a year from the pain. So now I have to find a suitable job since my back has gotten pretty bad. If you run your finger straight down my spine near the bottom it disappears, it's gotten pretty out of line. I'm pretty sure it is just lumbar scoliosis but the doctor didnt really feel the very top of my spine. I do have a hunch (Kyphosis), my shoulders and hips are out of line. I know everyone can have a different degree to there scoliosis, literally.. So physio isnt going to be fun, of course. I definitely would like some painkillers so I can have a life again.. what kind of painkillers did they prescribe you? Did they help you? ALSO mine has messed me up pretty bad.. obviously.. I havent worked since Nov. 2017.. Some days I am alright and some days the idea of moving is out of question. So would I be able to get a handicap permit for my license?

158,"So, my dog is 3 years old now and I'm not sure what to do about him. He was my service dog and he was a damn good one. But in 2016 I got pregnant and it was rough as hell. I was constantly exhausted and sick. I wanted to take him out and train with him but I physically just couldn't. 

When I had my baby, I couldn't handle the dog and the baby at the same time. Tiny humans require a LOT of attention and he requires a little more than normal. My depression and PTSD got worse. My husband is military and I was in a new place with no friends. My husband started to work more than he used to (new job requirements and such). Needless to say, I didn't get to work with the dog like I was planning. Now, my child is a toddler. My dog is 130lbs of GSD and he doesn't understand how big he is. I can't leave him out because he accidentally tramples my child. 

He spends most of his time in a kennel. Ive tried reworking schedules (which is damnnear impossible with a special needs toddler). I've tried leaving them (we have 2 GSDs, one is my husband's), I've tried everything in my power but it seems like nothing is working. The only way it works is if they stay in their kennels for most of the day. I'm extremely depressed and I have childhood trauma. It takes every ounce of energy and drive I have to mother my child. I can't handle 2 dogs and a toddler. I don't know what to do. I feel like the best thing to do is give my dog to someone who can take care of him. I love him and I hate it.

My dad is pretty well off, having bought multiple apartments and using them for rent means that we live comfortably. 

It's just me, my dad and my brother in the family. He's a widower.

He's planning on giving us the flats in the future and one for himself. This is very generous but I've stated multiple times that I'm not going to live in this country. He acts like I hadn't said anything.

I'm afraid he's either in denial or wants to keep me here by guilt. What should I do?",06Oct2018,1
165,"Im feeling kinda stressed because im starting to realise that i have no intrest in having a romantic relationship with anyone. Ive been in relationships befor but it just felt really uncomftrable for me. I never developed any romantic attraction to any of my partners. They were all honestly great people and did everything right but i just felt so guilty that i could not feel the same way for them as they felt for me.

Ive been thinking about this for a while now and im starting to realise that the idea of a SO, marriage and starting a family just dosent appeal to me. Is there something wrong with me? ",06Oct2018,1
166,"A little back story: This girl is supposed to be my big, which in sorority speak means she is supposed to help guide me through basically everything. I’m not feeling the love.

She never asks me to hang out, never gets excited to see me, never asks how I’m doing, etc. When I ask her to hang out, it’s always “I’ll let you know” and then she never does. I have a few situations I’m angry about in particular and want to know: is she a bad friend or am I overreacting?

1. She is always complaining about how her birthday is a bust and she spent last year alone crying. I texted her “Let me take you out for drinks and pizza (from her favorite place). It would be fun and casual!” She responds with “I’ll let you know.” It seems like she’s waiting for a better offer from someone else or just doesn’t want to go out with me. When someone offers to take you out after you’ve been complaining about something, I feel like it’s rude to just say you’ll let them know. Or maybe I’m way off base here?

2. She posts on FB tonight asking if anyone wants to go to the parties tonight with her (she doesn’t even think to text me?). I text her and say “Me! I really wanna go!” She then says she isn’t sure if she is going. I text her an hour later saying I really want to go AGAIN and she says she still doesn’t know. She then texts me five minutes before the parties start and says “Oh, so-and-so (another girl in the house) really wants me to go so I think I’m going to!” Umm… I already told her I myself wanted to go with her really bad so I guess I mean nothing? She then says she is leaving in five minutes. She doesn’t invite me to go so I have to ask “Can I come with you?” and I even offer to get drinks first from her favorite place. She says she’s meeting her friends at the frat house. Doesn’t offer to wait for me so we can walk over together: doesn’t acknowledge a meeting place, nothing. I find that… not friend like. Am I wrong here?

3. I get to the frat house and it turns out to be the wrong one. I say I am on my way to the right one. She then says “Oh, we are leaving to go to this other house” so I start walking there and when I’m almost there she says they are actually going somewhere else and that she doesn’t know where she is going. I’ve been walking 15 minutes alone in the dark at this point and when I tell her this and she just responds with “sorry. I don’t even know where we are going. LOL.” I suggest she looks for an address or just asks someone where they are. She doesn’t even respond for 15 minutes and by then my phone is dying and I’m a mess because I don’t even know where I am going and I can’t walk much longer because I’m physically disabled (which she knows). I tell her I’m panicking. She doesn’t even ask if I’m okay. I decide to go home and just forget the whole night. Am I overreacting or is she just being a shitty friend? I feel like if my friend was lost and I planned to meet up with her I would try to help her figure it out—especially when she’s alone after dark and you know she has panic attacks and physical issues. ESPECIALLY if that girl was my little who I’m supposed to help through sorority life. That’s just what good friends do. Or maybe I’m off base here too?

I feel like this is just a lot piling up and tonight was just a few small things that finally tipped me over the edge. I just want to know if I’m crazy or not. Is this how friends treat each other?",06Oct2018,1

Yesterday I brought up that after school I have to wait 2 and a half hours on my bus and she said she did too so we decided to hang about town. Overall I’d say it went well. She told me that she liked talking to me because I make her laugh and also said she “hadn’t laughed so hard in ages” and when I told her that another girl in my class didn’t get to know me until this year because she thought I was “scary” (I’m 6 foot 2 which is pretty tall for my age) she told me that she “always liked me” but idk if she was hinting at having a crush on me or just as a friend.


We hung out for the 2 and a half hours and then got our respective buses home. Afterwards we texted about various in jokes from the time we spent hanging out.

174,"Yesterday a friends really opened up to me via text about her self-confidence issues caused by a few things.

She used to be obese and has an eating disorder but now keeps herself in really good shape, her 2 ex-boyfriends were both assholes and were happy leaving her in the gutter and her parents haven't exactly been great either. Nobody seems to have just treated her as a human and she really struggles about her physical appearance 

I was surprised to hear she was still that bothered about her physical appearance and she didn't believe me when I said she was beautiful, which I absolutely mean and believe. I have an incredible amount of admiration for her and really want to help her. I'm going to meet face to face with her to discuss it but other than that I really don't know what to do.

176,"Little background, I’m currently in my second year of college. We met at freshman orientation and have been dating pretty much since then. She’s one of the best people I’ve ever met. We never even really had arguments. The only thing that ever arose was that I’m agnostic, while she is a pretty big Christian. When we first found this difference, she said it didn’t matter and she could deal with it.

We dated for over a year and everything went great. We met families and everyone loved everyone. My family joked that everyone said that it’s just a matter of time before we get married. We weren’t only dating, we were best friends. 

Then, one day out of the blue, she comes to visit me. As she walks into my room she closes the door and starts crying. When I asked her what was wrong she just said “Remember when I said it was ok that you’re agnostic? Well I actually don’t think it is.” And she basically went on to say that she needs someone that can support and be with her not only in everyday life but religiously as well. She said to me that there’s a chance for us to get back together, but it pretty much depends on my “spiritual awakening” (I guess). This was literally the first time she had even MENTIONED that she had a problem with it. I supported her through everything religious wise and still do. I told her I understood why she did it. 

Since then she’s also said that she doesn’t really want to talk to me yet because it still hurts her. We still both love each other very much and really just want the best for each other, but pretty much the only way I see this being solved is by my sudden switch to being Christian. Don’t get me wrong, I think I’m willing to if it means getting her back, but I know in the end I’d just be doing it for her. And I know either way, our relationship won’t be the same after this.

I guess I’m kinda just lost and don’t know what to do right now. Any advice would be nice. Thanks.",06Oct2018,1
177,"It seems like everyone else at least has some semblance of direction in life, even though I'm sure there are people like me. It feels like there are so many paths in front of me, that I'm paralyzed by them, the reality is that if I choose one path it blocks the others, or best case scenario I can only ever try a few of hundreds of potential paths by switching, and even then I'm only partially doing some paths. I'm in my early 20s, so despite my poor health I theoretically have the rest of my life in front of me. I'm terrified of waking up one day when I'm 40 and regretting my past mistakes like I do now. As awesome as opportunity is, it's crushing me since it feels like instead of having 100 paths where I could go right, there are 100 paths where I could go wrong. Some would say this is a mentality issue, but I know first-hand how devastating a single mistake can be and it's terrifying me and paralyzing me. How do I get over this pathological fear? It's very difficult since I have chronic illness and pain as the result of a split-second mistake I made as a child that is a constant reminder of how 1 mistake can irreversibly alter your life.

It's like being suckerpunched by surprise feelings of attraction that I wasnt ready for, nor wanted. It hurts, I dont want to hurt who I'm with, I want to see (crush) her. I'm conflicted and going mad over this. We exchanged numbers and both want to see each other. Since I ran into her I can't stop thinking of her, it's like a curse, I dont know what to do.

I just want to be 8 again and meeting a online friend that I still play with everyday. We played call of duty to minecraft (my favorite years to be alive) to csgo and a bunch of other pc games. But now I wanna start thinking of the future.


Everyone I know is now asking where I want to go to college and I answer with UCLA. But the real answer is that I’m lost. I don’t want to go the college but I also don’t want to have a job I hate. I actually feel like if I don’t follow my dream to be a Music producer/DJ I won’t be happy in my life.

Today things that make me happy are gaming and music. If you know me in real life you will know that when I am allowed to I will have my ear buds in, even when I’m talking with my friends (which is a bad habit) 

What I’m trying to say is that I feel my time to be a kid is coming to a close and I have no idea what to do. I want my life to be a happy and I feel like if I don’t, go to school go to college, get a boring job I hate, work 9-5 everyday for 50 years, retire and then my family forgets I exist and put me in a retirement home until I die.



TL:DR my childhood has been fun and I was able not not care about anything. But now I’m Graduating in a 3 years and I don’t want to take the route a normal person takes(go to college, get a job I hate, retire, die) I have always wanted to be a DJ/Producer and I feel like if that fails I will have a depressing life.

187,"This may be a bit long, so forgive me.
So my sister opened up to me earlier about the status of her school play. She was assigned to be the head (director/coordinator/scriptwriter).This means she'll oversee everything. She's also the one who'll give out the grades of an individual. So what happened is this: She finished the script, presented it to everyone, and they all-kinda agreed to do it. (Everyone decided what genre the play will be, she just wrote the story that fit the genre). Fast forward to today. There's a group in the props/background department that are too lazy (in my opinion) to do their job. So my sister already explained how the stage will look like. The plan was to make two backdrops/wall: an office meeting room and a living room. Then bring in tables, chairs, etc to make it believable. The props department agreed. Everything seems fine and dandy when my sister hears from a friend of hers (who's in the props dpt) that some of them was planning to just make the backdrop with the props in it. They suggested that the actors don't sit, just stand. They'll present it in a 5 days. My sister told me that not only are they changing the plans they agreed to, but the few times she checked on them they were goofing around. This group also disagrees with the choices the class makes. They're the thorn on her side.

My sister doesn't know what to do. These people are ruthless, according to her. They're like the mean girls/guys in the class. She's afraid of the backlash but she also wants to finish this play.

188,"Hi all, I figured I'd come here. I have this friend that lives in California (I'm in Virginia), and she's gone four days without talking to me. I say friend, but really we're more than that, just not together. Anyways, tonight she actually read my Snapchat message, but didn't say anything. Snapchat, (partially because I don't use it often, so I don't know how it works much) showed me a conversation that we had previously. The last message she said was something along the lines of ""if they ask, I'm outing myself there"". Me, with all my anxiety, starting having a panic attack and was freaking out that she meant she was going to kill herself. Keep in mind, she's trans, we both are for that matter, but her parents aren't very accepting at all, so that's partially why I assumed that.

Anyways, I wasn't sure if I should have called the cops or what. I guess it's good that I didn't seeing as she never actually answered the message.. dummy me. But I guess the advice I'm looking for is, if I have reasonable suspicion that she's going to hurt herself or someone else is going to hurt her, do I immediately call 911, or like, what? At this point, I genuinely don't know how she's feeling. I know she was upset that I hadn't asked her out, and she was kinda short with me the last time we talked. She's stopped talking to me for two days before, claiming that she just got very busy and what not, but I'm not sure, I mean at what point do I start to worry?

Furthermore, if I did call the cops, could it be anonymous? I know obviously suicide and homicide are both serious crimes, so I don't know if tips like that could even be anonymous. And would I call 911 or their local Sheriff's/police department? I think I have her address from Snapchat (no I'm not a stalker, but I was about to call the cops tonight so that's why I looked at it).

192,"I just turned 22 and am *technically* a junior 1 right now. I originally, out of high school, was going for a degree in Computer Science. Was going fine until the end of my first year where some circumstances caused me to tank a lot of my classes. See, I was a straight A student through high school so seeing any sort of failure was incredibly painful to me. Due to this, I transferred to the community college nearby as to alleviate tuition costs and clear my mind. However, I was still pursuing the CompSci credits.

Eventually, I felt the need to switch up my career path. I'm not sure exactly what it was, maybe the lingering failure still bothered me, but I switched about half a year ago or so to Secondary Education. Education was the other interest out of high school for me so it seemed like a perfect fit. Flash forward to today where I am enrolled in a different university and chasing that degree. But honestly? I feel sort of hollow doing it. 

My fear of that semester of failure is gone and honestly, I think I am beginning to see more clearly. The career path of CompSci was about the same level of interest to me as Education, but the future pay and job opportunities are not the same. Part of me wants to switch back to CompSci, but the other part of me feels like I've wasted too much time and should just get this Education degree. My family was already very supportive of my major switch despite the obvious economic downgrade, but I'm not sure how they'll react to my urge to switch back again. We had someone in the family do this already, my aunt. They joke about it now but she took 8-9 years for to get her Bach.

Either way, I am just at a crossroads. It is fall break so I wont hear back from my adviser for a while now.

While barely legally intoxicated I agreed to go to a birthday dinner for a guy I don’t even like. Under normal settings (like being sober) I’d say no in a heartbeat. But now I’ve committed to it, and I need to get out of it.

Some background: this is a guy who very nearly drove me to suicide when I was dealing with depression. His two best friends are also two people I am very fond of, so he thinks that we’re super tight and close friends. I fucking hate this guy. He’s abrasive, close-minded, opinionated, and inflammatory. So I choose not to hang out with these two other guys if he’s there. I’ve declined dozens if not hundreds of invitations to spend time with them, simply on the grounds of this dude being there. To the point where twice now in order to save face and keep these two other friends, I have to put on the facade and act like I really like this dude. Anyway, with everytime I flake out on this group, the questioning as to why becomes increasingly aggressive, so I’ve burnt many, many many excuses.

Now that I’ve actually said I’ll go, the old “oh something came up I won’t be able to make it” is not gonna fly. So now I need a legitimate way to flake out of this clean.

This pass few month she started to go some weekend “classes “ at a local Buddhist Centre where they have a lot of charity event and sharing sessions about Buddhism, also about people who transitioning to become a vegan because the causes being a real Buddhist. She started to kept talking about eating healthy ( not necessarily vegan food) but a balanced diet or healthy diet. 

This is really causing nothing good but annoyances she has very little knowledge about food and nutrition, comparing to my sister who actually graduated from University to become a nutritionist and dietitian. My mom just watches some stupid Facebook video about healthy diet then use it to apply to all of us. 

My sister who currently working in a hospital as a nutritionist try to talk her to some sense that she can’t just suddenly think that she has knowledge about everything and apply a stupid logic to everyone, but she went on comment about my sister that “ You are a nutritionist yourself and you don’t even eat healthy “  🤦🏻‍♀️

I’m fine with her wanting to eat healthy, but she is like a food police now on every single chance she had she will point out what am I “ eating wrong” .

196,"so im 20 and im currently living at home and feeling pretty directionless. i've fantasized about the idea of being a professional musician/artist for the last few years but i cant seem to make a steady gig out of it. i dont like college at all and i find sitting in a classroom super depressing. i dropped out of a difficult college to a lower tier school planning to have more time to make art and music, tho for some reason i cant seem to motivate myself to be at my best with these passions. i've been tunneling into these passions and consequently isolating myself from others because i couldn't talk passionately about anything i cared about. i feel like i have no one to share things that i like with.




my buddy from high school who i make music with invited me to join his band in nashville. i think its a great opportunity to be on my own, work on what i care about and have people around me that i've met and have become close to.

whats preventing me is my fear of my parents. my father is a corporate executive guy who says that he ""likes to make money."" he says that my passions will die out and i need to develop a real career for myself. a ""real career"" to him requires a college education, and grad school in something that will lead to a corporate job.

my mother says i can live at home without her judgement but she also wants me to be in college and then grad school. i dont want to live at home but this is the only consistent thing she recommends i do and its definitely just coddling that i have to get away from.

the more i hesitate to free myself from my family, the more i feel like im losing my talents. ive lost interested in everything i love but my parents swear that i'll be happy if i follow their advice. im starting to believe that their advice is the right path because my art is getting worse as my interest in life is diminishing. 

i just wanted to vent, and if you have gone through a similar scenario please lend me some advice

I recently [made a vlog about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2hBzmuIlJY) my own struggles with depression and anxiety. I really do want to take it forward to create an open dialogue and help (in my own very small minuscule way) to break down and take away some of the stereotypes and stigmas around mental illness and overall, mental health. 

I do need some help in creating content and making my content more engaging. Any advice you can give me would be great.

199,"He is a 29/m and I’m a 30/f. I feel bad. But he seems so distant and weird and didn’t appreciate me coming straight to his place after I got home from a long vacay. One where he didn’t seem too interested in my sexy texts and one where he did t seem too interested in my day and would ignore me for hours. I feel bad. It also I was really hurt when he would have weird comments about sexy pics I sent him. Or when he didn’t seem too interested about my day. 

I especially felt bad when I went to his place ASAP after I came back. We did it and he kind of rolled over and went to sleep. He mentioned offhand the present I got him before he went to work. 

He has just seemed weird and distant and his texts never seemed to ask questions or offer any more answers. He didn’t seem stoked to see me really and I initiated the phone calls we had when I was away. He was super upset when I told him that I wasn’t feeling this. But he like didn’t seem to want to talk. Just wanted to sleep. Didn’t seem interested in my vacay and texts and now I feel terrible. 

I always do this when I stand up for myself and what I think I end up feeling terrible. Any advice y’all?

He was kinda shitty and said that I didn’t respond to him immediately after I messaged him that and said “talk about being distant” because I told him he seemed distant.

They were the first people i felt i could open up to (even tho i rarely did) but as time passed my group of friends was torn apart and i was left alone. I cut many people of my life since our group broke up, leaving only 2 friends. 

One of them had a lot of issue which i tried to help but couldn't do much as we live in different countries. so i would  try to talk with her every day,doing my best to support her, but it wasn't enough. Luckily she met a guy who helped her more then i could. Now we barely talk, and if we do only if i text. Even before she wouldn't be the one starting the conversation unless she wanted to tell me something, never just going to check how i am. 

Now I'm not sure what to do. She is like a lil sis to me (even tho she is older) am i suppose to do everything in our friendship? Should i just stop texting her and see if she will care enough? Or did i lose another friend out of my stupidity?

202,"I did a job interview Tuesday which I felt went well, but as I started walking to my car my brain started to worry.I feared I was too quiet and I said the wrong things I think I was too honest. I really need the job and this one in particular I was hoping to get so bad. The lady that was interviewing me told me I should get a call on Friday or Saturday. Yesterday was Friday today is Saturday. The suspense is killing me. I haven’t eaten or slept at all. I have pretty bad anxiety guys, any advice?

To any interviewers out there I feel like you guys make your mind as soon as we walk up for the interview. Maybe it’s just my mind and anxiety talking but I think the lady told me Friday or Saturday just to give me hope, I don’t think she saw me as a real candidate. 

I just hate the fact that when she said “what are my best qualities” I didn’t say I’m bilingual. Even though it’s in my resume I should have said that :( do you guys even read the resumes. This place is in a city known for its tourists and she doesn’t have any workers there that speak another language fluently. (I met the other workers which were such nice people) lowkey im dying inside. Also when she said “when do I want to start working “ i said next week, is that wrong?

Around two months ago, my mother, I and my brother moved to Iraq, which I am not used to live in (my dad, brother and sis are still in Sweden). Every day I am itching to go back to Sweden but I have no idea how. Every time I ask my mother, she refuses, even if it ends up with me screaming at her face.

I am trying to get a flight ticket to Sweden but I have zero experience on that and I have no money aswell. After that, I do not even know where i'm supposed to live because at this point I can't even trust my selfish parents. To be honest, I don't even know what to type anymore.

In reality I was going through this mini crisis triggered by getting completely soaked by the rain along with the notebook I was supposed to use for my midterm evaluation and made a panicked, impulsive decision to back out at the last second. I realized by stupid mistake and felt so stupid and worthless I started to call the financial aid office (twice) to ask about how I could drop out of the program all together only to receive the answer I already knew: I would end up in debt and delayed if I didn't finish. I was seriously contemplating it and even spoke to my mom about it only for her to reasonably reprimand me for being a failure never starting what I finish. I ALWAYS sabotage myself when I am doing well in anything. I don't know why.

I asked my professor later about the affect it would have on my grade and she only told me she would remove the attendance points (which are a hefty price but not as bad as it could have been) but I can made up the midterm evaluation. I felt so relieved and like I was given a second chance but I feel SO guilty because I feel like I've taken advantage of her, especially since she would ask me about how my injury is and give me tips on how to feel better. I don't know how I'm going to face her the next time I see her especially if she asks me about the injury. I'm scared I'm going to freeze up or start stuttering. I feel terrible. So terrible that I can barely focus to study for my other midterms next week because I'm so angry at myself for what I've done. I can't focus and I don't know how I will.

Fast forward a week or three. He calls, upset because money that needed to have gone to important things like electric bills was being spent on alcohol. His father had taken any money earned from his part time gig (and whatever else he and his brother gave him) and spent it on booze.

The electric bill apparently is behind $1200. I wish I had the money, I can't help. I talk it over with the wife and we give him $100.

Later, he hits me up for Lyft cash. His one job is twenty minutes away, by car. I decline.

He asks me at least two more times if I could spare some cash.

About a week ago we hung out. It was his birthday, and his brother was drunk and in a mood. So, I drive out to him. We go to a local fastfood joint. He orders and then turns around and stares at me. I hesitate purposely, just for clarification. He expected me to pay for his meal, too.

The general mood of the entire night is  south. The conversation is crap and Im like... I want to leave.

I want to be a decent friend but I dont want to be an ATM. I know I need to address things, especially at the fast food place.

221,"2 weeks ago she told me that I was being negative and that she didn't think we should be friends anymore. So I lost her friendship and with it the entire friend group. It's school holidays now and literally only one person has said anything to me out of all of my friends. I haven't left my house in over a week now and I'm finally starting to feel very down about everything.

I'm a guy, I told my best friend I liked her, she said she liked me back and it seemed as if she was being truthful but she didn't want to date and I didnt understand why. I kept asking and eventually she got sick of it and just told me we'd probably never happen. So I distanced myself for a week and then went back and things seemed weird at first but a few days later we seemed like we were back to normal with our friendship. Then after one of our exams me and her hung out on a voice chat for basically the whole day and it seemed really good, like truly how things were with us before any of the relationship stuff, but then over the days that followed she suddenly got super distant and I didn't understand why. So I explained that to her and she told me I was being negative and that we should stop being friends. I don't think that's true, I think she just wanted an excuse for the fact that she was spending time with this new guy who she hadn't told me even existed. So I'm pretty sure she just felt awkward about it and didn't want to lose me as a friend but then eventually decided she didn't even want me as a friend.

So things are over between us completely. After all of it some of the things she does are extremely questionable but I know she is a good person and I don't like not being friends.

The reason I'm always so eager to know things like why she didn't want to date or why she seemed super distant were because I think I have some extreme self confidence issues. She had actually been a big help in me fixing those issues until she told me we weren't ever going to date and a month later that we wouldnt be friends anymore and now I feel very lowly. I have no friends who care to talk to me anymore and I've distracted myself with video games and sitcoms but that's not really working anymore.

I know I need to give her space right now but I really want to have my friend back. I genuinely kind of hate myself and my life for all the dumb stuff I've done recently and I don't know if I can fix it. But I really want to. How do I go about fixing and do you think it's worth it?

I just tell him to come pick me up so he does then when I get in the car he says the following.

“Sorry dude, my mom is at it again. She thinks you  are out here with some guy. This is ridiculous, you’re pushing twenty years old it’s none of her business who you’re hanging out with. I know you’re straight you came from me it’s impossible that you’re gay.” He is homophobic himself btw but he respects my decision to be out for long periods of time and live the life I want.

236,"Hi Reddit, I’m mid thirties  and she’s 31. We’ve been dating for almost a year.  The relationship is going well for the most part.  

My GF has these bouts of depression that she says comes on from PMS. First off, is this something that can happen? She tends to tell me indirectly that she wants to see me when she’s depressed but, she’s not the kind of person who likes to leave the house too much. I understand she wants to see me and I want to see her too. 

We just came off a week long trip together to visit her home country and see her parents. She did get a little sad leaving which I understand when you miss your parents.  But, when we came back on Monday, she was supposed to go into work on wed. She never did and decided to take the rest of the week off! She said it was her emotions and not feeling well. 

She tends to let me know when she is having these super sad thoughts but this time was a little more worrying. She mentioned she’s “trying hard not to spiral-it’s really hard to not question the point of living.” That, scared me.  She also said she almost cried in public. 

This only seems to happen when I want some alone time on weekends, case in point this weekend.  I’m also, sick so I told her I don’t want her to get this.  It’s the same thing each time, I acknowledge her feelings and tell her let’s hangout and then she feels better. I want to be there as much as I can but it’s also incredibly frustrating. It’s like I’m praising some sort of bad behavior. 

Frankly, I’m a little lost and would like some advice as to what I could tell her. Is she depressed? Am I missing something?

I like some alone time too on the weekends. It’s been months. Is that selfish? Am I doing anything wrong? What can I improve?",06Oct2018,1
238,"Hi, I am a 17yr old male just looking for advice.

I wouldn't know how to summarize everything. So I'll try and keep it simple and short.

This year at school I've really made a huge change in the people I hang out with. I've gone from being tucked away and confined in a small group of 'nerds' (All guys btw) to being in a larger more active group made up of mostly girls. I've learnt heaps as you would. But I keep finding myself either causing the problems in my group or when everything is fine I begin doing things or thinking things that might affect everything. 

To explain things I have liked a girl for most this year now, on and off. I'm beginning to lose interest in her that way as she has been playing with me emotionally for to long (Which I'm happy about). During the off seasons where I wouldnt like her (as we would have a fight or she would turn me down) I found myself becoming keen for someone else, usually these fade within a month or less and i would go back to liking the first girl, but people find out and begin to assume things. I've constantly been referred to as the guy who always needs someone or always has to like someone. Which I obviously don't like but am beginning to think I am. 

Deep down I don't think I am. I've never had a proper girlfriend, especially around this age where it becomes a lot more serious then a school yard crush. But I suppose the way I act portrays this and thus problems begin to arise. Now I know that things in a predominantly girl group run much differently to a guys group, and I know as a guy I will never truly be able to figure out how it all works. But I guess I just looking for help. I don't want to keep thinking this way. Because one day if I do eventually meet the girl of  my dreams I won't be able to tell or others will just think it's just 'another girl he will always need'. 

To make things more clear I don't think that way, I want to find someone who I enjoy spending my time with and can cuddle up with on cozy days talking for hours.

 So I guess what I'm wanting from all of this is to know is it normal? Is it normal to constantly be 'liking' girls even if you don't really mean it? ",06Oct2018,1
239,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash area next to the bar and a girl I work with that I haven’t talked to stared at me as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I looked but I thought nothing of it.

240,"Hi everyone. So I work in the same building as one of my relatives but in different departments. All of the departments share the same cafeteria, and I eat down there with 2 of my co workers every day. 

At the same time that I’m down there is another guy. He eats alone every day, and is extremely obese. He’s mentioned to my relative and to his co workers (heard from my relative) how embarrassed he is about it, he’s super shy because he’s afraid people will make fun of him and how lonely he is because he thinks people are afraid to be seen with him. 

Now that doesn’t sit well with me. He’s my age, but I’m a relatively attractive female. I don’t want to scare him off when I approach him or make it look like I feel bad for him. How do I invite him over to start eating with my coworkers and I without being pushy or making it seem like I feel bad?

242,"Long story short it's been over a year since I've been dealing with a really bad breakup. This breakup broke me and i gave up on allot of things.

For that whole year I isolated myself from friends and family and was just working coming home and going sleep. Repeat repeat repeat 

I isolated myself mostly because familiar faces would send me into a zone and it would make feel like shit and wanting to end myself.

I told my mother to give me time so I can find myself but today she showed up out of the blue and told me she was on the airport. 

A friend picked her up and she said she would be here for a week. This really got me upset and put me in a bad state because at this moment I can't deal with anything extra and her being here is extra.

I just have the kind of ego that makes me think I can actually do something grand with my life... like be a filmmaker or writer.

But right now, I'm feeling somewhat depressed, thinking that I just need to let go and do the best I can do with my very normal life. I live in LA and work in a kitchen.

So we were gifted to take a ride on the bus together, with the 3 of us.

The girl acted like I was invisible, completely ignored me and stared at my boyfriend with a huge smile the entire time. We were standing and holding onto the pole.

First time she ""touches"" his hand while stare at him, he quickly replaces his hand. (His reaction doesnt mean anything since I was there and ofcourse he wouldnt allow me to see this) This happened two times again within 10 minutes.

248,"Before I start, I just wanted to say that I am alright and doing well. 

So last night, me and my friend decided to go to a Chinese restaurant in Oakland which was quite a long walk from Berkeley. After dinner we were walking back to Berkeley and this young man (around 18-19) just walks right in front of us with a knife and asks for everything we had on (money, phone, cards, etc). He seemed extremely scared and was shaking (probably his first time), but we did what we were told to do. After he put everything in his bag I ask him if we can leave but instead he decides to threaten us by saying visually disturbing things that he can do to us with his knife. At this point my friend is basically freaking out and I still remember looking at her eyes and seeing how scared she was. I tried looking for help but nobody was around and this dude started acting more unstable every second, so I basically give up at this point and tell him to let her go and that he can do whatever he want with me after that.  He agrees but my friend refuses to leave, at that moment this dude just takes his knife and stabs me on the upper left chest and runs away (thank fucking god he didn't go for my vital organs or arteries). I immediately removed the knife and my friend tied her jumper to stop the bleeding. I knew that there was a hospital nearby so we start to walk towards it but before entering, I told my friend to take a Uber with her watch and go back to her dorm and that I would meet her there when I get back, she refused but I wasn't taking it and got a bit mad (I realized that I made a mistake and should have let come with me butI didn't want her to freak out even more).

 When I went to the emergency room, the doctor and the nurse confirmed that it was just a flesh wound and that I was extremely lucky. They stitched the wound (the most painful part, even worse than being stabbed), took multiple tests, gave me a few antibiotics and pain killers, and told me to stay in the waiting room for some time before leaving. I reach my friend's dorm room 4 hours later and when she opened her door I could see that she was crying for hours. She takes a look at my bandages and looks visually disturbed so I decided to talk to her for 1 hour to calm her down but she kept blaming the whole situation on herself (even though it was my idea to walk there in the night). I do my best to tell her that it wasn't her fault but before I leave to go and sleep in my room, she tells me that she doesn't want to talk to me and that she feels horrible. 

What should I do? I have been extremely good friends with her since high school. I even asked her if she was mad at me that I didn't let her come with me to the hospital and told her the reason for it but she just ignored me. Should I try to talk to her again or let her calm down a bit more? 

Sorry for the typos/poorly constructed sentences, it's quite hard typing with one hand because my left should is still hurting a bit!

251,"Over the summer, I started to become friends with some people in a clique. I’ve never been part of a clique, but it’s something I’ve always wanted. It’s a small close knit group that’s known each other since 6th grade. They are all seniors and I’m a junior.

They invited me to go to homecoming with them and I realized it was the “make or break” moment of me getting into their group so my anxiety came in full swing and I was insanely nervous the whole time. I talked less than I’d have liked, but I wasn’t a weirdo hiding in the corner. It also didn’t help that including me, there was 5 people so I was kinda the odd one out especially because I haven’t known them as long.

I sit with one of the girls at lunch and she mentioned she was going camping over the weekend. (We have a 3 day weekend because of Columbus Day). I asked who she was going with to make small talk and she said:
“Um, it’s just my family friends”
She said it kinda abruptly and I got the impression she wanted to drop the subject. I figured since her parents are church people, it was probably some people from there.

However, when I went on Snapchat and low and behold the group had gone camping. Part of me hopes that this is just them trying to make some memories before they graduate and they just didn’t invite me because they aren’t as close with me. Although there’s also that part of me that thinks they secretly cant stand me. 

It just sucks because my school has separate lunch periods and the one girl is the only good person in mine. Another girl I the group had been texting me earlier that day and joking around and another saw my little sister in the hall and said “your older sister is cool!”

It's been a few days since my boyfriend's been in the psychiatric facility, and over that time, I've realized something. 

I am absolutely terrified of mental hospitals.

Whenever he's able to call me, he does. He tells me that it's not that bad, but the beds are uncomfortable and the bathroom doors are held close by semi-week magnets. I miss him a lot, but he said that he might get out on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
I'm starting to think, however, that my fear of mental hospitals is amplifying my anxiety now that he's in one. I can't sleep well because I'm afraid that something would happen and people would find out that I might be fucked up in the brain. I'm terrified to the point of a physical pain in my chest.
I think that the severity of what has happened over the past few days has completely messed me up, especially since he almost died in front of me...

257,"My university accommodation fee in Birmingham for the first year at uni is just under 8 grand. My parents said they wouldn’t be able to pay all of the payment for the first term but would pay me back eventually. I thought it was kind of unfair as my dad earns a descent amount of money and my mum also contributes. 

Anyways the reason they said I’d have to pay most of the first payment is because they were in a lot of credit card debt. This is there fault, however, as they constantly have holidays abroad, trips away and meals out and wonder why their in debt. Anyways I agreed to pay. I then found out that because of my disability I would receive £1500 of my accommodation fee. You don’t get it all straight away but a portion off for each payment(3 in total). My mum said she would give me the £1500 pound but that I would still have to pay a portion of the first payment because it’s the largest. I agreed at the time. 

Recently I gave a grand to my parents for the first payment out of my student loan so basically at the moment they have been given £2500 off my accommodation fee( the £1500 subsidy and a grand from me) I talked to my mum about her giving me the money that will be taken off for the next 2 payments and she refused. She said they couldn’t afford it even though I perfectly well know they can. My dad has been given a raise and is in a well paying job and my mum does okay as well. 

To those who say I should get a job or should have worked, I couldn’t. I don’t want to get into my disability but it  prevented me from working for the last 2 years and I was in hospital for some time due to illness both physical and mental. I don’t think it’s possible for me to get a job at uni because of how demanding my course is and my mental health issues produce a range of physical side effects. 

I have so little amount of money in my account from paying towards the accommodation fee I am basically planning to not eat lunch or go out with my friends( I am in catered so get breakfast and dinner). But I haven’t been going to breakfast because it’s too early and I suffer with severe insomnia. Right now my only hope is to befriend someone or a girlfriend who is rich. I’m not going to beg for me but if I’m very close to them they may be able to pay for lunch for me or going out( some people in my accommodation are extremely wealthy). 

I have one friend who is rich in my corridor and he’s paid for some of my drinks and taxis but I’ve never asked him to do so. I just feel like my parents went behind my back and their financial instability is not my fault. They go on regular trips away and holidays 2-3 times a year sometimes for 3-4 weeks at a time( to 5 star hotels). Anyways I realise there is nothing I can do about it and the advice people will probably give me is to work hard and get a well paying job. But for now I can’t afford textbooks for my different modules, lunch or go out anywhere or events etc. ",06Oct2018,1

for starters she’s got a lot of people coming in and out of her apartment which is a little strange to me bc we both have children, i have a daughter and she has two sons. apart from that she has little to no furniture besides beds for us and the kids. 

we went to the grocery store yesterday and she threw everything she saw in the cart and then stopped halfway through and just started throwing shit back on the shelves bc she realized she didn’t have the money for everything in the cart. everything she bought was something you could just throw in the microwave, and nothing really healthy bc she “doesn’t like vegetables”. 

last night she started making a “pot roast” and just left it boiling on the stove and went to bed. i asked her if she was planning on finishing the food and she just said “oh that’s going to take hours”. when she woke up in the morning someone had turned it off and removed it from the heat, but it was completely ruined. 

we’re both 20, so i can understand that we’re not going to be 100% mature all the time but this is not how a household should be run, their kids run around with full diapers and they feed them on the floor like animals. im too scared to say anything bc i don’t have anywhere else to go and she’s basically letting me live here for free until i get back on my feet and she’s my friend, so im really at a wall. i don’t know what to say to her so that she won’t get offended, or upset that I’m living off of her for free and judging her bc this isn’t what I’m used to.

My parents never went to any of my band concerts but always went to all of his sports games. My parents usually bought my brother 800+ dollars worth of christmas presents where as I would get the occasional book or pair of socks and some candy (not that I wasn't grateful for what I got but it was a little discouraging every christmas when he would spend an hour opening presents while I had to sit there and watch). My parents bought his car and paid for all the repairs and insurance. My parents still buy him new phones and pay for the monthly bill. I have had to pay rent to live at their house since I was 14. My brother has never paid rent in his life. My brother will buy food and take up the entire freezer. I bought a box of eggos once and my mother would not stop talking about how I ""took up too much room in the freezer"".

It's gotten worse lately. I can't even have a conversation with my mother without her brushing me off to focus on whatever my brother is doing or just outright ignores me. She only makes dinners which he likes (which generally including foods I am allergic to or dont like).

At first i stuck around just for the stories. Eventually i got to the point where i occassionally talk to them. Never met them tho, all our interaction is based via internet (although i can get a chance to meet them if i wanted to). And then little by little, it inspired me to get my own life back on track.

But here's my dilemma if i tell them how they affected me: 

1. They might take this story as  a personal compliment (as i think they should). Maybe even an inspiration of their own when they feel down or something, or reassurance in what they're doing.
2. They might take it as sort of pressure, or responsibility towards me. Like, if they don't keep up what they're doing, i would become suicidal once again (which wouldn't happen!!)

272,"I sent this to my (gen-ed) history professor to ask him about if he could consider allowing us to return to previous questions on our Lockdown browser tests. I asked this because I’ve been getting grades that are way off from my expectations after the amount of work that I put in to take notes and study. And to add to that, the questions are randomized so some students have described getting easy questions while others are getting harder, more specific questions. So far we have had 3 tests (68, 92, 80) and after taking the last test I sent him this email out of frustration:


Hi Professor, 

This is sort of a question and an expression of my concerns with the tests. Would you consider allowing us to go back to previous questions on our online tests? 

I know for me (and for other students that have expressed similar concerns), the fact that this is not possible has created unnecessary pressure and stress to fly through the test questions in order to complete it in a timely manner, despite the fact that we have an adequate amount of time to take the test. Furthermore, I and many others students are in the habit of skipping a question that we are not completely sure about to come back to it after we have finished in order to save time; overall, preventing students from coming back to questions limits them from checking their answers and making sure they are satisfied with what they have chosen.

I hope I am not coming off as an entitled student, but there is something about the tests that we have taken in this class that makes me uncomfortable. I do not know if it is the fact that we cannot go back to previous questions, the type of questions in the test (like the ones that ask about specific presidential elections), or if I just do not know the information, but some of the grades that I have gotten on these tests that I was confident about makes me wonder how well I actually knew the content. The grades that I have gotten are definitely not the worst that it could be, but I honestly feel like I should have done better with the confidence level I was at (again, I may be sounding like an entitled student here so I apologize).

The argument that ""you either know it or you don't"" is a valid one, but returning to questions gives students time to think when they have 5 minutes left after finishing the last question. Let me know if I am asking for too much (and let me know if there will be more opportunities to boost my grade).

I was trying not to sound like I deserved an A because “I studied so hard and I sacrificed so much” but in hindsight it did seem like I was basically saying that.  He hasn’t responded yet after 3 days and I’m assuming it’s for this reason.

My question is what should I do when I have class next week? Should I apologize or should I stick to what I’m saying? Am I in the wrong?",06Oct2018,1
273,"My family and I are expats in a country and were under the poverty line at some point, and due to the country we live and the laws that are regulated, I couldn't go to public school and private school is the only way for someone to legally get an education but my parents couldn't afford it so I was forced to drop out at around 6th grade (Year 7)

274,"I kinda feel silly for asking this but I‘d like to listen to some opinions from strangers about this. So, ob Monday, I suggested to my coworker to meet on Friday during our first slot (which is from 8am till 10am) or on Thursday during our third slot (from 12 till 2pm). She replied on Wednesday saying rhat Friday is fine and I replied on Thursday „See you tomorrow!“. We also mailed about our projects which means that the sentences about the meeting were always at the end of every mail and not the main reason why we were mailing. 
On Friday, she didn‘t turn up. At first, I thought she wasn‘t sure that we had a meeting because I only mailed „See you tomorrow!“ but later she told me that she knew we scheduled a meeting but didn‘t know the exact time (even though I mailed on monday that I want to meer up during the first slut). I‘m just so confused because it was quiet clear for me. 

We were mailing about a project that is going to take place on monday. She asked me on Tuesday what objects she needs to bring and I mailed her right away what she can bring to the project. Today, she asked me again what she should bring with her - even though nothing changed.

I should mention that I‘m an intern which is why I‘m unsure and kinda anxious about it. I never had problems with scheduling meetings and stuff like this though.",06Oct2018,1

I met these two girls (they are best friends) from a friend and we got along well enough and they moved in. The first few weeks were fine and we hung out as friends but things got worse as time went on. They drank almost every night (excessively), had people over on weekdays until 2 AM, had loud sex with whoever they brought home that night, were very unclean, and were pretty much just the most inconsiderate girls I have ever met. 
I had talked to them many times about being quieter on weekdays as I have work in the morning, to which they responded that I get a white noise machine. 
The final straw was when one of the roommates brought her dogs over (which are not allowed as the landlord said no). Her dogs are old, senile, and gross. They have accidents everywhere and I’m a very clean person. There was a huge yellow puddle in the kitchen and I asked my roommate to clean it up, as it was her dog that peed. She got so defensive and the way she talked to me was so rude. She insisted that it was not dog pee and was so annoyed with me that I asked her to clean it up. Like what else could a huge yellow puddle be from?! Duh! 
Anyway, that was my last straw and I was sick of living in a gross party house so I moved out. 
Anyway, I know that they are planning a Halloween party  and will have underage drinking. I would really like to report them.

281,"Hello everyone,  
first time here, asking help for a series of bad days I'm having.

Basically, describing a bit my situation, I'm in a relation with a wonderful girlfriend from 8 months, of whose 4 we lived in the same city hanging out and travelling around really a lot, and last 3 were Long Distance, different continent. We saw each other being both free to travel for a week, and we have in program to see each other again in 3 months. Being her the one that crossed ocean already, I'm the one that will go there at the end of December, for two weeks. The continent-distance won't be there no more once she'll live in EU, next year.

When I told family this, dad answered with nothing but excitment, but mom started being repulsive and it's already some days that she's starting to be really aggressive and insulting me, my girlfriend and my life for what I'm doing, because I love her. I don't know what to do:   
I am absolutely not going to modify my relationships with my girlfriend, but I can't leave house neither: I am studying in other city and come back usually for the weekend, will graduate next year but will still do a Master. It's not a problem of money, I'm paying for my trips and I can live without family founds thanks to awardships for my universities results, but that would destroy my dad's life.

I am having difficult moments too because I would have never imagined that such a close person would reveal so mean. Thanks in advance.

I'm a 22 year old woman and I don't know how old she is but she looks around the same age and  I like baking but I don't know if it would be really weird to bring her a plate of brownies?

283,"Had a girlfriend for 8~ months. Broke up with her because I started feeling insecure about our relationship. She took it bad (small scale cutting herself). I took it fine. 


Last month, got back together - I took the incentive to meet up again, started missing her and got all kinds of happy go lucky thoughts. It’s not even been 4 weeks yet but now I feel extremely indecisive, similar to what I felt first time around. 


My feelings go both ways. If you were to put “leave” and “stay” on a scale it would weigh the same to the point where it drives me insane. 



Thing is I’ve become a lot more materialistic nowadays and I find her less attractive (in comparison to other women, because sex is still great). I love and want her personality but I don’t want her appearance or “social status”. Let me explain:


She has a greaaat personality which is what I fall for but she’s the weird one on class (I’m just a laidback guy). She’s got a half emo style going for her (I prefer the more common styles). She’s bad with money (I’m very careful with my savings). She doesn’t take school seriously and skips homework (I have straight B’s and A’s, aim to study for masters degree in the US). Most of my friends don’t like her, same thing with a lot of people in her class and she’s quite bitchy to a lot of people (I’m chill with mostly everyone). Her room is a mess (I’m generally orderly and keep things in check). She’s a bit antisocial such as won’t sit next to strangers on the bus, chooses to stand instead even if there’s a free seat on the other side of the aisle (I love talking with strangers in other languages such as English). Her English isn’t great (mine is better than my Swedish). I find economy and especially economic theory to be fascinating and it’s what I want to study (she finds it incredibly boring).


All those things, I don’t like. Simultaneously she’s ok with following my life goals (studying and moving to the us, living with dogs eg).



Everyone tells me to follow my heart but it goes both ways. What do i do? I realize maybe I shouldn’t have thrown myself back into this... I just don’t want her to feel like shit and like I’m jumping back and forth into her life. Thanks. ",06Oct2018,1

287,"I’m 22M and ever since my freshman year in high school I have been the guy that girls cheated on their boyfriends with. To be completely honest in the beginning I found it extremely satisfying for my ego to hook up with a girl who had a boyfriend, so I would 100% look for it.  To this day I do still find it slightly satisfying but mostly I still engage in this because I’ve found these type of situations to work perfectly for me? When you’re the guy she’s cheating with, you basically get all of the physical benefits of a relationship without any of the commitment. However it is also pretty damn lonely &amp; this past year I found myself breaking a lot of my rules with this one girl? I found myself jealous of her boyfriend but at the same time I knew that I didn’t want to be in a relationship with her? Or at least I’m afraid to be in a relationship. The problem for me is that so many women have cheated with me &amp; some are even still in their relationships to this day! The majority of them have expressed to me how happy they are in their relationships and I can tell it’s true by the look on their face BUT the tiniest wrongs make them cheat? Boyfriend been busy at work all day? Boyfriend tired? Boyfriend not paying enough attention to you? Of course you can have my undivided attention for the 3 hours we spend together a week. It cost me so little energy to make you feel like you’re everything to me for that short period of time. I’m just basically curious as to how people are so trusting of others? I personally have an extremely competitive personality, so I can’t imagine giving another guy the chance to do that to me? How do I stop being a cuck about that so that I can properly be with someone? 

(I had a 3 year relationship while I was in high school, my sophomore year to my senior, in which my feelings of not trusting her lead me to cheat on her first so that if she ever cheated on me I could throw that in her face &amp; safeguard my ego. That’s how bad this shit is for me!!! I ended up cheating on her countless times as we stayed together through this &amp; found it easier to cheat with other girls in relationships as we both had something to lose if the truth came out)

My dogs are very well cared for, I think I’m a fairly levelheaded person. I take them on walks every single day before and after work, and my dogs are very happy.

This all started when I guess one of my neighbors I guess saw my dogs looking out of the window one day and no cars at my home, so they assumed I was abandoning them? I don’t know. I really don’t see what the issue is. Maybe they bark at passers? I don’t know. But I got a nasty letter on my door one day saying all the neighbors around are sick of my dogs being cooped up and that I need to voluntarily rehome them or they are going to take action.

Like I said I walk my dogs twice a day, they’re chipper and happy healthy dogs. And I love them and they’re my best friends. Why would I give them up? I had to move here, I had no choice, and I thought everything was fine until now and I’m just so upset and frustrated and, why can’t neighbors mind their own damn business?

289,"I work for a relatively small organization (~60 employees), and I’m on an even smaller team (7 people). One of my coworkers has started to treat me rudely and acts passive aggressive whenever we talk. 

On Friday’s we lead a meeting where we alternate who’s the primary lead and who supports the other person. He was in charge so I brought my lunch to eat while I helped out. I still answered questions and kept everyone engaged. Afterwards he confronted me, saying that I’m unprofessional for eating and not leading the meetings the way he does. I told him, “I can stop bringing my lunch from now on. Can you tell me what else I’m doing that’s not ok? I actually thought I was keeping people engaged, but I want to hear your thoughts.” 

He deflected and acted like I was acting a dumb question: “I don’t know dude, just do what you always do in meetings?

295,"I've made another account for obvious reasons.

I am suffering from depression and I have had it for some years now. I don't really have any friends at all, only one. The rest have been using me and it's hard for me to get friends.

I have been clinging towards my sister and mom, because they are the most understanding people I know. They know how I feel, because they have it the same way, though they are doing better.

I sometimes get a huge fear of either my mom, sister or dad not living anymore, it really ruins my day.

I live at my aunt and uncle, and I see my dad every second weekend, but it's rarer with my mom. So I can't really get to meet them a lot. My mom said she needed a break from 'all this' and I truly understand that, she has a hard life and I respect that. She is the only reason me and my sister are living, because of her hard work, my dad was once an alcoholic and smoked a lot, back then it was hard seeing him. So my mom had to take care of us. Which she had been doing for years, me and my sister still agree on that he hasn't been there for us back then. He was once sent to a center of some kind because he was taking too many pills. He is doing better now thankfully and I seriously don't want any of my family members to pass away.

A huge support for me when I was suicidal and struggled with life, was my cat, Diesel.
I loved him more than anything. The true best friend of mine. I lost him about one or two years ago and still think about him to this day.
I did not see him pass away, he might still be alive. Because at the time I last saw him was when I left my school to take a break and quickly walk home to him, he was SO happy for me and I was also very happy for him. But at the time my mom was not home much and thought about moving, which she did some weeks before it, but we still had the house for some time. My cat wasn't inside of course, only when I came home to check on him.
He mostly sat at the door, waiting for me, but at times I had to call for him first.
When I finally saw him, we went inside and we were SO happy, both of us lied down on the floor, I petted him and he loved it, licked my forehead and snuggled me, I even cried multiple times of pure happiness while with him.

But the last time I saw him, I will never forget. Walking away from him needing to go back to school again, I didn't want to at all, but it was necessary. Seeing him follow me a long way back to the school, but I had to go unfortunately.

Today, 3 years later, I can't stop thinking about what I've been through. The only reason I am writing this is because of my loving family.
Without them I would not be alive, but if I happen to lose them one day, it might just be the end for me.

Right now, as I am writing this, I am fearing my mom might have passed away because she didn't answer me at what time we are going to meet tomorrow. It has only been maybe a day or so. My fear is getting worse. 

Is there any way to get rid of Thanatophobia without alerting my family? To not make things worse. 

I want advice to what I should do.",06Oct2018,1
296,"Hello reddit, thanks for reading my post! I'll try to summarize the situation quickly and as best I can...

I'm in my late 20's now, went to an expensive college prep high school and generally had a privileged upbringing. While in high school my friends began to experiment with various drugs and unfortunately so did I, mainly prescription opiates. I did very well my first couple years but by my senior year I was high 24/7, nodding off in classes. Somehow I managed to get through high school and began college... I lasted about a month. I was partying constantly and didn't have the right mindset.

Throughout my 20's so far it's been a cycle of finding work, doing well getting a car and apartment, girlfriend, ect. then the addiction gets bad and fucks it all up again. I go to rehab get out do well for a while then somehow the cycle repeats itself. Well a year and a half ago I was going to the methadone clinic daily and I start abusing benzos to enhance the high. I'm living with a girl that ends up kicking me out because of my behavior and I also lose my job. Now homeless and still constantly high, I'm getting into trouble all the time. Sometimes public intox, occasionally simple misdemeanors like drug paraphenilia/retail theft to support my addictive behavior. So these run ins with the law result in pending court dates but a bond is never set and in my mind I'm high so I don't really care, writing them off as ""it's just gonna be probation.""

The big one came when I was really intoxicated and I got into it with a police officer. He was by himself and attempted an arrest (for public intox) but I resisted pretty heavily in a blackout. Even though I didn't strike him due to the injuries sustained while wrestling with me they charge me with felony assault. Due to the frequency I was getting arrested they put a high bond on me. I spent 8 months in jail, pushing back court dates and getting ready for trial. Eventually they agree to a misdemeanor instead of the felony, because of my state of mind and it wasn't my intention to hurt the cop. 

Right now I'm on house arrest and I have a lot of probation to go. Honestly going to jail and having to detox from methadone and benzos in a cell really scared me, but it was probably what I needed. Also now I'm on an ssri to treat my anxiety/depression instead of self medicating to feel good and it's working great. Counting jail time and house arrest I have almost a year sober, and my whole outlook and attitude has changed. I want to do something good with my life. I recently started working an entry level job slightly above minimum wage, but I realize that living just to make ends meet doing something that I don't really like might be ok temporarily but not in my best interest for the long term. So I've applied to college for the spring, and these are my questions...

1. While the school is reviewing my application I've been doing a lot of research into what programs they offer and what is popular. For people that have more ""real world"" experience than me, what would you recommend? I'm pretty much open to anything, but I'm scared of getting a degree then not being able to get a job in my field or a good paying job.

2. I had to plead guilty to all charges (all misdemeanors) brought against me as part of my plea deal to lowering the felony. But I did plead guilty to quite a few misdemeanors. Again, I worry that after putting in the work to do well in school and get a degree I'll still be screwed 5 years later when I go to apply for a good job and they run my record or look at my flaky job history. In other words, is it possible I could be wasting my time? People can and do change, but it's going through all this work and putting myself $100,000+ in debt to take a chance with potential employers.

3. Any other advice is appreciated, thanks for reading!",06Oct2018,1
297,"Hi, so I[17M] have been pretty lonely for a while now and I’ve been wanting a girlfriend for a while now. Before I get shit on, I understand wholeheartedly that a girlfriend is not an object, hence my wording. As the title states, I’m 17, and honestly this hasn’t been the best year for me overall, I won’t delve too deep into that but this year I think I’ve felt more lonely than I ever have. I’m currently a senior in high school, I’d say overall I’m a pretty active person, I skate, play soccer, workout nearly every other day, I make movies, do film photography, read, draw, and I watch movies(movie buff). Besides that I’m interested in a lot, traveling, world issues/politics, music, and art. I have a close friend group at school and honestly they’re really all I have besides my parents. Now, I’ve had girlfriends before, two really. The first girl, we had a good run, had classes together and eventually started going out, after a few months we broke up. I felt pretty shitty after it, took me a minute to forget about it and about a year ago I started dating this other girl, but it was a shitty relationship and it didn’t last too long and when it ended I wasn’t even upset about it. School is hard to find anyone because my school specifically is small and everyone knows each other, and I’m really just not interested in anyone there. I also deleted all my social media (Snapchat, Instagram) so it’s really just down to texting and calling people that have my number at this point. I could be slightly introverted, I have a hard time approaching most girls so most times I don’t do it. I feel like I have trouble holding conversations that are meaningful and can continue for a long while when I’m with someone(I’ve had a few “dates” this year, none of them going anywhere). A big thing that blocks me is my conscious telling me I’m “weird”. I don’t know where the notion came from but now every time I’m with someone, I somehow convince myself that I’m strange or that i make people uncomfortable(despite occasionally being a little shy I’m pretty normal and relatable to most people my age). When I’m with a girl and I’m used to her to an extent, I can loosen up a bit and feel more comfortable. It’s weird, when I’m with my friend group(that includes girls), I can talk about anything and everything, I could do stupid shit and feel completely normal about it. Besides that, I can’t flirt for shit, and even if I’m interested in someone, it’s hard for me to escalate it, meaning I have a hard time making a move. Last point, I don’t know where to meet girls outside of school that are in my age range, I do live in a big city so there has to be something. I go to parties occasionally, but even then most times it’s just people from school. What can I do?",06Oct2018,1

300,"Let's start this with saying, I can afford this trip. Money is not the issue.

Anyways, I have been seeing this girl for about 5 months now but have only officially been dating about a month but 4 of those months really were dating as well. We are both 19 and over our Christmas break have talked about me flying out with her to go meet her family which sounds really exciting to me. I know its early to make a trip decision like that as my parents say, I don't completely disagree. What do you think?",06Oct2018,1
301,"It's more of a recent thing, and I'm not completely averse to it. I've been to a couple of those types of parties, and they're not really my thing. Most of the time I can accept that a lot of people just do it, for whatever reason. I'm a very judgemental person, and I hate to say that I judge them for it. It's not so much of a big deal with the people that I don't talk to, though. I'm more worried and scared of my close friends who are into that kind of stuff. 


I try my best to respect that they can make their own choices, but it just kind of scares me, and makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes they want me to drink with them, and they're very kind about it. They're not really forceful and they don't get me to do anything dangerous, they just want to relax and have a good time. But my parents attached a negative stigma around drinking while raising me.


 I know that this is stigma good thing in the sense that it keeps me out of harm's way, but sometimes I do wanna be able to just kind of enjoy with my friends, and not feel uncomfortable around them when they're drinking. I know you don't NEED to drink to have fun, but it does make me feel a bit left out and alienated when I don't.


I generally don't drink at all when I go to huge parties because I find it stupid, but I want to be able to feel normal around some of my friends who are only doing it in moderation.


 I trust myself to not overdo it, but I just need to find a way to be a little more comfortable with it, and I don't know how. And most of all, I don't want to judge my friends so harshly for it. As long as they're happy, I'm happy. It's just that I was raised in such a way that I just tend to judge them for things like this, even though it's a pretty normal thing for high schoolers to do.

303,"I need some advice on my current place of work.

&amp;#x200B;

For a bit of context I worked at my current place of work for about 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing job X which is completely unrelated to my current job (software development) but during my time at job X I developed software to make my life easier in the job, this was picked up on and I was ""promoted"" to my current role. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in this role for 3 years now and have never had any form of new contract, despite asking for one multiple times. I have never been given a pay rise or any form of compensation for my new skilled job, despite asking multiple times.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I have developed multiple pieces of software for my company and I am looking elsewhere for jobs now as it seems quite apparent they have no interest in providing a new contract or a wage to go with the work I do.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is relatively simple, who owns the software?

&amp;#x200B;

Most software developer contracts I have seen implicitly state that software created is owned by the company etc. Seen as my contract is still from job X, would this apply as it's ""implied"" by the fact they have paid me a wage for the past 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I have any leg to stand on if I pulled all of my software? (I wouldnt do this as I don't want to sever my ties with the company)

&amp;#x200B;

Could I bill them for the software?

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have no leg to stand on at all and just have to take this as a learning experience?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

Promoted from job X to Y, developed lots of software, never got pay or contract to reflect this, who owns the software, what are my rights?

305,"TL;DR- can hardly feed myself and fearing having to live on my own in my car. 

When I was 16 years old my mum came up with the excuse that she’s “not legally obliged to feed me anymore” (not that she really fed me anyway) and I have suffered ever since. 

I’m now a 19 year old man standing at 5 foot 8.5 inches tall and 130lbs despite my best efforts to gain weight. Bulking has never been consistent as I can’t always afford to eat as I’ve been mostly unemployed whilst at college, but I have gained 20something lbs since I was able to feed myself with the money from the job I had at 16.

However, I’ve recently landed a great job that pays well and my mum expects me to pay lodge to live in her house. But the issue is, I can’t justify in my mind staying at home where the environment is dreadfully toxic and there is never any food. But I would barely scrape by if I rented out a flat of my own so that’s off the table. 

I fear that I may have to go live in my car all on my own. I really need some guidance. I need to learn how to cook for myself on a budget. I need to know if I could really survive on my own in my car and how to do it. I just want to be independent so I don’t have to deal with my horrible family. ",06Oct2018,1

307,"I like my best friend a lot. Not sure if I would classify it as “love,” but since I don't think I am very willing to sacrifice my entire life for the sake of hers, I guess I’ll call it a strong likeness towards her. We’ve been friends for almost two years now, which is short for most close friendships like that, but we became close very fast simply due to our similar thinking patterns that we’ve both constantly brought up. We aren’t alike in the sense that we have similar interests and tastes, but just by the way we think about things and process the world around us. We will often notice the same things at the same time and think about roughly the same things within conversation. 

Here’s the issue: she has a boyfriend. They are madly in love, and their relationship is perfect. They have never argued before (at least not that I know of), and she becomes extremely happy whenever she sees him. I can honestly not picture a more perfect relationship than theirs. And it really pains me to say this because I really do like her. They have been dating for something like three or four months longer than we have been friends for. I have absolutely zero confidence that I will ever be able to have her since she’s so madly in love with her boyfriend, and I wouldn’t want to ruin this guy’s relationship with her anyway. I’m sure he’s really happy, and if I were him, I would love and cherish her more than anything. I’m thinking of ghosting her so I can get over her, it is my last year of highschool (and I go to a prep school so I’m going to be extremely busy). I don’t want her to distract me (I have bad ADHD) from my school year, and I’m thinking if I stopped being friends with her I’ll be able to focus and stop thinking about her all the time. I honestly have never felt about a woman more than I have ever felt about her before, and I know it’s gonna break my heart to cut her off. But I know that it’s a necessary thing I have to do. 

If I did have one question, I guess it’s just “what is the right way to cut her off?” I don’t mind telling her I like her if it involves that, but I want it to be a calm separation without an argument (like we’ve done in the past). I want us both to benefit from this separation in some way.

308,"I’m a junior in college and I’ve never had roommates before until now. I have 3 other roommates and we are sharing an apartment. We have our own individual bedrooms and we pay our own rent and we split the common area (living room and kitchen). 

Ok, so two of my roommates get mad that i have this guy I’m seeing over at night. They say they need to know who is in the apartment and if someone is staying the night. (Eventhough the guy would be in MY room). Whenever i have someone over, they are always in my room. They say they need to know because it’s for “safety reasons” and that it’s inconsiderate to have guys over late at night on a weekday. 
**Even though, i pay my own rent and utilities.**

**They said that they don’t care if girls are over at night but they get mad whenever a guy is over especially without notifying them about it**

So I just told them that I won’t have anyone over at all anymore. It’s unfair to me but I just don’t like having any problems with anyone especially because I’m stuck with them until the summer 

Last night, they texted who has a guy over and I did text “I do” but my message didn’t deliver so it didn’t go through and i woke up with paragraphs of them freaking out.

For example everyone in my class thinks I got the highest score on our last exam and he was telling everyone that I don't deserve it. Also he's a pathological liar and I can't believe the students actually believe the shit he makes up.

311,"I will jump in directly:

I already get a good salary for the job I do, but when my boss laid of a colleague of mine, he put 40% of her work onto my desk. I am a pretty aggressive negotiator so I tried to push for a 30% raise, as I knew otherwise they had to hire a new person, which would have been much more expensive. The thing is, my boss does not decide upon this matter, not before getting a green light from the CFO. The CFO says my raise would go against salary equality within the company. So this caused some tension between me and my boss, as he had to fight for my demands, trying to get me to take on the extra work. And I saw myself in a good negotiation position, as I am really difficult to replace and now he wants the work of the colleague that he laid off done for a cheap. 

I even spoke with the CEO, and he thinks this behavior may close some doors in the future, but he meant it in a well meaning manner. 

The company is still a family business and people are expected to take a step back when it comes to taking on more work. It seems that I am the first person to go against that and it causes huge tensions. But I think this is normal, as the company gets bigger and more structured, people have more demands.

What do you think, should a person in my situation use the good negotiation position and fight for a fair salary or take a knee and show more loyalty? 

Honestly I feel like a bad person, as I do not confrom as all my collegues do, but when I think about captialism, any salary I can fight for is a salary I deserve on a free market - its not my fault the other can't or won't fight for their own cause.",06Oct2018,1

more then that, i can be much more happy after using it, i finally feel happy, and enjoying spending time just watching funny stuff, and get more focused and willing when it comes to my daily tasks and work.

without weed its extremly hard for me to feel happy.

what would you suggest me to do? to quit the habbit and feel at least as good without it?

(well, except that 8 month period where i tried going away to college before deciding i hated it). my town is relatively small but isn't rural by any means. i live about an hour and a half outside of chicago, making every possible living situation insanely overpriced, even in my own town. one bedroom apartments can't be found for under 900 dollars at the very least, and studios just don't exist until you wander closer to the city (and there, they still cost 900+).

my parents aren't necessarily urging me to move out or giving me any ultimatums, but since i'm not going to college and have finally acquired a full time job that, for now, pays the bills, i figured it was time to consider making a change. the problem is that my current job only makes about 19k a year at best. which for a single young woman living at home is like winning the lottery, but for a single young woman looking for an apartment living so close to a major u.s city, is a nightmare. my state in general is an absurdly expensive state to live and breath in overall.

I’m a huge stoner and obviously that makes Amsterdam appealing, but beyond that I’ve been told that Amsterdam has a very “oddball” culture in that everyone is very unique and kind of strange.

Another pro is that since Amsterdam is in Europe I could travel all over and see a lot more than just Amsterdam. Finally, I’ve only just recently realized and accepted my bisexuality and the open-mindedness of Amsterdam and Europe in general feels like it might be the perfect place to discover more about myself and my sexuality.

BUT Cape Town is supposed to be incredible and beautiful and it’s in Africa and I don’t think I’d ever go to Africa at any other time, while I could go to Europe easily at some point in the future. Furthermore, everyone who has done an abroad program in Cape Town says it’s literally life changing and a unique abroad experience.

327,"I [F41] think my FWB [M40] might have stronger feelings for me than just being best friends who have amazing sex.

A little background, then I’ll bullet out my thoughts for simplicity.  TLDR at the bottom.

I should start off saying that we have never actually said or formally established we are “friends with benefits”. Our FWB status is based on where we are in life, past comments, and me being careful and making safe assumptions. We are just having a lot of fun. 

Background: We met each other at work about 20 years ago. We stopped working together when I left the company in 2002. We stayed in touch quite a bit then a couple years later he moved to another state, far away. Over the years we stayed in touch, mostly through social media. I have always adored him and thought of him as a good, honest, and reliable friend. He got married in 2013. He moved back “home” to the area I live in, in 2014. He got divorced in 2015. We have remained in contact and friends.  We had become very close, primarily online and over the phone, but didn’t hang out again until about a little over a month ago.  Both our lives have been crazy. I consider him one of my best homies. 

Our turning point: I sent him a text last October wishing him a happy birthday. That text sparked a lot of conversation and catching up.  Since the birthday text, almost a year ago, we have talked almost every single day.

*He often texts me first. If I text first, he always responds.

*We talk on the phone, hear each other’s voice a couple times a week.

*We text for several hours at a time almost every night. Deep conversation. We have become very close.

*Our voice phone calls average 2 hours.

*We flirt. A lot.

*About three months ago our texts and phone calls went to a different level... sexual.

*He has a hard past and has been hurt badly by women, especially his ex wife. He is very guarded. He is insecure. He has low self-esteem because of heartbreak and is skittish.  I am recently single. So, we have made comments in the past about how neither one of us wants a relationship because he has been single a long time and “it scares the shit out of” him, and I haven’t been single in a long time and it scares me too.  That conversation happened about two months ago.

Current status: About four weeks ago we finally hung out for the first time in many, many years.  We hung out for several hours talking and watching TV together.  We spent six hours together and ended up having sex.  A lot of amazing sex. Since then we have hung out one night every weekend and have the most intense and amazing sex.  Rounds and rounds of great sex.

Since the first time we hooked up he seems a lot more into me.  So, I’m kinda looking for a man’s point of view or someone’s point of view who has been through something similar.

*He is texting me more now.  More than before we started sleeping together. Most often he is the first to text.  I get a lot of random “whatcha doing” messages. 

*I get a good morning and good night text every day.

*He talks about how he can’t wait to see me again

*The content and tone of our chats hasn’t changed. The chats haven’t gotten awkward at all, we are still comfortable with each other, and it hasn’t turned into just talking about hooking up.

*He has been using the kissy and heart emoji’s a lot more than he used to. 

*He is calling me “dear” “hun” and “sweetheart” now.

*Last weekend we hung out watching a couple movies and he held me the entire time.  He was so lovey with me.  Kissing my forehead, smelling my hair, holding my hand, staring at me. Snuggling. 

*This past weekend the sex was way more loving, sensual, and intense. A lot more kissing, looking in each other’s eyes, caressing my face, slow and passionate, etc.

*I left in the morning and after I text him to tell him I got home safe he told me that the sex is amazing, and all the cuddles and holding each other is the best part.  He shared that cuddling with me is his favorite part. 

I’m twitterpated!  I don’t know how I feel about this.  Could it be that he has stronger feelings now than just FWB?  I’m just going with the flow, but wonder if I am looking too much into it.  Could it be that he is just a passionate lovey lover and really just a friend with amazing benefits?  I’m not used to such passionate sex and being with someone who isn’t selfish in bed. I don’t want to look too much into this, so I need advice.  We are both guarded and lonely, I might be thinking about this too much. I might be overthinking this. Ugh! 

I know, if we are so close, I should just ask him. I really feel like I don’t want to bring it up...yet.  I kind of want to see how things go, but it’s making me crazy wondering if he is falling deeper for me.  I don’t want for it to seem like things are going to get complicated with me if I try to define what’s going on with us. He is an AMAZING man in so many ways. I’m really okay with, and at a place in my life where I can just be friends with benefits even though if I be honest with myself, I do have feelings for him.  I wouldn’t be devastated or end it if I learned that I am overthinking it and he just wants to only be best friends who passionately screw. 

 
TL;DR: I think my FWB might have stronger feelings for me than just friends who have great sex.  Last weekend got a lot more intense, more sensual, and what seemed like very loving and passionate sex.  Then he told me that the cuddling was his favorite part.  Does it sound like he has fallen for me?",06Oct2018,1

329,"Hello everyone. This is a throwaway account for anonymity. 

I am a 27 year old straight male and have had a rough adult life. I believe it has something to do with an incident that had occurred when I was a very young child. 

Here's my story.

I have no idea how old I was exactly; anywhere between 8 and 11. I helped in a greenhouse with my little brother and ""grandmother"" (she was married to my biological grandfather, no relation to her). My grandmother's daughter, my ""aunt"", had two boys as well (my ""cousins"") and they would come over and we would mess around and play fight in the front yard. Completely normal behavior. Then after a while everything changed.

My older ""cousin"", 14 -16 years old, started to hang out with my little brother and me a little more than usual. Then, one day he  told us about this new game and if we played, we would feel stronger. He called this ""power-up"". After accepting this offer of this new game, my brother and I were led into a closet, one at a time. There, My ""cousin"" would molest us both, several times over a month or two. I could tell something was wrong with what he was doing, but i didn't know. 

He tried another time, the last time, and I refused. My little brother, however, accepted. I used that opportunity to tell my grandmother what he was doing to us (albeit, as a child who has no idea what sex is). After that, I was informed it would be taken care of and he wouldn't do it again. I have no idea if justice was served or not. 

I believe this incident caused some mental damage. I developed a habit of wearing female clothing from the occurrence of the ordeal, up until I was about 14 and off and on as an adult.

I saw this cousin recently, a couple years ago, at my little brother's funeral. The rage I felt that he had the nerve to show his face.

I have had a rough sex life. I've had multiple sexual partners. I can't keep a partner for longer than a few months and if I do, I never get truly attached and look for something else. It is very hard for me to form bonds with others.

I wish I would've pursued something, but I was a clueless child that was unaware of the psychological damage that may have occurred. I have been to a few therapists throughout the years, but nothing really helpful has been accomplished. 

I can count on my left hand alone how many people know what happened, and one of them has passed.

What can I do about this? What are my options? Am I truly scarred for life?

Thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read this.

333,"There’s so much going on right now inside my own family and with my house which is on property my dad collects rent for, for his friend who owns the land. This is a long situation with many negative ends I can’t seem to answer on my own so I figured I’d come here and see what advice could be offered or to at least vent a little. 
There are two trailers on the property where I live. One trailer houses my parents, my brother and his girlfriend and their 3 kids plus a couple dogs. 
The other one houses myself, my 9month pregnant girlfriend, her dog princess and occasionally my 4 year old daughter. 

We’ve recently had issues because my brothers gf who has a history of lying and being lazy lied again and I couldn’t ignore it. She constantly lied to avoid jobs, barely has worked in her life and when she did, cheated on my brother who took her back and has let sink fulls of dishes mold before washing them and instead buying new ones come tax time. 
This time around she was pregnant with her 3rd child, has just came back to my parents with my brother after getting kicked out for screaming at each other and the kids and in turn living with friends who called them out on being scumbags so they came back. While my parents kicked them out the first time for screaming she told my mother she miscarried the baby from all the stress. Fast forward a few weeks when their friends call them scumbags and they come crawling back, she’s still pregnant. 
Now she’s claiming the child is having heart issues, specifically the left ventricle not forming at all and that they’re planning emergency c sections for later dates and surgeries and a bunch of other terrifying things because of this heart issue. 
Meanwhile she sits in a couch on Facebook, has her 4 year old take care of her 2 year old and will get up to do one thing right before my brother gets home from work so when he walks in she can say “watch the kids” and go in the room to continue what she did all day. 
These complications mean more laziness. 

Fast forward a few weeks and she has an appointment and just kind of drops to everyone that they checked the baby’s heart and everything was fine. It healed. All on its own. It will no longer ever need any type of attention and the doctor was so happy and astonished they cried together. 

My 29 year old sister has Muscular Dystrophy and is sitting fresh out of her 2nd or 3rd heart surgery. This time to have a defibrillator put in her chest. Doing a little research and asking some doctors lead me and the rest of my family minus my brother to know she was lying as she has 0 paperwork on any medical issues, has no name for any condition and other factors I’ll get to. 
I couldn’t sit back and pretend she didn’t fake a condition to be more lazy while pregnant while my sister was sitting healing from an actual heart surgery so I called her out. 
My brother proceeded to want to fist fight me and she proceeded to attack my personal life on social media and to my girlfriend instead of doing the very simple thing of proving me wrong making me look like a giant asshat. 
Not once has that been done which is also fishy because it’s as simple as asking for a piece of paper from a doctor. 
That’s too hard to do but fist fighting and insulting each other is worth it? Idk. I feel there’s more to that but I’m scramble brained right now as I said, there’s a lot. 

My house sucks. It’s an old ass trailer and the only reason I’m here is because rent is fairly cheap and I’m told the land will one day be mine. Anytime anything needs fixing it’s like pulling teeth. We have mice everywhere and mold and I’m the asshole whenever I bring it up because I should be grateful I have a house. The regulator on our propane stove broke last winter and I was told that it would be up to me to replace it as my sister (she lived here before me) bought it and it wasn’t the original stove. 
My furnace has been a pain and I went multiple days last winter with no heat resulting in freezing pipes and more because, well I don’t know. I’d tell my father and get told to wait and if it upset me I was told I’m welcome to leave and someone else would rent this. ((No one would pay the cheap rent I pay to live here, trust me. Plus leaving isn’t that easy with no savings and horrible credit)) 
The furnace got infested with mice this spring and summer and some apparently died in the vents because, we can smell it. I’ve brought it to my fathers attention and asked it gets fixed for months while blocking vents with blankets to not smell rotting animals. I’ve gotten told it will be fixed for this entire time. 
My girlfriend is now due any day, it has been cold for a month now with no sign of warming up and I have no means of heat besides the space heater I had to buy because I can’t run my furnace and my dad just brought a guy down to look at them. 
The guy said it’s bad to breath so we need to replace everything and he’d be back in a month to do it. 
A month. 

I work every day. I have a decent job. I have a car. I pay my bills. I pay WiFi for my house and my parents. I’m doing okay but I don’t have the ability to just leave and idk what else to do. Leave or sit here and deal with this bullshit?

I was even allowed to play a year of lacrosse and had a great time. Those old wishes of wanting to play soccer have always lingered, though, and I really want to play, but I am too scared for some reason. I think I’m too worried of what others will think of me and whether or not I am too old to just begin to play soccer since I am 16 and this would be my first time playing ever.

338,"About a week and a half ago myself and two other co workers were trying to decide where to go for lunch.

She said I don't really care so y'all figure out. I replied in a joking but serious way and said "" we'll just go without you"". We both kind of laughed and she said ""how are you going to go anywhere without a car?"" (Because I do not currently own one)

This embarrassed me since she said it in front of some other co workers so I responded and said "" I'll just ride with him since unlike you he has his s*** together"". This made her really mad because she thought I was talking about her life when the reality of it was I was talking about the current situation. 

She told me to take it back and I said no and then she leaned over the table we were standing at and got in my face and asked if I was going to take it back again to which I replied with no again. She then started yelling in my face about how I think I know about here life when I really don't know anything. And every time I tried to explain what I said she would just interrupt me and keep yelling. 

As she was yelling at me I leaned back so she wasn't right in front of my face and that's when my other co worker came over and separated us. Later on that day my other co worker told her what she did was wrong and she said sorry but I didn't want to hear it because the whole situation really pissed me off so I just said don't worry about it and went on about my day.

Now I should point out that everyone at the warehouse is pretty close to her mainly because she's the only female who works with us at the moment and she's a really nice chill girl. I had told her she was like the sister I always wanted but never had.

Ever since this happened it reminded me of some bad times in my life where my parents were splitting up and my dad would sometimes yell at us. So ever since it happened I've been trying to sort of avoid her and not talk to her alot and now she's starting to catch on. She asked me yesterday if I was still mad and I just said no but she said there was obviously an elephant in the room because I've hardly looked or talked to her. I just kept denying anything was wrong and she said if I ever needed to talk to her then I could.

So here's where I need some advice. I want to forgive her and move on but what she did really bothered me because of previous events and that part of me is saying to just kind of break off and let her go and just be co workers. Should I forgive her and move on or not or tell her what the problem is? I just font know and I could use  some advice. Thanks.",06Oct2018,1
339,"Long story, unfortunately, but I'm going to try and condense it as much as I can. I'm also quite certain that anyone who sees this and knows me will identify me from this post, so my apologies if I'm vague.

I'm an adult who has already lived on my own for several years. Late this winter, my parents began having issues and fighting, and I felt that I was always dragged into it. A couple times, I blew up on them for calling me in the middle of the night - once my father, telling me that my mom had left and he couldn't find her, once my mother telling me that I needed to come get her because my dad wouldn't get out of her face.

Background: my parents have always fought quite a bit. My mom drinks heavily, and my father, while he means well, is the type who always wants to hash things out when they happen. It's been a bad combination, historically.

Anyway. My parents decided a few months ago to divorce, which would have been probably ideal, except my parents have also been caring for my young niece for years (my older sister is not in the picture). My father does shiftwork and had no idea how he would work his schedule around getting my niece to school. My niece was the primary factor in me choosing to move back home with my father, since I am guaranteed to be home to get her ready for the school bus, and I finish work not long after school lets out.

So that was the first bit of conflict between my mother and me: she wanted me to move in with HER, to help her afford an apartment. My mother, by this point, already had a boyfriend that she was staying with, and my father doesn't have much close family, so the choice to me was obvious: for my niece's sake, I wanted to stay.

After that, I saw my mother a couple times on good terms, but lately things have begun to go sour. For the last month or so, my mother only messages me when she needs something: she's messaged me, sometimes late at night, to bring her beer, cigarettes, weed, or to bring her home from the bar because her boyfriend is too drunk to drive. She also messages me without fail on my day off work with a list of places that she needs to go (bank, library, grocery store, etc). My mom doesn't drive, her boyfriend does. Of course, I don't mind helping my mother out however I can, but she gets mad at me when I can't or won't bring her to every location that she needs.

I have also become aware of some text messages that she sent to my father, despite being adamant that she just wants peace between them. She texted him telling him something like ""good luck finding a new housemaid"" and then making fun of us for the house being messy on a day that she stopped over. It's my dad and I who manage the housework now, each working two jobs in addition to the care of my niece, so I told her about a week ago that I didn't appreciate her commenting on my housekeeping. She called my dad later and gave him hell for telling me, apparently.

The final straw that is making me post here today was coming home on my lunchbreak today to find my mother sitting on the front porch. I asked her what was up, since she had told me she was scared to come back to the house and confront my dad (he was gone to work). She told me that her phone had broken, so she called my dad from her nearby work and got his permission to come down and use the phone book. It was early afternoon, and she was drinking one of my dad's beers from the fridge, with an empty can sitting nearby. I mentioned this, and she just said that ""he can be mad if he wants to, I don't care"". She was waiting for her boyfriend to come pick her up and bring her to the bar.

I think at this point, it's clear that my mother has a problem with drinking. Other family members are concerned but none seem to notice it was much as I do. However, my mom is adamant that there is nothing wrong, and that it's *just* her boyfriend who drinks too much. If she doesn't need anything from me, I'm fairly confident that she won't even respond to my messages, so I'm kind of in a bind and not sure what move to make. I don't know if I should keep stressing about this. If I should just help her as much as I can, because she's my mother, after all. Or if I should tell her point blank that she needs help, and risk her getting mad. Lately I've been thinking more and more that I need to cut contact for my own sanity, but obviously I don't want to do this to a family member who's obviously in need. I wonder often if she even realizes that she's been treating me like a cab service. Right now, I'm not even sure if I should tell my father that she was drinking at our home today, but I do know that I will be more diligent about locking the doors for now.",06Oct2018,1

341,"This is a long one, for the sake of the story/inquiry for advice we will call him John. 

I have worked with John for roughly a year now and as of recently me and a few co-workers discovered that John has been essentially living a complete lie. He tells everybody that he is a chemistry teacher at a prominent school, that he has a doctorate in education and chemistry. We can't find him anywhere in their database of teaching or staff, when calling and asking for him they have no knowledge of who he is. He creeps most of the female workers out, touching them ""innocently"". He makes phone calls to numbers that don't make sense with the conversation that Is being had on the company phone. 
For example he called and was talking to his ""boss"" we shall call Dr. Jacobs. But when reverse searching the phone number for this Dr. Jacobs it's linked to a tree cutting company. He is very private about his entire life, won't even give a phone number out to contact him about work related things. 
He leaves to go to his car a few times per night to do who knows what. 
When I approached him about the rumors about his Id's not matching with official ids from the school he told me that they were ""government issued"" and he wasn't supposed to talk about it. They also didn't have a picture of him on them which I feel if he's working for the government they should have some form of picture identification on them. 
I caught him watching porn during work the other day which he doesn't know, also not illegal as he was not touching himself. Me and other coworkers feel this was a bait to see if we would spread that information to other employees.

342,"Okay so this is a random question. What's your opinion?
My opinion is that if I had a bf/spouse going to a strip club to have random women grind on his parts is inappropriate. Imagine a married woman or in a relationship, having a man grinding and wiggling his junk on her ass, chest, and even right on her own junk? Pretty sure the other half (he/she) wouldn't be a very happy camper.
I think this should be a double standards thing.
Theres a percentage of some that try to justify this by and some even saying ""its a guy thing"". To me it's just not a good look and even slightly disrespectful because it's pushing the bounds.
I know that its a job and that's what strippers do. Not ripping off on anyone and what they do. I only think that too many (in relationships/or even married) folks make the mistake of doing things like this.
I personally wouldn't take a man/woman that is capable of doing things like this serious enough due to the mindset that they're portraying.

349,"This is going to be long and detailed, so buckle in.  TLDR near the bottom.

Context:  We're both sophomores at art school (*insert ""art isn't a career"" joke here*), and we both share a studio space and four classes that are nearly 3 hours long each.  It has been a month and a half since school started.  My crush is a transfer student.

Notes about her:  She seems quiet and shy.  In between classes, she does not seem to talk to anyone, except sometimes a girl who sits next to her (who is also a transfer student).  In class discussions and critiques, she generally says very little.  

I have talked with her prior to me writing this; in fact, I would say we are at least acquaintances.  While I am the one who initiates conversation all of the time, she never seems bothered by our conversations.  I make sure to never talk to her when she has her earbuds in.  Conversations are short, mostly about class and the art we're making.  When I do talk to her, she seems to have a snarky, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humor.  She laughs at a lot of my jokes, including some really dumb ones.

From a few conversations, it seems like we have some similar interests in some tv shows and video games.  She gave me her Instagram page to follow, and told me ""Don't send dick picks"" (I really want to send a picture of Dick Cheney to see how she reacts) and she followed me in turn.

She was absent for a few days, and I offered to give her updates on our homework and what went on in class through instagram.  She agreed, and seemed appreciative of when I sent her the updates.  (She was absent for a secret reason, and she shared the secret with me, but because it was a secret, I will not tell you why she was absent.  I think this is worth mentioning solely because it seems like she trust me enough to share the secret, as only her roommate and her friend next her are likely the ones who knew.)

When we have class together, she will sometimes choose to sit next to me; as in, there will be multiple seats available, and she will sometimes decide to sit next to me.  I would say it's 50/50 on sitting next to me or not.  We sometimes have playful banter, mostly about our computer brands or an art method.  There was a time where I got up to go to the bathroom, and for some reason an empty chair around me fell over (maybe I knocked it over?) and she quickly turned to me and asked ""what did you do?"" in a joking ""serious"" tone.  I have no idea if this story is relevant, but better safe than sorry.

Notes about me:  I know I am not the best looking guy, but I am working on improving myself.  I generally try to get along with most people.  Friends have described me as smart and considerate, but also kind of a dumbass.  I know that I am rather shy and introverted, and I have never been in a relationship, so I have no idea what I am doing.  Additionally, while I would *like* to be in a relationship with her, I do not *need* to be.  I am fine with just being her friend.  I am male.

Notes from friends:  My friends (who are mostly female) told me to try and be her friend first, which is what I am working on.  They have recommended that I take things slow, and to not rush anything.  They've also warned me that, statistically, nothing will likely come from this, which I am keeping in mind.  They also said to not get advice from the internet because it's overly generalized; this thread seems to be a limbo since I am providing so much context.

The Plan:  Next weekend, we will have no homework because our equivalent of midterms will be over.  I was thinking after all of our classwork is done for the week, I ask my crush if she wants to hang out and play video games/watch tv/watch a movie/etc. that coming weekend.  I had already asked her once before, but she had said that she had classwork to do and wouldn't be able to fit it into her schedule; she had said that ""she's really sorry"" that she couldn't hang out.  By hanging out next weekend, she should be more available to hang out, and I will be able to determine if she has any interest or no interest.  

TLDR:  I have a crush on a shy, introverted girl who, at least so far, does not seem to hate me.  We seem to get along decently, and I plan on asking her to hang out soon.  While I want to be in a relationship with her, I am more than fine with just being her friend.

This wasn't always the case as I was pretty much socially isolated throughout high-school (I'm definitely not the only person to have been through this), but ever since I've been in university, being surrounded by like-minded people has helped me improve my social skills and generally be received as a likable person. In fact, people tell me they look up to me and impressed by my technical skills, work ethic, ambitions and maturity.  I'm definitely not some genius or some super human, there's a lot of things people do not see.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm in my early 20s, pursuing a demanding study and working most of the week at a company not many people can get into easily. I work out every two days, I'm in pretty good shape, eat and cook healthy, try out new things (hobbies) and go out every week or so.

&amp;#x200B;

However,  in the last few weeks I've realized that the people around me are just.. So much more happier in life? Whenever I speak to my friends about happiness they tell me it's about loving yourself. I find this such a difficult answer; as the main advice people give when it comes to ""loving yourself"" is doing exactly what I am doing.

&amp;#x200B;

These things have lead me to feel rather uncertain about myself, about who I am, how I look and how people look at me. It almost feels like I sometimes need validation that I'm actually liked by spending time with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

This also leads me to another issue I have; which is the impact of romantic relationships to my happiness. I haven't been in a romantic relationship for a while and I almost feel as if I really need this feeling of being ""loved"" again. There's a certain feeling of jealousy that arises when I'm around the significant other / romantic interest of my friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

The test didn’t give me a single question I studied for, and I probably fucked the maths section. It was probably worse than my first sat.I don’t know what to do, my gpa is decent (3.8), but I have a low sat, little curriculars, and I apply to college soon(wanted to research physics, but that’s probably not happening now).

361,"Gonna be kinda vague since my boyfriend is a hardcore Redditer but I desperately need advice. 

Last night, my boyfriend and I had a “fight”, i guess. I don’t know what to call it. We’ve been dating for about 1.5 years. 

Let me just say-this last month has not been easy for us, specifically me. I have not been the same girlfriend I usually am , but I am still putting him very high up on my list. I’ve been really stressed out and depressed but I see the sun coming out! This happens to me once every few months, where everything seems to hit at once you know? 

Anyways, I came home from work to spend the night with him yesterday, . Everything seemed fine, we got dinner, then I noticed he wasn’t really touching me and seemed very closed off (to be fair, I wasn’t making any moves at this point). 

So I left him alone and we talked casually until dinner, after I laid my head on his shoulder and instead of embrace, he just sat there. So I asked what was wrong. This is when the spiral happened. 

He didn’t say much at all, except that what I said last weekend upset him. What I said last weekend was something to the point of “sometimes I think you’ll never commit to me fully (he’s scared of marriage, etc), and I don’t see much progress happening when we fight (he has bad fighting habits, as do I. Which he said he’d work on but it really has never gotten better).  

I was talking so MUCH it seemed, just saying it’s a harsh truth but still, we all have to hear them in life. I referenced a few times he said harsh truths to me and mentioned he’s allowed to be upset, but if he’s gonna hold onto it, this is not gonna work. 

He said that he’s been “doing it for 20 years so it isn’t gonna change over night” and things of that nature 

He shut down as always and refused to talk to me. I had work in the morning, and so I started getting ready for bed and turned off the lights. I tried prying more, nothing. 

I finally asked “do you wanna break up with me?” And he paused for minutes, and then just said “no.” It literally broke my heart. 

To make a long story short-the next 30 minutes is me crying and telling him how much I love him and asking why we would break up over this and him telling me he “doesn’t know if we’ll work as people when we move in yoether” and that “he doesn’t know what he wants”. 

But in a turn of events! He finally just said “you have things to work on and I have things to work on, it isn’t a big deal!!! I of course wasn’t gonna leave you”. 

So you mean, you kept me up for hours on a work night, complement dramatized the fight when literally the issue was so small. 

I didn’t blow up on him, but I was upset because I feel like this is how all our fights (we don’t fight often) happen. I say something that’s a harsh truth, he gets pissed and pouty because he doesn’t want to hear it. And then we have this blowup and he makes it drama and then it’s back to “normal”. 

I don’t know. I literally have no idea what this post is even asking but how the fuck do I fix this? Everything was normal this morning. I feel so hurt that I was put in the position to essentially stroke his ego by crying my eyes out over the thought of us breaking up.

362,"Employed a new starter 2 months ago, so far she has had 2 sick days for Diarrhea and Vomiting ( we work in food so has to have 48 hours clear) both times have been reports on Friday / Saturday so ended up having all weekend off.

One occasion she turned up at work with the police - they apparently pulled her over on the way to work after a neighbour called them for her arguing with her partner instead of dealing with it at the side of the road she brought them to work.

Partner has been ringing the shop nearly every shift even after we asked her not to take personal calls that aren't emergencies at work.

367,"Like I said, it’s a long story short and if anyone actually cares to know the complete story I would be willing to tell you if you contact me for privacy reasons because some of this might not make sense to anyone without full details, but here’s the gist of it.


Some scumfucker landlord sued me over a bunch of random shit after trying to find me in default of a lease and sending me an eviction notice in retaliation. 

He filed a complaint to the courthouse and we went to court. Throughout the entire process I had a lawyer backing me and I communicated very closely with him and the police with any issues. Each notice provided to me saying I was in default of the lease was realllll petty shit and I was given time to fix it, which I did. I was actually no longer in default of the lease but he sent me an eviction notice anyway. I basically told him since he wants me gone I will leave and I gave him some months notice and never really heard from him about it. 

The lease says that I will be charged rent for however long it takes them to find a new tenant.

Before leaving I took a bunch of pictures showing the condition of the place. Also before leaving this man took pieces of my mail and opened them and I can’t prove this of course. He illegally audio recorded me and showed the recording to the police that I called who told him to delete it. He harassed me via text at 4am. He accused me of fraud under his name. He accused me of damages and theft of certain items. He accused a friend of mine of doing something on his property (that the landlord actually did) on a day which my friend was not even on the premises. He sent me duplicate certified letters a decent timeframe apart just to harass me and get under my skin. 

All of the above, and this motherfucker lied under oath in court. I don’t know how he won but he did and I don’t know what to do. I’m gonna guess he won because the judge was literally a loser who acted like he didn’t have time to be there and actually listen to the case and do his job. My lawyer fees were like 5x his and now I owe him for a bunch of shit he basically lied about on top of my own fees. I say basically because of technicalities, such as saying that I “damaged” this but it’s actually due to normal wear and tear over a long period of time. Obviously I can’t prove he lied under oath but this shit is such a joke and I need help.

I have to pay this prick or they’re going to send police and have personal possessions appraised to get him his money. I’m current down almost $20,000 because of the costs of court among all my other debt.

But wait, there’s more...

This guy WON IN COURT but only he would have the fucking nerve to APPEAL the judgement because he’s a pathetic excuse of a man and can’t just move on. I know he just wants more money and he’s the one who wasted everyone’s time going through all of this. Who the fuck WINS a case and still feels compelled to appeal it especially when it’s only monetary gain. Your wasting more of your money to go through court and ask for more money, and then you’re going to tack on the extra fees you just spent trying to get more money. Then if I have to go to court I’ll accrue more lawyer fees of my own.

I know it’s not over with this guy and I just don’t know what to do. I’d really like to start a GoFundMe or something but I wouldn’t even have enough exposure to raise a decent amount to help me through this if I did it on my own. I can’t get a loan because I already took out loans to pay my lawyer.

Is filing bankruptcy an option? If I file bankruptcy would I still owe this guy? I’m sure if I didn’t he would just continue taking me to court because he’s literally got nothing better to do with his life.

I swear if you knew all the details you’d be blown away at how much of a douche this guy is. I literally did nothing to him.

I’ve been getting emails from obvious scam addresses promoting some Skylink Antenna or whatever it is and they all end in @hawaii.com. I’ve been sending them to spam to get rid of them and occasionally blocking addresses, but every time it seems it’s a different email address so it doesn’t block it. Last week I received another email from another scam, so I blocked the email address, however a few hours later the exact same address emailed me a very similar scam. Most of the emails are things like “Lucyr (taken from the lucyr.svaonfbri@brownwvu.com of my email) how hold you like some bitcoins” and “Lucyr, Amazon wants to know if you’re up for testing dyson hoovers” and so on, but they’re from different addresses so it’s really hard to monitor them. 

How do I keep these emails away? They’re really winding me up as it’s happened before (I used to receive upwards of 30 scam emails per day back in ‘14) and it just gets tedious reading through the subject lines (I don’t open them) to try and sort what’s actually meant for me and what’s been sent by robots.

386,"I'm kinda at a loss right now. I thought maybe she was going through some things and wanted her own space but I asked her if everything was okay with us. 

Some backstory - She had invited me to the group a few years back after confiding in her that I was feeling incredibly lonely. When I first got invited I was super active and she didn't like that so she started acting weird and stopped talking to me as frequently. I asked her what was up and she said that I was talking to much in there and it used to be her space to hang out. My feelings were super hurt because I felt welcome and people talked to me but she meant more to me then people I barely knew so I left the group. She said she didn't want that but just didn't want me to talk as much. I join back but feel like she's judging everything I say and is building up resentment that I'm there. anyways, i'm active on and off over next few years. 

Fast forward to around a month ago. She's hardly in the group much but I'm active in the group again. We play games together and I'm enjoying myself. She stops talking to me again. Let me preface saying the group is male dominated and I was meme-ing a lot with the uwu and ""im a girl teehee"" in what I thought was ironic but I guess it wasn't as obvious to her.

She is upset I'm talking like that with her friends and I apologize and say I'll stop talking like that. I respect her and again, don't want her to feel this way in a group she invited me to. She also tells me I have a problem with attaching to groups of people who give me attention. I have done this in the past. I've always been an incredibly insecure person so when people seem like we're friends, I get instantly attached and focus too much of my time with them. and that I was ignoring her in our other groups or simply not responding. Which I am guilty of as well. 

I kinda stood my ground this time and said that I'm not going to stop being active because at this point they're my friends too. I thought we were working through it next couple days but it's the same thing again. She doesn't speak to me outside of sending me the occasional snapchat - which I'll respond to and *maybe* get a short response. All my other messages are left unread for days or simply ignored. 

My self esteem is in the trash because she's the one person I thought would judge me the least but now I feel like if she doesn't even like me, who could? I'm more lonely now then I've been because I'm chasing a person that I thought would be in my life for a long time, wants nothing to do with me. I don't know what to do. Do I leave the group? I tried to change and be the least annoying version of myself but that hasn't helped. Without them I have no one to talk to though. 

I also want to add, I may be missing a few pieces and this is from my point of view so I may not know her full perspective. But please, any advice you can give would be really nice. Thank you.",06Oct2018,1

I think about a world where she's not alive and it brings me so much pain, I cant imagine what will happen if she's actually gone. I don't wanna continuously text her and annoy her because she's gotten to the point where she doesn't care about anyone or anything, shes just absolutely done with living because of how much pain she's in. I'm worried that if I keep checking up on her, she'll get annoyed and start to push me away or ignore me because thats something she would do. Sometimes when I text her she doesn't even text back so I just leave it and wait for her to come talk to me. I have made sure to tell her how important she is to me and how much I love and care for her..etc but I don't think anything is gonna change her mind.

I have a scholarship at an affordable college, but my parents do pay the remainder of the tuition, and gas, and they also pay for all of the food.

I've been going to counseling and working on getting better, but I'm feeling pretty darn low today. I feel like maybe it's just me who's on edge. My dad asked for me to patch up his jeans and I have midterms, so that sort of annoyed me, and my mom just tends to get super nervous about a lot of things in my life that are supposed to be my problem and that doesn't really help the anxiety I already have, but if I'm stuck in a really bad situation, she helps me and she's supportive.

They don't do this anymore because I told them it really bothered me, and things are much, much better now. My therapist has been fantastic.

408,"I'm a junior college student. My parents and I were very close the 20 years I was living with them, but they've been super religious, conservative, and overprotective as long as I've known them. I moved out over a year ago on my own into student housing, since then have moved into an apartment with my SO whom they know nothing about. (Joint lease, split rent) My parents knew where I lived when I was in student housing, because I told them even after I moved against their will. I bought myself my own first car at 20, three months before I moved out, since they wouldn't help me get a car even after I'd been in college for 3 years, instead my mom would still drive me to college, every day, as if I was still in middle school... which gets ridiculous when you're 20 and working three part-time jobs. Since I moved out of student housing, they have joked/suggested/asked that I invite them over for dinner, which I refused to their disappointment, have asked me to move back in with them once I finish my bachelor's, and have been trying to get my current address for ""emergency purposes."" I'm 21. I have an associate's degree, a full-time job, I'm taking full-time classes, I have a wonderful partner and two beautiful evil cats, and I'm almost finished with my bachelor's, all on my own money and financial aid... my parents haven't paid a dime of my tuition (in their favor, they provided food, housing, and transportation aka rides to school when I was still living with them in community college... though they made me pay rent my last few months with them because I ""wasn't doing enough of the chores""). I've told them repeatedly I'd rather live on my own from now on and that I want to be an independent person. I have no intention of them ever knowing about my nonreligious boyfriend/possibly eventually husband (and that's another conundrum entirely... Eventually having to get married and have kids in secret from overprotective parents just to stay in their favor). My parents were always very strict and overprotective, and my dad previously had a daughter who fell out of his favor after she went to a nonreligious college and lived with, then eventually married a nonreligious boyfriend, which my dad was completely against each step of the way. (They don't talk anymore; from what I understand it was the daughter who cut off contact, although they might still be Facebook friends, idk. They would bring up this daughter a lot, compare me to her, and continually ask me about my guy friends while I was growing up.)

After what I've seen from my parents, I'm very interested in keeping my residence and relationships completely separate from my parents, but still want to be cool with them. In other words, they have to be separate, since they wouldn't be cool with me otherwise.

TL;DR: Helicopter parents who have been very resistant to my growing up and becoming independent throughout my late teen years and early 20's are asking for my current address, which I don't want to provide because I'm concerned they'll just use it to spy on me/show up unannounced/see if I'm living with anyone.

Let me preface this by saying in 16 and this is my first job and this lady is probably 35 and isnt my manager or anything. shes my equal. Never seen her around before so she has to be a new hire.

Me: puts knife down on counter and walks back to my station to clean up

RC: walks over to me, “YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT AWAY THESE DISHES. ITS NOT MY JOB TO DO IT FOR YOU”

Me: I cant reach the top im sorry.

RC: YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO. 

she walks away and i burst into tears. i keep washing dishes while crying and then one of my other coworkers comes over to me and says oh my god im so sorry and is being super nice. she takes over my position so i can be away from RC. i went into the bathroom and just lost it. i couldnt breathe, i couldnt talk, i was sobbing. i hated it. why do i have such thin skin. i went back and started serving and i could her RC talking bad about my performance the whole time to another one of our coworkers. i felt crushed. i hate this.

412,"I an a teenager who was born and baptized into the Catholic Church. My whole life, my parents have always been what I call “quiet Christians.” They aren’t the stereotypical die-hard Christians that you hear about often nowadays, but they go to Mass every Sunday, generally hold firm to their religious beliefs, etc.

Even though I have always considered myself steadfast to God, the Virgin Mary, and saints, I have started to not be so steadfast to the Catholic Church. The prime reasons are its treatment and stigma againsg of LGBT people, which is unappealing to me as a gay guy. Its cover ups of sexual abuse in almost all ranks, as well as general hypocrisy of preaching for love and equality yet ostracizing women and LGBT people has made me turned off by it.

I researched Christian denominations that would be friendly to LGBT people, not faux friendly like the Catholic Church is. I ended up stumbling upon the Episcopal Church, and was stunned by its openness and inclusiveness, as well as its similarity to Catholicism. I attended a Mass last Sunday, and it was a fantastic service. It felt much more open and loving compared to Catholic masses.

My father was initially supportive of my decision to scope out the Episcopal Church, while my mother was as well, just less so. However, tonight we were discussing how some of my siblings’ activities contradict with Mass time, and the topic of my churchgoing came up. 

My mother said while she was fine with me going, she’d rather see me go to the Catholic church with her “as a family” and not the Episcopal church by myself. She said that while it may be nice to scope it out, she’d rather see me still go to the Catholic church with family. My father stepped in and agreed, saying that going to church is usually a family activity. I was stunned by what they said, and said that I’m going to an Episcopal church to feel closer to God, not family.

 My parents left it at that, but now I feel like a stigma is developing between my parents and me. I just want to go to a church that can allow me to still love God and that makes me feel welcome to be myself. While churches certainly have been ways for communities and people to come together for years, I don’t view churches much in that way.

I really don’t know what I should do. Should I just make my parents happy and keep going to the Catholic church, or follow my heart and keep going to the Episcopal church?

Computer Science has a ton of jobs in the Cyber Security field which I am interested in. I have a passion for protecting and helping people. I am compromising more towards the online school because mainly I don't want to be stuck paying loans forever.

417,"To fully understand the situation there’s a lot I have to go through, so it might be a bit long. 

So we both had a thing going on for a good 9 months. She liked me (was obvious) and I liked her, and it was cool because we would always just send snaps of whatever on Snapchat and never leave each other on read, and just enjoy each other’s company at parties. We were really close as well, and we both trusted each other with everything. She was super nice and I could see was a genuine person I liked to be around. I wanted to take it further, and told her i had feelings for her and asked her out to go see a movie. She’s a shy girl and very closed off about her feelings, so this made it a bit hard. But she agreed to and was excited and it was a good time. 

But then, like 2 weeks later, she all of a sudden slowly stopped talking to me on Snapchat, and didn’t look like she enjoyed my company in person. And this was all in the week of our deb (formal), so naturally I began to freak out because I thought I did something wrong and I didn’t want deb to be uncomfortable for us. So I asked her what was up and why she was like this, and she just gave me the response; “Well we’re not talking about anything anyway and I’m tired so anyway goodnight” And this was at 8:30pm, and i know for fact she normally sleeps at 12am every night. 

So deb comes and goes, and she’s sort of normal for the most part. Then the after party comes, and she says a quick hi to me then goes off with her friends. But then she straight up ignores me for the rest of the night, even when I try and talk to her. I sent drunk snaps expressing my love for her, and next day she sends me a paragraph back saying how it’s probably easier if we stay good friends. I was completely fine with this because I decided as long as we’re good friends I’m happy. Next couple of parties and at school she still acts awkward around me, and is all weird when I talk to her on Snapchat. So next party I decide to ask her AGAIN what’s up why, and she sort of shuts me down and walks off, which i don’t know was because she was drunk or what. Ask her over text the next day, and just tell her everything about how I feel, and about how I still do like her, but I just want to be good friends and not to date, and i don’t want it awkward. She says she doesn’t feel like she likes me in that way anymore, but that she definitely wants to stay good friends and to stay really close. She also agrees that we shouldn’t make it awkward anymore. I could tell she meant it, and I knew she wouldn’t lie to me because I know she had good intentions because I’ve seen it. So I was happy that we were finally on the same page. 

And just recently there was another party, and this time she seemed eager to talk to me over snapchat and it seemed to me like we were back to how we used to be. She even bought me drinks which she’s never done before. But the party comes, and she still found it hard to talk to me. She went up and talked to everyone else, including the guy who touched her wrong at the last one and made her uncomfortable. But me? Nah she didn’t talk to me the whole night and brushed me off when I tried and talked to the other people in our group. She did try small talk a couple times with me, and it was better than the other times, but other than that, there was nothing.

So, I'm 18 years old and I've always had a high corners forming a v-shape in my hairline. I'm not sure if its receding though or its because of paranoia. The first time I noticed that my temples where high was through an article stating that the first signs of balding were high temples. So I got paranoid. I went to the dermatologist 3 days ago and he told me I'm fine, no thinning, no miniaturization, probably just high corners like my dad and brother have as well. But I'm not entirely convinced since I know dermatologists can make mistakes, and he didn't map my hair. Only looked at it with some sort of goggles. I'm thinking of buying and starting minoxidil (a balding medication) but I would rather not if I wasn't balding.. which I'm not sure about. Since medication for balding is a life-long commitment.

Everyone points out that I look EXACTLY like my grandfather on my mothers side of the family and he started to show signs of baldness at maybe 30 years old (not entirely sure, the only pictures I've seen of him young were through a slideshow so I didn't get the best look).

This is literally the only thing I've thought about the last month and I can't think about anything else. It's really getting in the way of me enjoying my life. Any advice on how to stop worrying?

430,"I'm not normally the kind of person who makes a post like this, but this has been on my mind for a while and for whatever reason I've had difficulty coming to terms with it.

I was ""depressed"" for the period of maybe a year to a year and a half during my latter part of high school. I had low self-esteem, I would come home wrought with self-loathing, and my inner monologue would occasionally stray towards very hollow suicidal thoughts. It got to the point where I would take mechanical pencils and either run it back and forth over the same place on my arm until it started bleeding or I would stab myself with it, but this didn't happen too often.

When you read that description, it seems pretty obvious that I was depressed, right? The big issue, though, is how superficial all of that felt. When I say that, I mean that I don't know if I was depressed or if I just have a toxic, self-destructive personality. I didn't feel hollow like I've heard depressed people feel. I didn't really change my behavior outside of 1-2 hour bursts over that short period. I didn't lose my interests, I still talked to my friends, and my life as a whole didn't really take a dramatic turn for the worse. I felt bad, and then I didn't. I didn't get treatment because I didn't really have to - it just went away after a while. 

If it was caused by temporary, arbitrary stress, why did I have such a self-destructive reaction to it? Am I really that weak-willed? 

If it was depression, why would it just go away like that? Why does it seem like I didn't really have a persistent struggle with it the way others do?

This matters to me because, to an extent, I consider this the ""defining"" period of my life, and that's pathetic. Yes, I was miserable, and I consider myself to have had meaningful personal growth through the experience, but I feel like it wasn't hard enough. If I had any willpower at all, I could/should have probably ignored it.

I'm just rambling at this point, but for whatever reason I'm kinda hung up on this. I know there's probably no objective truth, but if I have a toxic/self-destructive personality I want to maybe try to fix it.",06Oct2018,1
431,"Hello all,

I'm currently in my junior year of high school, and have begun looking at colleges. This is where my request for advice begins: How to choose a major? And to decide on a field to go into?

I am looking at either forensics or game design, but I do not know how to choose which as I love both. I love game design because of the creativity and challenge it presents, but I also love forensics because I get to help people and the challenge. For people who work in these fields, how did you decide to go into them? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for my next question: what to look out for? What are signs that a university is good at putting on a show? what are signs they are worth the money? My mother said that if a universities credits are not transferable then its a sign a diploma from their will not be widely acceptable; is there truth to that statement? is it is an understatement? hyperbole?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, which universities would you say avoid completely? Either you've had a really bad experience, its not worth the money, or a number of other issues they had. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much if you have read through this far as it means a lot to me, and thank you even more for advice. I am new to all this, and I can understand why its considered a daunting task as their is so much you need to know. If you didn't understand something then I am more than happy to try to explain what I mean as best as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time,

432," My sister was in a really bad relationship a year ago, she gave me her old phone (which she havent use in 1 year) to fix it if possible. Yesterday i fix the phone,she ask me to send her the photos of the camera gallery and while i was adding them i realize that a lot are really hurtfull conversation between she and her ex, mostly him calling her whale or that nobody will love her. He was an asshole, a really jealous and insecure person and treated her like shit, she never could see it though. The thing is she suffered a lot in her relationship and post breakup, and im felling the photos will only bring her sadness, and nothing constructiv could come up if she saw them. Im thinking of erasing all pics and telling her that i needed to clean all the files in the phone to fix it. What do you think? I know its bad to lie to her and i shouldnt try to control her life but what good can come up for her to saw those horrible conversations.

Sorry for the bad english, correct any mistakes pls.",06Oct2018,1
433,"First I wanted to apologize for my very bad english skills and I am trying on improving in the future.
2 months ago I started a YT channel where I give advice about cultivating medicinal cannabis, tips on how to properly use the plant and how to set up a homegrow. My intention was to give those who are medical patients a simple guide on growing their own medicine as drug laws in Germany are ridiculous and many patients have to pay 20€ a g. But I always make sure to put up a disclaimer about not advising to commit any illegal activity as they can get you in jail here. It's been a really fun time and I've gathered a really good amount of followers. But recently things started to change. Recently some of my classmates found out about my activity on the internet and some of the ""cool"" kids started to make fun of me which in it self isn't bad because I do have a good reputation at my school as I am seen as that ""innocent"" kid so many people just forgot about it. But those guys just keep bugging me and I've noticed people following me to my house. I didn't think much of it till someone sent me a mail claiming to know my ""secret"" and basically threatening to black mail me. I don't mind them doing that because they don't even have any proof of me actually owning that channel. But then stalking became really scary. They would usually just call me by my channel's alias which didn't bother me at all but now some of those guys follow me around even on week ends. I knew they didn't like me as I may be considered a smart ass. I am on my last 2 years so I of course try my best to achieve the best marks. But I always try my best to not be a dick about it because I know it can be anoying. And now I am going through a chain of emotions I never felt before. I feel pathetic as I don't think someone would be so shook about it. I hardly sleep and I always look around before leaving the house or crossing the street because some of those guys stalk me literally regularly. I don't get why? Why do those guys do this over something this small? They put letters in my brief case stating ""We'll get you!"" ""We'll ecpose you to everybody!"" These letters didn't bother me tbh but last week they sent me a message with a picture of my dad's grave being completely messed up and put up a sign saying ""This hapens to junkys like you!"" I don't understand! I can't keep up my composure anymore! I started getting more and more depressed over something this stupid I can't believe it! How do I stop this? Should I quit my YT Channel over something this stupid? I knew this was a controversial toppic but I just wanted to educate the people of my country. I have no one to rely on rn so I just wrote this now long text on reddit and I feel so pathetic about it. About not being able to handle it myself. Man I just hope some of you have any idea on improving this situation because I am still in shock. I will consider every advice you guys give me because I ran out of options and feel like going crazy. I start imagining things and feel like being trapped in a black hole.",06Oct2018,1
