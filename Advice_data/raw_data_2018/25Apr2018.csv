1,"I have never ever throughout my whole 18 years of life once asked to go out at night with friends. ever. i’ve been to 2 school events, both this year - homecoming and prom. I asked my parents 2 days ago if i could go to senior week. Yes i am late but i wasn’t planning on asking them because i already knew they were gonna say no. So i asked, and at first they said yea, for a few nights only. the next day while we were sitting around watching tv they told me that they aren’t comfortable with me going because they “asked around” and sweek is just a bunch of kids getting drunk, doing drugs, and having sex. but they didn’t explicitly tell me that i can’t go. i’m not exactly sure what to do- i  really wanna go and think it’s not fair at all. i’ve never asked them to go out at night, with my friends especially. the only time i hang out with my friends is when we play basketball after school or doing school. for my whole life i’ve been controlled and told what to do, and this year especially it’s slowly been eating away at my tolerance. idk when i’m gonna explode at them but i’m too afraid to say anything now because that’s how i’ve been raised. my dad told me that it was up to my own judgement, but i’m looking at you for some advice.

2,28F i have a 5f and 7m kids. I dont know why but everything they do irritates me. I normally hold it in and dont let them see it. But any time they call my name or need me for something i get me instantly irritated. I hate it. I just wish i could relax and be okay but they drive me crazy and i dont know how to stop it.,25Apr2018,0

4,"I'm 17 years old, male, I'm graduating high school in less than two months and I'm trying to have fun. I'm not going to sit here and say my mom's being crazy, but I'll say unreasonable. For the majority of my high school career I would say i've been very ""under the radar"" i've never done anything rebellious, never failed a class, never even went over to a friends home. Now i'm a senior and want to try some of these things out, i've gotten closer to many people and just interacted more and that's fine. The problem is i'm currently failing one class and i've walked home without permission twice, I can understand the failing class sure, but my mom seems really focused on this whole walking home thing. I've never given her a reason to suspect I do drugs or hang out with terrible people, in fact i've shown her the opposite. The point is my mom takes my phone for about a week at a time, doesn't let me walk anywhere, and absolutely refuses to let me enjoy my senior activities.

5,"We’ve been together for about a year and a half now. She’s never been in a relationship before me. Just dated a couple guys here and there but no serious relationship. I’ve always felt like she was very distant with me emotionally and because of her lack of intimacy, I kept beating myself up. My self esteem declined time after time due to feeling like I wasn’t good enough for her. So today I finally asked her the question “do you love me romantically?” At first she said “of course I love you” and when I specified the word ROMANTICALLY, she just started crying. At first she asked me what it means to love someone romantically and I just broke down because I feel like when you love someone, you just know. 

I told her that it’s not fair for her to just keep stringing me along in the relationship if she doesn’t know how she feels about me. She kept crying and apologizing for disappointing me. But it really hurt to hear her say “I don’t know if I love you romantically”. I feel so betrayed and lied to... All the times she told me she loves me, it’s wasn’t the truth. 

We live together so I packed lightly and told her that until she knows the answer to that question I can’t see her anymore. She started crying and saying that she’s sorry. I’m pretty sure the relationship is over but I keep holding on. 

TLDR: girlfriend tells me she doesn’t know if she loves me romantically. Packed my things and left the house but don’t know what to do from here. ",25Apr2018,9
6,"I work in a small company.
I've been promoted to handle everyday operations.
Problem is, the foreign owner doesn't easily trust local people. So I'm basically left with staff that does everyday tasks and aren't able to handle different situations.
I myself, am not really qualified for the position that I was given. I just learned stuff along the way.

My dad recently asked me to help him with his business, since he's getting old and complications of diabetes hqve caught up to him.

How should I resign from the company if I'm the country manager? I'm genuinely concerned that the company I work for will be in a mess if they can't find someone to replace me.
Would like to hear advice from those that have experience.

P.S. I know they can always hire someone alot more qualified than me, but as I said, the owner doesn't really want to trust someone new.",25Apr2018,1
7,"About a month ago, my girlfriend of about 3 months broke up with me. Our relationship was a bit weird because she was so insanely busy that we hardly got to see each other \- I'm talking weeks without hanging out, with our only communication really being through text.

Despite this, I'm pretty certain she still liked me through it all. I mean, she said yes in the first place, and I had numerous signs before I'd even asked her out that made me suspect she was interested. While we dated, she occasionally made jokes and said things that suggested she saw us as being together for at least the foreseeable future. In fact, our last ""date"" before we broke up she joked about such things.

Then we went a long time without seeing one another, and she finally asked if we could talk, and of course she broke up with me. She said it wasn't me, but that school and her family life were too much for her to handle a relationship right now and it was taking a toll on her mentally and even physically. She also said that I was the sweetest guy, that I was her rock when she needed someone to talk to, and that her anxiety issues weren't because of me and she didn't want me to think they were.

I figured that if a break up was what was best for her, its how things should be, so I just accepted it and we agreed to remain friends.

Thing is, the semester is coming to a close in just a few weeks, and I am very interested in getting back together with her. I know, I know, its usually a bad idea to get back together with an ex, but if her reason for the break up is really just due to circumstances, I'm wondering if there's a chance.

We are still great friends. We have a massive snap streak, we talk daily in group chats, and we still get to hang out \(in a group\) on the rare occasion she is free. We talk so much in our group chats that a couple of my friends have pointed it out, saying we ""sure do talk a lot"", just the two of us, and one friend even joked that we should ""stop flirting in the group chat"". We made yet another group chat with me and her in it, and my friend said ""we need to add more people so it doesn't just turn into you two talking all the time like the other one"" to both of our faces, and she and I just kind of looked at each other wordlessly before the subject got changed.

We recently had a small get together with our friends. Her roommate left pretty late into the night, but before her, along with one of her best friends, but she decided to stick around even though it was just me and a few friends she doesn't know too well remaining. She ended up staying there for several more hours, and she's *never* been a night person, so I was surprised how late she stuck around, and she got a ride home from me. I thought maybe she was hoping to have a one\-on\-one chat, but the ride is like a minute long and we just briefly discussed other people before she thanked me for the ride and went home. Her sticking around so late is pretty consistent with back before we started dating, where she would stay up really late whenever it was just me and her, but otherwise never hung out late. Its part of why I thought she liked me originally.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if she's still interested. I don't know if these mean anything. She's always been hard to read, which is why asking her out in the first place was so difficult, but its almost scarier now because we already tried it and it didn't work out. I don't want her to think I just see her as a potential girlfriend \- she is so important to me as just a friend, too, but I don't want to miss out on dating her if the opportunity is there. At the same time, I don't want to ruin what we have by asking her out if she's not interested. I know there's almost no way she'll make the first move, so I have to decide if I'm going to ask her out again or not when the semester ends. I don't know, does it seem like she's interested, or is this information not at all enough to know?",25Apr2018,1
10,"I live alone, and my car was broken into, only thing stolen however, was the garage door opener. Fortunately, it’s not that garage door opener to my house.

12,"Hello all, I'm reaching out here because I'm at the end of my rope. I don't even know if this is the correct sub to be in. 

I was diagnosed with temporal lobe damage about 8 month's ago. I was too scared to follow up properly. The dr. Went over my mental state from the past 10 years and is pretty confident as to my condition. Everything makes sense as well, head injury, (multiple actually) difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety, and some type of seizures. It's not grand mal, possibly petty mal? I can't remember to be honest. Hyper aggression goes hand in hand with it. 

My purpose for this post is, I don't know what to do. Staying with my fiances dad and I feel like....dying. I have lived in the dirt for the last 7 years. Drifting from job to job, factories mainly, hate the culture/environment. I've never had any money saved. (26 y.o. male) I'm on 3 medications, 5 pills a day.

13,"Hi all!

My boyfriend and I go out a lot with his dog, Chewie, who is a small havanese/maltese mix dog. Girls will often flock to Chewie to pet him (they always ask of course) and I’ve noticed a very distinct pattern in his behavior.

Whenever an overweight or a less attractive girl pets his dog, he always turns to me with an irritated look on his face after they leave and says something under his breath about how they were “scaring Chewie” (they weren’t, they were being friendly), but when it’s a skinny pretty girl, he’s always super smiley and tells me about how friendly they are.

Am I just jealous or is this a reasonable observation? Thanks in advance!",25Apr2018,5
14,"Hello fellow reddit users. I have been a user on Reddit for several years and it is a big part of my daily life. I decided to make an anonymous, throwaway account to have the opportunity to anonymously ask you all for some advice in this ongoing very difficult situation and set of circumstances in my life. In order to understand my current situation, I will need to provide some basic background information about myself and I will try to give a brief timeline overview of my life as well. I want to be as concise as possible to avoid wasting anyone's time but I do 

To stay some\-what anonymous, I am an early twenties male and I was born in the US in the state of Georgia. I come from what you would deem a typical middle\-class American family. The first 11 years of my life were fine &amp; dandy and I would say I had a pretty fortunate early childhood. During those first 11 years of my life, I lived in a pretty nice middle\-class home with my mom, dad, and two sisters. 

When I was 11 years old and in the 5th grade, my parents called my sisters and I upstairs to talk and out of no\-where they announced they would be getting divorced. Right after that conversation my dad packed his belongings and moved about an hour out of town into a friend's house. Following the divorce, things were pretty hard on me and probably even harder for my two younger sisters. 

From this point, a couple weeks go by and out of nowhere my next\-door neighbors announce that they too, are filing for divorce. To give you some insight regarding the neighbors, their family was best friends with my family growing up. We built our houses in our old neighborhood around the same time and our families quickly unified. We grilled out with them nearly nightly and did nearly everything with their family. So that all being said, the neighbors announced their divorce and then a couple weeks later out of nowhere the neighbor's dad \(who to this day is technically my ""step dad""\), starts having dinner over at our house. The dinners progressed into him eventually staying over nightly, and then after a few more weeks he was living full\-time with us. Being 11 years old at the time, I really didn't know what to think was going on within my parent's marriage, and then also the neighbors marriage.

Several more weeks go by, and the million\-dollar dream home \(that my parents were in the process of building before they decided a divorce was coming\) finishes construction. My dad ends up deciding to move into the house by himself so at that point I was spending a few nights a week with him. At this point I think I had moved onto middle school and I was basically transitioning back and forth between my dad's new house and the house I grew up in where the neighbor\-dad was now also living. In my original house it was now my mom, my two sisters, and my soon\-to\-be step brother living there. Meanwhile, the neighbor\-wife is still living right next door in their original house! It was all a complete mess.

Fast forward a year \(this was around 2008\) and my mother &amp; the neighbor\-husband have announced they are getting married, and then the very next day they announce my mom is pregnant. At this time, my dad is still living in the dream house and my sisters and I were staying with him a few nights a week. This is the year that things took quite a turn for my dad, as this is when the US economy collapsed and many lost their jobs. My dad lost his one and only job of 32 years where he had a very comfortable salary. Within a matter of months, his dream home was foreclosed and he was out of work. He ended up moving in with his mother for the time\-being while I lived full\-time with my mom &amp; new step dad. 

This is where the problems start to arise. I really don't like referring to this man as my ""step dad"" but technically that is his title so that is how I will reference him. My step dad was very egotistical, the king of verbal abuse, and he cares about nothing other than money. My mom and step dad would fight/argue constantly, multiple times a week and it was always in range for my sisters and I to either see or hear. These fights weren't some sissy mess either, we are talking punches being thrown into walls, TVs being broken, an entire closet of clothes and other luxuries being dumped into our backyard swimming pool, and the list goes on and on... Not only was my step dad always verbally abusive or fighting with my mom, but my sisters, my step\-brother, and myself all received similar treatment. An example that will stick with me until the day I die was one night when the entire family was home, my sisters, step brother and I were all upstairs in our home and my step\-dad and mom were downstairs. My siblings and I were all in one room watching a movie when out of nowhere a massive altercation between my mom &amp; step dad breaks out. My siblings and I sat upstairs absolutely terrified while our parents were downstairs going at it. They were throwing various objects at each other, exchanging verbal abuse, and at the point when I heard what I thought was my mom getting pushed into the door I immediately ran downstairs. I did not see it happen, nor will my mom admit that it happened, but I am 99&amp;#37; sure that she was thrown into her bedroom door by my step\-dad as they were fighting. My step\-dad had smashed my mom's iPhone on the bedpost and their bedroom TV was broken. While I was still in their bedroom with my mom after all this had happened, my step\-dad walked back in. I basically walked up to him and told him I better never see anything like this happen again or I will call the police. He responded by grabbing be my collar, telling me I was a ""stupid prick."" and that there was nothing I could do about it. The household was absolutely out of control because of my step dad and mother's behavior and no one was genuinely happy. For the most part, everyone stayed in their bedrooms and did their own thing because everyone was afraid of what could happen at any time.

For the next several years it was basically the same as I described above, a household full of verbal abuse and constant fighting. By the time I got to high school I was able to move in full time with my dad, which was definitely a relief. I was so happy to get out of that hell house and away from my inhumane step dad. Some time during my freshman year of high school, I slowly started noticing something was severely off about my personality, my behavior, and my ability to effectively communicate with other people or objects. I began having an extremely difficult time reading/comprehending anything and school was very tough because that made it difficult to learn. I never wanted to do anything but sit in my room and browse the internet. I hated being around large groups of people or in a setting where I knew I had a lot of eyes on me because I would become over the top anxious and panic. I eventually told my dad what was going on and I saw a psychiatrist for the first time. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with GAD \(or Generalized Anxiety Disorder\), panic disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. He prescribed me a basic anti\-depressant, which I believe was the SSRI citalopram. I took the meds as prescribed and had no luck at improving my anxiety or depression symptoms, so the psychiatrist moved onto a different medication. I tried medication after medication, but nothing ever proved to work long\-term. There were points where I had short\-term luck with a couple medications \(I.E. Remeron\) but its effectiveness quickly faded. Over the years I have been on over 20 different medication trials within the US pharmaceutical industry, those medications ranging from SSRIs, SNRis, to anti\-psychotics as several psychiatrists have diagnosed me with bipolar disorder type II. My anxiety is so severe that it massively impacts my day\-to\-day life. I dropped out of college after nearly two years because my depression and anxiety took over. Even a simple task like going to a class was an impossible challenge because of my mental state. 

Fast forward to 2017, I somehow managed to herniate 2 discs in my spinal cord. The doctors were never able to pinpoint what caused it or why, but I personally think it is from moving too much heavy furniture \(helping my parents move houses several times\) while already originally having a weaker spine genetically. With the 2 discs being herniated, it put a complete halt on my life. I was in extreme pain, like I had never felt before, and it was constant no matter what I was doing. I had horrible sciatica pain and could hardly sleep because my back was hurting so badly. After 6 months of visits with multiple orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons, I finally found a neurosurgeon who offered a solution. That solution was a 3\-level spinal fusion surgery that he told me would alleviate up to 70&amp;#37; of my pain. As I had been laying in bed for months unable to do anything from the severe pain caused by the herniated discs, I decided to move forward with the procedure and in the summer of 2017 I had the 3\-level spinal fusion performed. Recovery was one of the most challenging things I have ever been through, but I would say overall the surgery has alleviated about 50&amp;#37; of my pain. That is A LOT, but I still do have a ton of daily pain.

From July 2017 to January 2018 I basically spent all my time recovering from this huge operation. I really couldn't walk much for the first month and it has been a slow moving recovery to say the least. So just at the New Year, I decided it was time to get my life back on track and get back to work full\-time. I ended up getting a pretty well\-paying job in retail sales and I had incredible benefits. Two weeks ago, I had a massive panic attack while at work and basically walked out the door. I did not just abruptly decide to quit, this decision was made after dealing with horrible anxiety and panic attacks for the last 3 months while on the job. My anxiety has the ability to easily take over my entire mind and it often causes me to lose my train of thought or entirely forget what I was saying. This often happened during transactions with customers and I would become so embarrassed and end up panicking even more. I often spent my 30\-minute lunch break crying in my car because my anxiety was so bad and I just wanted to leave. And eventually I did... 

If you are still reading, I just want to thank you so much for your time. I know this has been a long post but I have no idea  what to do at this point in my life. 

So that brings me to where I am now, unemployed with a few thousand in debt, a few thousand in the bank and an absolutely out of control mental illness that I am very worried will one day take my life. So my question to you all is, if you were me where would you go from here? Keep in mind my back is very weak and in tons of pain so the type of work I am able to do has to be taken into consideration, and my anxiety is so severe that I really can't handle face\-to\-face interactions right now. Any advice, tips, or comments are greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Much love to all...",25Apr2018,3
15,"I was thinking of moving to Washington state after graduating with an associates degree and continue for my bachelors degree over there. I have never been to Washington but I plans to go visit as a vacation just to see how it is over there, since my brother in-law's grandparents live up there and they said its great and that there is many opporunties for me as an artist. 

However, someone from my class told me that he has lived in Washington for a couple of years but moved back to our hometown because he said they're nothing but extreme SJWs and feminazi's. While he did say it was beautiful, the people there to him are just too sensitive and no one seemed to like him since he shared some different views and opinions. We live in California but we live in very small city that is a bit more on the conservative side (We were the only county that voted against same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana here in California), so we're not like big cities like LA or San Francisco.

Now I'm unsure about wanting to living in Washington. I'm not a super political person, though I considers myself both a liberal and somewhat a conservative person depending on the situation. If someone has different opinions than mine, than thats fine but the last thing I want is someone like a SJW or feminazi to argue with me and call me a bigot just because I don't share all the same exacted views. I really want to visit and possibly move there but now I just don't know if I'll enjoy my life peacefully in Washington.

16,"Alright, I'm just gonna warn you guys in advance that this is gonna be a mess of a post, I'm just gonna express all my thoughts and concerns and ask how you guys think I should handle the situation. 

Just for quick background info, there was a girl I fell for that went to my school and martial arts studio. We graduated and I quit martial arts, so I knew I was probably never gonna see her again. 

About 4 months ago I took a leap and asked her out. She told me she's seeing someone but she could be a friend if I need one. In my drunken state I poured out my life story and we ended off on the note of her saying ""if you ever need to talk to someone I'm here."" 

Now I gathered what I could from some online sources and interpreted the ""her seeing someone else"" as her telling me she's not interested and that I need to move on. Anyways, why would I go to her to talk over my close friends? 

I took the rejection as motivation for self improvement, I started creating good habits and got fit. But the hole in my heart is still there. I can't stop wanting to talk to her. I hope I'll eventually run into her on a street or in a store every time I go out. I hope she'll reach out and message me. But I know it won't happen.

It's been 4 months since we last talked and I haven't talked to her since. The only contact we've had is me wishing her a happy birthday. Did I kill everything by dropping contact? Is there any way I can manage to salvage this? I don't even mean in terms of a relationship, I just want to be able to speak to her.

These are my questions.

-Can a guy and girl actually be just friends? Why would she say she could be a friend? Why would she want to be?

-Did I make the wrong decision by trying to move on for 4 months?

-Should I contact her again? How should i go about doing this?

-If not, how can I help myself move on?

Thanks guys.",25Apr2018,1

20,"I am really struggling to have enjoyable or... actual sex with the people I care about. It's gotten so bad that I have almost entirely lost interest in finding a partner because I know there will be no satisfaction in it for her, despite what I might want.

The reason I make this post, rather than referring to the million others about PE, is because they all seem to have a different problem to me. All the other people wanting to last longer in bed talk about wanting to last longer than 30s to 5min because it's not enough. Fuck, what I would give to be able to last just 30 whole seconds. For me it's a few seconds if that. 

I had issues with ED (mostly from intoxication) in the past which gave me performance anxiety about getting/keeping it up, which worsened the ED - I think this contributed/contributes to my PE because I am concentrating so hard on maintaining the erection. I've somewhat dealt with that now but my regular cycle in bed goes something like this: foreplay (fine) oral (fine, I overcompensate here knowing sex won't be long), and then as soon as penetration occurs I have to pull out within a second because I know I'm going to cum otherwise. Half the time, I've already hit the PoNR and just slowly and sadly cum into the condom right after pulling out. The other half, I can try again, but get no further. I feel like I'm basically a virgin at 20 - I cannot recall a single postitive sexual experience and I have no partner to help me work through these issues with. How on earth would I even find a partner while completely incompetent in bed.

At what point does this become a medically recognised issue? None of the regular advice seems to apply to me and my under 5sec stints. I feel like I don't even get a chance to practice or try different rhythms (like the people that want to last longer than 30s-5m). The PoNR is pretty much instant for me and I want that feeling to fuck off. I could give up all the pleasure of sex to be actually capable of sharing an intimate experience with someone else and able to give them a reason to come back.

Is there medication other than cialis/viagra for this? Should I just avoid sexual contact until I'm older? What do I do reddit?

21,"So I've recently begun to crush on my computer science lab partner. She's a Computer Science major and I'm a Math major, so in essence we have similar aptitudes when it comes to STEM. Guess I must be a sapiophile of some sort, lol. We're both freshman if that has any relevancy at all, so social circles still may be developing.

Anyway, for the most part we would sit just seats away in two classes that we share, but one time I asked her to sit with me to complete a lab project. From there on she began to sit right next to me in both classes. Not really sure if that's anything significant, I guess she may not be too familiar with others but because she knows me, she may prefer to sit next to somebody she knows.

In general she is very shy-- she doesn't speak a lot and I have never seen her speak a lot. Even though I am very shy, I have a friend who is part of my lab group which I am very familiar with and make jokes with him all the time. It's great to see her laugh or smile at dumb things I say, but of course it could be just courtesy.

How do I go about advancing with this girl, in terms of asking her out and if things work out, dating? It seems my time is running out as the semester should end within a month's time. I don't think she has shown any strong signs of attraction nor flirtation. I don't see her as a very flirty girl or I have just never seen her flirt.

What indicators do you look for in a shy person if they are interested in you? On the few occasions we have spoken,it has been about school in general and not much else.

I do propose that if I do muster the courage to ask her out, I know a ramen place near campus to have a dinner with her, but honestly I don't know how things are supposed to advance.

22,"My mom has always been an extreme control freak. She only cares about talking to me when she wants to give me her ""advice"" or ""opinions"". She has never been interested in me as a person, and her so-called advice/opinion is usually just her way of rudely telling me ""I'm right, you're wrong"".

I am getting married soon, and everything I have done, even the smallest details, have sent her into a control rage. 

For example, she had to come with me and my fiance to the cake tasting because it was ""very important to her"" (she has said that about everything). Fine, whatever. We did a tasting, and she got upset because I chose to do only two flavors, keep in mind that the main flavor I chose was her favorite (it was also mine and my fiance's favorite). She was upset because the other flavor I chose was chocolate, and she wanted vanilla. I did not like the taste of the vanilla. I have always preferred chocolate. She was also upset because I chose not to do a cream filling in the chocolate. I prefer it to be just chocolate and frosting. I should mention that she payed, however, I did not know she was going to pay. I also did not ask her to pay. Fiance and I are perfectly capable of paying, and she knows that. We thanked her very much, and everything seemed fine...until she brought it up again. She complained about having chocolate, and I told her that I wanted chocolate, and she got her favorite flavor too. I also told her that chocolate would be a better choice because, most of fiance's family prefers that as well. She responded with ""Oh, well as long as they are happy, that is all that matters"".

I understand that this seems very trivial, but every single tiny detail of this wedding has gone down like this. I used to be able to handle her, but I feel like I am starting to reach a breaking point.

Today, I got a job interview which I was really excited about because, I have been job searching for a month. I called to tell her that I did the interview, and I thought it went great. I was excited, so I called to tell her. Her response was ""Oh, OK."" It really pissed me off because, she knows how much stress not having a job has been causing me. This isn't anything abnormal. She has always been this way. Whenever I have good news, she doesn't give a shit. She doesn't care about me, she just cares about controlling me.

She has some serious issues from a fucked up childhood, so I actually feel very sorry for her, but she can't seem to stop trying to control everyone. And she literally does this to everyone. My dad, my sisters, other family members, etc. 

I, and many people (separately) have tried to nicely talk to her about how her actions, and choice of words make us feel, but that just results in her blowing up saying things like ""I guess I am just a terrible mother"" or ""I will just stay out of your life"". She even found a way to blame me when she couldn't find a dress to wear to my wedding, and threatened not to show up if she couldn't find a dress that she felt good in. I actually handled that situation very well, and was very calm, and tried to help her through it, and she did not apologize, or even acknowledge how horrible she was being.

I am sorry that this is such a long post, or if I seem to be rambling, I guess I just really needed to vent.

I just always feel guilty, even when I know I didn't do anything wrong. She makes me feel like I am a horrible, stupid person because I want something different than her.",25Apr2018,1
23,"Background: Previously we dated for almost 3 years until he broken up with me over text around midnight out of the blue. He would text me about how he was hooking up with this girl I was told not to worry about during the relationship. Three month later we got back together and have been dating for 6 months now. 

He’s just plain mean. I don’t know why but it’s his first instinct, I’ll get him something nice for him like his favorite drink or snack and he’ll say something like “wow couldn’t get anything better? thanks” and won’t laugh it off or anything. He also knows I’m self conscious about my weight but will make fun of my round face and call me a whale or a cow as a “joke”. 

He starts arguments and makes it clear he doesn’t trust me with money. And after he makes me cry he just “apologizes” in a way that’s like “well I’m sorry YOU feel that way” or “I’m sorry you think I was mean”. I don’t know if he just words it wrong or what. The money I could understand if it was like $50 or more but, he lent me four dollars for a drink once and constantly harassed me about paying him back a day after he gave it to me. He isn’t short on money, trust me. 

He always hints to talking to the girl he was with over the summer even though I’ve asked him to never talk to her again, because what he did to me with her really fucked me up. On my birthday he told me he was coming with a gift to make up for his behavior, but he showed up 4 hours past the time he said he would with not even a card, he played fortnite the whole time.  I love fortnite!! I always ask to play it with him but he says he’s busy or that he doesn’t want to have to carry me, but I’m actually kinda good!

He also brings up things like I’ll never be a woman like his mom or that his mom is the only person he cares about.

Maybe it’s just a phase and I’m overly sensitive, but I’m not happy and I just want help. I want to know if I can still be in this relationship or what I can do to see what’s wrong. We talked about getting married and he wasn’t like this before. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. ",25Apr2018,27
24,"Yesterday I received a DM from a friend asking if I knew anyone who wanted to adopt a dog. Admittedly, we are exes \-over 4 years ago since we dated \- and are not very close, but have always been friends/no hard feelings. I happen to be married now \(over 2 years\) and my husband was always weary of this friend \- mostly because of his own insecurities and just finds it weird that I remain friends with my exes.

When my husband got home yesterday, I asked him if he received my texts from earlier. I had sent him 3 pics of the dog along with a plea to let us take him in. He acted like he had not received them, but we have a certain we use when we're playfully acting dumb about something. Since I'm very serious about adopting the dog, I told him to cut if out and that I really wanted his input. He said we couldn't afford to take in a dog and that it would be unfair to our 16\-year\-old cat to have to put up with a new animal in the home; but to set us back a few years to when he would side\-eye me and ex's texts, he threw in ""and we are NOT adopting your ex's dog.""

I tried to explain that our cat has actually met and lived with this dog before and that it wouldn't be that much more per month to feed a dog. Our cat will not be alive in the next 10 years, but the dog might. And we've been talking about getting another pet for over a year, but nothing serious.

While I respect his concerns, I feel like he may be over\-exaggerating them because his main concern is petty \- adopting a dog from the guy I was living with before him. I don't want this dog to be put up for adoption and then live in a cage for years to come... He's an adult dog, about 6, and a rottweiler breed, so it will be difficult to home him. I've been in tears off and on since he said no yesterday and I don't know how to maturely express how much it means to me that we adopt him.

Part of me is afraid I'm neglecting something important because of my own wants but the other part of me knows that the only issue he brought up that I can't cancel out is adopting from my ex. Is that a substantial reason to leave it be or should I fight harder to bring this dog home?",25Apr2018,1
25,"I'm quiet. I'm very, very quiet. I don't really say anything unless I have a point to make, or someone has spoken to me first. 

My coworkers have a field day with this. I'm 25, but they treat me as a completely incompetent child. They nudge me a lot commenting on how quiet I am. ""Haha, you need to stop talking so much buddy"", and so forth. I have never known what to say.

It would be one thing if it was just here and there, but it's daily and frequent. And just today one young woman I work with came over to me and leaned on a piece of equipment (making it unusable to me which irritated me somewhat). She asked me about this and that, and in my awkwardness I fumbled around to give the most straightforward answers while knowing she was probably just asking it all to poke at me and see how I'd react. She started asking questions out loud like why I wasn't married, if I planned to get married, and stuff like that. I turned red and tried answering, but she blurts out ""Aww, poor thing, I made him blush"", and began laughing along with a few other coworkers as now everyone's attention in the room was directed at me. She asked me to turn towards someone else so they could see just how red I was. There were some comments from other people as well like ""Oh goodness he *is* red"". Being pretty irritated at this point, I just gave her a blank expression so she'd hopefully get the point and just leave me alone. She didn't, started nudging me and asking ""haha, are we getting on your nerves?"" in a voice you would use with a small child. 

For some people this might easily turn in to a ""boo hoo no one understand me"" situation, so I don't want you to think that's what's going on here. They like to talk. I don't. That's it. But they will not leave it alone. And I don't think its coming from bad intentions either. I'm sure they are just trying to have some fun. But honestly its just getting to where it stresses me out. 

How can I deal with this?

I was really hesitant but I did. I just put the head in my mouth like 2-3 times and that was it. The guy was like ""are you sure you have never given a blowjob? You're really good! You're a natural!"" He also put his finger in my mouth, stroked my hair, and touched my boobs and rubbed the nipple lol. How do I loosen up when it comes to sexual things?",25Apr2018,1
28,"I have always been a people pleaser. These days I’m noticing exactly how conflict averse I am, but it goes beyond conflict into feeling like if i am helped by an assistant in a shop, and I don’t buy anything, that I have wasted their time and that I owed them. 

I will almost always assume that other people are right, like they have information that I don’t and I will feel like an idiot if I disagree and am wrong. It is debilitating because I really feel like I’m not being true to myself when I can’t bring myself to distinguish my opinions, values and ideals from other people’s.

29,"I've fucked myself right up the ass with about every social situation I am involved with due to either circumstances, associating myself with insane people, or my mental illness.  It's ridiculous.

Due to a series of increasingly unlikely series of unfortunate events, I'm living in transitional housing, have little to no help from my family, and no professional connections from more than 6 months ago.

I'm in community college part time; I took two classes last semester, failed one and got a C in the other after getting straight As and Bs all my freshmen year.  The class I failed, calculus, I am currently retaking-- and unless I get my shit together and get good grades the rest of the semester, I am going to fail yet again.  I am doing ok in my other class, philosophy, which has also helped me improve myself a bit.

I am considering taking time off of college; if I do that, I can work more hours.  That economic help will put me in the position of further improving my life, as well as putting me in the position of being better off when I start with a clean slate across the country before August next year.  I also could use time to improve myself and focus on my psychological wellbeing, as I believe I may be developing a serious psychiatric illness.

I am seeing a crisis counselor for now, but it's getting to the point where she doesn't know how to deal with what I'm bringing her way and her and my caseworker both think I should see a psychiatrist.  The mental illness takes up a lot of my time and constantly sabotages me; I know if I can just fucking figure out enough workarounds and strategies so I an function, I WOULD be able to succeed.

I just want to fucking succeed.

However, I have no idea how to drop out of school, if taking time off is even dropping out, and to be honest, it seems like a huge mistake.  Many members of my family have dropped out of school and never returned, and I don't want to drop out of school and have a successive downwards spiral like I have seen so many times.

I think maybe I should take a class I enjoy, or maybe an online class so I can avoid the fallout from a disasterous social situation I created and can't cope with on campus, and just eat the cost since I can't get financial aid if I take less than 6 credits.  I don't know.  I used to fucking love school, since I love learning new things and talking with them to people, etc, but recently it has been 100% stress due to my being actively homeless until recently.",25Apr2018,1
31,"this is a throw away account because I'm terrified at the thought of her finding this. 
I dont want to type a 400,000 word novel about the history of us and everything else so im going to do my best keeping this short and give the details needed. 

Ive been off and on with this girl (lets call her cathy) since we were 14. Me and cathy had a weird feeling for eachother and the 3rd time we were at it(we were 19) i grew a little distant. I wanted out. But i felt the overwhelming urge to stay, thinking it would get better or that things can change. I realize now that it was a toxic and mentally abusive relationship, i always couldnt go do something because i had to be with her, i couldnt go eat with my family unless she came. I couldnt go an hour without checking up on her letting her know i was still there or i would hear about it for the rest of the day i would like to add that working a full time job and having to text your girlfriend in the bathroom for 20minutes every couple hours is hard to get away with. eventually one time me, cathy, and her friend who had known both of us for a while (lets call her sam) were sitting in my car, just hanging out and smoking like edgy kids do. Her friend noticed the behavior of cathy and later that night had told me about it. Sam asked a couple heart breaking questions like ""are you happy?"" and ""could you see yourself working together with this person during hard times?"" it was actually eye-opening.  The next day at work, about 9:30am i checked my just-charged-phone and seen that cathy had texted me, i had 5 missed calls from her, and 3 voicemails all amongst the lines of ""why do you not love me"" , she seemed upset per usual about me not texting her when i got to work (i start at 8:30 and this morning my phone was dead.) i explained to her that my phone had died and that i was actually late because my alarm hadnt gone off due to it being dead, we were also busy at work so i didnt have time to message anyone once it charged a little for the battery to turn on. She sent a simple text in response to me apologizing and it said ""do you love me?"" and i really wanted to let it out, i was frustrated and stressed and had typed out ""unfortunately."" and had hit send. My heart dropped. I literally had no intention of sending it but thank lord i did. She seemed weirdly mature about it, we both got our belongings from one another and had kept the whole breakup clean and mature. After moping and being distraught, Sam had talked to me. Letting me know that I was right for leaving a toxic relationship and that she wished the best for me. I hinted that we both just left and let her be her own downfall. a week goes by and Sam lets me know that she had told Cathy to leave her alone and that she no longer wants anything to do with her. After keeping somewhat in touch with Sam for a month i had asked her to come out and get some food. One thing leads to another and sam is now my significant other. A month goes by and cathy eventually poked around and found out about us. I'm going to say immediately after finding out she messaged me and had messaged sam, had made posts on facebook specifically about us and with her 5,000+ followers she made a riot. Everything we do anymore is belittled by cathy and she has yet to move on. I had tried to make peace and say it wasnt an intention for us to be together and that it just happened but cathy is a stubborn one. I am continuously getting threats online and have come out to my car where someone had put notes all over it saying ""i hope you rot"" and ""wish you would die"" (not very clever.) I am sick of not being able to just be happy with someone else and im stuck in this constant cycle where she unblocks me, messages me some shit about her hating us, her blocking me again, rinse and repeat. I dont know what to do and i know i did the right thing leaving her. I actually feel like myself with sam and i feel like a person i never knew came out of me when i started being around her. Its been 4 months since i last talked to her and theres still hundreds of people messaging me about how much of a POS i am and how much they wish i would die. what can i do to get rid of the hatred and how can i get out of her life? Ive made 5 different accounts so far and theyve all been found. I dont want to go to a lawyer or take this to court unless i absolutely have to

32,"22 year old female here. I’ve had these friends since high school. 
Friend one the one I met first let’s call him Derek.  20 We’ve known each other for 8 years. We were always close and we told each other everything. Well within the last two years our encounters are surface level because I’ve noticed he is very arrogant and righteous. He interrupts me, on top of all these things too. 
Example: I will be talking and he just interrupts me and starts a completely different conversation. 
Other example: If I don’t want to do what he’s doing he calls me lazy and gets angry. Or if I can’t do it he pouts and gets passive aggressive. I’ve distanced myself because I feel like it’s the best thing for me (self care) but today he asked if I wanted to go camping with him this weekend. And I felt like I had to tell him all of this finally. So I told him I felt disrespected, not listened to and invalidated every time I hung out with him. He blew up on me and eventually came to his senses. Says he wants to meet soon and hang out and talk.. 
Next friend let’s call her Sally, she’s 19.  We’ve known each other for 6. She’s always kind of been someone I couldn’t fully trust in certain ways. She steals things from people, she lies, and she talks shit on almost everyone around her. To be completely honest she has such a great and caring side but I’m starting to think there is never going to be just that one side of her it’s always going to the the mischievous one. There is subtle things that make me feel like she’s either jealous or she just maybe secretly hates me? Idk she puts me down in front of others. In subtle ways but they are there nonetheless. I normally brush them off but I cannot take it anymore. I will give you an example: When were around men she constantly flaunts and brags about herself even though it’s all a lie.  Amidst all of this she puts me down and kind of laughs at me. Even when we’re with my friend she’ll whisper with them and laugh at me.  Also if I have a crush on someone and tell her about him she always without a doubt OH MY GOD HES SO UGLY!!! What do you see in him. Look at this guy! This guy is hot. 
Friend 3 let’s call him Greg he is 19 as well. We’ve known each other for 7. We kind of always had an on and off friendship since I’ve known him. We butt heads on some things but we eventually come together in understanding and so on. But he makes little comments that are very passive aggressive and really quite brutal sometimes. 
All three of them when we’re all together will discuss how much I’ve changed. How I’m an adult and I’m no fun now. Or how sensitive I am or how much I overthink. The list goes on, anything about me they will seriously pick on me about. 

I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. But these comments and things are really starting to wear on me and make me feel really down and sensitive. I’m going to a college right now, I have a job and a car and my life is together. But one thing that constantly is there is how badly I feel mistreated by friends. I’ve just gotten used to this behavior and I am so sick of it. But I feel like if I say anything else it will somehow be my fault or that I am the bad friend or something.. 

So my question is given the history and time.. do I exactly need to “break” up with them? Can I just part ways without giving an explanation? I need suggestions guys. Help because I’m starting to feel crazy and like there is something wrong with me. ",25Apr2018,1
33,"I’ve been dating the same person for 6 years, we’ll call him Nate. He was basically my first everything and we’ve been through it all. We were together all throughout high school and now I am a sophomore in college. There is not one thing he doesn’t know about me, he could basically finish my sentence and read any facial expression I have. I can talk to him about anything and our level of comfort with each other is something I would never take for granted. Throughout high school though, he was definitely verbally abusive and I have always been a person who doesn’t really have a backbone. He’d get angry over things I’d wear, like low\-cut shirts or tight dresses, and would blame me if any guy tried to get with me/approach me. He also was really against drinking and smoking for a period of time, so he would not allow me to ever drink or smoke with my friends. This led to countless arguments and him never compromising. We broke up for a summer, but he still controlled me in a sense because he knew I couldn’t live without him. Fast forward to college and he eventually realized that he was being controlling and somewhat abusive throughout our relationship. I wear what I want now without thinking if Nate will approve and he drinks and smokes now. Last year, I started talking to this guy who Nate and I both know from high school, we’ll call him Jake. At first, it was just the friendly sharing of music and political memes and shit like that. But I’ve gotten to the point where I think about Jake constantly. We talk almost everyday, and it’s not really flirtatious, but I just feel like there’s something there. I saw him a few nights ago and even though I was with my boyfriend, I just wanted to talk to and be around Jake. I told my boyfriend about my feelings for Jake, and he understands that I can’t control it. But I don’t know what to do. I wouldn’t cheat, but I’m just constantly thinking about what it could be like with Jake.

39,"I'm not the kind of person who likes to think badly of others. In fact, I generally have pretty positive opinions of most people I meet (until the give me a reason to think otherwise). I don't want to jump to conclusions here and accuse my housemate of being a bad person, but I should probably explain first. 

I'm a student, and after moving out of dorms I decided to live with 4 of my friends for the rest of my time at Uni. 1 of them moved out at the end of last year, so for a while it was me and 3 others (and for a while just 2 as one of them went home for a few months). Things were a bit chaotic for a while because we still had two empty rooms in our house which have been let out to various international students who need somewhere to sleep and eat for a couple of months. We've had a couple of people come and go, but since the start of the year a younger guy has moved into the furthest room in the house. 

Now, my friends are all really friendly and we tried to make the new guy feel as welcome as we could. At one point he asked me if he could use one of my dishes as he didn't have any just yet. I was sympathetic so I said of course, as long as he cleaned up after himself because I'd need to use it later. When I caught up to him later I saw that he'd acutally used everyones stuff but he'd left it dirty. I mentioned that he should probably ask before going into the others' cupboards because I couldn't vouch for them being okay with their stuff being used. This seems like a minuscule complaint, but I knew the others wouldn't be very happy to find their stuff out of place and at the time I didn't think I'd have to explain that when he initially asked me. 

Since then we've had to ask him to use washing liquid to wash dishes instead of running them under cold water; use a washing tablet from the massive box under the sink when using the dishwasher and not just filling THAT up with hot water; not to leave a bag of rotting trash in the conservatory (because it gets hot and heats up the trash making the house smell) and to take it out to the bins; to not leave various puddles of whatever food he's cooking on the sides and on the fridge shelves (since we had a pretty bad ant infestation AND mice); to not leave the back AND FRONT doors wide open all night (which he's done on numerous occasions and we tried to explain the area we live in is known for petty theft); to keep most windows closed at night (multiple strays have wandered into the house and I had a long and painful issue with bed bugs when we first moved in because of strays getting into the house); and most recently to not play loud music past 11/12 at night as most of my friends have morning lectures and are up by at least 6:30. We also keep a calendar by the front door with everyones deadlines and exam dates on so we know which days people might be working late and/or need to focus. On more than one occasion he's had parties to at least 5am. Worst of all, this guy has left the gas hob on on numerous occasions - sometimes a live flame, sometimes the oven/grill and others just letting the gas run. We've had two 'fire safety' doors installed because of it but they're honestly shit because they don't close properly and they're just hunks of wood with no handles. I don't know if you can count this as property damage (probably a bit extreme to call it that) but this guy also used one of my friends blankets, that he keeps in the common room, as a picnic blanket and put it back where my friend left it covered in food, and drink and mud stains and never even attempted to clean it. This guys also destroyed a handful of handmade place-mats, that were a gift from my mum, after him and his friends soaked them in wine and left them to fall apart in a sink full of water. I tried to asked him what had happened to them and instead of answering me he turned his back and pretended I didn't exist. That upset me quite a lot and I tried to be understanding because he perhaps hadn't known they were mine, but at least explain that to me instead of ignoring me?

I feel terrible for complaining because these all seem like petty things, but one of my close friends who lives with me is on the spectrum and I've tried to make things easier for him. A lot of the stuff this guy is doing is throwing my friend out of his routines and I don't usually sugarcoat things for him, but wouldn't anyone be concerned if their friend was being affected by this behaviour? 

As of late the parties and late night visitors have been keeping me up as well. My bedroom is at the very front of the house and the front door itself is barely a metre away from my bed, so I hear everyone going in and out and any conversations outside my room, which as I said before can happen all night until at least 5am. 

We've tried to explain on numerous occasions to this guy that we don't want to nag, but just doing little things will help all of us out and we'd be grateful if he could do his part so that things in the house just go smoothly. He's pretty much ignored everything we've tried to explain to him - still doesn't lock doors, still throws parties, still leaves the hob on, still doesn't wash anyones dishes even though he's pretty much the only one willing to use the now filthy kitchen at this point. I've tried to politely remind him on a few occasions and explain that I don't want to be on his case all the time, I personally don't think its a lot to ask to have some kind of consideration for the people he's living with and his only response to any of our questions has been that we need to 'get used to everything he's doing' because its 'generic student behaviour'. I tried to explain the other day that its fine for him to have friends over and to throw parties but to at least keep it down in the morning because not everyone will be awake. I personally don't believe thats true. I lived in dorms first year and even though the kitchen was dirty, there were some late night parties and we ended up with a trolley in our 4th floor flat, everyone was at least understanding if their behaviour affected those around them. 

There's not much else I can say or do since he no longer acknowledges any of us and turns his back when we speak to him - even if its just hello. 

I'm really at a loss here, I never intended for him to feel ostracised or to be pushy or naggy. I'm not his mum by any means but he seems to ignore the fact that there are 6 people living in the house (including me). Sorry if this is one big complaint. Can't exactly talk to my Landlady since she'd most likely say its not her problem and/or to ignore him, which we tried to do. Should we (as in, my friends and I) keep trying to talk to this guy and try to have a discussion where we can hear his side as well as ours? I feel like that would be best since I'm sure he'd like to let us know how we irritate him. Or shall I just contact the Landlady anyway? 

Again, sorry for the long whiney post : / Like I said, I don't think this guy is a bad person but he's unbelievably messy and unsafe which really bothers everyone.",25Apr2018,1

I have a potential job in the field I was studying and want to be able to let them believe that ive graduated so I can continue on with my life. 

My main problem is how I'm going to show them that I've graduated when I'm not walking the ceremony or even have a diploma to show.

43,"This may seem stupid, but does anyone have advice on how to take pills without them getting stuck in your throat?

I have a terrible gag reflex, and always have anxiety about taking a pill because I’m convinced I won’t swallow it all the way down on the first try and it will get stuck at the beginning of my throat.

46,"Not too long ago, I was going through a terrible time; I was constantly fighting with my mom over money (more info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/7wfvsu/im_broke_and_i_dont_want_to_live_any_more_because/?utm_source=reddit-android) ) and she made several threats to kick me out of our apartment. She finally succeeded but thankfully my boyfriend offered to let me stay over at his place. However the whole situation has left me so mentally and physically drained that I fell into a pretty severe depressive episode. I didn't want to leave the place, eat, or do anything, and neither did I want to talk to anyone. So I pulled a NCNS.

I was surprised when I realized that none of my coworkers had made an attempt to contact me and ask where I was. But again I really didn't want to talk to anyone so I didn't do anything about that as well.

It's been almost over a week. Still no calls or texts from coworkers or my employer. But I'm pretty sure I've been fired because I know a NCNS is highly unprofessional and often frowned upon, not to mention it reflects the employee's lack of discipline. I'm sure that if I tried to show up, I'd be told to leave and that they want to have nothing to do with me. I don't blame them. They have every right to be upset with me.

But I've been wondering if I should at least let them know *why*. Should I explain to my employer about the situation I'm currently in? I'm not expecting sympathy, and though a tiny part of me wishes for it, I also highly doubt that I would be given a second chance. But it wouldn't hurt to try, right? Besides, they deserve to know what happened, I think.

I'm not even sure how to begin. I don't want to sound like I'm making up an excuse or a sob story. I just want to explain. I know fully well that should I get terminated, it is entirely my fault for pulling a NCNS for a whole week - in those 7 days I could've said a thing or two about my absence, but I didn't. I was not professional, and no one would want someone as incompetent as me on their team.

Now I have to go look for another job. But should I let any potential employers know about my depression, in case something like this were to happen again? My (presumably) final paycheck should be coming soon and I'm afraid what happened between my mom and I would repeat itself. I also hate feeling like a worthless freeloader, and I want to at least pay some rent to my boyfriend or something as a means of thanking him for letting me stay over during this difficult time.

I just feel so embarrassed too. Maybe my boyfriend suspects it, but I don't think he knows about my NCNS and my being fired (his work usually starts before mine did; we also clocked out at the same time but since my workplace was closer to his place, I'd reach home sometime before he does). I don't want him to know that I'm now unemployed because I'm ashamed, and I'm scared he'll think of me as a failure of an adult. I just wish I could help myself for once without any assistance and be someone that *others* could rely on, for a change.

(For the record, I do take medication regularly for my depression, and despite that episode I'm now feeling slightly better and I'm ready to meet and serve people again. Trust me when I say that things would've been even worse without them. By that point, NCNS would be the least of problems.)

47,"I don't know if I should be posting this here, or if I should post it altogether. The thing is. There was a frustrating incident today in my relationship, which I'm not willing to discuss, as it would be a breach on both her and my privacy. That said, what I can say is that I know I overreacted and got extremely frustrated over what happened. I did my best to keep my cool, but for both my and her wellbeing, I decided that it would be best to take a step back and not talk to her until I fully calm down from the frustration, as I don't want to hurt her by letting her see how truly upset I was. 

Now. I've been thinking about my relationship with her since the incident. I really believe she's a wonderful girl, and I do think I love her, but recently I feel like there has been a growing distance between us, today's situation making it worse.

I don't know if I am second guessing the relationship due to a problem with the relationship itself, or due to other outside situations regarding my family breaking apart making me feel more cautious and less trusting of people in general, but I do know that I am feeling incredibly frustrated and unfulfilled as of late and I can't find a way to help myself calm down once something that aggravates me happens. 

Do you guys know a way to keep my cool better and cope with frustrating situations more effectively? 

I also need help to better communicate about how I feel with my girlfriend. I usually keep my poker face on during bad days, only telling her about an upsetting situation when I'm in a state of major emotional distress. This situation involves her, so I can't really talk to her about it without this hurting her.

PS: sorry if I rambled a lot. I still haven't been able to calm down and  just had a bit of an anxious peak which left me with a knot on my throat, almost making me cry. The situation happened a bit over seven hours ago and I'm still terribly upset about it. ",25Apr2018,0

50,"Not entirely sure where to start with this, but here I go. 

So there’s a guy at work that’s always really friendly to me. Every time he sees me he says “Hey [name]!” with a big ol smile on his face, and I return the gesture. We haven’t had a conversation aside from exchanging formalities so I didn’t really think much of his greetings. It wasn't until Saturday evening that I finally realized he had been flirting when he gave me a flower. I work at a place that regularly gives them out to the guests, so it wasn’t TOO unusual that he did it, but the fact that he did it at all was just like………… what. 

Now I’m not sure what to do. I kinda liked him before, but I don’t know how to approach him when I go to work tomorrow. Should I say something about it? Should I just like…. Avoid him and hope the feels go away? Should I see if he’s still interested and maybe instigate a potential date? What do I do???

Also, I’m not sure if I want to be in a relationship right now. I’ve never dated anyone before and the thought of being in a workplace relationship makes me uncomfortable. On the other hand, I’m at a point in my life where I’m supposed to make mistakes and grow as a person, so I think this would be a really good learning experience for me… But I don’t want to make my coworkers uncomfortable if/when we break up........ Buuuuuuut he’s hot and into me so…. I don’t know. Life is hard and feelings are dumb.

53,"Long story short, I met her online, she’s in Malaysia. I’m attending a wedding there in November for my best friend.

My Filipino friend (let’s call her Cindy) wants to meet up with me, which I’m fine with. She will take 1 week leave to hang out with me. I’ll have 3 weeks holiday in Malaysia. 1 for the wedding.

She plans to take me to some place via bus and we will share a hotel room together.

Now...I don’t mind, but we barely know each other. She has never asked me for money or anything like that. She calls me some nights and just wants to chat. We video chat mostly and talk about random things. She seems like a great person, but I can’t help but keep searching for online scams about Filipino people.

None of them seem really match her however. The closest thing is that her grandmother died recently, but she flew back to the Philippines and came back to Malaysia. She never once asked for money or anything.

I could just be over thinking it and she just genuinely trusts me. I just think she’s too trusting, because she said most guys will talk dirty with her or something like that, and I’m like “Why would I do that?” She assumed that I might be the same. She doesn’t know who I am, what if I’m actually bad and want to cause harm to her? I try to teach her to be happy and to never let others walk all over her.

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for almost three years. He supports me with my decisions, helps me with whatever I ask, and swears he loves me unconditionally. I believe him, and feel that if he didn’t, he wouldn’t still be around as I have embarrassing emotional issues and outbursts and he treats me no different. He has always been there for me to cry to even if he doesn’t understand how to help. 

My self esteem is awful, I wish I could escape it. My problem is I need obvious signs of love and affection on the regular or else I start thinking he’s becoming disinterested. Even though I know he’s not (does that make sense?) it’s pathetic. I’m 25 and shouldn’t feel that way. We have talked about this and he has stated multiple times that he’s in this for the long run and will take on anything with me. He served in the military and has said that physically showing emotions is a problem for him as an outcome from being overseas. He can be having the best time (as he says) but you could never tell by his face expressions. He states he doesn’t know how and is trying his best to show his love and it makes me feel awful when I start to cry because I’m not being shown enough affection or think he’s head over heels for me. I don’t want him to think he’s not good enough because he’s more than that. He’s done more for me than any other man and I am incredibly happy, I just don’t know how to make these issues go away. 

I’m afraid my emotions are going to ruin our relationship, but he says they won’t. I’m constantly feeling like I’m not good enough for him despite what he says and how he acts. This isn’t a problem with him, it’s me. I’m just looking for any sort of advice whether it’s regarding improving my self esteem, coping mechanisms/outlets for when I feel this way, advice from anyone who has served that can vouch for the lack of emotions, ANYTHING. I think a large part of all this is that I will never be able to understand why he lacks physical emotion as I have never experienced what he has.

We talk pretty regularly though there are times when we don't for like extended periods (past 16 hours). We are definitely not yet at the dating phase however it seems pretty clear that I like her and she feels the same way too.

However she has always had this guy friend who is part of her group of school friends, I don't really know how to put it any other way, but i feel as though they might have something going on between them. I do follow a couple of her friends on instagram, and some of their stories that i have seen would always have him close to her in the picture. There was this one story in which their group went to a beach resort and i saw a story of him carrying her up on his shoulders in the pool. It also doesn't help that her other friends seem to keep shipping them together. Furthermore as they are in the same course, they basically spend a lot of time studying together.

I'm not too sure if i should confront her on this as I don't really want it to seem like i'm trying too hard or if she takes it the wrong way. I have casually mentioned him in a conversation before and she said they were just friends. The reason i brought up the instagram stories earlier is because he never seems to be in her stories when they are together while the rest of her friends' stories clearly show them being close to each other. From what my own friends have told me the reason for this is because she may not want people to think there is something between them. I just can't help but feel like something is up.

Could really use some advice on how do i approach a situation like this as i really am able to see something between us. Am i overthinking? Or have i been fooled all along? Relationships are confusing as hell. :/

Basically, here's what's going on. Last year I was promoted into a supervisor/manager role and oversaw production and operations for my company's branch. I was thrust into this role but welcomed the challenge and have received a lot of support from my 2 bosses \(I'm very close with them \- they are my mentors and have always had my back\).

We have this one person on our team, who is a complete nightmare. She is incompetent in every sense of the word and causes nothing but problems and is in general just a toxic person. Any time we discipline her \(verbal warnings, course correction, etc\), she threatens legal action. HR caught wind of this and told us to back off and to handle the situation delicately so we don't get sued. So, we can't get rid of her. This has been going on for the past 4 months, and having her on our team is a total drain. Production and quality have suffered. Everyone else on my team has started developing attitudes, asking ""why can't we just fire her? what are you doing about this?"" and aren't functioning like a team. I reach out to my leadership for guidance and am hit with the 'this will pass, just be patient'. I'm doing my best to get a handle of this situation but there doesn't seem to be any winning moves. Morale is low, workplace culture is unfavorable, and above all I feel inadequate and feel like I've let my bosses down.

The bottom line is that I'm unhappy where I am right now. Despite my bosses fighting for me to get into this position, I feel like I am not cut out for corporate management at this time. I am still very young and may need more experience under my belt before I am able to effectively manage people. I have an interview for a job on Friday that seems to be a good lead. I am just wondering if anyone else who has been in similar situations can provide insight. 

I just gave a brief overview of what's going on, but am happy to provide more details if needed. Thanks in advance.",25Apr2018,1

84,"So my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me a month ago. She had tried to break it off in January but I convinced her that we could make it work, and it actually was getting better. She said that she didn't see a future for us, and that I didn't make her feel the way she felt she needed. She said she was comfortable with our relationship but... it wasn't enough. I was prepared for it and I've actually been dealing with it fairly well.

So anyways, here is what I want advice on. I've started dating again. Using apps such as Tinder and Bumble, and a dating site called Plenty of Fish, or posting on reddit.  I've met a handful of women from them, and it's been alright. Still nothing that feels... right. I think my problem is I'm meeting the wrong kind of woman, or just people that are in the wrong place in life for me. I want to be able to meet women without using the internet. I have no idea how to do that. I don't have issues talking to women, but I do have some anxiety. I occasionally have some self image issues, but mostly I'm terrified of being seen as a creep. I'll see women I would love to start a conversation with at a book store or the ice rink, but I can't bring myself to do anything.

Anyways thanks for reading through this post, and any advice is welcome. Also sorry if the grammar/spelling is bad. I've had several early mornings in a row for work.",25Apr2018,1
85,"I don't even know where to start. Life changes in a second, without your approval of the matter or not. I guess I should have seen it coming but right now I'm just losing it. 

This weekend I got arrested for the first time ever. On a domestic violence charge. My wife and I were drunk, got in a fight, made up, then got in an argument late at night. I was tired of it and we were sitting on the bed so I just shoved her to lay down and cuddle her and go to sleep. I kept telling her, ""go to sleep, go to sleep, please let's stop."" Obviously I have fault, not only shoving her to lay down but yelling, hitting the pillow in anger, I wasn't in the right state of mind either. 

But at last, I thought we were going to sleep. No more than 10 minutes pass when my mom is knocking on the door with cops behind her. The neighbors had called the police, the walls are so thin in this apartment you literally hear everything anyways so I'm not surprised. I was surprised to get arrested though, I didn't feel like I was being violent, definitely not enough to get arrested at least. I got taken to jail over the weekend and I almost lost my mind. The feeling of your freedom being taken away from you is incredibly sad and defeating. I felt I would never see the outside world. May sound dramatic but it's how I felt. I had panic attack after panic attack after panic attack. Even now. 
I love her. I love her so damn much and we both fucked up so bad with drinking heavily all the time, not getting mental help but goddamn do we love each other. Everything we'd do together, even go to the bathroom. One would sit while the other pooped and just talk to each other and keep one another company. Worked together, lived together, showered, games, cook. Everything together. 
Now, she's gone. I come back home and most of her things are gone. I have to hit the restart button on myself and learn to live alone, and I hate it. We had worse fights than this. This shouldn't have happened. Or should it have? Were we perfect for each other but was it just not the right time? Will it ever? I miss her and I know she misses me too. 
The court set a protection on her so I can't contact her, nor will I because the consequences are a million times worse. But I'm not a bad person...I think? We had our issues but I tried to be a helping person. I really did. I guess I just didn't help myself at the same time? I don't know what to think. 
I don't know what to do.
Not only is my life going to get complicated because of these charges but I also have to lose who I thought was the love of my life. 
I feel lost. Scared. Alone. And I just wish I could hug her and have her back and tell her I love her. Maybe we were bad for each other now and in the future we could return but how can life change so drastically so fast? You don't have a say in it. You have to deal with it. But how? I don't have the energy to work out right now, I don't have friends, I can't see myself with someone else.

87,"My Fiancee and I have been living in a middle level apartment for the past year. Recently, we found out that our neighbors have been filing noise complaints about us quite often saying that we are fighting, screaming and making a ton of noise. 

The apartment owners have confronted us once, and the complaint was the same, but my fiancee was already out to work and I was sleeping, so the apartment owners dropped it as a false claim. 

Recently, our neighbors called the police on us reporting a domestic disturbance, yet I was at the gym and my fiancee was dead asleep. 

Now first off, we don't fight to begin with. Secondly, if there's an argument, it's never to the point where we scream at each other. The office is convinced that the person making the claim may just be hearing things. They've told us we're fine essentially. 

How do I deal with the neighbor though? Were at the point where we're whispering and tip toeing so as to not disturb this person's slumber. Do we just keep the office informed?",25Apr2018,1
88,"I'm not a very attractive human male, I'll say it right now.
I usually wear tie-dye, every day for a long time, it's almost a meme at this point. I plan to tie-dye my hair over the summer, and I have a tie-dye FAQ. My point; it's engrained in the way people see me. Weather they see it as a part of my identity or just a fun gimmick, I'm not too sure. 

I started playing tennis recently, and I was told I look hot in my uniform by a few people, which is not tie-dye (unfortunately). It got me thinking, should I stop wearing tie-dye in order to be more attractive? 

My thoughts so far: I'd be more appealing to future crushes. But that means that they would like me for what I look like rather than JUST what I am under the clothes and skin. Maybe not wearing tie-dye is gonna make me a bit more popular among my fellow high school juniors (I have enough friends to keep me happy, but they are mainly in 10th and 8th grade)

89,"My dad has never liked where he works, understandably so it has awful work conditions. He has done multiple attempts to open up his own business and they've all failed. He's opened up a CD shop, (When they were more prevalent) a restaurant, and bunch of other side businesses. 
All have put us in great financial debt.  He now wants to pursue a business in making and selling wooden furniture. He's pretty good, but not financially support your family good. 

Honestly, if he left his current career I would be happy, it makes him miserable. I just wish he would make better decisions fiance wise. We have no money saved, he would leave his well-paying job and transition to business which in total he has accumulated let's say over 500$ all spanning over several months and months. I am at stage in my life where I can financially contribute to a house.   

Except all I'd be able to acquire is a minimum wage job. We already struggle bill wise with my father's well-paying job. I  can't even begin to imagine even being able to pay half our household expenses on a minimum wage job.  Also, I am willing to admit I don't want to get a job for it to only lead to 100% of that money being earned just go into to paying off bills which won't even cover to full costs of it. 

I'm at loss here. I want to be supportive of my father, but I can't be with these decisions he wants to make. If he was willing to get a part-time job, and I get a job too and help cover certain costs while he tries to get his side business to take off I would happily oblige. Or even he chose to hold off on leaving work and he saves enough money to cover the costs of bills for the span of a couple of months. He devoted all that time to his new career, I again I get a job, to contribute to groceries or other things.

There is no reasoning with him. He knows what we've been through why does he want to go through it again? Why can't he just switch careers, why is he so obsessed with starting his own business? Why can't he save, and have a safety net before venturing into this business? 
Am I being selfish with my desires? What will happen to them when I move out? 

If I question him all he says is I don't have to be worrying about this. I'm sorry, but not knowing we'll be able to make ends meet is quite concerning. I've already applied to work, but I haven't gotten a single call back. This is so difficult for me. My dad has sacrificed, so much for my family, but he can be so reckless. What do I do?

I go to college and to make a couple bucks my proffessor suggested I help this small organization create a webpage. I took the offer. so I went to  speak with then and they were nice and I was happy to get started. I worked really really hard on this project and I'm not really a webpage kind of dude and I finally submitted my webpage to them and everything seemed totally fine and they used it for a day. I checked in because they didn't seem to computers savvy and I was gonna see if the small edits to detail they made were alright and  the site I made was gone replaced with a slightly more professional site. I do not blame them for going with the new site. it looked nice but here I am with the money already in my account and I feel like I didn't earn it.

99,"Since young, I've always struggled with expressing my emotions vulnerably, especially negative emotions like disappointment, anger, sadness, whatever. I'm a relatively private person so I chalk it up to this for my inability to express my emotions vulnerably and healthily. I tend to internalise a lot of my negative emotions because I'm always thinking along the lines of ""What kind of energy am I putting out to the world?"" 

My biggest struggle is always expressing these negative emotions towards someone healthily, for example when I'm upset at a friend or someone and I want her to know. When I was in a relationship, I always second-guessed myself whenever I was mad or upset at my SO, like, ""Are my feelings justified?"" 

I need constant justification for negative emotions, especially if they're directed at someone. I need to know that I'm right and rational in how I'm feeling because if I don't, I spiral into this anxious mess wondering whether I overreacted by being angry or upset or disappointed. I end up feeling guilty a lot of the times whenever I do express my anger and disappointment.

That's why I hate ever expressing my negative emotions, because of the guilt that entails it. I just internalise and let it go. It usually doesn't bother me so much when I internalise and let it go but sometimes it does get frustrating.

101,"Okay so basically I am trying to get as much advice as I possibly can on this before anything serious happens. 

I was forced to move in with my birth father and his new wife around a little over a year ago. Moving from SC to GA and leaving all of my friends and people who I care about behind. The time I have spent with my new step family have not been good. They belittle me and talk about me all of the time, making me do most of the chores around the house and putting me in a room the size of a decent walk-in closet. My father doesn't notice the things that my new stepmom and her children do to me. Not to mention that he allows her ex-husband to continue to live with us and stay in the same house as us. The school year for this year is coming to an end, and I had already been making plans for next year when I turn 18 to move out and move back to SC to my friends and to my partner who I have been with for four years. But one of my friends who I have known since middle school told me recently that they are getting an apartment and thought I would make a good room-mate to help with bills and to help me move out of the household I am currently in. The thought of that makes me feel so light and free, for the simple fact of moving out is what I dreamed about for the years I lived in SC to now. Ive wanted this for so long but now, that my freedom is so close I don't know what I should do. I am a hard working junior in school and I will be a senior next year, I may not be honor roll material but, I get the highest grades I possibly can. (80-or higher) I have worked in quite a few jobs both in SC and in GA and I know I can do both my schooling and work, so there will be no problem with that. The main thing I am worried about is the fact that I do not have a car, and the possibility of something going wrong and really the fact of I will be on my own. The job would not become a problem for not having a car. As I could walk and there are lots of jobs hiring near the apartment complex. I also have people in SC who I know if something bad happens can help me out and make sure I get back on my feet properly. 

Im just, scared I guess... 
I like to plan ahead and always have a back up plan for something but for this I don’t know what to expect, Ive never been though this before and I don’t want to leave it up to fate.

My friend said the apartments rent would be around 800 a month (not including electricity). 
Do you think that someone working at a starbucks full time and someone working part time at a Krispy Cream or a Gas station could make enough to stay afloat with something like that?

I was a part of a serious relationship less than 2 months ago. We were dating for 3.5 years, but it didn't work out. I broke up with her and I am totally over her. This isn't my problem. 

I've been living with friends in a close by town. Been going out to bars and parties with them (I'm in college). I met this one girl at the bar. She seemed cool and cute, we exchanged snapchats and had a date set up the next day.

 To be truthful, I'm not really ready for another relationship yet, but I don't know a ton of people from the town that my college is in. I figured even if we didn't mesh well together we could still be friends, because I need some friends in this town.

 We go on the date, and it actually goes really well. We have a lot in common and she is very beautiful. I didn't like that it went so well because, like I said, totally not ready for a new relationship at this point. But I'm not one to shy away from things, so we go on 2 more dates. On the third one, things were getting hot and heavy, and she invited me into her bedroom. 

At this point, I had to make sure she knew exactly where I stood. I tell her that i do like her and that I think we get along really well, but I'm not sure if it will go anywhere between us, at least not until I feel ready to take that chance again.

Well that was a turnoff for her, which I understand. That's why I told her, because I like and respect her way to much as a person to just ""hit it and quit it"". So I leave, and haven't talked to her in a couple days. 

I really do like her and honestly could see us being together if the timing was better. I've been thinking about seeing if she would mind going on a couple more dates, and see how it feels. The problem is, I don't really want to lead her on and then drop her again because of the timing. 

I'm just looking for some advice, somebody out there has had to be in the same situation at one point right? Also, not to many experiences with breakup/REBOUNDs, so I'm not sure how to tell if it is just a rebound or not. I don't think it is, but like I said, not to much experience.

116,"My wife and I are very similar, yet also very different. One thing we have in common is that there's a certain class of people that just never seem to like us, that we just never seem to get along with.

We're both prior military. I'm prior enlisted, she's an officer in the National Guard still. She has some serious problems getting along with other officers, always has even when she was active duty, and officers fall into this category of ""Others"". Or maybe we're the ""Others"", I don't know.

I regularly work with the owners of small to midsized businesses in my career. These folks are also ""Others"". They tend to like things like golfing and some of the finer things. I often have interests that overlap with some of theirs, and we'll have a good conversation about that. But at some point, something just clicks like they forgot I was lesser or something of that nature, not sure what it is. Usually these folks are men, and in my experience there isn't usually a racial component. They voraciously read books about management and leadership, and are usually college educated. This particular class of people seem to always give me the benefit of the doubt at first, and then eventually become very dismissive of me.

My wifes experience is like this with other military officers, usually female, but also with a lot of housewives, also not really with a racial component. Also the type who like things we would generally find to be pretentious, like humblebragging about 5k races and hip restaurants or their dream destination wedding, or the right way to raise kids.

I'm not college educated, but I'd consider myself pretty intelligent, and I'm very well read. I'm in an extremely technical field, and just generally a reasonably smart guy. I can talk literature, philosophy, politics, whatever. I'm worldly and I've traveled a lot.

My wife is very educated. She has her masters, she's lived abroad, and is also very smart.

But we aren't bullshitters. We tend to be pretty honest people, we don't put up a front or act fake towards people, we aren't fancy or pretentious. We like getting good deals on shit from Goodwill, sometimes we fuck up and are a little too honest, and generally wear our feelings on our sleeves.

What I've noticed though, is that these ""Others"" seem to always do pretty well in life. It's the person who gets that promotion hookup from the boss, or lands the high paying job they are barely competent enough to do, or runs a small business and somehow manages to schmooze everybody in the city and other people buy their bullshittery. We're the people who get depended on a lot. We get asked to work that weekend project, or play the pinch hitter when an emergency happens at work. We do more than the people who culturally are ""Others"" who are our peers, but they seem to always be held in a more favorable light. When we talk to the ""Others"" we always feel like we're somehow breaking invisible etiquette and social mores that we don't even know exist.

I mean we're not stupid or rude, we're not as brash as bulls in a china shop. I can be sometimes, but my wife generally isn't. But these folks seem to always look down on us. They don't include us, they don't try to schmooze us the way they do everybody else.

I want to reiterate that I don't think there's a racial component here. I'm a straight white anglo dude, my wife is hispanic. I've gotten the 3rd degree from these people when they're white, hispanic, asian, black, male, female, what have you. It's like it's a mindset or something.

Why don't they like us? Is it because we have nothing to offer them or hook them up with other than friendship or support? Is it because we are breaking the rules by not having this pretentious fake front of politeness that is just a tad *too* polite? Do they think we're just plebs? We're not dorky little hunchbacked people. We're pretty average looking, probably above average intelligence, and generally very up front and friendly.

This bugs my wife and I, but to be fair it's one of the strongest things we have in common with each other. Despite both of our accomplishments it's almost like it's a bunch of Chads and Staceys who just seem to always get ahead and just see us as lesser people. 

What's the deal? Who are these people? If I start golfing and reading fake ass inspirational management books that are counterintuitive to everything I learned about leadership as an NCO in the military and buttering up my managers, will I eventually land that VP job and six figure salary?

Bugs the shit out of me.",25Apr2018,1

118,"Hello Reddit, I am just a young guy looking for a little life advice. Last week, through a mutual friend, I met a girl that I immediately hit it off with. This may not seem very out of the ordinary for most, but for me, she was literally the only woman I have ever met in my life that I can sit down and talk with for as long as we are together. I am horrible at carrying on a conversation in person, but with her it is like it’s the easiest thing in the world.

As stated in the title, I also lost my virginity to this girl, which happened this past weekend. This may seem very fast, which it was, but I feel like that only exemplifies how much I immediately enjoyed this girl. It was not a case of I slept with the first thing that would sleep with me. I have several opportunities to have sex with people I did not care for in the past, but I held off because I wanted to share it with someone I liked as a person. And so, I found this girl, and I decided that she was the one I wanted to share my first time with. 

Now, the thing that I am having a problem with is the fact that it is impossible for me to have a relationship of any kind with her. I leave for home in 5 days (I am living in another city, and am only in my current city for school) and she will be gone for school before I come back for my second year, and so I will literally not see her for another year at least. Now, the problem is, I cannot stop thinking about her. It absolutely kills me to think about the fact that I cannot spend more time with this girl, and I don’t know how to change that, hence why I am turning to Reddit. 

I have asked all of my really close friends if they have any advice, but all of them tell me that it’s just because I lost my virginity to her, and not because I actually like her. I know this is wrong, however, because I already really liked her before I lost my virginity to her, which is something that they cannot seem to get into their mind. 

So, now that you have the backstory, here is the question: is there any way that I can stop thinking about this girl, since all I am doing at this point is setting myself up for failure?

TL;DR: I have kind of fallen in love with the girl I lost my virginity to, cannot stop thinking about her, even though we will be moving away from each other, and there is no way we can be together, and that kills me.",25Apr2018,1

So, quick story:
I came across GWA subreddit little over 2 years back, and I won't lie it was an experience like none other, not just in terms of sex but in terms of understanding how the human mind works. 

From my side, I always wanted to contribute to the GWA subreddit, and I think I have enough imagination and online script support to get started with the content. 

But I'm kinda stumped at how to go about actually saying things. I'm a complete novice, I barely have any experience in recording and hearing myself. Is there any advice that can be given on how to get started, maybe a few tips I could follow and get better at it?

128,"I'm currently living with 2 other girls in an apartment during college. If I were living by myself, I would make sure that my living areas are clean as often as I possibly could. But living with roommates, I understand that's not realistic so I have lowered my standards for how clean the kitchen, bathroom, and living room are.

Both of my roommates are care significantly less than I do about how clean everything is (specifically the kitchen and bathroom). I typically clean up the kitchen every 2 weeks which takes me about an hour to do. And I clean the bathroom about every month. The roommate I share the bathroom with oftentimes leaves her hair wads from showering on the floor and stains in the sink bowl. And the kitchen gets so filthy so easily from cooking stains and their clutter that they like to leave all over the kitchen counter. I've voiced that I'd like for us to try to keep everything clean, but I know that it'd be a lot more efficient to make a schedule and divide up the work. 

So in order to decide a fair amount of clean-up, what do you guys typically expect? Maybe clean the bathroom every 2 weeks and cleaning the kitchen every week? Confrontation isn't a problem for me, but I want to propose a schedule that is fair and will still keep the house clean because I really can't stand how dirty it gets.

TL;DR
Unclean roommates. I want to enact a schedule for what gets cleaned and who cleans it, but am not sure what is a good amount.

130,"I'm a Catholic. I have been questioning my beliefs for a while now. The apologetics for my religion do not seem sound to me. (Quite frankly, some of the justifications make God appear apathetic at best, and completely evil at worst.)

I want to find somebody I can discuss this with to help me through, but I cannot seem to trust anybody unless I know they are a devout believer in our faith. I have tried various secular counsellors before, and while their advice was helpful, I found myself ignoring it as soon as I considered the notion of being wrong and having to spend an eternity in hell. Conversely, I have talked to several priests about this as well. Eventually, our discussions would end up with me having nothing to stand on but the faith that it made sense, it was just beyond my understanding. It's just not helping. But hopefully you understand the dilemma: I can't find help from anybody I can trust, but I can't trust anybody who could potentially help.

I'm sick of living a miserable, sexually-repressed, fear-filled life of servitude, and the worst part is that the only reason I can give for why I am doing this to myself is that if I don't do this, my Dad will never respect me, and maybe I'll also go to hell with nobody to blame except myself.

131,"I feel like I understand all the terminology and what is committed and uncommitted, what's slimy and what's not, but I'd still like some clarification either way.

""Boyfriend/girlfriend""- committed relationship(unless otherwise stated) this would be ""official""

""Dating""- you've been talking to someone gone out with them a few times, but you might be talking to and/or seeing other people(not quite sure if that's slimy or not)

""Talking""- there's someone you're interested in that you're talking to but it's okay if you're seeing other people(I had someone tell me that was slimy)

""Seeing someone""- kind of like another term for dating I suppose? But more so someone to hook with

I guess a general rule would be don't do to others what you wouldn't like being done to you, but on the flip side of that people aren't always on the same emotional levels.

I feel like it's a really gray area up until you declare you are boyfriend and/or girlfriend, and even then things aren't exactly clear.

132,"(15F) I’m in photojournalism for my school and yesterday evening I went to take photos for a boy’s baseball game.  I was in the dugout taking photos of the game and within 5 minutes of standing there my butt got *accidentally* firmly brushed on top of twice (for reference, I’m just gonna say it, I have a particularly large ass on a slim/athletic build).  When I’m standing in the dugout I can hear comments about my ass being said, but this honestly doesn’t bother me too much, just because I’m unfortunately used to it and it no longer phases me.  But then, as I’m still standing in the dugout taking photos (minding my own business), there’s a group of three boys standing behind me and I can hear them making comments and giggling and then I hear one of them say, “no balls,” to which I’m thinking if one of them blatantly slaps my ass I’m going to lose my shit, and then I hear them still giggling and saying, “no balls man...no balls.” And then this one boy (probably 16yrs) spits water all over my butt, getting the back of my shorts completely wet.  When I turned around two of the boys were laughing and walking away while the other one was standing with the bottle in his hand, and I yelled at him, “are you fucking kidding me?” and he ignorantly says, “oh, I’m sorry, really.” And I go, “No, you don’t just fucking do that to someone.” He then goes, “Really, I don’t know what I did, sorry.”  And I simply said back, “You know damn well what you did.” and just sort of stared him down for a second.  I didn’t tell their coach because they were coaching on the field and I just didn’t want to make a scene about it.  I also don’t know who the boy who spit the water at me was and didn’t get his jersey number, but I recognized one of his friends standing there laughing (he probably wouldn’t tell me who it was but I haven’t asked yet).  I wish I would’ve done something more. 

How do figure out who this boy is, and should I tell anyone if I figure it out? (Ps. I honestly don’t think that the coach would do anything about it since it’s not technically that “serious” of an issue, and he’d probably impetuously take the “boys will be boys” stance).

138,"So. I mean the title very much. At the bottom I'll express what it is I'm asking and looking for. 

""Oh everyone's into different flavors!"" doesn't apply here; I am actually deformed and my features scream poor genes. I look sickly and much older than I am. People say I look like a fugly crackhead all the time or insult me on my face. And hey. This is a visual world. A visual society. It is human nature to value appearances greatly and no matter how someone spins it, people tend to treat uglier people on average far worse. I hear a lot of guys say beautiful girls are just more valuable…never hurts less each time I hear it. 

This is all coming from someone who...used to never care. Who was happy doing what she wanted, who believed in personality beyond all else--though me being an awkward, shy girl...one who literally had communication issues and needed speech therapy as a kid...the odds were already against me. I'm horrible at talking. I guess I might have managed alright, but being disconnected from other people and having a lot of bullies abusing me over my looks/fatness/etc...just snowballed over time. Only still have one best friend irl. 

In the past year the only times I was happy was when I deluded myself into thinking I’m cute; felt more comfortable just living and naturally wanted to do more, attend class, etc. rather than just cry at home or something. Yeah. I've done that pretty often...sometimes the anxiety becomes so great I just can't step outside. It's not actually BDD, either. I genuinely have never been complimented in my life, only ever insulted. Posted my picture online and yup, I'm a 2/10.   

…And of course, I've never been with a man, and the only ones that seem to have shown interest were middle-aged when I was a teenager. Or guys who saw me in dim lighting here and struck up a conversation, only to treat me with disgust once they saw me in the light and insult my looks and walked away…even if we talked and laughed together for over a hour before one time. Or they just look…disappointed. 
I remember when a guy I knew was asked about me. ""Oh, the conversation I had with her was wonderful and I'm sure she's a good girl, but she's too hideous to date. Not even f'able."" 

Ever since I became an adult I lost my hobbies. I lost my peace of mind; every moment outside is full of anxiety and pain; I just hate being seen now. I started getting depressed over this because someone betrayed me because of how I looked when I was 18, prom time...the reason they explicitly gave was that I was too ugly to be seen with...just imagine how much that f'ed me up.        

I’ve tried therapy for years; seen all the available ones already. Didn’t help one bit. Or made me more sure that I am ugly (never diagnosed with BDD). 

I tried to ""improve."" I lost weight this past year. Used to be overweight my entire life (almost 200) and clung onto the idea that I could be cute someday…but it was only a red herring. I spent 100s fixing my acne-prone skin. Helped a bit, just didn’t fix the worst issues. I got better fashion. Showed off my assets, like the long, shapely legs other girls tell me they envy, but it’s worthless, really. I'm a butterface. :(

I am a weak person. I care what people think. I want to feel attractive; I want to look a certain way. I want a guy that isn't just settling.
I want...to not be me anymore. And these are all impossible things...and, I'm not sure how to reconcile this, /adv/. I really don't know. I've gradually grown more obsessed about this with time and...god, it's ridiculous, and painful, and I don't even know what to do about being hideous without the means to even overcome this; this is all people ever see in me, and for good reason. I'm so shy.

I am suicidal, it's true...sometimes it feels like...the only hope I have of ever feeling ok is in death, or in extensive plastic surgery. Just feel so lost. And I also feel physically very ill most of the time so...yeah. I feel trapped on multiple levels. :(",25Apr2018,2
139,"Hey Reddit!

So my partner and I live in a small apartment looking out the back of a pretty popular food place. On the off hours, and regularly at the end of the day, the waiters, and the owner themself, enjoys a smoke in the back. We have an ancient place that was an addition to the building, and the smoke pretty much goes right through our floorboards and fills our place. My partner is allergic to smoke \(and everything else\), so this is a real problem for her especially.

I'd like to go downstairs and ask the owner if he can possibly do something about this, but there's a few issues:

1. The owners don't seem crazy about us living above them. They don't own our apartment or the rest of the building, but they have treated any visual appearance of us outside of our door during busy hours as a forced grin, please step through very quickly, kind of thing. To be clear, our front porch goes to a stairway that leads right through their seating area. It's the quickest way out of our place.
2. Before we moved in, they had pretty much taken over our porch. Our porch was cluttered with their aesthetic gardening stuff, and we had to ask them  \(through our landlord\) to remove their stuff. After this was done, they made several clear and kind of passive aggressive suggestions that if we didn't keep the porch pretty they'd be upset with us.
3. In general there's a boundary issue here. Waiters and restaurant patrons will come up to our porch to take photos \(it's pretty\), move things around \(forgetting that it's not theres\), and so on. It's very easy to see through our windows, and we're just as worried for our own privacy as we are for some kid coming up here and seeing something their parents wouldn't want them to see.

In general there's not a great line of communication between the owners and us. I'm a pretty anxious and somewhat conflict adverse person, so I'm seeking advice here. How would you suggest I open up a dialogue? What's a thoughtful way to request they stop smoking outside?",25Apr2018,1

So my manager messaged HR for the first time in July to try to reissue me one and apparently they did but when they send it, it does take 2 weeks so I waited til beginning of September and nothing.Now one of my manager did not deposit his cheque and his car got broken into so the cheque got stolen. So what happen was he messaged HR again in October to get his cheque replaced, he received it two weeks later close to end of October and assumed I received mine so I followed up and asked again in December where is my cheque? 

Going forward to 2018 of January, they said I should get it for sure first week of Febuary, if not, end of Feb so being patient I waited til end of March and still nothing. This time apparently they did try to send it to our store but nothing. It is end of April now and just yesterday my manager explained I should probably sue the place or ask them to compensate me more.

Now being a patient person, I kind of had it up to here with this place. 7 of the 10 people that travelled with me no longer even work here cause they found something better.

What do you guys recommend? Thank you kindly.",25Apr2018,3

155,"So, last year around this time, I was drinking and smoking a lot, and psychotic. I spent most of my time playing guitar in a parking lot thinking that cars could talk to me.

I got sober and moved out of my parents house, and now I'm living in a cheap apartment room. It's unbelievably cheap here. The only drawback is that my roommate tends to be controlling.

Here's the thing, I'm not really psychotic anymore, but still mentally off. Social setting scare me and they didn't used to. I haven't been able to hold a steady job in 2 years, but as time goes by everything keeps getting better. I live off of social security only about 700 dollars, rent is 500 including utilities and that leaves me with 150 dollars for the rest of the month, plus food stamps.

So that's what I have to work with right now. I need to get a decent job somehow, and one that I can keep. I have such a hard time focusing that it has to be something engaging.

So where do I go from here. I'm totally alone, all by myself, mentally ill, willing to work, but need to find a job I can hold.",25Apr2018,1
156,"I wasn't sure where to post this; I don't know if /r/fitness is the best place since I'm not necessarily trying to get ~swole~ or anything like that. Ultimately, I just want to be ""healthy"" and live a long life. Ideally. 

I used to eat a lot more, but in the past six months, my appetite has greatly decreased. Maybe it's because I'm more distracted, I don't know. I have a lot more going on in my life now. Good things. I eat three meals a day and usually a snack or two. But they're generally pretty small. 

What I usually eat in a day is something like this: a smoothie or some oatmeal(plain, and I add honey and fruit to it) for breakfast, then soup(homemade) or a sandwich(usually peanut butter) for lunch with fruit, then in the afternoon I have some fruit and maybe some nuts, and for dinner I have something like pasta with shrimp and vegetables. I don't eat dairy much because it makes me feel really sick; I had ice cream on Sunday and I still feel sick. 

To be honest(no point in being dishonest when asking for advice), there are definitely foods that I try to avoid and feel like I ""shouldn't"" eat, but that's because I know I won't feel good if I eat them. 

My body image is fine, I feel like I look great. I exercise a little bit but not much; I go on a 30 minute walk almost every day. But I can't do much more. I tried to do some 10 minute workout video today and I quit after the first 1 minute and 30 seconds. Then again, I wasn't able to do much more than walking before, either. In high school I failed the PE fitness test. :/

For numbers/stats and all, I'm 18 years old, and I'm 5'8."" I don't know how much I weigh, but I'm guessing around 115-120 lbs. I've always been skinny but in the past six months I've noticed that my close are a bit loose on me, though I don't feel like I've noticed any significant changes in my weight/outward appearance. However, my parents were concerned a couple of months ago, saying that I was looking a bit too thin lately. They haven't said anything since, though. 

Anyway, I'm not asking for *medical* advice, but I'm asking if I should be worried or if this is okay. I just read stuff online and get scared sometimes. There's so much information. I feel like if this were not okay, if I were actually malnourished, I'd be experiencing the symptoms but I'm not; no dizziness, no shortness of breath, chest pains, thin hair, etc. My hair's thick and my energy and mood's good.",25Apr2018,1
157,"Just this week I moved into a new place and found something interesting.

In some storage cubbies (it's a garage-turned-living space, a lot of stuff was left behind), I discovered an open envelope post marked 8th of February, sent from Germany, addressed to a specific celebrity I'll call H. H's filmography is 50+ movies and some very recognizable titles. It is not an English name but evidently this celebrity lived in the USA at some point because his mail came to my new residence in California.

Inside the envelope was a handwritten fan letter addressed to H, and also included 3 photos of H in various movie scenes. The letter seems really sweet and genuine, and eventually humbly concludes with ""can you sign my photos with personal dedication and send it back to me : ) ?""

This fan clearly thinks H lives at this address because it is perfectly written on the envelope. If I return to sender the letter will go all the way back to Germany, 2 months later, with a disappointing no response and probably the end of this fan's efforts of contacting H.

Is it fucked up if I autograph these photos on H's behalf and send them back to the fan? I feel like it's harmless and would make the fan happy...heh what do you guys think???

I have been on the board for 3 1/2 years and this was only my second time missing a meeting. Today I got an email (a week later) telling me that they held their annual meeting and the vice chair position was discussed. Another board member was voted in to the position unanimously. I was told that they value the views and experience I bring to the board meetings and they hope that the change of duties does not deter me from continuing on the board. 

I have absolutely no bruised ego here so if I stayed on I wouldn’t be doing so just to “rock the boat”.  But there is part of me that feels they showed a complete lack of respect in waiting so long to inform me of the vote and that a discussion took place without my presence, which CLEARLY was not a positive one towards me as they did not value the work I did and voted in someone who has been on the board for 2 years and has literally missed 1/2 of those meetings.

I really like her and want to change her cuz she is a little bad.. she almost got fired from work for no-show lol. She doesn’t hang with much guys and I’m not sure what to do... here’s Why.

Months ago she told me her best friend had feelings for her and bought her roses.. then she cut him off.. idk if that would happen to me but I took it as a sign.. recently her sister told me she really likes me but I ain’t kno what to do.. cuz ever since she said that I feel like she hasn’t been interested in me but then recently she gave me the 😍 on a snap swipe up..

My mom feels like we NEED to invite my aunt (her sister), uncle, 2 cousins, a cousin's wife and their child who live out of state. The issue is I NEVER TALK TO THESE PEOPLE. I've seen my aunt maybe twice in the last 5 years and my cousins once in the last 10 and my uncle...I don't even remember. And the last time I saw all but my uncle was a cousin's wedding in October. My mom is assuring me they won't show at mine since it's my 2nd wedding (They didn't come to my first) and because 2 other cousins are having out of town weddings that they may or may not go to. 

Needless to say we are not close. The issue is my family is kind of 'But faaaaaamily.' but they aren't expecting me to invite aunts and uncles on my dad's side I don't really know (BECAUSE AS INSANE AS MY DADS SIDE IS THEY KNOW WE'RE PRETTY MUCH STRANGERS!). My family is also known for getting easily offended. My cousin is getting married in Albuquerque (We all live in AZ) and my Gma can't go cuz money, but went to visit her dying friend Sarah friend in NY and now my uncle Ben doesn't want my Gma at my cousin's wedding cuz she can go to NY to see a dying friend, but not my cousins wedding. And the cherry on top, my uncle Ben had an affair with Sarah, who has now passed so...logic runs strong in my family. Cuz weddings and dying are the same thing. 

Anyway, I'm ok with offending people, my fiancee and I give no fucks lol, but I don't want my mom dealing with the drama so... My issue is I'm ok with taking the blame for not inviting them but my family is obviously petty af so my mom will get the drama. But do I invite them and hope they won't show? I care so much to the point that if they RSVP yes, I will cancel everything and get married at the courthouse. Neither my fiancee or I want people at the wedding we don't know, blood relation or not.

Also to add my mom and this aunt, her sister, aren't close either. This aunt has lived apart from everyone for easily 40 years with little communication. It's purely all about bullshit wedding protocol...

Is there a middle ground I'm not seeing? My mom is a sweetheart but cares too much what people think but I also don't want to drag her into drama...Help? And cost wise, my fiancee and I are planning to cover everything. My mom has helped (Of her own free will) with my dress, but that's it. So there's also not a money power play here.

She was being secretive and deleted the messages before I could read them. We fought and I finally got over it.

183,"TL;DR BELOW

I'm not really good at sharing my problems aloud, so I guess I'll start at the beginning. For a long while now, I've wanted to make movies. Ever since one school project forever ago, I've loved telling stories through the medium of film. About a year ago, I decided to make a movie. I had a great idea, it intrigued a lot of people, got them excited, and in a few months a lot of people wanted to help.

At this point, I was confident. I knew it could happen, now I wanted to make sure I did my best. I reached out to an old friend of mine. In the past we've had a falling out for reasons not really important here, but I knew he had an interest in film. So I pitched him the idea, he loved it, and I brought him on. 

For awhile things were good. The script was coming along nicely, getting to a good point structurally. I liked it, and I thought he did too for the most part. But as time went on i wasn't sure that was the case. Every week there was some big change that he thought should be made, some element needing to be removed, the ending needing a change to suit the previous changes. For awhile I stuck to my guns, but eventually I caved. And really, I'm not sure why. I think at some point he really made me doubt myself. You see, he's very good at debating. Any point I made against his suggestions would be side stepped, and answered with a long winded rant. It was always ""I see what you mean, but as any good screen writer knows-"". Just to make it clear, he's not an expert screen writer. This is his first as it is mine. 

Eventually what ended up happening was two different versions of the script were made. My version, with quite a few of his major edits, and one he made in private that was entirely his making. Now if I had my way, we wouldn't be using his. There were things I liked, but there were major issues that I'll explain later. Unfortunately, that's not how it happened. Very suddenly, his version replaced mine. He brought in quite a few people only he knew, proclaimed ""experts"" in whatever he deemed important, and his version was the one they viewed as the official one. 

So I guess that brings us to now. I've lost all drive for my project, something I initially had such a passion for. What I'm working on now is a shell of its former self. So much was cutout that it's barely even a movie. There aren't any stakes, the characters I initially wrote are just cartoony caricatures, and any attempt I make to change it is shot down for one reason or another. Any deviation from what's written ""changes the tone too much"" or ""humanized such and such more than wed both like"". The dialogue is awful, the lines are clunky and awkward. We just did casting (little consultation towards me) and the actors stumble through half of the lines. I've been told in private that much of it just doesn't make sense. And with casting? I had to fight tooth and nail for two people that I know to be actually cast. He railed against it so vehemently that even the people I brought in had disagreed with him. 

Sorry for such a long post. Its nice to get it off my chest, but at this point I'm not sure what to do. When I started, I never thought this would be some great masterpiece. In fact, I thought it would kinda suck. But I knew I was going to do my best, and at least make something people would enjoy watching. I know now that's not what I'm working on. I'm not sure what options I have now. I can't take back control, it's too far out of my reach now. It was partly my fault, I should have put my foot down earlier. But it's too late for that now. My power over the project is miniscule, and at any moment he could probably boot me out and run off with it himself. On the other hand, I could probably do the same, despite how much of an asshole id feel like for doing so. I could probably just quietly bow out and let him ruin it, but I've spent so much time on this that I can't just ""give up"". I feel like I need to commit. Right now, I'm just stuck. Does anyone have any advice on what to do?

186,"Long story sort about 4 years ago my mother posted a picture on Facebook of my cousin and said “ who wants to take this handsome guy out.” My moms much younger friend responded to the post. 2 years ago they got married.  

My cousins now wife has a slightly younger sister. 2 years ago my cousin and the sisters mother was trying to set me up with her. I actually walked their mother down the isle of the wedding. Problem was she had a boyfriend at the time that no one liked. I politely just let it go away over time. Basically didn’t show a lot of interest because I didn’t want to get involved in that. Also had no idea if she was even interested or not. I can’t even remember if we even talked or not.  

Fast forward like a year later. At this point in time her boyfriend and her had been broken up. My cousin once again volunteered to give me her number. He offered in front of his wife ( the sister). She didn’t seem to care. I danced around the subject yet again.

Fast forward once again to the present day. I was considering trying online dating. Started making a profile. Haven’t typed anything out though and have no pictures. As it so happens to be I match with this girl and now I’m kind of interested but not sure if she would be or ever was. We haven’t even seen each other in over 2 years. 

The time has passed to message her on the dating site and there site doesn’t really work like that anyways. In about a month we will be attending the same baptism for my cousins new born twins. 

My question is should I ask my cousin about her and get her number and just randomly text her or should I wait till the baptism and try to talk to her there and then maybe get a number from him or possibly even her? I guess it just feels weird to randomly text her when I’m not sure what she even thinks about it. Probably doesn’t even remember me. ",25Apr2018,2

189,"I'm a 25 y/o dude still living with my mom.

My dad died in my early teen years (12-13) and since then I've basically been the ""man of the household"". Now that I'm older and my mother has gotten some serious health issues, that feels more evident than ever.

I basically pay all monthly expenses so we can keep living in our house. My mother can't work anymore and wouldn't be able to support herself if I left.

I feel trapped because of this. Deep down I know that what I'm doing (staying with my mom to support her both emotionally and financially) is the right thing to do but the ever present questions of:

- ""Do you still life with your mom?""
- ""Don't you want your own house by now?""
- ""How long are you going to stay there?"" 

from friends and co-workers are seriously breaking my self-esteem. 

The questions they ask and the way they can't just accept a ""yes I still life with my mom"" make it seem like I'm doing something extremely weird and I can't be bothered constantly explaining the ""broken"" state of my family.

I want to think of what I'm doing as noble and just: Taking care of the person who has taken care of me my whole life and making sure she can stay in the environment she wants to be in. But people around me make it seem like it's super weird.

I honestly don't know what I'm asking for. Does anyone have any advice on my situation? Whether that be changing my life or just finding a way to cope with it. Help would be much appreciated.",25Apr2018,2

TLDR at bottom

Backstory:
Here's me. 19 years old. I've had a 2 year relationship with a girl (of my own age). But sadly we separated about a year ago. During the relationship i've grown into the family so much that even after the separation, the grandparents still occasionally ask me over for a tea. The whole family still loves me and I still see them about once a week.
Part of me thinks the reason why they do is because her new boyfriend is a drug addict with a horrible personality and taking her with him. The family hardly has any contact with her.

Story:
The family also has another son an daughter. The son being 16yo, and being one of my best friends. And the daughter 14yo. I can get along with her really good as well. We FaceTime almost daily. She shares her life with me and trusts me more than her parents (there's some issues with the parents).
She's also sharing with me her concerns about her female time of the month, and also talking about stuff that clearly states she's getting in puberty and liking boys.
A few days ago though, she tells me she's never really kissed someone. And she wanted to learn. She asked if I would help/teach her. So I tried explaining, but she wanted practice.
I told her it would be In her best interest to have that experience with her future boyfriend. But she Insisted in having practice so she doesn't embarrass herself when it comes to it.
I told her I would be open to help her but that I'm not sure if that's the best thing to do.

To be honest with y'all redditors, I would gladly help her even if she wants physical practice. And let it be duly noted that there's no sexual intention from both sides.
But the thing is, i'm mainly concerned about the moral/legal issues that this will carry. A 19yo making out with a 14yo.
 
My opinion about it might be twisted as I know her for 3 years and we both know there's no feelings to it. But the moral issues with a 19yo making out with a 14yo is wrong in all possible ways. And afraid for what happens if there's legal action (if someone even ever finds out).


TLDR:
what do you guys think about a 19yo kissing a 14yo because she asked for practice in a non sexual/feelings way, having known each other for 3 years already.",25Apr2018,0
201,"In short, every time I interact with a close friend of mine, I feel like a burden, or that I should be extremely grateful that they chose to contact/spend time with me. And then when they do, I feel so guilty for taking up their time, and feel as if I am in their debt.

I don't have this problem with anyone else. I'm not entirely sure why it feels like this with this particular friend, but I think it has a lot to do with my complete lack of self esteem, and the fact that I hold them in very high regard. 

I'm thinking I should take a break from this friendship, because everytime we see eachother it triggers every negative feeling I have - and just spend time working on myself. We have been friends for 12 years and speak and see eachother on a regular basis, so I don't know whether to discuss this with them or just quietly disappear. The sad thing is, I am currently thinking it wouldn't affect them at all and be largely to my benefit, but I also know that I don't like it when people ghost me without any explanation.

205,"Ok so, 8 years ago my jerk of a bio dad chose drugs over his child. Long story short, he didn’t tell the rest of the family he was giving up his rights, and after he threw a fit in the court house, the court ordered a no contact order. That means I wasn’t able to see any of that side of the family from the age of 9, and well it’s still in effect until I’m 18. I’m 17, will be 18 in November. 

So let me give you a little backstory. This woman is not just a grandmother, her home was like a second home on the weekends, since my dad lived with her on and off, and the times he wasn’t living there she refused to let me go to a crack house. 

Basically she cooked for me, bought clothes and toys for me, took me on vacations, gave me a bedroom in her house (when she could. Sometimes my dad would have one of the 4 and my second cousin would be out of prison occupying the other), and like I said she took care of me like I was her own kid on the weekends, and not like a grandchild. Of course I had a loving set of parents in my mom’s house, but they took care of me during the week. This woman was 74 years old, still worked her office job at the state, and was still able to keep up with a small child. 

The reason she did this was because of the death of my dad’s sister. At the age of 16 my grandmother was supposed to pick her up from softball practice, but was running late. My aunt decided to call her and tell her it was fine that she was going home with a friend. That night, the car she was in swerved in the path of an on coming coal truck killing her instantly. My aunt usually sat in the backseat of the car, and when the first responders told my grandmother the girl in the back was fine, she was relieved. Turns out my aunt was in the front. 

She pinned my aunt’s death on herself for years. When I came along, she told my mom that I gave her something to live for. That I helped her get past my aunt’s passing. Now that I look back on it, she did a lot of things differently because of that accident. For one, she refused to let me sit in the front seat of her car, and stressed car safety. There was a time when she would dress me in my aunt’s clothes, and the joy that was on her face when she ran her fingers through my curly hair that resembled my aunt’s. Even though we didn’t look a thing a like, she still insisted I was just like my aunt. She wanted me to join basketball and softball so bad. Which I did join softball later on, but she doesn’t know because of the no contact order. She gave me my aunt’s old room, the closet still filled with clothes untouched from the day she died, and blankets on the bed she told me were very special. Looking back on it, a lot of my toys were my aunt’s old ones, and I now understand why she threatened to whip the neighbor boy, after he said he was going to break my Barbie. 

Anyway, she’s 82 now, and not getting any younger. She’s still up and running around and doing stuff like she was 8 years ago, but time is an evil thing. Should I contact her? I mean, I do love her, and her birthday was last week. ",25Apr2018,97

210,"-Throwaway account-

For most of my life I’ve been super introverted. This is due in part to having had a really bad lazy eye that I was extremely self-conscious about (so obvious it’s painful). Cameras were my enemy. Picture day was my worst nightmare. I’d literally have a breakdown the morning before getting my picture taken. 

I went through high school pretty miserable and made almost literally no friends (switched schools often too). Basically, I focused on my studies to avoid social interaction.

Bottom line is, I had picture anxiety in a world of social media where pictures are everything.

I have avoided social media...which is a terrible idea for someone of my generation (millennial).

I wrote much of the above in the past tense because recently I had surgery to correct my appearance. I have no excuse for being asocial anymore. The old habits stuck strong, but I really want to change.

Presently, I have a few social media accounts but with no posts and nobody added. I start college next year and need to network. I can imagine it would be very embarrassing it would be to explain to my future peers that I’m new to social media. They all use it! Will they judge me or not trust me because I have no past credibility?

How do I start? Completely overwhelmed right now.

I apologize if I sound whiny; this has been bothering me for months now. Advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks!

211,"Hi again. This is the second post on this topic, but I really need some more advice.

I have a few regrets about my teenage years \(all the way to 23\). Because of my family and my situation, I was always very miserable, sad, and never could enjoy my carefree years. I had trouble because of this in getting a relationship, going out and stuff like that. I got a job in college so I could travel and do some things, but even then I couldn't, because I had to support my family. I hate the fact that they were self sufficient about this and didn't feel the need to earn their money, because I had enough for us to live, but never enough to do what I wanted...

I had a very hard time because of them and the problems that they caused, and they didn't actually cared that I was miserable and always so depressed. I tried so many times to talk to them, but they simply ignored me, or said something like ""You are never pleased with what I do for you"", and they just assumed that it will pass and I'll always be over it. And it really got to me, and I had some really dark thoughts growing up \(on the verge of depression and stuff like that\), and I still feel a sorrow, deep down somewhere.

So when I was young, I couldn't enjoy myself and was always depressed because of them \(I'm not going to go into details, but it was tough, and it really took a toll on me\). I hoped that those things will go away, and there will be a time when I would be carefree and live without thinking about everything, and supporting them. But now I'm 24 and they still do this to me. I know that sooner or later I'm going to have my own family and the struggles that come along, and I just wanted to live a little before this. 

Bottom line is that I have this feeling that I have missed out on some aspects of my young years. I knew that if things were a little different, and if there was at least somebody in my family that understood me and helped me when I needed the most \(and I really did needed help\), things could have been so much better.

At 23 I finally found a girl, a great girl that I love, and I always thought that when this will happen, I'll forget about these things and I'll finally be happy. But I'm actually very concerned that my frustrations will make me lose her, and I feel like I can't enjoy our great times together because of this. 

I really don't know what to do, and I really appreciate any piece of advice that I get. Thank you!",25Apr2018,2

Aside from a single detective we met purely through happenstance, every form of law enforcement or federal authority has been completely useless. Nobody even wanted to *talk* to her, they just kept sending her between different police departments, until I finally had to put my foot down and *make* them do their jobs.

My dad was a cop, so I've always had an enormous respect for anyone who pursued anything related, but this experience has completely flipped my perception.

221,"[28 F] ~~ Emotional Abuse Trigger Warning

Hey everyone, so I moved from the States to Europe last year.  I got married a few days before we made our permanent move.  E, my Maid of Honor, has always been there for me during every twist and turn.  

The problem is...since I moved (about nine months ago), our friendship has turned very one sided.  The only thing we talk about is herself. The only things she knows about me is limited to what I post on social media.  

She is/was dating this awful guy.  He is a drug dealer, manipulative, and emotionally abusive towards her.  They have been broken up since November (but really who knows) and still see each other every week.  Every morning when she wakes up, she texts me about problems they’re having.  I send her really good, thoughtful advice. I really mean I am sending her PARAGRAPHS.  Tt’s always followed up with, “did I do anything wrong?” Or “Am I the problem?” And such.  I always reassure her in lengthy texts that she did nothing wrong and this is not her fault.

She won’t reach out to me for a week or two, and then comes back and tells me they’re hanging out again and she didn’t want me to know.  She does heavy drugs only with him.  It’s always the same complaints.  He is a textbook narcissist/manipulator/idk the term.  He treats her horribly and then apologized profusely and begs to be back in her life.  He calls her off burner phones and just shows up at her house (allegedly).

Since September, no matter how long she ignores me, I ALWAYS send her pages of advice.  I am always supportive and I never shame her for going back to him.  She’s a cute girl and she’s so smart with a good job and I tell her she deserves someone so much better.

I’m starting to get exhausted. If I bring something up about me, she tells me, “you’re fine,” and “you’ll do great,” and “don’t worry about it.  I truly don’t think she cares about what’s going on in my life.  Every time we text, she Has the same problems.  I feel like a broken record. she always ignores my advice, goes back to him, and comes back to me crying help.  I am negative all the time because we will talk about it all day long if I let her and frustrated because she doesn’t listen to me. 

I finally snapped yesterday.  She ignored me all weekend.  She told me he called her Friday after a drug binge and demanded to come over so she let him and they spent the weekend together drinking.  When he left, he told her he had enough of her.  Her two other friends were there.  I told her: “Were they okay with it when he said that to you?  I would have never let him in if I was there.  If you truly want him out of your life, and I hope you do, the next time he calls you off a burner phone or shows up at your house, you need to tell him you’re going to file a restraining order...and then file one.  I’m really not sure what else to say at this point.”

She hasn’t responded and I don’t expect her to.  I think she low-key thrives on the drama; she always has,

I’m not sure if I have a specific question apart form does anyone have any advice in dealing with a situation like this?  I live across the world so I can’t just see her.  I’m sick of being her therapist, giving her lengthy advice only to be ignored.  I want to just tell her next time, “ya, this is why I think a restraining order is a good idea,” (not that casual but you know what I mean).  I know people will only change when they want to change but I feel so bad for just wanting to give up.  Is there anything else I can do?  If she never gets back to me, do I just let the friendship fizzle out?

TLDR: Long distance friend in emotionally abusive relationship cycle for &gt; 6 months.  Only texts me when it’s related to him.  Has no interest in my life.  Trying so hard to give her good, long advice which she always ignores and go back to him.  I am feeling like a broken record/pseudo therapist.  I constantly find myself negative and frustrated due to conversations with her.  Finally, told her to file a restraining order and I didn’t know what to say.  How much is too much?  Am I a terrible friend for wanting to give up?",25Apr2018,1

226,"A short back story. I'm 22 now, dealing with a former abusive mother, who is also hooked on drugs, and a suicidal father who emails me suicide notes every two weeks.

I've been moved out for about 2 years now (not counting all the years my mom kicked me out) and still have to deal with their shit.

My parents are divorced, but still two peas in a pod.

My mom calls me everyday to scream in my ear about her new boyfriend and her drug induced paranoia that her neighbor and her boyfriend are hacking her phone and trying to kill her. I've tried in the past to get her help but she's already been released from a mental institution twice and hit me last time I called an ambulance for her (about a year ago). And if I don't answer the phone, she leaves strange voice mails that can range from threatening me, threatening her life or just flat out telling me I'm a piece of shit for not answering. 

My dad on the other hand just plain wants to die and constantly reminds me of it. He had a doctors appointment two days ago and emailed me about it, but adding to the end ""just want you to know, I will die during this"" for no reason. He was just fine after.

Along with that he also thinks the fbi is stalking him and wearing invisibility cloaks. He's even gone so far as to send me pictures of his home, circle these ""fbi members"" in red and tell me they're there. There is never anything there.

To this day I want to give up on my parents and try to live peacefully, but I feel guilty in the end and most of this has resorted me to alcoholism just to get by. I need a new plan, though. I don't want to end up like them. That's why I'm here, asking you guys now, seeking some kind of advice or motivation of what to do. I know I probably need loads of therapy or something, but it's just starting to feel weird in everyday life. I just wanted a normal adult life, and I thought moving out would solve my problems. Instead I just feel more responsible for my parents. 

I would love to hear stories and simular experiences if given the chance.",25Apr2018,6
227,"To this day I still think about how creepy my actions were. And I still beat myself up about it.

When I was in 7th grade I had a huge crush on this girl in my school. I decided that I was going to email her online. because I didn't know how creepy it was that some random kid found her email and then used it to message her (I found it on the school students website  after a bit of digging). So I emailed her a few times and eventually her dad emailed me and asked me to stop.

A year later in class she talked to me about my pet chickens which i rudely responded to with basically a ""no shit Sherlock"" answer. I felt so horrible that i would even talk like that to my crush. after that the talking never really happened again.

I still feel like a massive creeper and idiot all now in year 11. I cannot face her. And I hate myself. My social skills are really horrible and I just want to apologise for everything I had said to her. It has been on my mind for all these years. But I just cant do it because I still have a crush on her and I get a knot in my stomach whenever i see her. I also feel like I'm not worthy of talking to her since she is really attractive to me, pleasant spoken, sporty and last time I heard about them her grades were great. Where as I'm Chubby, lazy, a smart ass, average school-wise and a gamer who doesn't play sport. She is the a complete opposite to me and better in every way.

What do I do? do I forget about it and feel like shit for the rest of my life, or work up the balls to say I'm sorry after all this time?",25Apr2018,2
228,"Long story short: I put a lot of emotional baggage on my friend nearly a year ago in the summer. But that was after I confessed to her, I was really afraid that she would want nothing to deal with me but she acted very cool so I opened up. I told her a lot about the thoughts I was having, and though she was supportive, I continued for a month after that and asked her very morbid questions (i.e How would you feel if I died?). I then asked her why she rejected me, and three days later, I told her about my suicide attempt (though it wasn't about her but it looked that way). 

It's been eight months. I stopped confiding to her about my depression in August and I took her advice the moment that school came back. I apologized to her and she said ""Don't be sorry for anything I understand"" but looking back, I apologized for the wrong things. I should have said that I'm sorry for dumping all that on her, and for if I ever manipulated her. But since September, I've been talking to her as I do with any of my other friends. We talk about our mutual interests, life, and school -- and she's opened up to me about her past and her insecurities. She talks about her family often but I never give mines (because it's the reason why I tried to kill myself). The most we talked was in winter, and we talked for nearly two days.

But it's not anywhere near what it is now. We're both college students and I'm very busy with school so I haven't talked to her in a week or two.

But recently, I felt a lot of guilt because it looked like I tried to manipulate her into liking me, and because I felt like my apology didn't hold value at all or it didn't feel right. One part of me wants to fully apologize for the things I wanted to apologize for but the other half wants to just leave it in the past and not bring it up ever again.

I say this because she likes the idea of hanging out with me, and binging some series. How do I overcome feeling this way? ",25Apr2018,2
229,"I have a gas problem in my stomach, and I think bread has caused it for all this time. Here is my diet:

11:40 Two slices of bread with strawberry jam 

16:00 Dinner, this can be anything 

21:30 One slice of bread with slices of banana on 

Basically the problem is that I get a lot of gas in my stomach and when I hold my fart in, it causes a loud ""explosion"" inside my stomach/ass. I have already went to the doctor and he told me to cut out certain types of food, but now time is up.

Problem is, I have a math mock exam TOMMOROW. Tommorow, I will sit still for 5 hours exactly without being able to go to the bathroom. For the last 4 months, I have eaten nothing but this exact diet from mondays till fridays every single week, in the hope of curing my gas problem. I still have it to this date. Though I don't know if I should stop eating bread, because I don't know what else I should eat. I don't know if I should actually stop eating bread, as eating something else could fuck up my stomach for tommorow during the dead silent time I have to take the test.

233,"Hey everyone 

I turn eighteen this year, which I'm looking forward to quite a bit.  I have a good relationship with my grandparents, they're both 60 so they're still quite young.  
My gran spoke last year of wanting to take me to NYC for my 18th as they frequently travel to America.  I agreed, but not much more was said about it and I was okay with this as they have done this in the past.  They planned a two month long trip to Florida for myself, both my parents and my uncle and his girlfriend but it never came to anything even though they told us it'd been booked.  
They asked me where I'd like to go in America if I had the choice and I said New Orleans because of the music and the food culture.  I've wanted to travel to New Orleans for quite a while too.  
Then they tell me last week that they, themselves are going to NOLA a day before my eighteenth.  They never had an interest in going here until I said and to be frank, I'm quite hurt.  

I was really looking forward to seeing them on my birthday but they're going away for two weeks.  I just find this incredibly strange and rude that they've chosen to go away on the 2nd when my birthday is on the 3rd.  I've spoken to many people about this and everyone I've asked finds it strange because they were 'really wanting to take me away for my birthday'.  

I'm hurt but I'm not fussed, I still have plans with better people.  I just find it odd, and I want to see if anyone else feels the same.  

EDIT: I have indeed spoken to both of my parents, as well as my uncle regarding this and all of them are pretty annoyed about the situation.  I've considered speaking to my grandparents about it as I'm just wondering why they've done this.  I feel like I'm genuinely overreacting and overthinking this.  ",25Apr2018,10

1. A close friend says something perosnal about me that i dont like and i lash out i felt bad afterwards

2. A friends go out wothout inviting me. I say nothing and dont make a big deal out of it it just hurts in the inside

It seems to take me months or years to get over things that others have let go of (or at least gotten under control in weeks). For example I broke a rule at work (misunderstood it but they think I just wasn't being attentive) and now I'm basically waiting to find out if I still have a job or not, though it seems unlikely because they weren't fond of my work to begin with. I keep trying to brace myself for being fired once again and getting in the ""moving on"" mind set, but when I do I just feel like I'm walking into a wall. I don't WANT to move on I don't WANT to begin again. I don't want to turn anything else into fucking lemonade.

236,"My wife had recently come back from a week long business trip. Before this trip i trusted her with everything and she has done nothing to make believe she wants out of our marriage or splitting up.

However during her trip I had a dream that when I picked her she told me that she wanted to leave and go our separate ways. 

I go to pick her up at the airport and was greeting with hugs and kisses, but when I got to the car my heart sank like ""uh-oh... this is it"" I started to get real quiet and she could sense something is off.  We try to go about our usual post trip conversation and she tell me ""I met a co-worker that i developed a crush on""  Now this is completely normal for us. We are pretty open to saying which parent from daycare we think is the cutest and so say this type of thing all the time. It has never bothered me before But the combination of my dream and this sentence took me even deeper. Any other day I would have laughed and asked her What she liked about him.

Anywho we were able to talk it out for the most part and we are almost to where we were before. Even though she has been faithful and has never done anything to jeopardise our marriage, I am having a real hard time getting this pit out of my stomach. My mind is racing back and forth between she going to cheat on me and she is going to leave even though there is absolutley ZERO evidence that she wants either. Can someone help me get it out?

237,"I'm a freshman at a university in the United States. I'm taking a class required for my major and I have a very difficult professor. I currently have a C in the class and an A- in the lab portion. Last semester I made Dean's List, so I am a good student, but this class just sucks. Besides the teaching issues, I noticed something lately; the professor made multiple promises on his class syllabus that he never followed up on. This includes; 

""You will be assigned to a quiz group on the first day of class. Your quiz group may be changed during the course of the semester. Quizzes will be held during the scheduled lecture time. Quizzes will be taken individually first, then as a group unless otherwise stated."" 

""Should the average grade of any exam fall below 74%, the class average will be adjusted to no less than 74%, and all other grades will be scaled to the new curve.""

""Attendance will be taken every day and attendance points will be given based on the number of days you are present in class.""

All three of those are listed on his syllabus and all three of those he never followed up on, commented on or made any effort to honor his words. Now, I don't know the class average grade on any assignments although I'm about 98% positive there are at least one or two quizzes out there that have an average way lower than 74%. One quiz I scored a 2/10 on, and my two friends scored very similarly, and so did a multitude of people they talked to. Quizzes were never ever taken in groups, and we were never even assigned groups and my professor never addressed that he said there'd be quiz groups. Additionally, attendance was never taken once, I have no attendance point in the grade book and will not be given any points for attendance. 

Is this something I can report to an administer? Is this worth reporting and is something likely to happen? Or would it just be futile and pointless? If I report it should I talk to the Dean's? A department head, or somebody else? Or should I just forget about it?

244,"[26F] My best friend (maid of honor in my wedding) and I live in separate countries.  She is in a relationship with a textbook narcissist, drug dealer who is emotionally manipulative and abusive.

Since September, we have been stuck in this cycle where she ignores me for a period of time, reaches out to tell me she was with him and she didn’t want me to know, complains about the same things he says/does, I gave her good lengthy advice (literally paragraphs upon paragraphs if we’re texting), she asks me follow up questions, “is it me? What did I do?” Give her more advice, she ignores me to get back with him, and so the cycle repeats itself.

I’m emotionally exhausted.  I’m negative all the time because it’s all she wants to talk about it all day.  She responds to texts about me with short answers “that’s great” or “don’t worry about it” and ignores anything else. If I change the subject to something else, she brings it back around to him.  I’m frustrated because she doesn’t care about my life and I’m not a therapist (she sees a real one) but she expects me to act like one for her and then ignores whatever I say anyways.  I finally got frustrated and told her I didn’t know what to say anymore and she should file a restraining order if she really wants him out and he’s finding ways to contact her and show up at her house.  She didn’t respond.

I’ve had enough with our one-sided friendship.  I know people only change if and when they want to but I don’t want to be insensitive to her situation.  How much is too much?

246,"All of my problems began in about August. I left my job I had been working at for 4 years to join the Air Force. While I was in training I sustained an injury and was sent home ultimately unemployed. This is early November. I called my previous boss and he very enthusiastically brought me back into the company with a different department but still working within the same company. I was repeatedly told that I had a position with regular hours and in December, I reached out to my bank to get a car loan. The car was 6499. The bank agreed. I was making enough to be able to afford the car, however, in January the position got reclassified as seasonal and I was laid off yet again. I sunk all of my savings into my bills (including car payments) and ended up without a job for two months. I got a new job finally but it pays me substantially less. I need the car to get to work but it’s not tagged. Apparently the taxes and tags need to be paid at the DMV. It will cost 650 dollars with 25 dollar increase every month I am unable to pay it. I am making enough to pay the monthly price of the car, the insurance, my rent and other bills. I just cannot pay the extra for the tags and taxes. I’ve thought of taking out a loan to pay for it but I already have three credit cards and don’t believe I can get one. I’ve already received one ticket for it being expired and paying that took a pretty big hit into the little bit I had managed to save for the tags and taxes (i saved 150; ticket was 72). So I’m stuck. I don’t know what to do. I don’t think DMVs have payment plans. Once again, I can make the monthly payments on the car and my insurance just not the extra.  Thoughts?

255,"Sorry for the (over?)abundance of background. 

My dad yelled at me (and my mom and sister) constantly. Absolutely anything would set him off, and he would scream at us for minutes on end for anything from not washing the dishes right to my biology grade dropping from an A+ to an A. In elementary school, my self-esteem was in tatters; in middle school, I couldn't stand the sight of myself in a mirror; and by high school, I was seriously considering killing myself. I was constantly seeking validation and pleasure from outside sources because I never got any from my family. Video games and masturbation (first just thinking about girls, then to porn) were my go-to. My grades in high school and college weren't as good as they could have been because I blew off homework to just do stuff I wanted to do. I still don't feel good about myself, I occasionally have suicidal thoughts, but I've never made any plans to hurt myself (mostly because I'm scared and deeply averse to pain). I've never gotten any kind of firm diagnosis, but I self-identify with dysthymia (chronic, low-grade depression). The last time I tried therapy, it just became an echo chamber for my complaints about my relationship, which nearly ended as a result.

Now I recently turned 36. I have two kids, not married to their mom because she found out about the affair I was having to make myself get more validation (and maybe because I'm just a slut [I don't use that term to be degrading, although I am ashamed of how much I think about having sex with other people]). I've got a girlfriend with a teenage son, and I love them both. We've been together five years. In the last half a year or so, I started doing community theatre. I was in plays in high school and loved it, it might have seriously saved my life, but I was too scared and shy to try out in college. Then I saw a show that a friend directed, and it inspired me to try to get back into it. I've accepted four roles since August, and I'm thinking about trying to do it for real. 

The problem is that it's affecting my relationship and my family. I'm out practically every night rehearsing, I've gotta juggle my weekends with my kids around shows, I've missed a couple of things with my girlfriend's son. She doesn't want me to quit, but she also wants to spend time with me. And I want to spend time with her, too, though we're in a bit of a rut where we don't do much besides just sit at home in front of our phones/TV, and she's given up on initiating sex with me after I missed one too many subtle hints that she was in the mood.

I also still put off stuff I should be doing for video games. Our house is a mess, but all I want to do when I get home is play something. When she goes on a business trip, she comes home to find it even worse than she left it because I've spent the entire time on my computer. When I have downtime at work and should be preparing for upcoming projects, etc., I'm just browsing Reddit or emulating. When my kids come over, we usually never leave the house — I just let them play their Switch/3DS the entire time they're not eating or sleeping, even when my girlfriend suggests an activity. They are into some non-screen activities like Yu-Gi-Oh and board games, but it's mostly electronics.

So, that's a long explanation to say I'm a hedonist unmotivated by actual responsibilities to my home, my job and the important people in my life (I should also say I suffer serious FOMO when my younger and childless friends/colleagues hit the bar or a party because I still like going out drinking and I obviously should not). 

How do I break these habits? How do I stop living my life with the impulse control of a 9-year-old after guzzling a fistful of Pixy Stix? If there's a way I can pursue my dream of acting and still be a good family man, I want to find it, but maybe there isn't. I don't want to keep letting them all down, but I've tried to tackle these issues before only to end up breaking promises and falling back into my old routines. 

I appreciate your thoughts.",25Apr2018,2
256,"I am graduating from university two years early at the age of 20, and have a job lined up back home. I plan to take a year off until graduate school and work. I feel very disconnected to current friends and I have never really felt like I belong anywhere. I've realized this year that I don't really care for the people I have made friends with. I think we have grown apart, and are only friends because we have known each other for so long. Also, I don't feel like I'm in the same place as my friends. Some of them haven't even had their first job yet, gotten into their major, or moved out from home... not that there is anything wrong with that, but I just don't have anyone who can relate to me at the moment. I want to make some friends with people who are in a similar place that I am in, but I'm not sure how. I don't think that I will be making close friends at my future job, because it's very independent. I've never had a long-term group of friends, I usually just hang out with one or two friends. I would like to have a friend group though, and maybe I would have a sense of belonging.

I dont like the taste of those anymore and it became a robotic habit. And it getting pretty bad psychological side effect what saddenes me the most. Soo it not worth it to me anymore.

264,"Sorry, mobile poster here.

I don't know what to do, maybe some people here can offer help? I'll go down my list of what I see as the biggest problems, categorized.

Personal:

- Fibromyalgia. I suffer from it, it's awful. In fact this may very well be the root cause of everything here. I have tried a lot of things and the pharmaceuticals don't work, they made me much worse. I do get by taking an herbal called kratom. It helped so much that it allowed me to quit drinking alcohol and break free of opioid addiction (yay!) I still suffer pretty massive depression from it, and this condition has made me fear sleep. I tend to over sleep in a deep sleep, and cannot wake up no matter what I try. I feel like I do this because it's incredibly painful to wake up, and I don't want to. I fancy myself pretty tough, the pain doesn't get to me, it's really the depression and sleep issues that are killing me.

- Anxiety. This one's fun. I just have general anxiety, only made worse by my inability to act. I also have Trichotillomania (whee) that gets worse with anxiety. It's really sad because otherwise my skin is beautiful and I'm pretty good looking, that is if I could not fuck myself up all day.

- Failure at self care. Pretty self explanatory. Like I said I'm really pretty if I would only shower everyday, and bother doing my hair and putting on makeup. For some reason I just don't. It's not that I feel I can't, or refuse to. I just stagnate and marinate in apathy and self dislike. 

Environment:

Messy - This is depression related most likely. I've always been messy, but the depression makes it awful. And I'm not just being overdramatic here. The worst thing I ever did was this, ok so my apartment has no dishwasher. I didn't do my dishes for like 4 months. I was eating off paper plates. Once summer came around I noticed fruit flies, and of course there were little maggot things in all the dishes (barf). I threw everything away except for my favourite coffee mug. I still have not bought dishes. They give me anxiety and make me sad. I did get a nice pan for cooking, I also have two spoons and forks. I still don't keep up on those unless I need to use one.

Clothes - Oh god there's clothes everywhere. My closets are packed with nice hangers, which I don't use. The floor is my closet. I might do this because I dislike my wardrobe. But I can't afford good clothes, so meh.

No personal space - I have no personal space. I have a couch but I think that does more harm than good. I don't even have my own chair or desk. I have a bed, and a couch. My apartment is small and terrible. I wonder if this makes me feel alienated in my own place, which is why I have such contempt for it and everything in here.

Financial:

Broke - self explanatory, pretty sad. My husband works and makes enough to scrape by. I used to work as an artist, and was actually successful. I still have the supplies, I could just ""do it"" at any time, yet I slowly grew to dislike it. Again its not that I cant, or refuse to consciously. It's a mental block it seems, that seems to be a common theme with me.

The Good:

Not everything is bad. I have a husband who loves me and an awesome best friend. We have a car that works. I love my pets. And I write, which is the only thing that makes me happy, and really the only dream I still have. That's it though. I'm blessed to have what I do, and I know I should be grateful. However the stagnation and apathy and self dislike are hard, especially with having chronic pain on top.

Apologies for such a long post. It feels nice to even type it out. I'm sure people on this sub are filled with all kinds of advice. Even a small piece of advice on one of these individual problems would help. Thanks in advance for any advice offered. I really do want to be a better person. I can see it all so clearly, what I could be, and I'm sad that it's just out of reach.",25Apr2018,3
265,"I’m so excited!! I’ve been wanting to move to Atlanta for quite some time now. I keep making excuses to stay where I am. But I finally just decided to pick a date in October and go for it.

I’m trying to figure out if I want to sell most of my stuff and start fresh or take most of it. I don’t have much in terms of furniture.

266,"Around three weeks ago I applied for a security guard position at a private security company. I got an interview and eventually started going about the whole hiring process. I took all my tests and courses for my guard card and yesterday I got a call from the HR manager to go to the branch office at 8 AM for orientation. I brought all the paperwork I needed to bring and showed up at 8:00 AM, but the doors were locked. I saw another door was open so I went in and asked if the orientation had already started but they looked confused and said maybe it was at a Hotel nearby. I went to the hotel and asked if there were any orientations being held at the moment and she didn’t mention the company I was hired at. I’m currently parked outside of the branch office waiting until the HR manager shows up. I texted him letting him know about the whole situation but I’m not really sure what to do now.

My dad is under the impression that I will be staying forever (talks about plans 6 years away) and suggests that I go back to school.

271,"So ive been living with my dad and step mom since I was about for. My step mom has always had an issue with yelling and my parents being controlling/ overprotective. I constantly feel like their behavior is insane and not normal or healthy but they justify it as ""you just don't like rules"" or ""we are just trying to help/ correct you"" etc. 

My step mom is really obsessive about sex. When i was about 11 I remeber i was going to a boys and girls club event and i had two shirts one of which had stains the other looked fine.Naturally i chose the other one and when i came in my parents room my step mom asked me to lift my arms and then she yelled at me about how short it is and that i was wanting attention. She had even yelled at me on a family trip I had went on because i was wearing shorts and I bent down and tied my shoes in a certain way.She said again i was ""seeking attention"".She keeps accusing me of sneaking off and having sex with my boyfriend. Last summer on a trip she kept berating me about ""walking funny"" and even pulled me to the side and demanded to know why I was walking funny. She kept saying i was trying to do ""ungodly"" things at prom just because my boyfriend had wanted to drive.

Then she makes constant jabs and is obsessed about my apperance. Im a black female and I have natural hair. My hair texture os not ""conventionally"" attractive, even tho she let me go natural she keeps expecting my hair to be loose wavy curls,shit i don't have. She constantly tells me that ""white  people "" don't want my hair like that and that i wont get a job and thday as a mother she can't have mrw walking around like that. She always threatens to perm my hair. She had went on and on one day about how I'm not making enough effort in my apperance anymore and my boyfriend would want to keep me ugly so that other guys wouldn't look at me. She even takes a picture just to show me ""just how i look"".

She said it was disrespectful for me and my boyfriend to talk outside on the front porch. 
She had let one oid my cousins look through my phone one day just to see if i was having sex.
One day when she took my phone she had texted my boyfriend pretending to me and i didn't find out until i got it back. Apparently he had been in a car accident so she texted ""im soory boo r u okay"" it was weird. 

She has thrown mail at me a across the table in a rage and would jump on breaks in the middle of the street when yelling,calls me stupid/ dumbass saying how much i don't listen or how i have this ""demonic spirit"" in me. 

Whenever i discuss her yelling with my dad my dad says she is just trying to help. Sometimes she would have a talk with me about how she's a parent and she wouldn't yell if she didn't care and she knows i can't stand her because she's my step mom and other stuff. I told them how i feel unhappy here and i hate being yelled at for little stuff and they said i just don't like rules and i just don't like being corrected.  I feel lost oin what I feel because i feel like they constantly make light of it and middle me seem like a bratty teen.

274,"TL;DR There is a huge chance this child might not be mine and I am worried about how I might act towards it when it is born. 



So my SO and I already have 2 children, 1 each from previous relationships, and have been trying for a third. Low and behold last week, we got a positive pregnancy test! Happy days right? WRONG.

You see, my partner and I are polyamorous and as such we have a few others involved in our life. When we started trying for baby three (code named: Satan Spawn 3: the Rebirthening), we made it clear to all those involved about our new rules and boundaries, most about making sure to use condoms etc. Everyone was excited for us and agreed to them, a few of my SOs secondary and tetiary partners gave me a few tips to knock her up.

A couple weeks ago, my SO and I have dinner with another couple who were known swingers. One thing lead to another and we were all naked, drunk and stoned. He, the guy in the other relationship, gave my SO a creampie, clearly breaking the rules we set up. However in his defense, A) we didn't have dinner with the intent to fuck them, it just happened, and B) they were not aware of pur rules and boundaries.

We laughed it off as an accident because my SO was not in her fertile window. No harm no foul. Until the pregnancy test came back positive. Now there is a chance this child could be mine as we were fucking more than rabbits in heat, however according to our calculations, the date of conception seems to be around the time of the incident.

My SO still thinks its mine, scans and stuff are being done next week, but I am freaking out. I love my SO and I love our family, but this is making me worry as if this child is not mine, then I would be ultimately cuckolded if I stay and raise the kid, and I am afraid that I would see my failures to let the boundaries be known, and my failures to impregnate my So, my failures to stop someone else from doing it when I was in the same room, all these failures I will see staring back at me.

I don't want to leave her. I don't want to force her to get an abortion either as it is her body, and I respect thar. I just dont know what to do or what to say.

280,"My LDR boyfriend's parents are stingy about him abandoning them to see me. However, they don't treat him ideally. When I visited, they angrily call for him 24/7 to do tasks that they really shouldn't depend on him to do. If he doesn't come in 10 seconds, he gets in trouble. It almost felt like everytime we were alone they'd call, causing him to frantically get up and do what they needed. They even ignored him when he asked they tone it down infront of me. When he requested he and I leave the house to hang out with friends, they got irritated and said it was too much trouble. We had to deal with them for an unneccessary amount of bickering before we finally got permission. He avertted to online classes after his freshman year of college because he's too uncomfortable around people, yet he visited me this year as a junior and suddenly wanted to take real classes again. I'm 99.9% positive he's developed his abnormalities because his home isn't a healthy environment.

I stay up with him at night to talk, which has gotten a lot more personal and deep recently. We talk long hours, which messes with my school schedule the next morning. I've especially struggled with my math, as it's the first class I miss the next morning following our talks. My boyfriend got really emotional last night. He said he thinks he's trained himself to not have an opinion because that only makes his parents more upset. He said that being in a relationship with me has made him more self aware about how good my life is compared to his. He says it hurts him, knowing that he is missing out on something that is better. Meanwhile I had meant to tell him I needed help with my math (he would ha e been extremely savvy in mathematics), but he was dealing with so much pain that night, it was impossible to get that to work. My grades are failing because he is a growing burden.

This is why I offered he buy an apartment close to mine. He has about 3,000 dollars saved up from the job he just quit, and his online classes would still be 100% accessible. He knows living on his own would grant him a new life. I would motivate him in the right direction, and he would finally feel no pressure to make choices. He might even overcome his depression and social anxiety.

Now here's the thing: his parents are bound to suffer heart disease at any moment, as they are reaching their late 60's. The father already has self-made toxin in his legs which developed because he hasn't been active enough. The mother just visited the emergency room because her limbs stiffened too much. Nobody knows what day will be their last. I think my boyfriend needs to learn how to live indepentantly, but he feels trapped because he doesn't want to be away if they die.

TL;DR: Long Distance Boyfriend is almost done with college but he has underdeveloped behavior because his life at home is oppressive. It's affecting my life and my grades, so I want him to live by me. However his parents could die at any moment.

283,"TMI Alert. ;) 

I am a 28 year old female. I have intimacy issues with my husband. I am wondering where this is stemming from, and just listened to Amy Schumer speaking about grey area rape....
It honestly got me thinking about myself and these issues I've face.

My senior year of high school, I began talking to my first boyfriend. I was a virgin, had plans to stay a virgin for a long time, and was just fine with holding hands and light kissing. 
Within a week of dating (we are both 18) he started prodding for more...asking me if I'd masturbated, think about sex, you know....fill in the blanks. I was uncomfortable with thought of all of this, but there was a part of me that wanted to know more about this other life. 
By the second week, he knew that if he just could get the look of desire in my eyes, he could go further.  At that point, we were watching a movie in the back of my parents mini van, started heavily kissing, and he dry humped me to an orgasm. 
I FREAKED out, started crying, and was not okay with the situation. He was ""kind"" but said that he couldn't wait to tell his best friend that he made me orgasm without touching me. 

At this point, he kept asking and pushing me for more. I was obviously always  uncomfortable with wanting to do things, but he was persistent, and I didn't want to ""lose him"".  By week three, we we're pleasuring each other, with our hands. Then, he would ask for more, and then we began oral....then, he would ask for even more....and by month six, he had convinced me to at least do anal. ""It isn't sex!"", he would say. 
Of course, it hurt too bad...and I gave into vaginal penetration. 

A year later, I asked him about how he fell in ""like"" with me and he admitted (shamefully) that he knew I was a virgin, and that he wanted to just see how far he could get me to go. However, justified his actions by saying he fell in love. 

I think to my relationship with my husband, and it's been nothing but patience and love. When I say no, he respects it. 
But, I can't be intimate without him disrespecting me, in some way. 

By no means do I think I was grey area raped.....
But, man...I STRUGGLED after my first boyfriend and I broke up. I thought the way to get guys to love you was by blowing them, at any chance. It wasn't until my husband that I realized how broken my thoughts were on intimacy. 


So, Reddit. . . 
In light of the #metoo movement....am I being crazy? I felt taken advantage of, of course...but, was it more than innocent prodding. Should I be looking at this being a deeper issue that I should heal?

Along with the year, I didn't get into my dream school. I am losing money and will soon be an adult with no job. I am just trying my best to be happy and stuff. I am not trying to be sad this week but im just being beat down daily and daily and the only thing keeping me happy is my girlfriend. Even then, She is going everywhere during the summer with her family and I am just going to be home doing nothing but on the computer while my parents nag at me about not doing anything. 

I don't know what to do anymore with my life. It is all just coming down.

Anything I can do to not feel discourage? I feel like the worst has yet to come and I don't want to lose the only happy thing I have left. ",25Apr2018,2
286,It’s our first wedding anniversary next week. My husband and I have said we aren’t spending a lot of money but I’d like to get him something different and thoughtful. As we’ve been in a relationship for close to ten years most of the obvious gift ideas have been given on previous occasions! Any advice or ideas would be appreciated I’m running out of time! ,25Apr2018,1
287,"(Not in the U.S.)

My dad has a diploma in engineering and makes min. wage doing a white-collar job with, idk, 40 years of experience.

How much of it is circumstance? How much of it is bad luck? How much of it is incompetency? Lack of responsibility?

I'd like to know.

Growing up was really tough because we didn't have much money, but dad claimed he liked his job. He was fired a few times (maybe 3?), but that may? be because of economic downturns but I don't think he has a particularly strong work ethic either.

As a kid, my parents quarrelled *a lot* about money. It was terrible. I feel like even making a $1000 or $2000 more would have made things much, much better. ",25Apr2018,2
288,"Hey guys so a little back story, I’ve always had extremely vivid dreams that almost always have a beginning, middle, and end. I’ve had the weirdest dreams and have written a couple of them down (if any of you are interested in reading them just DM me) But recently they’ve gotten increasingly more vivid and quite a bit graphic. It usually involves me getting brutally raped. I don’t know why this is happening recently but I hate that it’s happening. I am used to a dark/ morbid theme to my dreams but the horrible nature of these recent dreams leaves me feeling anxious &amp; horrified in the morning.  
I also struggle with insomnia (trouble falling asleep but can stay asleep) and I don’t know if maybe these dreams are preventing me from falling asleep (subconsciously) out of fear? I guess I’m looking for some advice on falling asleep/ some help on how to prevent these wicked dreams. 
Edit: I am not trying to minimize anyone that has been sexually assaulted/ raped and I know that my dreams can’t compare to what so many people have gone through. I just want to get this figured out. If this post offends anyone please DM me and I’ll take it down. Thanks ",25Apr2018,2
289,"My S/O of 3 years suddenly confessed that he doesn’t know if he wants to be in a relationship anymore. He misses being single and wants to grow and become a better person. He can sometimes be negative, but the way I see it everyone has their flaws. I told him to do what’s best for him, and that I’m okay with growing and become our own people while still in a relationship. You can be your own person while still having a partner. So, he told me he’s not sure if he wants to break up or not. And last night after we cried and talked about all of this we end up cuddling and having sex. And this morning he keeps telling me he loves me and everything will be okay. He’s confusing me. He told me imperfect and he loves me yet wants to leave me? I don’t want to force or beg him to be with me. I want him to be with me because he loves me. I love him very dearly. He’s my happiness. I don’t want to give up on us. I’ve been happy, and this whole time i was under the impression he was happy too....we don’t fight often. Every now and then we will get a little annoyed at each other but we don’t have full blown screaming match’s often at all. 


IF we do break up, On top of all of this, he’s taking my car away. I’ve been paying him for his car for about 2 months so it can be mine. Well now he’s saying he’ll just refund me the money. And I’m the one getting kicked out because the house is his. Not mine. So no car, no house, all my family is in a different state and I’ll probably end up loosing my job because I don’t have transportation. 

I don’t know what to do. If he changes his mind on breaking up should I forgive and try again? He’s ruining my life. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I can’t even breathe. I’ve been crying my eyes out since last night. ",25Apr2018,1

I really hate not being able to relate to my straight friends and most of the world is straight and I feel like I don't belong.

Every time I watch straight porn I just don't find myself being into it that much. But I'm definitely bi.

296,"Hello,

I'm a 21 male, will be 22 by the end of the month. I am a virgin, and have never kissed anyone. I always had this fantasy of meeting ""the one"", you know, and living a movie romance with her. That belief did make me ignore a few opportunities to have relationships with people that were interested in me.

Simultaneously, I hold the belief that I don't deserve to be in a relationship with anyone, or have any kind of affection at all, because I feel that I am ""not good enough"" for that. So I am always making nonsensical lists of things that I have to do before I can think about relationships or sex, such as ""Well, I have to get that promotion first, maybe then I'll be good enough"", ""I should lose some weight first, maybe then..."" and so on.

So I have always actively feared and avoided relationships, romance and sex because of those 2 beliefs.

The rational part of my brain knows that those two beliefs are kind of bullshit. I know there isn't only one perfect match for any other person, and I kind of know that I am not necessarily so bad that I am unlovable. But despite understanding this, that is still how I feel.

Recently I have been thinking about ways that I could get over this, because I fell in love with an amazing, older person. I do realize that this person is way out of my league \(for real, this is not low self\-esteem or anything\) so I don't really consider it an option for me to actually be with her, she's more like an inspiration for me. BUT it made me realize that even if it were a possibility, my complete lack of experience in sexual things would make me really bad at a relationship with her, or with anyone else for that matter.

So my conclusion is that in order to be good enough for a relationship,  I should lose my virginity and get some practice first \(Now that I actually wrote this, it does sound really dumb kkk\). However that seems like an asshole thing to do, because it might mess with people's feelings and kind of uses some women as practice and other as the ""real thing"".

So I thought that seeing a professional \(that is not being abused by a pimp or forced into this profession\) that in no way cares about me might be the best way to do this. This way it's only business for her, no one get's hurt. \(And also I get to keep my belief that I am not good enough, because I know that I am just another customer for her\)

It still feels weird somehow. It makes sense to me, but it feels strange.  Am I a loser for being a virgin for those specific reasons? Would I be even more of a loser if I did this? Would this shatter my fears and make me realize that sex is not a big deal at all, and I shouldn't be so scared of it?

Would it be wrong?

Thank you for reading :\)",25Apr2018,5
298,"im 18 years old, me and my girlfriend just went through a nasty break up, she cheated on me multiple times, and while broken up in limbo i made out with a girl that she counts as ""cheating"" but thats besides the point, at a recent party, I ignored her, as I would walk by her friends and her she would say shit like ""thats fucking gross"" or ""what a piece of shit"" and stuff like that, it didnt get to me until we had to walk down some crowded stairs to get to where everyone else was, as she walked past me she said ""youre disgusting"" and i was drunk and had had enough of it and said ""fuck you"" then she exclaimed ""do you want me to hit you?"" and I said ""you're not going to hit me"" and by this point everyone was watching us, she beamed her fucking palm across my face very hard several times then proceeded to punch me in the stomach, in shock I yelled ""DID ANYONE JUST WITNESS *girlfriends name* ASSAULT ME"" and no one gave a fuck, im pretty popular and a lot of my ""friends"" both boy and girl saw it and didnt do anything, that being said i didnt expect somebody to jump in and start freaking out at her or fight her but for someone to say ""hey thats actually not cool"" would have made me feel so much better, she used to beat me a lot in our relationship and for her to embarrass me like that and do it in a social setting made me depressed as fuck, she had people coming up to her saying shit like ""im so proud of you, youre so strong"" and people laughing about it and my guy friends joking that I got ""beat up by a girl"" im not going to press charges, I dont want to ever talk to her again, but I dont know what to do, this isnt okay, and I dont just want to let it slide.",25Apr2018,2
299," I had a former friend visit 3-1/2 years ago (after the visit, we were no longer friends. Long story.). While here, he registered his car using my address. Also got car/health insurance using my address. After a month, I told him it was time to leave (I think he’d still be here if I hadn’t done so). I forwarded his mail to his mother’s home (he doesn’t have an address of his own) until a month ago, when I told him via a note enclosed with the most recent mail that I was going to be returning mail to sender in the future as I’d been patient enough. I assumed when it was time to renew his registration, that he would do so wherever he was living as that’s what he had done while here. But apparently the sweet low cost of Idaho’s car registration and attendant insurance was too much for him, since he not only continued to keep his car registered to my address, but had a NEW car registered using my address. Called DMV today to find out if there was anything I could do. They said the only thing I could do would be to file a report with the police, which would ultimately trigger the cancellation of his registration. So, people of Reddit, what would you do?

302,"I work at a coffee place. It’s horrendously understaffed (which could easily be changed—entirely the fault of the store) and since I’m the only full time employee that hasn’t been there a full year yet, they stick me with all the hard work and crappy shifts.

I wake up at 5:45 to get to a 9-hour shift where I’m on my feet all day, 5-6 days a week, and get absolutely no respect or help from my coworkers. By the time I get home I’m too exhausted and have lost all motivation to do things that actually interest me.

That’s just for context... So on Monday, I was told *20 minutes before opening* that I would have to keep running fresh pots of coffee all the way across the store all day for “free employee coffee day.” I told my supervisor how unhappy I was to find that out last minute and he had never seen me that stressed before... He promised it wouldn’t happen again. He even said that again last night.

Well today... again, I was told 20 minutes before opening that the *regional manager* for all of the stores in our area would be coming in for a huge inspection at 11. I begged my coworker (who was supposed to be at the coffee bar with me) for help, and she just said she was too busy cleaning things in the back.

I freaked out... I just ran to the bathroom and cried so hard I got sick. I’m not the strongest person in the world and to be hit with this twice in three days is horrible. I clocked out and hurriedly told another coworker I couldn’t stay.

I just got a call from the store manager saying that I should take tomorrow off and then on Friday come in for a meeting at 2:30. I have a medical diagnosis and asked my psychiatrist for a letter, which she said she’d give me. I plan on bringing that... I’m also positive my own supervisor and other coworkers would vouch for me. Since it’s extremely understaffed, it would be very hard to replace me (not to sound conceited!).

But will I still likely be fired? What are peoples’ thoughts on this? My head is still spinning and I just need to hear from someone, I have no one to talk to",25Apr2018,11
303,"Soooo ... in January I tried to hang myself and failed and spent a week in a psych hospital.  I also lost my job at a music academy.

Sometime in February I posted online asking for advice and mentioned how a family member abused me and my sister-in-law saw online and told my brother who told my parents. My parents and brother didn't believe me and denied anything ever happened.  I was also having a relationship with my professor (I am/was attending a shitty public university and trying for conservatory) and he stopped it and wouldn't fulfill his promises to me. Oh and this is the second man to do this to me. The other was when I was 16.

I also have BDD and OCD tendencies.  So I auditioned for conservatory and got rejected and can't try again until Fall. I did fine. I don't even understand what went wrong. I live with my parents and have no prospects at all. I'm not even a part of my own family and can never be now.  The only way I survive the days is by Ativan.

The only solution I can think of now is get a job and throw myself into OCD obsessions like weight and makeup to distract from feeling anything.

305,"Well, so it all started a little while ago. My group of friends (5 guys) got really close with another group (5 girls) in the past year. We all knew each other since we were kids, but we just never talked with each other but it was really easy and it's so fun to hang out with everyone. Anyways, I really like this girl in the group. I told my best friend that I like her (he is also in this group), but I also told him I probably wasn't going to do anything cause I didn't want to make it the group dynamic awkward or anything like that and of yeah, my fear of rejection, that probably played part too. 

Now, I know that the next part kind of seems petty and I probably should get over it but this is just how I feel. 

My best friend told me that he also likes this girl, and it felt like a brick being thrown at me. But, being stupid, I said yeah, go for it. I didn't think at the time I would go for it, and I thought he'd have a better chance than me, he's a lot more attractive, confident, funny, all that. I didnt realize the repercussions of my actions until later when he told other people and he started flirting and just think about them together. It feels like my heart is burning and my mind is going mad. 

I feel like I'm more mature than this and I don't even know why I'm feeling this way and I'm trying to be happy for the thing that is starting between them. I'm staying away and I'm trying not to talk about it, but the longer it's going on, the more upset I get. I cant tell anyone in the group cause then everyone would know and that would be really messy. I don't want to be petty and tell my friend to stop going out with her, especially since he asked me first before doing anything about it.

I didn’t want to pry or assume too much so I gave her a chance to explain, but basically she just said that he had a very rough childhood and he did something bad when he was 13 that led to him being locked away for 7 years. She goes on to act as though that was too harsh a punishment and as if his rough childhood justified his crime. I’m a rape and abuse survivor and when I was young, my first assault was from a 13 year old that was abused horribly by their father. She KNOWS this. I carry the weight and emotional scars with me from it every day. In my book, 7 years doesn’t even come close to making it right.

312,"(SERIOUS)

Im in such conflict right now and I want to be as open minded and as judgement-free as I can. This is very long but please I need your insight! I truly do. 

I was always told to look for pedophiles growing up. Wasn't allowed to be clingy towards male relatives. No wearing shorts around males. Etc etc. I was groomed and molested by a friends of my when I was 5, they were brothers ages 8-9. So I was always keen in things like these. My first bf.. I noticed he was weird but brushed it off. Until I saw him staring lustfully at his 7 year old cousin. It was prolonged too. I stared at him back.. Lile Wtf? Completely gave me a pedo vibe. Anyways we broke up a few months later. Second bf.. I known him at least two years before we began dating. He was always interested in me and I in him but never was given the chance until now. We are going for 1.5 years and counting . he even looked up engagement rings (and mixed kids to see what our kids would look like). A few times we have spoken about pedophilia and all sorts of it. He is against it and knows it is wrong and twisted. He said that people shouldn't be attracted to people under the age of 16 and it is normal for men to be attracted to young women. I was testing him and I said ""15 is ok too"" and he goes "" that's too low, below age of consent..."". We moved on from that. A few times we had talked about how parents sexualize their children and all of that and I asked him at some point if he was a pedo and he said no. He has always said no. Although he has a very dark humour.. Just throwing that out there. Recently i was on his laptop and I was about 5 pictures.. There's no age no name or tags just promiscuous and sexy pictures of girls which looks to be professionally taken. My concern was that they looked very young. Ranging ages 12-15. Yes, I know that there are women who are small and look literally 10 years old but I feel like that fact they looked so young should be enough not to save the pictures. It was only these ones mixed with a bunch of other porn pictures (grown looking people) 

1) three teens doing a handstands the beach
2) a young girl about 15-16 well developed (small boobs,slim but curvy). In a biking just shyly sitting down on a rail. 
3) you cant see her face. Slim, slight curves, it was just a picture of her back. Wearing bra and underwear.. Colourful,brightly colored
4) was a selfie. She looked 12-13. Braces not really smiling. Her breasts were exposed..
5) just looks 14 and not developed. No ass no breasts. Posing covering half of her face.

I did confront him about him. He was mad that i was nagging him. I asked him what was so attractive of the childish looks? He said ""how do they look like children? What makes you say that?"" he was irritated. He didn't speak to me and went outside to smoke. I followed him to talk about this. I asked him why he didn't realize those pictures looked suspect. If he was attracted to children. He shrugged his shoulders and said he is attracted to ""young females"".. We were young he is 19 im 21 so I said ""what young bc we are young, im a young female"" and nods in agreement. A few second if silence and I asked if he liked 13 year olds. Quickly he said yes but something tells me he was trying to piss me off. ""You're not saying that to piss me off are you bc this is serious"" and said no. I was angry but didn't let it show. I spike to him kindly asked him understandably. We talked and I again I asked him the same question and he said ""no,i was trying to piss you off bc you were pissing me off. Isn't that what you wanted to hear anyways?"". I stood in silence and went to walk away. He told me to come back.. And he hugged me. I told him i wanted those pictures deleted and he agreed. And he actually did. Things were back to normal. Until later that night, i still had a few questions. He is a very smart dude fir his age very insightful and intelligent. It didn't fit right that it didn't cross his mind that those pictures were weird. He ended up crying saying that i think he is a pedo and that ill leave him and he is trying to make me not believe that of him. So he was crying bc he believe that I believe he was a pedo and was going to leave him. I comforted him and said i dud t believe that but i had to make sure. I wasn't accusing. We made up. The next day i apologized and said he never gabe me a straightforward no only that its normal for men to be attracted to young adults. I know what that meant.. I wanted a straightforward answer. He eventually said that he think he isn't a pedo. ""You think or you know?"" "" i think"" ""why do you think?"" he said bc he was aroused. I told him to ask himself a few questions which I ended up asking up "" are you aroused by or get sexual urges at the sight of children""? "" no im not attracted to children"" ""what is you age limit"" "" he said 18"" ( which he did say the say before that its normal for men to be attracted to young adults 18-35). I told him he isn't a pedophile then. I asked what was it then that aroused you and he said might've been their small feet or small bodies in general as in petite and slim with curves. He sees me as slim and short framed. I have small boobs and hourglass shaped but slim. I look my age tho. The convo ended up with him saying that he is not perverted in that way. 

He is trying to cut back on porn. Believes its wrong and wants to eventually cut it off completely. I believe he isn't a pedophile or anything of that sort. I do believe that he got tired and needed a new stimulus. Kinda how a straight man who is obsessed with porn cant get off anymore of the same things and will look for something new to be able to get off and would watch gay porn. U think that's what happened here. I watch him around children and he pretty much ignores them... He ignores everyone actually lol i know when sees something he likes he often to sneak in looks (im far more observant than he is and I can read body languages very well) so I noticed quickly when he is attracted to someone and its always a female in their late teens or early 20s. 

I always feared that I might unknowingly marry a pedophile and I don't want to feel like im blinding myself and making excuses for him bc I love him. I love him to buts and out connection and relationship is very strong. What do you think and please be helpful. I don't believe he is a pedophile,im just a very anxious woman(neurotic) who over-thinks and over-analyzes everything and questions everything. My mind literally never stops questioning things..

316,"Okay so here’s the story:
In lesson we went into the public area I was hitch people can work on computers my friend (1) who was sitting to my left and my other friend (2) who was sitting to the left of (1) .
Fast forward towards the late part of the lesson (1) &amp; (2) notice a memory stick on top of their computer (they were sharing). 
We proceed to put it into the computer to see who’s memory stick it is. The memory stick is called “PUBLIC”. After looking through we just find photography pictures... low and behold we find a folder called “body” so (1) clicks on it and then we see the pictures. I obviously take a peek every now and then but trying to continue with my work because 1. I had a deadline 2. It wasn’t right considering we weren’t meant to see these obviously. Go towards the end of the lesson (1)&amp;(2) are still looking through almost all the pictures and decide to stop.
After stopping, (1) wants  to keep the memory stick (2) says take it however, I say hide it behind and collect it next lesson if it’s still there (I didn’t want to say hand it in because I knew they wouldn’t so hiding it then telling classmate first thing when I see them was my best plan to return it) . We do that leave as normal...
Next day I have a lesson with classmate. However, before lesson starts (1) is an idiot and says to class mate that he’s seen her nudes because he’s like that.... she comes into maths stressed out and I see that(was not aware of what (1) said until later today). After the lesson finishes I tell her that I found her friends memory stick with pictures of her and show her where to find it.

This has all been reported to the teachers however, I didn’t say (1) was planning to keep the memory stick

TL;DR: found nudes on a memory stick, was class mate’s .  She may think I copied them and is worried/upset possible angry I haven’t actually spoke to her.

So the question is: 

How do I get across that I am truly sorry and regret invading her privacy?
I know these situations are delicate and do not want to come across as if I’m doing some sort of damage control. But with no trust in place how to I get her to understand I am sorry.


A few things to note
I am very quiet and haven’t had a long convo outside of the class
I DID NOT COPY THE PICTURES (which I would like to make clear to her)
We weren’t on bad terms in fact I would say we were fine not friendship but not neutral... class mates is honestly the best description.
I am the only one out of 5(2 others came round as this was happening) that wants to apologise although I think someone else is as well.

Please let me know if anything isn’t clear.

331,"My sister works for a well-known, international airline checking in passengers and bags, working the executive lounge, and other positions that would be considered “low-level.”  

Recently the regional manager of this airline came around and met her for the first time. She said he was nice, and didn’t think much of it when he asked her where she lives. She told him, and the area is not really known for being at the top of the “hangout” list since it’s near the Bay Area and there are a ton of other, considerably more interesting places to visit elsewhere.  He replies, “you’ll have to show me around [her hometown] sometime.” Fine, just small talk, she assumed. 

Here’s where he gets weird. “Can I have your number so you can show me around then?” She feels the remark is a bit off, but doesn’t want to ruffle any feathers of someone so high up in the company, especially since she is looking for more hours. So she gives him her phone number. 

Twice now he has text her, asking her to “show him around” the area she lives. Both times were at what I would consider unprofessional hours: once at 7pm and once at 10:30pm! 

She has mentioned it to a few of her immediate supervisors, who confirmed he has a wife and children at home (not that it matters other than making him more scummy as she is not attracted to him in the slightest).  

So the question becomes, what is next? Her supervisors know about it but don’t seem to be doing anything about it. He is the highest up in the chain of management other than (I guess) the companies owner. Should she speak with a different regional manager? Should she try to speak with the owner? How can she prove she’s already spoken to her supervisors and nothing has been done? It is making her uncomfortable but she feels there is nothing she can do. Any advice is appreciated!

333,"So I dated this boy (M) for about 3 years. I felt mistreated and unhappy in the relationship so I left for my new boy (H). My ex had a lot of health issues while we were together, but it never seemed too serious. He always seemed normal, smart, balanced a job, girlfriend, and friends, and overall was just any typical dude. (We started dating when I was 14, am now 18, he is 2 years older). I just felt unloved, uncared for, and like I wasn’t a priority, so I broke it off. Immediately after that he went crazy. Calling me 60 times a day, sending me essays on my phone begging for me back. I was confused on this behavior because I honestly thought that when I broke up with him, he wouldn’t care. (During our time together he broke up with me about 3 different times each lasting about a month). I started seeing a new boy (H), 1 year older than me. I decided to keep it a secret in the beginning because I was scared of my ex finding out and dealing with more harassment, I was going through a lot as it was. After I broke up with my ex, he kept telling me his health issues are getting worse, told me he had brain tumors, brain cancer, was givin a couple months to live, had an intense brain surgery but I never saw parts of his hair shaved or anything. I love him and care about him deeply, so I always tried to be there for him, but he wouldn’t let me unless we were back together. I would ignore him because whenever we talked it would just be harassment, if I said I’d go see him and would flake because I got too nervous that he would yell at me, he would say that he was going to come to my house, so I would always leave and come back hours later.  Fast forward a year later, (today), and he knows about my new boyfriend (H), and keeps bringing me down and guilting me and basically verbally abusing me about how shitty I am for hiding it from him and that he wants to die because of me. Now, he’s telling me he has about a week to live because his body is shutting down and he wants me to see him everyday to make amends. I know he actually has health issues, but I don’t know how honest he is being about all of it. He’s never let me come see him in the hospital, and when I try, he says that he will leave the hospital so we can spend time together at his house - doesn’t make sense. The other day he told me that he was in the ICU and that he was dying so I texted his mother to see if she can update me if anything happens. The text didnt go through and I found out I was blocked on her phone. I figure he did it because one time he told me he was going to kill himself because of me so I called his mother. I had someone else call her phone # and she answered and sounded perfectly calm and normal, for a mother who’s son is apparently dying in the ICU. When i later confronted him asking if he blocked my # on her phone, he lied and said she got a new #. Now he’s saying he only has a couple days left to live and I dont know if I should believe him. I want to see him because if he is telling the truth about being terminally ill I would not want all of this to weigh down on me, but I need to know the truth and I dont want to feel shitty for having a part of me that thinks he’s lying but none of this makes sense to me. I don’t know how someone could keep this going for an entire year.

337,"This is gonna be a long read about how my life is kinda going to shit, and I don't really know how to handle it. It's going to go over my home situation, my relationship, and my own issues. Sorry for the long read in advance:

I've been dating this girl for a little over 4 months. Both of us are seniors in high school. However, I feel that I might have misjudged the probability of our relationship working out before hand. She's my first girlfriend ever, so i cant say I'm super experienced with relationships. But that's not because I couldn't get with any girls. I just didn't want to because of other reasons. However, with her it's been really different.

So for the first 2 months, things were really great. We got along really well, we hung out a lot, we got to meet each others families and get comfortable. It was wonderful. But then things started to decline.

Backstory on me: I'm very outgoing and sociable. Love talking to new people, love going out, love going to see new places and things, love being active. I'm a devour Christian and worship for the youth at my church. I'm an above average student and am currently getting my certification to be a Nursing assistant. I love to encourage others and make people laugh. I never really like to put people down and do not take pleasure in other people's suffering, even if they have greatly wronged me. I've had a very lucky and wonderful upbringing. Very few issues (until recently) and have been affluent for most of my life. That's just a little about me.

Some backstory on her; she has crippling anxiety, suffers from depression, and rarely wants to talk about her problems. That isn't a huge deal, people don't have to always say everything on their mind. She has gone through a lot of verbal abuse from her 30 yr old sister and her father. I'm getting some vibes from her that make me think she was perhaps sexually abused sometime in the past. She has attempted suicide once (way before we met). She has an eating disorder and she always thinks she's fat and ugly (compliments of her sister and father). She's only 110lbs and 5ft 4in tall. Not fat at all. She's beautiful

So why do I want to break up with her? Well, I don't. But I feel it might be necessary because of what's been happening recently. She's been getting really moody and irritable. Anything I do is annoying and there's nothing I can do to comfort her in anytime. I feel like I'm walking in eggshells around her, and I hate that feeling. I am turning into a different person just so she can continue being snappy and hypocritical. She frequently puts me down to her friends while I'm there and it bothers me a lot. I'm an encourager, and love to bring people up and make people smile and laugh. I hate putting people down, and hate seeing others put people down. However, whenever I compliment her or say anything remotely nice to her, she shoots it down, tells me to shut up, or talks about how that isn't true. Then she follows it up with ""you're so irritating"". Her lack of patience of course is a sign of her depression and anxiety. And I can sympathise with that. However, I don't want to be in a toxic relationship. And I'm only in high school; I'm not tied down. We haven't had sex, I havent proposed, or anything that would be a commitment. The longer we stay together, the more painful the break up will be. And I don't want to hurt her because she's already fragile enough as it is. But there's other problems ad well.

The day of posting this was April 25th, 2018. Our school prom is May 19th. Breaking up with a girl before prom just kinda seems like an asshole thing to do. That and she already has her dress. So I think that would be super shitty to do on my part. On top of that, we have two class periods together so I would have to see her for a lot of days and it would only hurt her more if we broke up. I however, also want to be happy. I want to have a good prom considering it's going to be the only one I have. I don't want to go with someone who is angry and irritable. Her anxiety also would make her not want to dance or do anything even *slightly* outside of her comfort zone. She also doesn't really care for Christianity. Most people wouldn't see that as a problem, but for me it hurts. It's really important to me, and I want it to be really important to her too. I want to date someone with similar interests, similar passions. And she just isn't that. And it's my fault for not realizing that and my fault for going for her when i didn't know enough about her yet.

Now here's the worst if the situation. My family is going through a lot right now. My dad lost his job mid July of last year, so we've been living off my mom's income ($30,000/year) which was really inconvenient considering we just bought a $300k house right before he lost his job. On top of that, my brother (20 and has autism) has slipped into a massive depression and has been frequently talking about killing himself a lot. How he's gonna do it, and where he's gonna do it. Anyone who has ever been institutionalized knows that it's an awful experience. And my brother being taken away because we can't provide for him scares me a lot. Suicide watch is expensive as well, so leaving him by himself is a massive scare. This whole situation is adding a whole new level of stress for me. Which means having a girlfriend, especially one who is consistently snappy and irritable is more stress

So I come to my conclusion. I would love to talk to her about her issues. But she never wants to and whenever I bring it up she just says she's going to cry and shuts down immediately. I can't stand problems that I can't talk about. So having this is like having a knife lodged in my spine. I still like her, but I'm thinking about the long term. And I don't want an even more painful breakup in the future, for her sake. So do I break up with her, or do you guys think it will get better and I'm just being too sensitive? If I should breakup, how would I do it? What would I say? If not, what should I do for the moment? If you have any more questions about what I've said, lemme know. I've probably left some things out accidentally. But I really just don't know what to do. If you've read this far, thank you for your time. I know it's a lot",25Apr2018,0
338,"My fiance and I are getting married next month. Things moved fast with us, we got engaged 9 months into dating, and now are getting married in May, 14 months after first meeting. I'm happy with him and I don't feel uncomfortable with how fast we moved, but there's currently one issue: So, we are searching for a home to buy and we both want a property with a rental apartment (like a garage apartment) attached to it so that we could rent it out. I see this as a good investment or something good for when we might need to care for one of our parents as they age. But, here's the problem: I want the space so that we could rent it out and put that money in savings, but he wants to rent it out for a very low amount to his father. His dad is perfectly healthy, able to go about life, he currently owns a home, has a social life, and is independent. My fiance wants his dad to sell his own home and move him into a garage apartment on our soon-to-be-first-home. He also wants to take over his dad's money that he gets from selling his house, just so he doesn't blow it. We will be newly married, just beginning our lives as husband and wife, and I just don't want to start a new chapter with my father in law living right next to us. I want my space, privacy, and not start it this way. Also, I think my fiance is helicoptering his dad and that's not healthy for our marriage either. I would understand if his dad were ill and incapable but that is not the case. When I tell my fiance that I'm uncomfortable with that idea, he makes me feel selfish and says he doesn't see the problem. I'm so upset by this, and I don't know whether I'm being selfish or not.

339,"I've had huge trouble structuring/simplifying this...

I have this friend who talks about cutting himself, wanting to kill himself, a bad drug habit and numbing pain with drugs (speed, xtc) frequently. Most of it is just for attention, but it's gotten particular bad lately. His dealer died of a heroine overdose a few weeks ago and he seemed to react to it by numbing himself even more than usual (actually doing it, not just saying it) and i was really worried. We talked but a few days later I hear from a few friends that he said that he also injected heroin two times. It hurts my gut lots to think about it.
I don't know if he was lying or not. It's plausible that he was. On the other hand, that would still mean that he needs help. 

We used to talk a lot about personal stuff, but I don't think he is very good friends with anyone from our group. No one knows how to react to this, there is not exactly a lot you can do as a friend except listen and offer help. Everyone in our group has mental health issues and problems with drug abuse but heroin is a line we do not cross. Still, we are not the people he should be talking to about this because we don't react as strongly to this as we should. He's a bit younger and desperately needs some guidance, but all of us have to some extent gotten used to people abusing drugs/mental health issues and can't pretend to be as shocked as he wants us to be. I think he only feels cared for when we show that we are afraid for what he might do to himself, especially because he is not taken very seriously due to his lies. He seems to be waiting for an outcry on our part. It's like he's in all his sorrow still trying to impress the ""cool kids"" who seem to be untroubled by anything around them because they've seen worse. But in truth, we do care, we just don't know what do except talk with him. 

To make things worse, I have to stop talking with him about these things altogether. It was a hard decision, but there are a few topics that I cannot handle because of my own past and his current problems have to do with all of them. I literally get suicidal and nightmares for weeks sometimes after speaking to him. I do not want to risk my own life when I don't know if it helps, and I have promised this to my boyfriend as well. Aside from this, I am not someone who you want to talk to about these troubles, I don't know how to handle them either and can only give bad advice. 

So now only a few people (in this group of friends) are left that he could talk to and i dont know how many other friends he has. He does know a lot of people that will make things worse for him (for example by ""one-upping"" him when he talks).

Is there anything we can do as friends? The only plan I have right now is to ask my friends to lend him more of an ear than usual. I will also have to tell him that i advice him to go to rehab or a closed mental health facility as he is a danger to himself. That will be extremely hard, especially because he will most likely take this personally. Any advice on how to tell him? (in combo with an explanation for why i cant talk about these topics with him?! I dont want to make him feel like he is dragging me down...)
Thanks for any words of advice and experiences. 

TL;DR: friend might be doing hard drugs, might be lying. Talks to people who can barely handle their own mental/drug problems, i cant be a listener anymore either, what to do?

340,"Hi, my name's Adam and before i ask for your advice, need to tell you a little bit of context.

So, to begin with, in the country I live when you begin to study in a highschool \(which is 3 years\) you are to choose a ""profile"" of the class you are going to be in, for example: Maths and Science, Biology and Chemistry, History and other related school subjects most likely not present \(or weirdly named\) in your countries. These profiles define what you want to focus on during highschool keeping in mind your future plans \(don't really know if that's how it is in the rest of the world too\).

When I was 15 and graduating from my previous school my plans were to study medicine, most likely stomatology \(because both my parents are oral doctors so I can have an easier start\) and thus I chose the class with Biology and Chemistry \(parents did not push me to choose so or at least I didn't feel like it\). And that was probably the biggest mistake of my life. Long story short, my 2nd year out of 3 im gonna spend in this highschool is heading to its end and so far chemistry has been a huge pain in my ass. To be honest, I just can't seem to understand it, look at it in ""chemical way"", only in ""mathematical way"". Once I had even spent 1,5 week studying chemistry \(not mentioning all the regular revisions i try to make\) before an exam in which I didn't even score 25&amp;#37; \(I got 22 if I remember it right\). And the thing is that if I want to study medicine in the future most \(if not all of them\) universities require me to pass like a ""post highschool exam"" \(idk if it's something common in your countries\) in both chemistry and biology at \~90&amp;#37;. So as you may have already guessed, it's just not possible for me to achieve that. So basically I'm just stuck in a class learning a subject that will most likely be completely useless to me in the future and wondering what I'm going to study or if im actually going to go to a university. 

But the worst I have yet to tell: 2 days ago my parents began to ask me about my future plans, chemistry and stuff and when I announced them that I'm probably not going to even try to write the ""post highschool exam"" in chemistry, they are just disappointed. They just don't seem to understand that I have made a mistake by choosing chemistry 2 years ago \(which in general is quite a bad idea to make 15 year olds decide on what they are going to do in the future before they even have any idea how all the subjects, like chemistry for me, are\). They keep telling me how being a doctor \(or anybody basically related to medicine\) will bring me money and the ability to be independent but to be honest it doesn't matter to me. Anyway, it all is just really depressing and makes me feel terrible.

341,"I am 13.


Yesterday i got into an argument with my mom. Nothing unusual for a teenager. In that argument she was Plain out wrong and lying about a lot of things. She said things like ""You cant argue with me because you are young"" I am more experienced and always right, don't question me "". The second one is a bit rephrased, but thats what she meant. Then she started calling me a dumb liar. I knew i was right, so I told her that she is the dumb liar here. She got pretty insane afterwards.


And now the thing that baffles me. She called out everyone from my fathers part of the family to be fucked liar (My father is working out of country currently). She told me how my 86 year old Grandpa I love is a stupid liar, the same about the rest of the fathers part. That triggered me, so much. Today she wanted an excuse, I told her ""Fuck You"". She angrily told me if I behave like this she wont be a friend with me.


The thing is, I dont like her. One time long ago something broke in me, and I, dont see her as someone i remotely like anymore. I dont have the heart to tell her that we arent friends for a long time.

342,"I've been talking to this girl in my class and we have similar interests and she seems cool.

We did a final presentation today where we pretended to talk on the phone to each other in front of the class and we acted like we were calling each other.  Before the presentation she told me she could give me her number to make the phone call seem more authentic, and I'm really stupid about that kind of thing so I just said something along the lines of ""that's probably not necessary""

Then after the class I realized she might have been trying to actually get my number and I felt pretty bad.  The only way I have to contact her now is sending her a message on my university's online blackboard website where we do discussions and stuff.

She seems pretty cool and is someone I'd want to be friends with.  I was thinking about sending her a quick message on there telling her I wasn't trying to blow her off and that I'd be down to hangout sometime or whatever.  I'm just afraid that this will come off as desperate or weird.  OR i might have misinterpreted her asking for my number and she actually did just want it for the assignment, so the message might come off as really conceited.

I guess I have nothing to lose by sending it but I wanted a second opinion, thanks !!

352,"This is going to be pretty long.

But I hope somebody takes the time to read it. 

So I’m 18, and I graduated from high school last year in May.

At the time, I was in a relationship with this guy that I’d been involved with since my freshman year of high school. Granted, we only actually started DATING right before my senior year. 
I pretty much gave up everything for this guy. Stupid of me. He was kind of my whole world. He was 4 years older than me, and he asked me to move in with him after I turned 18. (I graduated in May, and I didn’t turn 18 until August. My parents wouldn’t let me leave at 17. They threatened to have me returned home if I left.)

So I gave up my plans for him because I wanted a life with him. Before him, I’d always wanted to join the military. He told me he didn’t think I could do it, and I should just move in with him and work until I could afford to go to college. 

And. 

Anything he said, I did. 

The relationship was awful although I didn’t see it at the time. I excused everything he did. No matter what he did. He was emotionally and sexually abusive. He lied, he called me names, he had sex with me against my will, he wrapped his hands around my throat, he threatened to kill me. There was so much that he did and so much that he said. I can’t even begin to tell you. 

And, in the end, he didn’t even come to get me despite him promising to do so. He told me that something had come up. 

Then. A week later. He dumped me. 

So I was a mess. With only one option left if I wanted to do anything with my life.
Military. (That way I could do college while I was in.) 

(Sidenote: I would’ve joined the military at 17 before I started dating that guy if my mom would’ve signed for me, but she refused to.) 

You see, even if I had ever wanted to go straight to a decent college, I couldn’t have.

My parents were very unconcerned with my future. They’re huge procrastinators, and we don’t have much money. 

Because of them, I still to this day have yet to get my license. (Before anybody goes jumping down my throat about blaming my parents when I’m 18 and “should be able to get them on my own”, I don’t just say it to say it. I say it because it’s true. My stepdad works from 5 am to 6 pm weekdays, and my mother doesn’t drive. I have no way to get up to the DDS (or DMV) in order to take the test. We live in a very small southern town in Georgia. There are no buses or Uber or taxis. My friends have all gone off to college or joined the military. Not that it’s their responsibility to take me to begin with. Plus, I live on the outskirts of town, and I don’t have money to give people for gas to come pick me up. I have begged my parents time and time again to help me. They make promises, and they never go through with them. That’s how they are.)

How does this relate to college you ask?

Well. In highschool, as a back up plan, I had to go online and talk to my counselor in person in order to get waivers filled out, so I could take the SAT and ACT for free. We couldn’t afford the tests, and I knew that, so I signed up for them. I had everything ready. My parents were aware that I planned to go, and my stepdad had agreed to take me. (The tests were on Saturdays.) On the day of each of the tests though, my stepdad didn’t take me. 

So I missed the two free opportunities that I had. 
And now I don’t have any test scores to send in on a college application, and you kind of have to have those.

I have everything BUT any test scores. I have two official high school transcripts all sealed up and ready to go, and I actually even tried to apply for some scholarships, but I had to have SAT/ACT test scores for that too. So I was unable to fill the papers out. 

Had I had a license, I could’ve taken myself to the tests. And I’d try to sign up to take them again now, but I still wouldn’t have a way to get there. And now I wouldn’t have the money either. 
So I finally started talking to a recruiter back in November 2017. 

I REFUSED to get stuck in this tiny hick town. 
Getting rides to see my recruiter was NOT easy. In fact, he had to come to me more than once. I had to beg my bestfriend’s older sister. I had to beg my cousin. I made deals. 

I started going through the process finally. Went to MEPS in January. Got my job picked out. Got a BMT ship date. It was March 20th. Come February, I was working out every day, and I was so happy and so close to leaving. 

Then. Two weeks before my ship date, I woke up one morning having severe pain in my left side. Had to go to the ER. Found out I had a kidney stone. 

I had to tell my recruiter. My recruiter gave me a week to pass it before he would have to replace me with somebody else. I drank so much water. Cut off soda completely. 
I didn’t pass it. 

In fact, I still haven’t passed it. 

The military won’t let me leave with it still in my kidneys, regardless of whether it’s bothering me or not. 

(Which it hasn’t hurt in about two weeks.)

I found out today that I was getting a DEP discharge. Which means I’ll have to go through the whole enlistment process all over again if I want to join the military. But not until AFTER the stone is gone. 

I really don’t have any options left besides the community college here. But even that is far-fetched tbh. I’ll have to take an entrance exam, but I have no way to get up to the college to even take an entrance exam. 

My mom keeps promising she’ll help me find somebody in our family to take me to go get my license next week, but she’s been saying that same thing since my 18th birthday last year, and nothing has come of it. 

I know everybody likes to say “You should be happy all you have to do is sit at home.” 

“You should be happy your parents are willing to take care of you.”

But I feel like a total failure. My only goal was to get out of this place. I never wanted to get stuck here. I promised myself I wouldn’t. 

A lot of people hate me here. I had a bad reputation in high school. I dated two guys that I shouldn’t have, and they had exes who were very petty and went around telling people stuff about me that wasn’t true. 

It seems so immature, but those girls had a lot of friends where as I was introverted and shy, and it caused a lot of trouble for me. A lot of people still don’t like me. 

I wanted out of here so badly. I still do. I feel hopeless. Stuck. Desperate. I don’t know what to do. There’s not much that I can do.

I wanted to make myself proud, I guess.

And. Life just kinda kicked me in the ass. 
Advice?

353,"Hello everyone!

I don't know how to start this post, but I'll try my best. English isn't my native language, so feel free to correct me. 


Let me give you some information to start with. I'm 14, above average looking and get good grades. I exercise and play sports 4 days a week, on an elite team. I've recently had a difficult time in school. I don't know which group I belong to, because I'm kinda special. I'll give you some groups below. 


**My friends (kinda)**
Ok, so these guys I call ""friends"" is really immature, makes a lot of noise in classes and they don't care about grades. They don't do drugs or anything illegal, but they really don't care about anything. After school they go home and play console. I do own a console, but I'm mostly into PC gaming, and I'm about to build a new PC next week. From my perspective, it looks like they don't care about their future. 


**The girls**
The girls usually stick together in one big group. Not much to talk about here. There's a few pretty girls in my class, but I'm not looking for a relationship (I've declined offers before). I'm not the best at girls, nor the worst. 


**The good boys**
These boys always do their homework, and likes to be the teachers pets. I've tried staying with them before, but their jokes are horrible and every class they will try to finish first. I'm not trying that hard in school, but I still get better grades than all of them. 


**The iPad gamers**
This is a small group. They will bring their iPad to school every day and play on it. They don't interact with other classmates, unless we're working in groups. They will scream in breaks, if they lose in some kind of game. I prefer to stay away from them, because they will get really pissed at you, if you somehow annoy them. 


**The lonely**
This group is made of 2 boys, doing everything together. One of them is really annoying, and has done some bad things in the past. I would also prefer to stay away from them. They're kinda lonely, because everyone knows that they do some bad stuff. 


Sooo, this is my class. I really don't know who I should stick with anymore. I could really use some help. Any advice or tips will be appreciated!",25Apr2018,2

357,"Basically I can’t tell if I’m being paranoid or not. A girl in one of my classes who i didn’t talk to for most of the semester has recently been really trying to talk to me... and I’m not particularly attractive... one day on break she walked over and asked me for one of my social media handles. I told her I didn’t have the one she asked for and offered to give her one of my other ones instead. So she added me on that one and we have messaged a little bit here and there and then we have talked in class. We’ve barely messaged and she has already asked me if I wanted to come over to her apartment, and then every day when we are walking to our cars she mentions that I can come over.  I find this suspicious because I don’t usually invite people over who i have not known for a long time and I’m a rather large man who participates in a combat sport... and how a rather small woman could be so careless is mind boggling for me.

Another reason I’m acting paranoid is because a local gang member whom I have to interact with on a regular basis has threatened me a few times for reasons that I don’t completely understand. And the threats started happening shortly before this girl started wanting to talk to me. A part of me feels like it’s a trap or something, but I know that I have pretty low self esteem as-well so I could just be being paranoid because I’m not used to women being so friendly.

I am a 23 y/o dad living with my gf and my son, he is 11 months old and he's the best thing that happened to me.

little background first: Drop out of law school, got a nice job in a important bank here in Chile as a documentation agent, moved with gf and my son and I'm renting my own place. I've always been the party guy and irresponsible and all that but being a parent changed me 200% and im totally dedicated to my family. Im not earning bad or anything but since its my first ""real job"" (i've always worked with my family, doing twice or three times more work and got paid the half im getting paid right now) Right now is going pretty good, I can provide everything we need to my family but not enough to save in case anything happens. I returned to college but to business administration wich is half of the time and i'm going to classes at night. I've gained a lot of weight because my life turned upside down and im now facing all the adult responsabilities, since I always lived with my parents and never had money issues, I'm very stressed but my family is my motivation to get all my shit done. I used to play rugby but I can't do it anymore  because of my class Schedule and work. Tried to bycicle a lot but recently got my bike stolen. 

I'm getting help from my mom so she fortunately has the funds to pay my college (college in chile is not as expensive in the states).

I have some ""break"" time for about 1 to 2 hours at work everyday because I do all my work first and got time to review reddit later. 

What can I do to improve my work skills online, for a short period of time invested every day?

What can I do to overcome the stress and face the adult life easier? 

Is it viable to find weekend part time job to save more money? 

Any advice or experience can help... maybe im not being very clear but im writting this from work and I just want to have some guidance or empowering words to get my shit done. I'm really feeling like life is hard at this point but things aren't going that bad, just seeing my son happy is fuel for my motivation but im just getting started and I know things are going to get harder from now on. 

TL;DR 23 y/o  recently dad, returned to college while working at the bank, got stressed and fat, need advice or experience from older dads. I'm just starting to man up and taking care of my family but things just are going to get harder from now on.

I suffer from anxiety and depression, my apologies if I come across overly morose or anxious.

I was so happy, my boyfriend has dental coverage for me approved so I finally was able to go. After many years of no coverage and no dental care outside of brushing my teeth, I was certainly expecting a large amount of issues.

What I wasn’t expecting was a $1200 bill due for cleaning the bottom row of my teeth alone. After coverage, I owed just under $200 but it is still well above what I can afford.

The problem is I work three jobs and still live under the poverty line. With my medications and the rising price of gas, I can’t even afford to pitch in towards rent for my boyfriend anymore.

Now I face a laundry list of things to do with my mouth that will cost just under $7k. Coverage may not go much farther and this is the beginning of the year.

I have an infection in my mouth and I’m stressing over being able to afford the antibiotics right now, let alone the other things required.

I don’t know what I can do. I can’t leech off of my boyfriend and continue borrowing money for this. I obviously don’t have that kind of money floating around. At the same time, I don’t want to let me teeth go.

The company has been dead for four years now. Dad was going through hard times and became a drunk. He stopped managing his money well and got himself into debt with the local stores that, for over twenty years, supplied the company with lumber and other supplies. Dad lost the house my brothers and I grew up in (that was hard) and then spent the rest of his money on an apartment. That was when the company officially died. 

As I said before, my dad was at his best when the company was flourishing. Even in somewhat difficult times, having the company was enough for him to feel proud and happy with his life. 

Fast forward to now. My dad is wasting away in his tiny apartment. I feel like maybe, if possible, the construction company may be a good solution. I think perhaps it would not only help with money issues, but help improve his self-esteem and make him happier. Maybe it would give him another reason to keep going. And I know that it's naive of me to think we can revive a long gone company, but I'm willing to try and if I can convince him, I think my dad will be willing to try too. 

My dad has a 9-5, Monday-Friday job. He is the only employee besides the manager, who is good family friend. If we can fix the company, I know the manager would have no problem hiring another employee and giving my dad part time hours so he has some time to work on the company. Hell, the manager might even be able to help us out with the company itself. 

The only problem is, as much as I know my dad would be capable of fixing this himself, and as much as I know that he wants to fix it, he just won't. He's become this shell of the man that raised me. He complains about his life constantly, yet does nothing to fix it. I know deep down inside him he wants to. I know if he would just try, he could. He just needs the push. And I really want to push him. 

My dad doesn't have a lot of money. I think bankruptcy might be the only way he's ever going to get out of those debts. Maybe that would ruin the relationships he has with our local suppliers, maybe not. I have no clue. I'd really appreciate any ideas you may have on how he can deal with that. 

I know I'm not an expert on any of this (obviously). There's probably a lot of helpful details missing, and if you can think of any and let me know so I can talk to my dad about it and maybe post an edit/update/whatever with more helpful information, I'd appreciate it and I'd gladly do that. I'm willing to do anything. Even though I have my own life and two jobs, I'm willing to find time to help him out and work with him, or help him find employees if need be (the company is family owned and run, but they have hired outside people before and it's never really been an issue).

I know this is sort of all over the place. I'm sorry about that. I'm writing this quick before work in the hopes that I'll have some good ideas by the time I get out. Again, I'd really appreciate any helpful tips and solutions. 

How do I go about reviving a dead, small town company?

Edit: Also, if any proud, set in their ways men in their 40s are reading this...how should I talk to him about this without wounding his pride even further? I’m a twenty year old girl, his only daughter, and he’s very set in the idea that this isn’t something he should have to talk to his daughter about. He thinks I’ll think less of him, and that I just can’t understand what is going on (which is very untrue. There might be certain things I don’t know about yet, but that doesn’t mean I won’t understand once I’m told). Is there a certain way I should talk about it, or should I just rip off the bandaid?

373,"Hi advice,

Today during work, a coworker of mine \(A\) was throwing things at another coworker \(B\). The coworker B seemed like he didn't really care \(""whatever"" was his response\) but a few of the thing almost hit me, and things shouldn't be thrown around in the office to begin with \(kinda against the rules\), so I told coworker A to stop throwing things. 

He ignored me the first time I told him, and kept doing it, but the second time I told him to stop Coworker A said to me: ""Mind your own business, FEMALE"".

Hearing this made my blood curdle and I got the urge to crush skulls, so I walked away and wrote an email to my manger saying that i will be working on the other side of office for the rest of the day.

Another coworker \(C\) told me that I am over reacting and he was joking. I do not feel it was a joke because coworker A has been treating me poorly since I rejected his advances towards me. \(but that's a whole other can of worms\)

I want to report this to HR, because I feel it was a blatantly sexist remark, but I need some advice,

\- First, I want to confirm that I am NOT crazy or over reacting. What coworker A did was wrong, right?

\-Second, How do I actually report this?  We have video cameras at work but they have no audio  \- so the company can see coworker A throwing things, but they cannot hear his remark and I don't think my other coworkers who were there to witness it would want to get involved, because they all buy weed from coworker A and don't want to get on his bad side. 

\-Lastly, what can I say to HR to let them know seriousness of the situation, and my willingness to ""lawyer up"" if nothing is done about this, technically, sexual harassment. 

Any advice or tips would be much appreciated. 

Just to note, I am the ONLY woman in my office, other than our manager who has an in &amp; out presence.",25Apr2018,1
374,"Late 20s, male. Ever since I was young I have had a fetish for women smoking cigars. If I see a woman smoking a cigar (which is admittedly a rare sight in itself), she becomes 100 times more attractive to me.

It's been with me for most of my life, and at this rate it's pretty much going to stay with me forever. I don't smoke myself, but this fetish has permeated virtually all of my sexual fantasies and I have found that I always have to imagine it to be able to perform in sexual situations.

It's admittedly a very rare fetish, but for much of my life I've hidden it out of shame. However, I'm increasingly getting to the stage in my life where I just want to be able to find someone who understands and emphatises with my fetish, and is open to having fun with it.

376,"Okay, little bit of a long story here.

My friend, let's just call him R, is gravitating towards my other group of friends. I have three main groups:

* The ones who I can talk about my feelings/personal stuff to.
* The ones that I talk about Fortnite, rap music, and *fuckin them thotties* to.
* The ""nerds"" that I play a *Risk* style game with and discussing geography and world flags with.

R was in the ""Nerds"" group, and still is, but he seems to be leaning over to the ""Fortnite/Rap Music"" group. He sits next to me at lunch, along with the rest of them, and has picked up slang like ""thot"" and ""nut,"" but has had exposure to these words due to memes (he's a huge meme fan).

R has also started asking me questions that only the ""Fortnite/Rap Music"" group would ask, like ""have you ever busted a nut for real"" or ""what do you jack it to"" and I say something like ""I don't want to answer that"" to give him an answer that should satisfy. I'm also 75% sure he's gay because he's mentioned it before (but very, very subtly) and whenever we're changing for gym he glances down at my crotch and pretends that I don't notice.

R and I's friendship is going in a good direction but I don't want him to feel jealous of the ""Fortnite/Rap Music"" group because I spend a majority of my time with them, and think that one group is better than the other, which is not true. R also really wants my attention most of the time because I seem like his only friend and even if I'm talking to someone else he calls my name as if I was just standing there silently.

How do I keep R like R, and not like the guys in the ""Fortnite/Rap Music"" group?",25Apr2018,0
377,"I come from a family that is short-tempered, high stress, and very particular...so you can see how that may rub off on me and my personality.  

I go back and forth from my boyfriend's place and my parent's now that I've finished nursing school. I limit how often I am home because it just is a constant theme where I get emotionally worked up and stressed out by my family that I am usually in tears or am in a ++irritable/angry mood that it really ruins my day and anyone that is around me.

Although my reactions to my family and our nature is another issue, I want to work on how I can stop nagging my boyfriend. I've been home (he's joined me) the last few days and every day I am constantly nagging him to clean up after himself, to step up and help out with his mess or even to just offer my parents a hand (I was raised that way) in anything - cleaning, cooking, etc. But he often tends to forget and leaves his dishes or messes behind or he like just goes back to my room. He shuts/slams the doors closed and since we have hard wood flooring, it just amplifies. He lives in an apartment alone, so these are just typical boy habits? idk. 

I've gotten my fair share of yelling from my parents because of ""not cleaning up after myself"", ""being too loud"" etc. They're just very nitpicky, but also at the same time I am becoming frustrated with my boyfriend (dating for 2 years now), at how nonchalant he is with cleaning up in general and I guess how he is a naturally messy guy.

Things are just worse when I get home and when my parents are involved and get mad over it, it makes me even more upset with my boyfriend because I'm already constantly telling him to clean up his mess or to be more considerate and quiet etc but he always ""forgets"" and then he apologizes profusely for it. It's one thing to apologize but it's another when you say youre going to do something and then not. 


What can I do to stop nagging him? And how can I just enforce the idea of taking the initiative to clean or keep things tidy? His apartment is another story, and honestly every week it's always me saying ""Hey! lets clean"" and then it just goes back to being messy in a few days because he leaves things out/everywhere.",25Apr2018,0

So I responded with “Sh*t, so Sh*t …”. That same night, my other chinese friends (Who I think might have connection with him) told me that ""someone had a video of you"" or something like they know about the video.

I’m not woried about saying what I said (Despite having social anxiety, I didnt do anything stupid or over the top in that video). What I am woried is the nature of the story. Once if someone record you and put it on social media, does that mean I am being made fun of?(with Wechat and chinese people, in this context) Or is that just what friends do to bond and joke around ? 

I know I am supposed to react and talk to him about it, but I dont want to be rude.  I feel so weak and pathetic for being so not assertive like this. All I wanted was a friend who play with me and respect me for who I am, instead of making fun of me, or play with me out of pity ?

390,"Hello, this is a tough question. My coworker and I are co office managers, we have a maintenance man who we are having problems with. He is defiant, puts incorrect hours on his time card, works on his own schedule, brings his child to work, just doesn't do his job most of the time, and recently got an undeserving pay raise. 

He doesn't see us as his bosses and we are having a really hard time with that. Due to his special treatment, we don't feel comfortable telling our boss when he does anything wrong because we have suspected there may be something going on between them. Recently, his 5 year old child was left in the office for us to babysit as per usual, and he let it slip that he isn't allowed to say our bosses name. We found that suspicious and asked him why he can't say it, but he wouldn't tell us so we figured maybe he didn't know why he wasn't allowed to say it. 

Finally, a couple weeks later, and the subject of our boss came up again with his son, he told my coworker who works in the office with me that he and his dad have been staying the night at our boss's house on the weekends and even said that her teenage sons are mean to him. 

We don't know what to do about this situation because he gets away with doing whatever he wants here when we need someone who does their job and we also don't have an HR dept, she is the highest up employee right under the owner.

403,"So I've never really posted or read too much on this subreddit but I've been really struggling so here goes nothing:

I want to start out by saying a few things about my academic history before I begin making excuses. All throughout high school and middle school I was in honor/AP (advanced placement) classes which were not very hard at all for me. I would be able to screw around in class and end up getting acing every test without doing hardly any homework. In high school I had one of the highest SAT scores in my school even though I  took the test high as a kite. Also, I would just do the bare minimum for any assignment in class just so I could get by. One other note I think is important: I did schoolwork at home maybe 10 times TOTAL during my 4 years of high school.

So now onto college:

I am a freshman in college in my second semester. My first semester I was horribly unprepared for the difficulties of my courses as I kept my same study habits (or lack of) so as you can guess, I failed. I failed two classes and got put on 'academic probation' where I basically just needed to attend a couple of meetings and not fail this next semester. 

This semester I started everything right: I was studying nightly, utilizing help from the school such as tutors and writing centers, and developed an interest in what I was learning in each class. I studied my ass off and before midterms rolled around, I was rocking above a 3.5 GPA. When midterms started getting closer, I tried everything I could to prepare but I got shit grades in EVERY SINGLE ONE. 
After that, I couldn't focus in class at all. I would just sit on my phone browsing reddit the entire time and while I still kept up on 90% of my day-to-day homework, I was still half-assing everything and mostly just played the system rather than actually learning the content. Now, its finals week and I'm trying to study REALLY HARD but I just don't know how. I literally have no clue where to start studying for this Econ exam and I honestly feel like I might miss the mark for academic probation again.

It makes me wonder if college is just not for everyone or if I'm just being a bitch. While I can stop looking at my phone or whatnot during class, my brain just wanders uncontrollably. I have absolutely ZERO interest in my coursework and feel depressed whenever I'm at the school. I'm a smart guy but I have no motivation to learn.

408,"A bit of pre-text, I'm currently in the military and married working truly ungodly hours (90-100 hours a week). So with what little time off I love to hang out with my wife but I also just sort of want to mentally recover from all the work and be lazy. The issue arises that as of now we don't have a ton of money to go out on dates and stuff, So I've been trying to find things we can go do for little to no money we already went out on a picnic for Easter, I caught wind of an outdoor symhpny on the beach so we went to that, but I'm just struggling to find other things to do. I know she's getting tired of just always staying in the house and things while not terrible aren't as good as they could be. I just want to mix things up more to show her I actually do care.",25Apr2018,3

410,So when we booked the holiday we didnt pay for baggage because we didnt have the money at the time. Had a look to see how much it is and it is £26 each there and £26 each back so £104 all together but then they added and extra £16 for a checking in charge? So im wondering online check in opens in 23 days so should i wait and see if its cheaper after checking in or suck it up and pay it? ,25Apr2018,1
