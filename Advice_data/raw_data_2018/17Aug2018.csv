0,"I work at the same place my mother does, I am admittedly a bit snoopy, so I looked at her phone, and she was basically sexting my best friends (married) Dad. My mother isn't married, but has a boyfriend. This has pretty much shattered my entire perception of her. I've got a strong belief that parents should stay together and care for a child, and that they shouldn't cheat. I mostly fear for my half-brother, the son of her boyfriend. The hopes of my real Dad being fully in the picture are long gone, so the best I can do is for him. Of course it'd affect my friend's family too, I'm doing my best to keep this a secret, but I'm just so disappointed in her, and let down by her actions. I expected better out of her, what do I do?

1,"25-year-old female here, hi.

To clarify: I know a lot of people and my social circle is pretty wide, but I have a hard time making any deeper, meaningful friendships.

Time for some background: Autistic, ADHD (and BPD, but after years of hard work it has started to get under control). I'm a social elephant in the glassware shop: I talk a lot, am quick to react emotionally and often don't realize when I'm embarrassing myself or someone else. People often don't get it when I'm joking, as my family has a fucked up sense of humor, and as I'm not fluent with small talk or eye contact I sometimes may come off as cold. To top all this, I don't understand (spoken) sarcasm to save my life. Unspoken social rules are literally impossible. 

Because of this I was super easy - and still am - to fuck with, and ended up being bullied practically throughout my school years. I have had a lot of traumatic experiences with broken friendships, where I have been tricked into trusting people and then bullied for being so naive, or suddenly abandoned after breaking these social rules I didn't understand. So, after years of bad experiences with friendships I grew defenses. Big ones. Now signs of affection among friends feel shameful and I'm afraid to seem desperate and needy, as this triggers a lot of uncomfortable memories from childhood. 

Especially big groups of friends used to be very hard: When I'm having a bad week or my mental health is worse, I tend to assume the worst when there is some small conflict or misunderstanding. In these situations my trauma tells me I'm getting dropped out of the group so when I feel wronged I lash out and pick sides as if to make sure I don't have to be the one who's getting dumped. Usually I do damage control by just cutting ties with everyone involved until I calm down. This behavior had almost disappeared until there was a major setback: maybe three months ago a friend asked me to come on a vacation with a group of girls. I was so excited, just to be told two weeks later the other girls didn't want me there after all. I don't know these other girls as well as I knew the one who asked me and they wanted it to be just close-friends-only kind of thing, and it literally broke my heart. 

After that friendships have felt even harder. The only people I hang out with is my boyfriend and his friends, as with them I don't have any social pressure, and when there's any conflict, I lose my temper and get very defensive as trusting people enough to stay calm and honest is impossible. I try to stay confident, positive and be nice to people but in truth I just feel like I'm withering up inside. I'm stressed and anxious and the nightmares of my school years in which I'm being socially tormented, left out and provoked until I lose my temper and then laughed at have come back. 

TL;DR: I have traumas from bullying and my disorders make social situations hard. I no idea how to get close to people and therefore I feel lonely. I rarely get asked to hang out and asking others to spend time with me feels desperate and shameful. I'm afraid people will just pretend to put up with me. So other people just seem to magically end up hanging out together and I tend to feel like an outsider.",17Aug2018,1
2,"Not a joke. I’m genuinely curious how to start enjoying salad. I don’t need to lose weight or anything but to be completely transparent I get a bit embarrassed when I don’t eat it because it’s what most adults do. The issue is that I can’t stand the texture of most salads and would rather not have to douse it in dressings in order to enjoy it. 

I know this is super weird but does anybody have any advice for how I can try to acquire a taste for it? Wouldn’t hurt to eat more healthy. ",17Aug2018,39

5,"# Looking for general tips, but if you want to know specifics of my issues then read on...

I'm 35/F and Autistic - I'm very socially isolated with no friends, no family, and little social interaction through work.   


I 'pass' as neurotypical and have good social skills but I just don't seem able to easily connect with other people, it seems like a one in a million thing for me to find someone I can comfortably get on with socially. I'm pretty awkward socially and due to being socially isolated I can be very quiet, I'm told I come across either intimidating or very introverted.  


Problem #1 is I struggle to find opportunities to meet people, I'm not sure where to go or what to do to find ways to meet people that would allow me to make friends. I don't have social anxiety so I'm fine going places alone but it's no fun alone and it's tricky to just go up to strangers without being rude/weird, not to mention a one-time meeting rarely turns into friendship. I live in a small city, there's only one suitable Meetup but it's no longer an option thanks to an ex.   


Problem #2 is I just have no idea how to make/maintain friendships. I've had friends who came about as a result of being coworkers in previous jobs, they were more people I hung out with at work and went clubbing with...I need drinking buddies for sure, but it'd be nice to have actual friends to just spend time with and where there's mutual support. I just don't know how to go from acquaintance to friend, never mind a real friendship verses just drinking buddies.   


Problem #3 is I've always had male friends, but I've also always been in relationships so not had to worry too much about guys taking my being friendly the wrong way, now I'm single that's a bit more of a problem. I think it would be really beneficial to have female friends but I just don't know how to get on with women, they act like I'm not one of them.",17Aug2018,1

7,"Even though I'm in good shape compared to the average person in an objective sense (weight, heart rate, strength numbers, endurance, etc.), I have terrible body image and confidence: my mind fixates on those who are stronger than me, and I get envious and discouraged at the gym, or even just walking around and seeing a strong guy. 
I've been lifting since I was probably 18 on good programs like Starting Strength and 5/3/1 (but with bad sleep/diet, so progress has been supremely slow). I know I need to work harder, and to be more disciplined in my training, and that it’ll take time. But sometimes the obsession is just completely debilitating, and the thoughts interfere with the rest of my life, e.g fretting over my workout plan for hours instead of studying, being unable or unwilling to sleep because I didn't work out and feel weak, or just becoming conscious of any doughy part of my body while sitting or walking around, and feeling like I’m trying to resist scratching a bug-bite. I’m not even a student athlete: I’m not competitive, and I don’t have the confidence for it. It shouldn’t be this big of a deal to me. But it is. And I don’t know how to keep it under control.

8,"Some background: I am a 21 year old from the US. My GF (a 19 y/o Canadian citizen) just discovered she was pregnant a few days ago. This has been a swirl of emotions for the both of us, but one of our primary concerns is picking a good time/method to notify our parents and families. My mother is the type to put very strong emphasis on my future, always giving me life lessons about the importance of completing college, staying out of trouble, and planning. One of her biggest pieces of advice has been NOT to get a girl pregnant. Well, mom, about dat...

I’ve been working as a Realtor for 8 months, am enlisted in the US Army Reserve for 2 more years, am a university student, and live at home near Detroit. Thankfully my only monthly bill is my car lease and I live relatively cheaply. My GF is currently unemployed but recieves money from the Canadian government each month to cover rent and living expenses (forgive my ignorance on the specifics of this as I am not well-versed in Canadian social programs) and lives with family in the Chatham-Kent area. We both have decent support systems and are far from starving but I worry that our combined income may not be sufficient. I am also concerned with citizenship for the child and my GF’s eligibility for visa. If my child were born in Canada, would it be considered a dual-citizen? If in the US? Thankfully my GF lives only an hour away from me so visiting and spending time are not issues on account of my flexible schedule. However, my GF will be interviewed by a call center for a full-time, 40 hour a week position sometime this week. As excited as I am for her, I worry that this could cause scheduling conflicts before and after pregnancy. These are all things that I’d like to get figured out before breaking the news to my mother, who I fear will be terribly devastated. In January, she experienced seizures due to stress and anxiety from work, divorce issues, and other personal problems. I am worried that breaking the news to her could throw her over the edge again as she does not handle stress well at times. My GF’s family’s reaction would likely be different as they are blue-collar small town Canada folk who’ve all had children as young as my GF and I. Her father likes me but I have not met her mother in person yet. I’m not sure if the best bet would be to break the news together at the same time or to tell her parents first and wait. I am genuinely terrified of the possible outcome of this situation!! Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated. Forgive me for the wall of text but we’ve agreed to keep this a secret until we have a plan set forth.

TLDR: Canadian GF is pregnant, I live hour away in US, how/when do we tell our parents and what can be done about citizenship?",17Aug2018,1

The same friend was dating this guy. They broke up. He came into her work (he works at a store near hers) to talk to her while she was working, trying to be friends with her. I told her he's going to try to get her back, it was rude and unprofessional of him to do that when she was working, even if he works near her, and not a good idea to take him back as a friend.

I’m in a little bit of a pickle. I just got a call back from a small law firm, offering me a position as entry-level paralegal (will be working with with wills and titles). However, I also got hired on the spot at Whole Foods yesterday. Now, Whole Foods is not what I went to school for, but the company does offer amazing benefits with room to advance. 

The law firm does not offer any benefits at the moment since it is in the processing of growing. The law firm had a nice close-knit family type feel to it, and Whole Foods also offers that same type work environment. 

Starting pay at WF is 12. I don’t know the pay yet for the law firm, the desire pay I put was 13/hr as I am at entry-level, I though it was fair. The lady who interviewed me asked if it was negotiable, so I’m assuming she will want to negotiate down. The law firm is also further away about an hour commute, WF is about 20 min.

26,"I (42M) have steadily grown more frustrated with a dysfunctional work situation over the last year. This week I have been struggling with resentment and I feel my professionalism is slipping.

I was on a small team that transitioned to a different department. After a few months, they let my manager go, leaving me to share responsibilities with a co-worker who has a history of marching to the beat of his own drum. Despite regular meetings together with our department head to develop a transition plan, a leadership vacuum persisted. Several efforts to define accountability stalled while backlogged projects piled up. All the while, my colleague went to bat for new projects with spotty documentation and never had more than a passing discussion with me about the list of tasks waiting to be done.

As the year went on, I dug deep into documentation and spent time asking vendors to fill in missing details on our past contracts so we could build a document that would allow the department head to explain what the team does and how we spend our budget. Because I knew we were already in a bad position, I worked long and hard to assemble this data. But so much of it just kept pointing to poor planning, incomplete documentation, and lack of oversight. Things I had been advocating to fix for months.

Throughout the process, there appeared to be an understanding of the effort I was putting in, primarily in the form of a significant raise I hadn't even asked for, but the core issue of the team's productivity imbalance continued to be swept under the rug. Part of this appears to be a fear of losing even an inconsistent resource on a team that management considers short by at least three members.

At the end of 2017, I got frustrated enough that I started sending out resumes. I had one unfortunate experience where my resume and pre-interview got me close to a dream job only to realize during a team phone interview that my skill set was very underdeveloped for the position. I took that as a sign to find ways to better myself at the job I already had, but the needs of the department to right the ship have been keeping me constantly occupied.

I realized I made this process too personal. I feel personally wronged by my colleague for not stepping up to the leadership role management put him in as well as neglecting too many of the tasks that would keep the team afloat instead of putting it further behind. I bristle at his suggestions for action when I was the one who called vendors to clarify options, costs, and contingencies that were left poorly documented. I can't even stand to try and make nice every day when I just want to throw him under the bus with every daily meeting designed to dig us out of this hole.

I was actively trying to fight the bad thoughts. I was trying to give my colleague the benefit of the doubt and find common ground. But this last sprint of extra effort has stolen my energy and my personal time to such a drastic degree that I need some justice that I don't know is coming.",17Aug2018,1

So, I've just started my first year of high school (at age of junior; it's different in my country of origin). It's going pretty shit tbqh. We're going way too fast with the topics. So, to counter this, I've decided to work on my hour-long breaks. Problem is, I can't seem to focus. There are too many people around me, and not only my friends.

I still try to go to the library because it has PC's where I can work, but the amount of noise and people I can socialize with there is too distracting. Got any ideas on how to 'fix' this?

I’ve never been medically diagnosed, but I do have anxiety and sometimes I think I have depression as well as being bipolar. I don’t take any medicine because I’m scared and also I’ve (again) never been diagnosed. 

I often feel like I’m misunderstood and it really beats me up inside mentally. I know that a good portion of it is due to my own struggle with communication, but I have no idea how to change this. Sometimes I feel like I have to talk to people like I would a 5 year old just to not hurt someone else’s feelings, but I think I actually say that because that’s how I know I won’t say something that would be taken in a mean context. A lot of times when I talk, people take me for being an asshole because of my tone, and I mean absolutely nothing by anything I’m saying. 

I tend to push people away when I feel like I’m not wanted or cared for, so I don’t have a lot of friends. The family that I do keep in touch with aren’t people I talk to enough to feel like I can openly talk about this stuff.

30,"Throwaway because this is all really personal, though if anyone knew me they could very easily identify this anyway.

Some background- I am 26 (white American gay male), and went to college at a state school and studied Chinese. I also speak Japanese (learned starting at age 15, fluent now from studying and working in Japan). When I graduated I went to go work in Japan at a telecommunications company, which was fine and interesting but had bad pay and long hours. During this time, I started taking computer science courses online to work toward a second bachelor's degree in computer science, because I realized that a liberal arts degree was going to financially fuck me in the ass for the rest of my life if I didn't do something. I am halfway through that degree now, and it'll take me two more years at my current rate (studying while working full time is slow).

So I live in NYC right now. I actually moved here because I was visiting my best friend who lives here, and on a whim I interviewed for a job at a Japanese equipment finance company and actually got it without any experience. It paid more, and I was sick of my other job, so I moved here. I had a horrible, crazy, mean boss at this new NYC job, and eventually after desperately applying to other teams within the company for long enough, I was moved to one of them (sales support). My current boss is very nice, and I do an excellent job at work. Everyone acknowledges it, including him, everyone on my team, and everyone we support and work with. The place honestly kind of falls apart if I leave, even for a few hours. I am an insanely detail oriented perfectionist, which is valuable in finance.

I have some frustrations at work- poor management, people on other teams not doing what they need to do for me to get my job done right, etc. That bothers me enough, but it is slowly getting better, I think. However- two months ago I got my performance review and a promotion and raise (which I 100,000% deserved for all of the work and hours I put in). The only sticking point was that I was made salaried instead of hourly, and given a $5,000 pay raise to $60,000, while my \~$8,000 of yearly overtime disappeared into thin air. (Compensation includes about $18,000 in yearly bonuses both before and after the promotion). The work hours, of course, did not change. In addition, I discovered that our new staff member, hired to help me with our insane workload, is paid hourly, and his base is $59,000, but he gets paid overtime. So after overtime he makes about $7,000 more than I do, all else equal.

I was so offended by this that I simply started looking for work at other companies. I haven't even talked to my manager about it, because honestly even if they did pay me more, it just pisses me off too much that I had to point out that they cut my pay when I was doing that much work.

Last month, I went to go visit my mother, who lives in Phoenix. She had endometrial (basically uterine) cancer, so she got a hysterectomy. It was completely curative. and the doctors are optimistic that she won't have any more cancer. But seeing her drugged up in a hospital bed reminded me that some day, she will be drugged up in a hospital bed, and she won't get out of it. She will just die there. She's only 67 now, but her death now doesn't feel like it's that far away. Because of that, I thought ""Why do I even do this job in NYC? I hate it, I hate how dirty and crowded and awful NYC is, why don't I just move here?"" So I started to think about that.

Now I'm back in NYC going to work every day, and I advanced to the second round of interviews for a credit analyst position (in banking this is better compensated and a better career path in some ways (not all) than sales, and I think it's a better match for my personality (ISTJ)). I completed the second interview today, and got an email saying that they pretty much will definitely offer me the job, and I should hear back soon.

Now I am conflicted because a) I was thinking about moving to Phoenix for the reason I said above, and b) I think I want to be a software developer using my computer science degree when I finish it, because that career path seems more attractive than anything in banking or finance. Can anyone please offer some advice?

TL;DR I live in NYC, NYC kind of sucks, but I have a job offer for more money here than I currently make, but in a field I don't see myself in in the future. Don't know if I should move to Phoenix to be near my aging mother (67 F) or not.",17Aug2018,2

I would leave them and get new friends, but the cliques are already established for the most part, and I'm scared that I'll look desperate. Finally, my more passionate relationship was recently cut short by her moving away, and I can't decide if I should just pseudo-Blackpill myself or if I should look for someone else. Some say that my age is not appropriate for a partner, and I'm starting to agree with them.

In short: I'm becoming more socially awkward, my ""friends"" treat my like shit, and I'm romantically/sexually confused as to how I should go about another possible relationship.

I’ve been looking around and getting a few call backs but it’s still not helping me make money in the mean time. I’ve been having a shit ton of personal stuff going on with my family and going through some major depression and stressed the hell out. (not making money isn’t helping). i don’t drive yet due to the fact i’m fucking poor and so is my family. i have to buy my own car and i’ve saved up a lot but the money i do have i won’t allow myself to touch. my mom works 3 jobs and dad works overtime, they aren’t here a lot and usually can’t take me to work. since i haven’t had any money to throw around on gas for rides to work, i haven’t been able to make it to work which is causing me to have less hours. I missed two days this week. i haven’t  had the energy to even eat, let alone get out of bed. my family is worried about me and i’m honestly worried about myself. i think working would definitely help bring my mood up, having some extra money would be nice.. however i think my job is getting tired of me never having rides.

So three nights ago I had all the pills I needed for an overdose but then realized my mother needed help cleaning out the large garage and moving things into the house. It was more of an excuse to delay my suicide tbh. The next morning I find out one of my cousins died from a sudden blood clot in her heart. She felt it the night prior and died in the morning. I wasn’t close to her in any sense but I still mourned her a bit. The next day I would have actually done it but this time I gave my self an extra day in order to get everything sorted.

36,"One of my best friends in the world just told me that he has a crush on me.  

I'm a lesbian.

He knows that.

I have a best friend who we'll call SK. He moved to my school a year ago, and we became fast friends. At the time, I was going through a pretty serious mental health episode and was dealing with anxiety, depression, and some auditory hallucinations. (Yes, I heard voices. No, they never told me to kill people.) I was terrible at managing it and I ended up driving some of my friends away because I was constantly either aggressive for no reason, or overly-dependent on people. I cleaned up my act and I'm doing better with a super supportive group of friends, but that's not the point. At the height of my mental issues, I relied almost solely on SK to talk to, and told him about hearing voices and about the issues that were happening at my home as well. He was one of the only people who never used that against me or fled, and for that I was infinitely grateful. After I got out of the throes of my mental illness, we just went back to talking about video games and sending each other memes and stuff. He was one of those people that I could talk to endlessly with no worry about running out of topics. I told him I was gay during the middle of the school year, and he never seemed bothered by  it and was super accepting and supportive of me. Recently, I relapsed a little bit in terms of mental health and my family life got fairly significantly worse for a couple of weeks. I once again turned to him for support, and he always listened and told me that I was still a good person even though I didn't feel like it. He saved my life a couple of times during that period just by being there for me, and I thought I was frankly blessed to have a friend who cared that much. I got to a point where I felt much better, and I told him that I was super grateful that he was there for me, and that I felt like I could always count on him. He told me he felt the same way and that he thought I was one of the realest people he knew. 

Recently, I was talking to him the other day, and mentioned that I had noticed that he was somewhat distant and kind of down lately, and I told him that I was always there if he needed to talk. He told me that he did have something to tell me, and proceeded to tell me that he had liked me for months, even after I had come out to him, and that he felt really bad about it. At the time, I told him that it was fine and that I was okay with still being close friends if he wanted to be. I kind of lied. I don't feel comfortable with being close friends anymore, but I still don't mind the thought of being friends. Whenever I think about it, I get really nauseous because I feel so awkward that I told him all about my personal life and essentially poured my heart out to him. After he told me I cried a lot, and it still makes me so anxious to think about it that I'm not sure if I'm even going to be able to be friends with him after this even if I want to. I really, really want to be his friend, but I feel kind of weird and a little bit betrayed that he still liked me even after he knew that I'm not interested in men. 

The biggest problem for me is that I did essentially the same thing to one of my female best friends, but I eventually got over my crush and never told her about it. It kills me to think that maybe if she knew, we wouldn't be friends anymore, and I don't want that to happen between me and SK. I still think he's a wonderful person, but I don't know how to be around him comfortably anymore. 

Does anyone have advice on how to move forwards with our friendship, or how to silently distance myself from him if I can't handle being close friends? 

Thanks, and sorry for the long post.

38,"So at the beginning of the summer I planned to start a little business with one of my ""best friends"". Quotes because after highschool we never really talked that much but would still occasionally hang out. So the plan was to basically create a brand like everyone is doing these days and make apparel and do videography shit. I had been planning to do something like this for a while but I think the only reason I brought it up to him was because I honestly don't have any other friends. I really want someone else to do it with because making videos alone can be pretty hard and I'd like to have someone I could bounce off ideas with. But the thing is that I don't think my friend is going to add that much value to what I'm doing. I hope I don't sound arrogant because that's not my intention but I'm the only one who knows how to edit videos, I have the only camera out of us two, and I've known him long enough to know that he just doesn't have a good taste for visuals. I know everyone has different tastes but he's just not really the ""artsy"" type. The only value he brings is that he's very sociable and could network much easier than I can, I'm shy.  

We've tried to make plans to film and discuss things but *every time* we just have no idea what we're doing. On top of that he usually invites other people or is not very engaged in whatever we're doing. He will literally just play games while I'm on his computer trying to get shit going. After a couple repeated attempts at seeing if things would change, they never did. Just the same thing every time we hung out. So I started to distance myself from him because I'm a little bit under the impression he's just along for the ride and is going to expect me to put things into action. Maybe that's not true but that's what it feels like at least. 

So what do I tell him? Am I just being a bitch or is it fair that I don't want to continue this? Should I just remove him from my life completely? I might add that I know he has gone behind my back and told people things that were just supposed to be between us. Also pretty sure he's hustled me out of my money too. But for the most part he's always been a good friend and I've known him for years so I don't know what to do. I don't know who else I would ask, I suppose I could start this by myself but I don't think it would be too realistic considering it's film. Also I've just come to the realization that maybe the 9-5 life is for me (contrary to the mindset most kids my age have) and I should just pursue film as a hobby. Especially considering I don't know if I'll make friends since I'm so reserved. He does still hit me up and asks to hang out but I think it might just be because he has nothing else to do. I feel like an asshole for distancing myself but I'm just so lost. Please let me know your thoughts on all of this, it would be much appreciated. ",17Aug2018,1
39,"In school I really liked a girl for two years but never told her because she was on and off with a boyfriend. We had a weird friendship where we would talk to each other constantly some days and not at all other days. I went on a fucking roller coaster of emotions about her and wether I should tell her how I feel about her. I may be wrong but honestly I did feel like she felt the same for me in a way or at least knew how I felt, but I ruined everything.

We have a large house. -Wanted to buy a budgie and all necessary items with my own money. Was not allowed, as my grandparents think our house is overflowing. We have an elderly dog and a quiet cat. -Wanted to adopt a rescue kitten as my birthday present. Same excuse, too many pets. -Bought temporary hair dye as a confidence booster, was immediately glared at. Bought with my own money.

44,"I’ve known this person for 7 months now. I approached her first to become first. She seemed to be to be super friendly and down to earth when we first met, now she’s...changed. Uptight, looks down on people, just different. 

Granted, there were always issues with this friendship. We never hung out as much as I wanted to. Even when I’d message her first, she’d always say she’s busy or has something going on. That would happen 80-90% of the duration of our friendship. Now she‘s messaging me to hang out this weekend and I want to break it off over our hangout 2 week ago. 

So we met up at a restaurant and got some small plates and caught up. She told me how she’d lost her virginity while she was inebriated on holiday abroad. We are (were, I still am) celibate; and both decided to be so until we found someone we trust). The way she said it made it seem very shallow and disgusting. I just didn’t like how she described it all, and she said she had to tell me. I don’t have an issue with people sleeping with who they want to, but I just didn’t need to know that unless it was a significant life event like got a steady boyfriend or something. 

Not only that, but I never truly felt comfortable hanging out this girl. For example, our conversations were a bit forced and I didn’t feel 100% comfortable around her. I think this was exemplified when we last met up. We were talking about her going for her master’s degree and she basically looked down at me for not wanting to pursue one/further education. I told her I don’t want to pursue a master’s in my field, that I don’t see the point of it and that I’m satisfied where I am. I also expressed a disdain for corporate culture and 9-5 work, and my desire to get out of it. She kept pushing against this subtly and saying that certain companies pay for master’s degrees, when she knew I don’t care and already said I’m not interested in that.

What do you all think? I want to text her tomorrow saying I don’t think we mesh well together anymore, but the nice side of me wants to give her a chance even though I know I shouldn’t. I’d really appreciate any advice. ",17Aug2018,2
45,"I live in the middle east and live with my muslim family. I don't want to live here anymore. I have lost all faith in Islam and now I despise anything associated with it. Islam is worse than a cult. Going out of the house without a car is almost suicide because of how insane the temperatures can get. My father sees me as a disappointment and my mother does nothing to help or support me. Ever since I started kindergarten, I have felt very different from everyone around me, and I mean that in a bad way. People just behaved differently from what I behaved. They confused me and so were they confused by me. Anxiety continues to be a problem even if I'm out with ""friends"".

46,"I'm a rising junior that has done cross country and track for a year, but I have no volunteer hours or any other extracurriculars for college. This summer I screwed up, instead of working (Which really would've helped since my family doesn't make much money) or filling up my volunteer hours (0 currently), I chose to study for the SAT and attend summer practice for cross country. Now I'm planning to volunteer during the school year to make up for the lost hours I could've done freshman and sophomore year, but it looks very unlikely since I finish practice at 6pm-7pm usually. In addition, the meets during the weekends last a long time (ranging about 5-9 hours) and I'm not sure if I can squeeze any hours in. To make matters worse, I can't volunteer at the libraries and hospitals I've already applied to since I'm not able to be flexible with my schedule. At this point I'm thinking of quitting track to make room for volunteering and adding a few clubs as extracurriculars hopefully. Why this is a important decision for me is because once I quit, it's very unlikely I can rejoin since my coach expects us to be dedicated to track. I'm torn between leaving and staying in track and cross country because they have given me some of the best memories in my life (like winning first place during indoor and outdoor season), new friends that actually are friends and don't just only ask me for my grades or care about themselves, helped me cope with depression and stress, and kept me healthy. There are also other reasons like not having gym (total waste of time since we walk around most days) and not being judged, since society usually looks down at you for quitting something.

BTW sorry if this is actually a dumb question, but its an extremely difficult problem to me for some reason.

TLDR: I'm diverged between leaving track, which gives me time for volunteer hours, clubs, and work but I'll miss my friends, running, and having a strong mental mindset; and staying in track which greatly limits my chances to do other stuff but I'm able to hang out with good friends, stay healthy, and keeping an important extracurricular.

51,"I am a private tutor for a bunch of affluent kids in one of the richest parts of the world. Right now, I have one student whose mom says she loves me, but this student is disrespecting me beyond my comfort level. She is a 15 year-old and perhaps the most boy-crazy girl I have known in my life. Everything in our tutoring comes back to romance or marriage in some way or another. The trouble is that she knows I have a boyfriend, but she continues to bother me about the fact I am not engaged (and she has ideas that by my age-25-this is a must). Currently, I am trying to negotiate engagement with my bf of 2.5 years but I'm not sure I will be successful because he doesn't value marriage as much as I do (he did mention a few months ago that we could make it happen next Christmas, though I doubt he even remembers saying that at this point). I have yearned to love someone deeply and purely in a long-term relationship. However, after my first serious boyfriend in university raped me, I had to go to therapy to learn to trust another man again. I bought myself a ring (not a diamond one) for my middle finger, thinking that it could replace something I'd never get: an engagement ring. I also vowed to myself  10years ago that I'd gift my poetry to my true love when he proposed. 
Fast forward a few years I've been in a good relationship with my current 29 y/o bf of 2.5 years and anxiously awaiting engagement (because I have been an exceptionally loyal and selfless gf to him). I love my work because I care deeply about my students and their lives, but the fact this student is continuing to harass me about my lack of engagement (she rubs it in) is becoming too much. I'm crying on the inside at work. Besides going home and crying on the outside (and not telling my bf about all of this even though he lives with me), what can I do? I have to be professional with the student, but I can't let this situation continue. Telling her that we need to study doesn't work.

My ex broke up with me about a year ago now and I've spent that year growing but I also haven't gotten over her. At all. 

When she broke up with me, she blocked me on all social media, wouldn't respond to ANY text, and she would ignore me if we were in the same room as each other. 

About a month ago she unblocked me on Instagram and started following me.

But now she is back to not paying any attention to me at all/ignoring me.

56,"Let me start this off by saying I have trust issues due to past relationships. 

I trust my girlfriend of 6 (almost 7) months. She doesn’t have a lot girl friends but all her dude friends don’t t worry me. Except for one. Let’s call him Z. She is 2 years older than Z so he doesn’t go to the same school as me and her. Z and my girlfriend have a romantic past. They did everything before I came into her life. They kissed and gave eachother hickies almost ever time they would hangout. She even swore to and actually lost her virginity to him. 

I was talking to her as they were doing stuff together but she said they were only friends with benefits. Shortly after she had lost her virginity to him, she started talking me more and everyone else less including Z. A month later and me and my girlfriend started going out. She started to not like talking to Z but couldn’t bring herself to cut him off completely. I was fine with them talking but I would feel uneasy when they hung out (which only happened one time after we started going out).

But out of no where, Z started going to our school this year. My girlfriend saw him from the corner of her eye today and a couple hours later they made plans to hang this Friday. 

I’m not worried something will happen or that she’ll even allow something to happen because it’s been this long and I trust her but the fact that she saw him and made plans with him in such a short time makes me have a bad feeling because of their romantic past. They haven’t seen eachother in 8 months so they might just want to make up for the time but when I asked why the sudden plans she said “we just want to hang”

Part of me is saying not to worry but the other part is her on reddit scared their romantic past and the fact that they can see eachother whenever they want in school can jeopardize or relationship and how If i bring it up again (because we just talked about it and she told me not to worry) I could jeopardize our relationship... 

Should I be worried or am I just overreacting?

P.s. she is keeping the fact that she still talks to Z form her best friend since Z and her best friend used to go out. I’m afraid she’ll hide things from me like she does her best friend.

P.s.s. By hanging she’s just gonna stay after school with him. While we were talking about it she said “if it bothers you so much than why don’t u just tag along?” When she said it she turned her head and looked irritated.

He is so infuriating to talk to because he believes his ideas are Superior to my ideas because society thinks like I do. It's insane because his argument is always, it's because ""I don't think like you, I do what I want without whatever society tells me, so you'll never understand why I think using the n* word is okay"" ( we are not black).  I just want him to realize that he doesn't have the luxury to be picky about jobs right now and that he's being a selfish privledge prick. He needs to work hard to get where he wants, it's not entitled to him. He doesn't need a lucky break, he needs to work hard.

60,"Okay, so I'm an IEP student with ADD and Panick attacks. My teacher, who I'll call, Ms.Cast, is my Case manager as well as my IEP reading teacher. We got along typically well, and I never got a bad vibe off her. We even became close and I willing shared experiences from my life with her and vice versa, Eventually leading up to telling me she was pregnant. Eventually when a few months strolled around, she disappeared and I never saw her again. Of course I assumed she had taken leave to become a stay at home mom. But I was never given a new case manager and had to manage the rest of the year on my own. (which I did manage but unfortunately failed math so bad I had to go into credit recovery.) 

    This year (11th) I ran into a math IEP teacher who I'll just call Ms.Kay. Of course I was curious as to what happened to Ms.Cast, vaguely expecting to hear, ""Oh she had the baby and is just a stay at home mom now!"" But what I was told was rather alarming.

   Ms.Cast had a warrant for her arrest, fraud, possession of illegal drugs, theft, attempting to sell property that did not belong to her. Of course she was fired and arrest, but the problem lies as, why was I never informed of this? This woman had ALL of my personal information and IEP case. And yet I was never informed that she was even fired, nor was I ever given another case manager. Should I honestly be concerned?",17Aug2018,1
61,"Whether with classmates, friends, or coworkers in a group of 3, I dread feeling unwanted and like I'm not included, to the point of breaking down and crying, as childish and embarrassing at it sounds. One time it got so bad I would keep ditching class to avoid the feeling, and ended up failing the program, so I had to move on to another one.

Examples including, not being able to take part in a group project where there can only be pairs, and not being able to take part in conversations with jokes and topics not related to me.

It's my graduating year of uni and I don't want to mess up any relationships due to breaking down and crying since I've noticed a pattern of it happening at work and school where people get quite a bit distant with me after it and I hate it so much. It's my biggest weakness and insecurity. 

Advice of any sort would be appreciated, thanks. ",17Aug2018,1
62,"A little background: I started college last fall at a small university in the middle of nowhere in another state. Going into school I didn't know a single soul, but I ended up making a bunch of amazing friends who genuinely care about me. I had an amazing time, but a lot of bad things happened there. I was taken advantage of multiple times by guys and developed a severe drinking problem. My problem got me arrest there and ultimately I left school half way through the second semester to get help. Now I am sober and have worked mostly everything out at home and have to make a decision to either 1. go back to the school I left or 2. transfer to a school in the city of Chicago.

Option 1. Go back to the school that I left

Pros:

\-I know the school already and feel comfortable there

\-I'm used to being at a small school

\-I have so many supportive friends there

\-I made so many good memories there

\-I wouldn't wonder what if

\-I could try a semester out and if I don't like it I could transfer

\-There is an out patient recovery center not far from campus

\-If it goes well and I stay four years I would be getting a good degree

\-They have a pretty good bio program

\-Smaller classes

Cons:

\-I don't really get a fresh start

\-It's a small school and everyone witnessed my drinking problem first hand

\-I have to deal with the mess I made when I had a drinking problem

\-I've changed a lot

\-Some of my close friends there have their own substance abuse issues

\-I'm 4 hours from home

\-The school is in the middle of nowhere

\-The school is 70% greek life and I chose not to rush last year and not being in a sorority will impact my social life and if I choose to rush this year I don't know if I'd get into a sorority because I pissed so many people off

\-I have to see people that hurt me physically

\-All there is to do there is go to frat parties

\-I would have to leave for school in the next few days

\-I feel unprepared

\-The school is far from everything

\-The school administration would be watching me closely and-I can't afford to fuck up at all

Option 2. Transfer to the city

Pros:

\-Classes start later so I will have more time to get everything together

\-My family lives less than an hour away

\-Better support for my recovery and easier to stay sober

\-A lot of AA meetings and sober events so I can get to know other young sober people

\-A fresh start

\-Living in my own apartment

\-I get to experience the city

\-So much more to do while being sober

\-I have the ability to easily go home for my doctor's appointments (I have a couple that would be hard to set up if I go back to the other school)

\-Not in the middle of no where and I can easily go to any store

\-I can eat healthier more easily

\-I have the opportunity to get my GPA up and transfer to a school that could be better than the school I originally attended

Cons:

\-I don't have any friends that go to that school

\-I would be leaving behind all of the friends that I made and who went through the lowest part of my life with me and still stood by my side

\-I'm not used to living in the city or being on a big campus

\-It's a commuter school so it's harder to make friends

\-I would have to start over another time after getting there because my plan is to go to the city for a year to get my GPA up to transfer to a better school

\-I will always wonder what could have been at the other school

\-Doesn't have the campus feel that the other school does

I have lost sleep over this decision for months and have no idea what the best option is.

tl;dr I left the first college I've ever attended half a semester early to get help for my drinking problem. Should I try the old school out for a semester to see how it goes or should I leave behind what is comfortable to me and start over at a commuter school in one of the biggest cities in America?",17Aug2018,3
63,"I have a friend who I met through work and have known for almost 5 years now. He's getting married in a few weeks but I haven't gotten a wedding invitation. I didn't even get a save-the-date. The weird thing is that *I was* invited to both his engagement party and his bachelor party. His bachelor party wasn't even local. I had to fly cross-country to be there. I was thinking of asking him something along the lines ""Hey, did you send me an invite? Just checkin'..."" but I wonder if I should just accept the fact that I wasn't invited. I should add that another layer of weirdness that has me even more confused is that he feels very comfortable talking to me about his wedding plans and what not but never has asked me if I got an invitation or anything like that. I'm both frustrated and hurt. Anyway... any advice? ",17Aug2018,1
64,"So I wake up this morning to check my results, and it seems my lecturers from this past sem really hated me (totally my fault, though), because I managed to fail five subjects out of seven. I was never happy there, but I never told my parents, even though they probably could/would have done something about it. I kind of feel like a failure and I have no idea what to do next, or how to face my parents, own up to my mistakes, and ask them for advice",17Aug2018,1
65,"I work in a smallish store. The managers have always been great and one week they threw us ""employee appreciation week"" Where they bought us gifts from the store every day and bought pizza and food. It felt a little over the top but it was a great week, and we were severely understaffed during a busy time so that kept moral up. 

So lately things have been going great (we're the fastest growing store in the company) but also stressful and the 4 people who are managers are feeling underappreciated, especially since our CEO (and other such cooperate people) is a dick; and several sectors are a little incompetent, making things difficult for us on the retail end (this is all owned by the same people). 

So I had the idea of a surprise pot luck. I got everybody in a group text and almost everyone is bringing something. The thing is, a lot of that crew that was here for employee appreciation week aren't there any more, and a lot of it is newer people. I also just got a promotion. So... I'm just afraid that it looks a little strange that I'd decorate a table cloth with pipe cleaner art and hat pins for the people promoting me lol. I mean, it's not to get the promotion, I already have it (there will also be lots of free pipe cleaners are party favors). But I just know there must be some negative connotation, maybe standing out just gives me anxiety. That's why it took me so long to get the promotion in the first place. 

So yay or nay no the pipe cleaner art?",17Aug2018,1

As it is in fact my biggest problem, all in all.

In regards to my worries about life: Months ago, I felt certain about my future, about what I wanted. As in, having a family, being a mom and getting married some day. After some incidents in my personal life and revolving around my relationships, I've completely changed my mind. Now I feel like I don't want that until five years plus from now. I'm looking to live life fully instead, as in: following my dreams  and changing up or expanding on work, friends, day to day life and hobbies, self-improvement and self-love.

Somehow, my change of thoughts and wants are making me feel quite guilty and conflicted. Especially because that my mean that it will bring drastic changes to those relationships. Now I'm tip toeing around these lingering thoughts and it is slowly bringing up my anxiety and depression. I can feel it lingering and back when it started, it was at its worst.

68,"Our friendship group has like, at the minimum, one or two arguments a week. There's about 7 of us altogether, however one of them lives about 6 hours away, and one is just an internet friend who lives in a completely different country.

The leading cause of these arguments are meet-up plans never following through. For example, we all agreed last weekend to head up to the city this Saturday. We haven't been up there in months, so thought it would be a good idea. There's typically only four of us that would be going out, and two of us four, once again, cannot make it.

This just sparked a huge fucking argument in our group chat, because it's the same two people who cannot make it about 95% of the time. I, personally, am sick of these fucking arguments, and I seriously don't know what to do.

These guys are literally the only friends I have, and I don't exactly want to throw them out and be left with nothing.

There's also another issue - one of the dude's who, again, 95% of the time cannot make it, always tries to make it seem that we are at fault by moaning at him. Thing is, if there was no moaning, nothing would change. 

Man, I don't know what to do. This may seem like such a petty fucking thing, but it causes so much stress.",17Aug2018,1
69,"Hi guys,
About a year ago a friend (F1) and I both decided that another friend (F2) of ours was just using us and we ended the friendship (Alot more to it as to why but no need to go into it).

I did it first and F1 agreed with me.
 I did not care if she continued the friendship! but she felt the same way about F2. F2 and F1 knew each other since 2 yrs old and F2 didnt even invite F1 to her wedding etc. Just things like that is why she didn't want to be friends. Which is same reasons why I didn't. (Again a lot more)

It has been a year and we have been joined at the hip. She was my maid of honour. Im her sons god mother etc. And 3 weeks ago out of no where she stopped answering my calls and replying to my texts. Today I found out why. She is hanging out with this F2 again...which to be honest I don't care. F2 and I always bump into one another and end up having a coffee and catching up for 30 minutes. Then parting way. Me and F2 dont hate each other. We just dont spend time together.

But what is upsetting is she wont answer calls or texts all because she is with this other girl now like I'm replaced. And for some reason I know F2 will hurt her like always and F1 will come back to me like nothing has happened because she has not said anything just ignored me. What would you do? Say something? Wait it out? 

Personally Im just worried that she is going to ignore me for weeks and months and then get hurt and try come crawling back acting like nothing has happened and to be honest Im to nice and would probably hurt but let it. That is why i think maybe something needs to be done now? I am sick of people taking advantage of me. They only want me when they need me and when there is someone better in their lives they disappear...then come back qhen that person stuffs them over. And Im always them one with my arms open.

72,"Throwaway account, obviously. Also, sorry that this is long. 

My mother has been a fairly severe alcoholic most of my life. If anything minutely goes wrong in her life, she’s thrown into a chaotic trend of downing liquor like her life depends on it, and blames the world around her for her issues. Her bipolar disorder doesn’t exactly help. 

I’m currently living with her, partially for my own financial situation, but also to look after her. 

In this last month, I believe (thanks to Mr Google) that I’m seeing signs of some sort of liver disease in her. Because we don’t have insurance, she refuses to go to a hospital, but she had shown signs of getting better over time, at least until about five days ago. 

She hasn’t left her bed. She hasn’t eaten. Thankfully, she has had water, and no liquor at least in two days, but she has no strength whatsoever and has literally had me come to help her move her position in her bed every 30 minutes to 2 hours. I know for a fact that she has defecated herself in her bed and might not even realize it. The whites of her eyes are tinted yellow and she has a faint look of fear, like she doesn’t know what’s going on or is just freaked out. 

The few questions I’ve asked she’s been able to answer fairly clear-headed, but every time I say that she NEEDS to see a doctor, she absolutely refuses. I think it’s a mix of embarrassment and that we don’t have the money. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve slept a grand total of five hours in two days, I have to work, and I need some sanity.

For someone who is absolutely poor, taking care of someone who is also poor without insurance...what do I do? I’m scared to death, I feel I have no one to talk to. ",17Aug2018,1

Everyone is telling me that it shows that it wasn’t my fault. But I can’t help but blame myself (HR said the person who was training me said I wasn’t learning fast enough even though I only had 3 days of training the the other days were online classes) anyway I got a new job and for the past week since they called me offering me the job I have thought ‘I wonder how long this one will last’ and have talked to everyone I know in terms of ‘IF this job works out’.  

My first day was today and since I got home I have been so anxious, in tears, heart beating fast, sweating, shaking and can barely breathe and worrying nonstop about if I did anything wrong. I have dealt with anxiety before but this is absolutely crippling. Anyone have any advice for me?

75,"o i graduated university a few months ago and i got super lucky in getting the job i have. It has to do with my degree and the pay is decent , and i have no experience compared to my coworkers . They all have or are working on their Masters or have some experience, i just got lucky. The job was going okay at first and i was slowly learning, but then i was emotionally abused by my ex mans and i was a mess . I showed up to a learning season of how to deal with conflict the day after the breakup and i was. mess . I did not look good and i was disassociating and clearly not paying attention and kept leaving to ground myself. My boss was there and defs noticed and her and my other boss talked to me and asked if i had a substance abuse problem bc of how i was acting and that they can provide help. I broke down and told them partial truth, that things ended with him , but i did not go into details over how awful it has been. I was crying and they were understanding , i made it clear it as not drugs and this is truth . So that was two weeks ago. I got pulled in and told i had not been performing well since then and that they have seen no improvement and they’re concerned. They asked if anything else was going on and i said no, i told them i’m feeling better and have started seeing a therapist, which is true.

they said i have a week to show growth and have me a list of expectations. Basically i have not been “present “ and just not paying attending and not working as hard as i should, and need to interact more with clients / coworkers, take less bathroom breaks . I agree i need to step it up and apologize. They said i have this upcoming week to improve or they’re gonna have to let me go. It’s been really hard to stay focused and not break down at any minute and i am so disappointed in myself .

Since then i have been working my ass off and it’s defs been noticed my coworkers bc they said so . I’m so embarrassed at this . I really want to keep my job and getting fired is the last thing i need, but they are being very understanding. Most places would fire you right away after only working there less than 2 months.

78," I envy my sister who almost never take things less personally, simpler, more efficient, unwaveringly stick to the facts, make choices with their head, seek logical conclusions and want to be fair/unbiased. Calm, rational, efficient and objective.  Isn't that how all people should be? Facts matter more than feelings to her, she's less emotional than me.  She notices patterns and inconsistencies in people's behavior. She does not need help with her self-esteem. She is not impressionable. There is not much to correct her because she has her stuff together.  Always has the right answer. Rarely feels deeply self-conscious. Doesn't care what others think of her.

This started when my dad passed away, and I spent much more time making artwork in my studio and being alone. I'm relatively outgoing, but I felt really comforted in the catharsis of making and being in my own space alone. I am wondering if this triggered my sense of detachment and isolation. It's been almost 3 years now, and this feeling hasn't really subsided.

I won't even think about it  or remember this happens until I leave my friends and shut my car door. It's almost instantaneous and i immediately reflect on my existence and the futility of life. I feel deeply saddened, and it is never truthful of how I feel about my friends or the time we just shared. But it continues happening.

It's been much harder for me to go out and do anything the past few years. I generally feel much more apathetic about leaving home or exploring about. My interest in my
Hobbies has decreased, or at least my ability to engage in them has.

I guess I would personally not ask a SO about their past unless they brought it up and wanted to talk about it, but wanted to see how other people felt about it. It just seems like something that isn’t really my business unless it has to be, like their ex is crazy sociopath, someone I actually know/run into, etc.

I’m a woman and was talking to an older guy (i.e. 20+ yrs older) and he asked me about previous partners. I’m not sexually experienced by any means (in early 20s, only 1 serious partner so far). I should clarify that this guy and I are not serious (yet?), we're just casually talking. When I mentioned the one guy I was serious with for a few years and explained it ended because one of us moved far away, he just asked if that was it, meaning only the one guy.

I feel like I’m a shitty person for a number of reasons, i feel like I’m selfish, i feel like many of my thoughts are selfish as well as just mean and cold hearted. At the same time I do my best to be a good person, when I see needy on the train or anywhere on my way to work, I’ll give them what I can, heck sometimes I’ll even give them my whole lunch. I help mothers carry their strollers, and I help the blind up the stairs. I try to give advice to anyone I can, when they need it. But at the same time I just feel like an ultimately shitty human being. I catch myself judging people so hard that I always step back and say, “what the fuck, why did I just do that”. I do it way too hard and way too often. I feel like sometimes maybe that rubs off on those around me. I’ve never had a relationship that lasts more than 3 months, I have extremely bad luck in that department and maybe that adds to my cynicism. Sometimes when I’m at home, I feel even I’m rude to my parents subconsciously. If Im home on a Friday night and they’ll ask, “wanna watch a movie with us?” I’ll jokingly reply, “pshhht I don’t want to be here lol”, and I’ll go smoke a joint or something. I’ve been saving heavily for a trip to Japan for next year, and I feel like that’s all I talk about with them.

I really enjoy it honestly, dancing is great stress relief, I love meeting new people, there's always music, it's help me overcome my social anxiety, and I've made wonderful friends. The club I work at its very safe and the staff is kind and protective and I never do anything but talk to people and give them a clean dance (not fully nude, I never do any extras, and I don't meet customers outside of the club). But this is purely temporary until I can complete my degree, I have no intentions of doing this long term.

Unfortunately, my family found out and is being very hateful over it. My mom told me that anyone who dances has ""major issues,"" that I'll be exposed to drugs, my boyfriend will dump me (we discussed it before I started and he totally respects that I need to do this for college and isn't jealous) etc. They don't even care to hear me out. 

My sister was also told all kinds of crazy bullshit I supposedly said about her, none of which is true but she won't believe me. Honestly, I think our relationship is completely ruined now. What really hurts is that my family has been far more disrespectful and hateful than any customer I've ever encountered. 

They also immediately jumped to money too, because that's all my dad seems to give a shit about. My dad gave my boyfriend a phone he had laying around a few months ago and was keeping me on his insurance because it's way cheaper that way. All he cared to say was that I need to return the phone and get my own damn insurance. He cancelled both within an hour, even though it was paid for by month. They also want to take my car, which was both my Christmas and birthday present, which they told me they paid for with my inheritance from a family member who passed away. They kept it in their name so I really can't do anything about it. They have like 3 spare cars just laying around which they never use already, so this is really just spite/punishment. 

I just don't know if I can continue to have a relationship with them, or even if I should, considering how hateful and judgmental they've been. Just because I dance doesn't make me any less of a human being.. I'm just doing what I need to. Should I try to fix this somehow, or go NC? If so, how can I fix it? It feels like they really don't care what I have to say and my privacy just feels so invaded. We've always had an extremely rocky relationship and this is really nothing new or unexpected whatsoever.. Is what I'm doing really so horrible?


TLDR; My family found out I'm a dancer and has been really hateful and spiteful about it. ",17Aug2018,3
90,"Hey everyone,

I’d like to start that I am a female early twenties and my boss is male like late fifties (who is also NO WHERE EVEN CLOSE to Jeffrey Dean Morgan level dad hotness”

So I’ve been working with this company for about two years now but this guy has been my boss only for one.

I just kind of need to figure out if my boss is flirting with me or that’s just his “dad” sense of humour and him trying to be funny.

We work in a pretty small office and we don’t have any sort of dress code since we aren’t dealing with the public at all, I like to dress pretty comfortable so I’m usually wearing a graphic tee/hoodie and sweats definitely not trying to look cute. He will always make a comment about my shirts trying to spark conversation but will keep talking about it asking me questions about my interests and comparing with his his own.

He will also go out of his way to point out something I’m doing, or bring up things I’ve said in the past, or I’ll catch him briefly staring at me.

He also gives me lost of little compliments about various things,  will extend one liner jokes I said in person by messaging me later with a joke or fact relevant to whatever I had said.

The flirting wouldn’t be unwelcome but I’m the newest and youngest person in my office and because it’s a small group of people would definitely be extraaaaa bad in part to him being my boss.

Idk I just want to know what others think",17Aug2018,1

However, I would like to save money and may travel too. I'm also worried that I might have problems with women if I'm making less some of them.

I'd rather do a job that is active, not sitting in front of a computer all day. I love to socialize as well. I'd rather do what I like as well for a living.

He did tell me in the very beginning of us talking that he was “working on things with the ex” BUT he told me I changed things and she wasn’t even a thought to him anymore. I was his one and only. He didn’t want his ex at all anymore. He said he couldn’t get over how much he likes me and how happy he is that we found each other, he never wants to lose me. 

I nicely confronted him about the post, and he said he needed space, he was confused. I told him no I was upset but I said maybe we can reconnect down the road. He agreed. Then he Blocked me and deleted his IG

On Tuesday he unblocked me and reinstalled his IG. He’s actively online but no message. 

I did send him some cheesy messages while he had me on block bc I didn’t think he would ever come back so when he unblocked I saw he read them. (they just said I was sad and wanted to talk about things)

104," I'm a long term user on Reddit, but I opted for a throwaway account for this one. I really don't know what other forum can handle this question. If anyone can recommend another sub that is better suited please let me know.

As the title says, my mother is in a terrible situation. I'm not even sure how to frame this question. Am I asking how to help her, or am I asking how to help me (and by extension my wife and kids)? I'll dive into the details and perhaps a question will arise.

My mother is 60 years old. She's been single for decades. For a long, long time, she's struggled with mental illness. It's debilitating to her. She's never really opened up to me about the specific diagnosis, but I know it's something like 'extreme anxiety/depression disorder'. In her case, it's presented in a variety of ways. She's virtually an agoraphobe. She can only travel to certain parts of our city and only along certain paths. She has frequent panic attacks. Virtually every interaction or event that she has, in her mind, is negative. The complaining is incessant: this person is dumb, this company is trying to rob me, etc. etc. She also has a problem with hoarding, or to put it politely, she accumulates a lot of things that she doesn't need or use, and the thought of throwing those things away creates visible anxiety. For example, her house is basically just a pathway from room to room, with a waist-high accumulation of stuff everywhere else. She's currently seeing a psychologist and a cognitive behavioral therapist (two separate people) and has been for about a year. I'm not sure what meds she is on, but it's a cocktail of three or four different pills.

Now for the meat and potatoes. Two weeks ago she broker her ankle. She was walking her dog near the river in our town and fell. She's had surgery and the ankle is repaired with a metal plate. She'll be non-weight-bearing on that foot for something like 8 weeks, but then she'll be fine. The last two weeks have been really difficult on me and my family. Due to her mental health issues, she really resisted any type of medical care. The examples here are plentiful, but I guess the most salient one was when she was about to have surgery and she was very rude to me and my wife, saying how we're plotting against her, this was our idea, she doesn't need surgery, nothing is wrong, we want her to die so we can get her money. It was very difficult to hear.

Before her surgery my wife and I were hugely concerned about her well-being. She doesn't eat or take care of herself, including basic hygiene, getting dressed, regular exercise, social engagement, and house-keeping. Before all of this happened my wife and I would talk about how long it would be before she has to live in an assisted living facility. Also, last summer my maternal grandmother died. That story deserves its own post and a team of Viennese psychologists to dissect it. Suffice it to say, my mom is basically emotionally destroyed because of that death. Even though, and this is 100% true, my mom and grandmother had a terrible relationship and they did not like each other. My mom craved approval, and my grandmother withheld it. My mom's mental illness has twisted that relationship into some loving, kind, warm maternal relationship that just never existed. She mourns something that never was. To circle back to the hoarding, my grandmother's wishes were for her ashes to be scattered. My mom raised such a fuss to her siblings, that they actually agreed to split the ashes and give my mom an urn. My mom wanted to get a grave plot so she could visit. It pains me to write this, but my mother keeps those ashes in an upstairs towel closet, on the top shelf in the back. It's so incredibly . . . . pathetic. I just don't know what to say. It shocked me when I found them a few weeks ago.

My mother is receiving home health care while she's immobile from the surgery, but they're not set up to fix this. The root cause of so many of her problems is her mental state. She really needs to be admitted to a long term psychiatric hospital, but she'll never consent to that. My mother has verbalized suicidal ideations to me and my wife before, and I've reported those to her psychologist, but she's never been put on a psych hold at a hospital.

I've rambled enough. I don't know what to do. I mean, she's so far gone mentally I don't ever see her recovering to the point where she could enjoy spending time with my kids, her grandchildren. She has moments of lucidity, but when the time comes for action she crumbles and reverts to her typical excuses: I'm too tired, I'm too anxious, I have a headache.

My wife and I cannot be her caretakers. We have careers and kids of our own. We also don't need her poisonous personality in our home and relationship. What then, are the options? I've tried, and failed, to get her into a short term mental hospital. I've also tried, and failed, to get her to agree to go into an assisted living facility. Do I just watch her die by herself in her home alone? What do I do to prevent her from further damaging my family? Do I cut her off? I've been thinking about this problem for weeks now and I have no answers.

(Sorry for typos I'm kinda bad at typing) ok so basically I'm not sure rather or not I have depression or something around there. My whole life, especially through out high school, I've had some trouble doing almost anything. either At first, everything I did I felt either like people were judging me or I looked absolutely stupid. Like for example if I was sitting in class not paying attention as always, if ANYBODY laughed at any point I would feel as if they're laughing at me. Like I did something wrong and they laughed. Or say when you walked into class late and people looked at you, also was very draining. Even at lunch as I was walking thru the hallways to eat or do anything, people were judging me. And as I got older this kinda evolved into a empty feeling. Like I got used to the feeling and just did not care. At all. Like everything I did didn't matter. It resulted in me failing classes and I barely graduated on time. Now that I've somehow made it through high school, I have a slight sense of need to get things done and it's almost like it's going away but it's almost like the original ""judging"" issues are coming back. And now it's not when I'm around people, but just the opposite. Whenever I am alone for any time I tell myself things that probably aren't true. And I just get into these moods where I'm either sad for almost no real reason or I'm frustrated at just everything. Now that I'm almost 18, I feel I need to take this more serious. I want to get this obstacle tackled and move on, I just don't know where to start.

Since then however, he has become horribly depressed, somewhat alchoholic and has treated my very badly. He takes all of his anger out on me, yelling at me for sometimes an hour or more straight. Anytime something is wrong he blames me imediately. My sister on the other hand he never yells at, and he never makes her be accountable for mistakes she makes. 

Anyway last year it got so bad that I was extremely suicidal and nearly ended my life, I’ve been in therapy since and I feel much better. However, I came to realize in therapy that I don’t want him to be a role-model and I no longer wish to call him “dad.” What would be a good way to approach this? Bring it up to my mom? What do I do?",17Aug2018,1
127,"I want the baby, either to parent or give up for adoption. 

Baby daddy doesn’t, and says he can’t live with himself knowing he has a child somewhere out there. He threatened to tell my entire family about my past infidelities and other sins if I don’t have an abortion. He claims his threats are from a place of desperation, not malice. He offered to pay $80,000+ worth of my student loans (I would get this contracted) should I have an abortion. 

I’m 14 weeks along. Now is definitely not an entire time to have a child, as I’m in my first year of graduate school, and I could definitely use the money. This offer has made me reevaluate my entire moral compass.

128,"     A few years ago I started texting this guy through a dating app. We hit it off extremely well, but lived a few hours apart and neither of us were willing to make the drive between college and work. We talked through the months, flirting with each other, having more meaningful conversation, Skyping occasionally, but when in talks about a deeper relationship it was always out of the question for him because of the distance (and his eventual exchange program). 
     I met another guy and started seriously talking to him  but still keeping loose contact with the dating app guy. Guy #2 and I started dating, and he started getting a little jealous of Guy #1 and I’s relationship. Soon after the opportunity arose where I would pass through the area Guy #1 lived, and we set up a time to finally meet. I only wanted to meet this amazing person I had been talking to for the past months, and didn’t let anything progress past hugging... but there was a longing, especially on his side. 
     I’m ashamed to say after we met, I ghosted him for the better of my relationship with Guy #2. I was young, and too scared and awkward to provide an explanation- so I blocked the only way I had to contact him and put the memories in a box. He certainly deserved a better explanation then radio silence, and it’s been a few years since it happened and I was such a minuscule part of his life he might now even remember me... but I recently found his Facebook and wanted to send him good wishes without sounding too awkward or stalker like. Maybe I am because it’s been too long. I don’t know.

132,"Hi
I'm looking for some quite specific advice about how to go about reconnecting with my niece. She is almost 13. 
Almost two years ago, I helped my parents take custody of her and her brother following my sister's neglect spurned on by drug abuse. 
I looked after her a lot during this time. 
In march of this year, I fell seriously ill and had to stop writing to her. Now I've been reconnecting with her via email but it's hard to reinitiate the relationship. I worry I may have lost her trust by losing touch for a while. 
I can't connect through her mum (who she is now back living with). We fell out during the custody saga. 
It is important to me to be present for my niece, even though I'm physically miles away. I want to be there for her at least through other means.
Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you ",17Aug2018,1

134,"Hey, am just about to snap rn, I already got so angry hat I ended up hitting my head and i feel very lightheaded right now. 

All my friends rather play video games instead of hanging out irl. And am having this issue that video games are making me into a sadist by thinking of inflicting physical pain on the person that ends up ‘beating and mocking me’ in the game. This is also made worse that everyone my age basically sees being good in video games and something very desirable. If its not video games, they tend to have a very competitive hobby that I have no interests in bring in. People are just being too competitive around me and its making me start to snap in ways I don’t want to.

I dont even know what am capable of because I had a dream were someone was mocking me for being worthless and I ended up disemboweling him.

135,"I (21f) have a great boyfriend (29m). He’s really a good guy.

Though an issue I have is this and it’s really starting to get to me: 

I feel guilty all of the time and I know sometimes I’m the asshole (because I know sometimes I unintentionally tease him and accidentally maybe take it too far— at least from his point of view and of course he gets upset), but other times I feel like he just gets upset for stuff I think is no big deal (like today he asked me to use his money to buy something for our apartment, but I told him “no” I wanted to use my money for this thing because he’s been buying so much for us lately and he got upset). Then I end up feeling really guilty. I feel like I’m constantly apologizing. While these episodes don’t last longer than 30 min, it happens at least everyday and sometimes multiple times a day. It’s exhausting, it really hurts me, and it doesn’t seem constructive. 

I just don’t know how to handle this situation. I’m sick of saying “I’m sorry” and feeling guilty.  I really want this relationship to work though. How do I bring this up to him and begin to fix this?

139,"There's this woman (I'll call her Liz) who lives in my area and has liked me on both OkCupid when I was on it earlier this year and Tinder. I was already dating another woman earlier when Liz liked me and I deleted my OkCupid account without ever talking to Liz because I was expecting the date to turn into something more serious. But it didn't.

I never went back to OkC and instead stuck with Tinder with no luck. I came across Liz again last night and super liked her. She's fairly attractive and we have a bit in common so it seemed perfect. She liked me back this morning and I replied within 15 minutes of her liking me back. I had gotten out of the shower and noticed the match and responded then. I just responded something light, saying hi and asking about her favorite dessert (since that's what she mentioned on her bio).

It's past 12 hours without a reply. Normally I unmatch with women who don't respond but I'm feeling different about her than others.

I kind of want advice from you guys and gals: do you think I should

A: Wait for her to respond. If so, how long do you think is a good time to wait?

B: Send a second message, kind of a nudging reminder that I haven't left. If so, what do you think I should say?

C: Unmatch with her now.

When she liked me on OkC, she never sent me a message and I never sent her one back. I also didn't like her back on there and I have completely different, newer pictures, so she may not know that I'm the same guy as before. The thought crossed my mind that maybe she wants revenge for me not responding, but I don't think that since she likely doesn't remember me from OkC.

I don't get a lot of matches and she checks off a lot of important boxes for me in terms of someone I'd like to date. Basically, a specific religious preference is a must for me and she happens to be the same way and I see, maybe, 1 woman who has the same religious preference per 2 weeks, so it's incredibly rare to come across someone like this that fits my preferences so well.

I understand life comes up and all that, but it seems strange not to reply back. She's also not the first woman to respond yet not unmatch with me so I'm kinda wondering if something else is going on, maybe with me or Tinder.",17Aug2018,1

He got terrible grades and was always drawing (he's a very good artist though). I found him mysterious and decided to get to know him. I found that he was incredibly smart but it became clear why he didn't have friends. He was new at our school and we were both very interested in all forms of art. For a month I was spending as much time with him as I could (we'd get lunch, talk after school and text for hours). One day I sent him somewhat revealing pics and he didn't respond. I decided to tell him it'd be best we just stay friends and he started freaking out. He's what most people would probably call ""crazy"" though. After this, each time I'd talk to him he'd fill me in on something most people don't tell anyone. Told me about getting beat as a kid, told me about his mom's meth habit, told me about how his dad's in prison, told me about the time he witnessed a murder, being homeless by himself as a child. His mood swings were insane. He became very clingy to me and he was socially incapable of talking to anyone else. It seemed like he was trying to force closeness between us and win me back.

147,"Im a high school senior right now and up to this point I've don't alright in all my classes and soon it's gonna be time to start applying for colleges and embarking into the world as an adult. It seems that nowadays everyone has a built in mentality that if they don't go to college they will be homeless and never be successful. As true as it sounds, college has always gave me chills. The hard work, the time management, the costs, it's like there's multiple forces working against you just to make you quit college. I've always heard about people doing what they love and doing what their hearts desire, and I look at so many adults nowadays who do a certain job just because they get a paycheck and they are unhappy and stressed. I always convinced myself that when I got to college I would major in computer science and go to a great college. It's all still possible but I would hate the work load and I would hate all the expectations. Soon all a bachelor's gonna get anyone is the minimum since everyone is getting one. 

I have always loved music and playing guitar, singing and entertaining people. I have also always wanted to travel the country, the world, and spread my name.

I've been recovering from that through therapy, as well as recovering my strength and weight. (Currently fluctating around 70 kg)

Now I've been thinking, questioning, doubting as my anxious mind tends to do. How do I quit a personal trainer? I simply can't afford it anymore. With my current expenses it has become too draining.

I feel loyal to my personal trainer. He has become a good friend. He has seen me during my down period as well as supported me throughout it. I feel guilty for quitting on him, but really the money is gone.

This got me talking to a close friend and he mentioned he started training/lifting again recently. One thing lead to another and we talked some more about it, including his offer to write up a training program. As a physical education teacher he probaly knows a thing or two. So I could team up with him and it will be much cheaper for just paying the gym membership ^^;

I'll admit that our relationship going to shit is almost entirely my fault. I have not been in a great spot mentally this past year or so and I seem to blame it all on him. I don't blow up on my dad ever, and keep my feelings about how his overbearing traits bother me so much to myself. I know my dad loves me and just wants the best for me but it's sometimes hard to see through the annoying things he does.

161,"Throw away account for starters.

My life is good. Like really good. Own my own very successful business, a great house. Married over a decade to a woman who is gorgeous inside and out. 2 amazing kids. Great pooch. Lots of hobbies. Lots of friends.

But I hate myself.

It’s brutal. Everyone sees me as this happy go lucky guy. But inside I’m miserable. 

It all started a year ago. My wife says she wants a change in our marriage. I had literally been working at being a better me for a solid three years. Lost a bunch of weight, gained an exuberant amount of patience and self confidence, just overall everything seemed amazing. But my wife, who I love so much hits me out of the blue with this “I need a change.” Find out a month or so later about this young guy from her work that has caught her eye. My wife is stunning, and I’m not that special to look at. Handsome enough, but nothing to write home about. We go through counselling, and everything seems to just click better than ever. She says she’ll stop contact with this guy (8 years her junior and very good looking) and everything seems to go back to normal. Better than normal, we start falling in love all over again. Truthfully I had never stopped even for a second loving her, but things were two way again. Than the lies start. 

Soon enough I find out she is still in contact with this guy. Nothing romantic on his end, but her feelings are getting more serious. I don’t know what to do, but I stay cool and I leave it up to her. She quits her job and promises she is cutting that relationship off. I truthfully believe her. She gave me all her passwords, and constantly left her phone in the open which I checked. It was a weird, scary time. Things have gotten better between us. I don’t hold it over head and she constantly reminds me that she sorry and totally committed. But I’m not the same now. Scared, and internally depressed. I had just started to like myself, and now I’m back to a state of self loathing. No one knows and I hide it well because I just want her and our kids to feel loved and appreciated. I want her to feel like I’m over everything because I’m not perfect and I don’t expect her to be either. But inside I’m a mess. I drink myself silly most nights after she falls asleep and just overall feel insignificant and shitty. I’ve seen counsellors and doctors and have bared my soul, and as much as they help, I can’t help but feel like I don’t deserve her or this life. 

Even as I write this I feel stupid. My life feels too good to hate myself this much. Is this normal? I mean, I am not suicidal, but I feel like I’m another bad thing away from just giving up on everything... how do I get back to being me?

I don’t want to leave my wife. I wasn’t always a good husband, not unfaithful but distant at times and often impatient and sometimes angry. My wife stood by me in that time. I’m just not sure what the best course of action is to be me again.

163,"Last holiday season i got hired at a very fun cosmetics store (Lush.) I was hired along with a very large group and we all had the chance to possibly be kept on the team after the holidays since they needed more employees in general. I gave everything to this job and loved it with all my heart. I was so loyal and would come in or stay late anytime they needed me. I loved my coworkers and we had such a bond, or so it seemed.

When the holidays we’re over, all of us seasonal workers applied to become permanent members of the team. I was not rehired, which i could not understand since i tried so hard, and it seemed like everyone else got rehired but me. I didn’t understand. Everyone on the team (who wasn’t just seasonal and were there a long time) told me every week how i was looking like such a permanent member and how well i was doing. I was really hurt.

I got a phone call telling me i wasn’t going to stay after holiday. They said they didn’t feel like i was where they wanted me to be by now, whatever that means. That made no sense to me since they would all constantly tell me how far i’ve come and that i really seemed like a permanent member. I was crushed. Everyone i made friends with there, mostly the employees who have been their forever, seemed to no longer talk to me and i didn’t understand why since we had so much fun before. The manager who called and broke the news to me told me i could reapply in the future and that i could call with any questions. I did call and ask what i could do next time to be better and become a permanent member, but she never called back.

I had to look for a new job. I’d frequent the mall to see who was hiring, and every time i walked past lush i would get mad and sad when i’d see all the people that we’re hired instead of me or who i used to have so much fun with. I finally found another job, one that offered me full time and i always have guaranteed hours unlike lush, so i felt sort of like “haha, in you’re face lush!” 

I felt really on top of the world and like this new job valued me. I walk by lush every day on break to get to the mall food court and the smell of lush just makes me sad. I try to avoid eye contact with anyone. I thought i was over this and moved on, but even months later i’m realizing how hurt and sad i am. 

I always see my old coworkers from there tagging each other in stuff online and i wish it were me. I wish we still saw each other everyday and i still existed in their world, but i don’t. I am tempted to reapply, but i know the hours would be not great at all (if barely any) and i would feel embarrassed reapplying to a store that didn’t want me to stay before. I pass some of my old coworkers often since we share the mall spaces and it feels like we just avoid each other out of awkwardness. 

I found out a lot of people who got rehired new somebody and that’s how they got in, and that makes me even madder since i tried so hard on my own. My new job is very boring and barely has any coworkers. I have tons of hours here, am respected, and make better money, but i miss the old atmosphere of lush and having fun coworkers. But then i tell myself that maybe they never liked me and if they did they would have kept me. I know a store can only hold on to so many seasonal people, but it still hurts.

Why am i so hurt over a job that kind of treated me like shit in the end, made me feel like all my hard work was for nothing, and that didn’t value me? How do i get over this and fully move on when i constantly see them in the mall? How do i get myself to stop wanting to go back? How do i not miss these people and wish i was around them all the time again?

164,"I'll keep it short. I've been struggling with my confidence and self esteem for a really long time. Almost a year ago I met this amazing girl who is pretty much exactly what I look for in someone. After some failed relationships she made me feel wanted and I felt great after a long time of doubting myself. We text almost everyday but we can't really go out due to her strict parents. The times I have met and been around them they have been very nice and I thought they generally liked me. Today I came over to her house and the girl confessed that she had an argument with her mom about me coming over due to her telling her mother the day before rather than giving her time to ""think about it"". Apparently the mother isn't that strict she just doesn't want her daughter to date me because I'm ""ugly"". After she told me this all that happiness and thoughts of us having a happy relationship were completely shattered, I told her I didn't really care but on the inside I was destroyed. Right now I'm kind of regretting trying to take this relationship slow. We are still in school but I'm attending a different one so we can't see each other at school everyday, and I don't think we can keep this talking stage going. I guess it hurts this much because I've experienced this before, the same old ""my daughter could do better"" and ""you're to ugly to be with her"". This just happened some hours ago so I thought I'd tell someone.

165,"First off, throwaway account, used before for this sort of thing.  


For a while now, I have had a nagging suspicious that I may be adopted. All of my family has thin, blonde hair, this goes back on both of my grandparents sides as well. Me, I have very thick brown curly hair. My parents have plenty of photos of my older brother when he was a baby. I have yet to see one of me as a newborn or very young. Plenty of me as a toddler, but none from me as a real baby. Physically I look very different as well. Much more of a 'stronger' square face instead of my families more sharp 'delicate' faces.   


There have been plenty of other small things over the years that have also built my suspicion, but those are the main ones. How should I confront them about this? If I'm right how do I deal with it?

172,"So me, my best friend (let's call her N) and my other friend (let's call her K) are taking a difficult course at university. We had to submit an assignment so we decided to email ours to each other so we could help each other with any mistakes. K emailed hers, I gave her advice. I emailed mine, K gave me advice. Nothing but silence from N - she never emailed her assignment, so we never read it, but she did receive and read ours. No big deal, maybe she left it for the last minute or something.

Then we both got called in to the department by our lecturer and he told us that our assignments are too similar. N immediately lied and said we worked on ours together, so maybe we made them similar without meaning to. She looked at me with these big fearful eyes like ""please go along with my lie"", but I'll be damned if I'm going to let her jeopardize my university career. So I asked to speak to the lecturer alone, and explained that I never read her assignment but she read mine, and we definitely didn't work on it together. He said he wouldn't take disciplinary action on either of us.

I opened the door to walk out and confront N... and she's standing there having a full-on anxiety attack, crying and everything, in the middle of the department hall. I knew she had 2 semester tests to write later that day and even though I was livid, I had a moment of weakness - and I told her I believed that she didn't mean to copy my work, just to calm her down.

But I don't believe her, because obviously she took a shortcut and my expense and could very well have gotten us both expelled for plagiarism. And she's my best friend. I've been fuming about it for 24 hours now, and I don't know what to do. I want to tell her I know she's a liar and how could she do this to me etc., but at the same time I don't want to cause drama or make our other best friend (let's call her C) feel like she has to choose a side.

So I was on Instagram the other day and the app suggested someone I used to work with. At least I think so. It was a brand new account and all it had was a profile pic where the girl had a bear filter on, but it was her name and the first initial of her last name. 
  
When we worked together, I felt that we had a decent little aqcuaintance-ship and she always said I was cute. So seems like something to go off of. 
  
The account was private. I sent a request and she accepted and followed me back. I sent her a message that said, ""Is this THE [name]."" It feels cringy now, but I was excited that she potentially made an Instagram. 
The reply I got was, ""this is [name] :o""
I tried to reply right away but I guess I had a poor connection and it didn't send. So a night or two later I asked if she was the girl I used to work with and mentioned the specific place. 
  
Didn't hear back, so tonight I went to check if I just hadn't gotten a notification. The conversation was gone and couldn't find the account. Unless she just deleted it, that's usually a sign you've been blocked. First of all, I can't understand why I would get blocked after that, whether it was the girl I knew or not? Any ideas?

(Second side note. I checked her followers to see if she was following things I remember her being interested in. She was following another account with a similar name and a pretty similar picture.

The girl, lets call her Anne, is best friends with another girl Trish. Trish is on a long trip to Australia currently. Boyfriend and Trish don't know one another, but Anne told some stuff about Trish to my boyfriend.

Trish and Anne had an text conversation and it went like this(made it shorter);

Anne; So much happend since you left.

Trish; Guuuurl tell me all about it.

Anne; Had 4 tinder dates, new cat, new tattoo.

Trish; Whaaaat you never tell me anything gurll more rambling.

Anne made a screenshot of this convo and send it to my boyfriend. The caption was; she missed so much 😆😂😂😃 Boyfriend replied with; haha😂

So..why on earth would she send him this. The tinder stuff isn't related to my boyfriend because they didn't meet through Tinder. (Yes i am sure)

What made me think; they made a vow that they won't tell anyone they had sex, and Anne wanted to show him that she doesn't even tell her best friend about it? Can someone give me advice? I asked BF about it, he says he doesn't know why she send it. She never sent him a screenshot before so its not a usual thing to do.

TL;DR Boyfriend received a strange screenshot. Not sure what to think of it.

200,"Hi Reddit.

To put some context to this, me [26F] and my partner [44M] started dating in January after he left his previous relationship. 

I knew from day one it'd be a difficult one. There was the ongoing divorce and 3 kids. 2 teens and 1 grown up step son. I fought through it though because I saw something in this guy I just couldn't let go. 

He had his own place and I stayed over quite a lot. We went out with his kids. I'd met the extended family and him with my family too. I got on really well with the kids and they seemed to enjoy spending time with me and coming over to mine to spend weekends with us.

Fast forward to now, a few weeks after he moved in with me and signed a 6 month rental contract, he told me he couldn't give me what I wanted, he had an eye watering amount of debt and he couldn't see a future in the relationship. He took all of this things at 5.30am yesterday (2 days after he'd dropped this on me) and left. 

We talked a lot over the 2 days. He kept saying he had a lightbulb moment weeks ago (this would have been the same time as we'd have signed for the house) about him wanting to be alone. He wants to move abroad but also wants his teenage kids to live with him which seems contradictory because his kids seem pretty happy being at home with their extended family nearby. He said he loved me still and was happy 90% of the time which I thought was pretty good. But he still wanted to leave.

I'm trying to get my head around how he can go from saying they can't wait until he can ask me to marry him for real and picking possible baby names to running for the hills. Nothing changed except he moved in. I expected there to be teething problems as we got used to spending more time together but not this.

I'm so lost and confused. I think I'm going to have to pay to get out of my house contract and move back in with my parents. It seems like such a step backwards. I'm in bits. I haven't been to work for the past few days and he's just carrying on like nothing has happened. 

I don't know what to do to try and pick myself up from this. I feel like I've failed if I move back home and my mental health is suffering. He encouraged me to trust him and let him help me get better. Now he's gone I feel like I'm back to before square one.

TLDR; partner of 8 months did a 180 seemingly out of nowhere going from wanting to get married and have kids to saying he wants to move abroad alone and start again only weeks after we had signed for a 6 month rental. I'm so lost, I have no idea what to do.",17Aug2018,1

What does not existing feel like? I've heard people describe it by saying that ""post-death is the same as pre-conception), in the vein that you just don't exist. But that *scares* me. I'm not even out of high school yet but there are nights where I sit and cry because I know that eventually I will become like a grain of sand, that is just blown away by the wind. Surely, *some*thing has to happen after death? What if I'm wrong and the Christians are right? Or the Muslims are right? Or the Buddhists are right? What if I go to Hell for being atheist?

What happened to all of my dead relatives? Are they watching down on me or have they faded into nothingness?

 I understand that humans are, in extremely simple terms, just a bundle of organs. We can only  live when all of our organs work in harmony. Our brain is the only reason we can *be*, but that doesn't work without the necessary nutrients and oxygen that the respiratory and digestive systems provide. But those would be able to do anything without our muscles, which in turn can't function without the brain. It's like a cycle, and if you interrupt it you die.

I don't really like life, but if that's the alternative to eternal emptiness, than I'll take lt anytime.

209,"TL;DR : advice on how to live with an irrational, mental unstable parent, without getting said parent help


My mother is an irrational person. The things she says and does are completly conflicting. 
I try to give you a feeling for that with some examples:
She complains the whole day about me and my dad not helping her, I try to do some chores but i have a chronic illness so basically pain 24/7 which leaves me sometimes crippled in bed. If I do something (for example bringing all the groceries in and putting everything in its place) she screams at me because I did a minor mistake (put the cream on the place of the cream double or some stupid shit). 
Also, if she is screaming and complaining again tht nobody helps her and insulting us that nobody ever does anything and I go downstairs to help her she tells me to go away or that it is okay. 
I was depressed through my chronic illness for years and she used to tell me everyday that I am not depressed, if I said I wanted to commit suicide she screamed at me and said I should stop talking shit. Now she is a little sad and talks about suicide (because of life choices she independently made) and I tell her she should stop saying that, cause she is talking herself into it and she just pretends I disrespect her feelings.
I would be more understanding if she would seek help but she doesn't. No matter how much I encourage her. 
If I need to go to the doctor I make my appointments alone but she insitis on driving me there. I tell.her that this isn't necessary and she will just stress herself again but she just doesn't listen. Because she currently has problems to get to work on time she is screaming, throwing stuff around and sometimes crying almost every day she has to work, I go everywhere alone but she always wants to drive me and doesn't understand that I am in independent person now. So everything goes wrong like everyday and she is screamimg that she will be late to work, insulting me, being mean to me and, not openly but kinda in a passive- agressiv way blaming my illnesse and me for.consiming so much of her time. 

I know I need to be more understanding for her situation, I am sure there is something wrong with her, but every comment you make about Psychotherapie or something she is instantly crying and pretending I say she is insane....

Ok I just got downstairs and she forgot to close the door before driving to the store.I hope this doesn't happen if I am not home. 

At this point I don't want to help her anymore, no not wanting, I just don't have the nerves anymore. I struggle with amphetamine addiction, my chronic illness and several social problems. 

I need tipps how to live with an irrational person that desperately wants to be involved with your life but just can't get her shit together enoguh to do that.

221,"My kids' school has an annual camp/retreat to kick off the school year, and one of the traditions they all look forward to is when a beloved teacher recites ""The Lorax"" from memory. Unfortunately, we just learned that this beloved teacher is moving to one of the sister schools, so they're not quite sure how to continue the tradition in a meaningful way. It's important to note here that the student ""emcees"" (a small group of students that have volunteered to lead the group presentation portion) have a fair amount of input/control over structure/content of presentations.

One idea is to have seniors memorize portions of the book, and recite it that way. Another idea is to compile a video before the annual retreat, ideally the seniors reciting portions as mentioned previously, then finish the video with beloved teacher saying the final line (apparently the way he says it is what really makes it amazing). These kids have incredible tech skills, or can source a student with said skills, so video editing and quality shouldn't be an issue. The only concern here is that it might feel a bit impersonal, despite a new video being created each year with current students to maintain relevance, but this option would allow beloved teacher to always say the final line. I have also suggested that the students speak with beloved teacher for his input, and it sounds like they will be doing that.

If you have thoughts or suggestions, please share them. The kids are feeling a bit sad and lost right now and aren't sure what to do. Thank you!

222,"I have been struggling to focus on my studies after entering college. I was never good with coping with changes, especially if it’s all too much to take it at once. I spent all my childhood years in our area where I very much am close with the people there, to the point where I consider them my family. In my High school, I have considered the teachers and my classmates as family too. It was dear to me as much as my home, since all the people there helped me in improving myself, and we were close with one another. It was a small community, but I knew everyone well.

After graduating, I needed to move to a university because I saw it as the best place to achieve my dream of becoming a neurologist. See, this place was very far from home, and it was vastly different from it; the place was much bigger, all the people were new, the curriculum’s dynamics was different from what I had grown accustomed to, and more. Being in a new environment and needing to face the big changes quickly, I am sad for the past few weeks. Even if I had managed to make new friends in my school and enjoying the many opportunities it gave me, I can’t help but feel very sad whenever I think of the fact that my friends are no longer with me, I’m far away from my relatives, and the place I’m staying in just gives this imprisoned vibe.

223,"(Doing this on bfs account) Okay so I'm on the 21 day combined pill called Rigevidon. Yesterday (Thursday) I took my thursday pill in the morning and everything was fine, next day i go to take my friday pill and find 3 missing. The 3 being fridays pill and tuesdays and wednesdays from a new packet. This is really odd I was taking my pills as normal and i find it really hard to believe that I would unknowingly take an extra 3 pills. I usually start my packets on a tuesday, this week i would have taken tuesdays up until fridays so far and nothing else. but because fridays was missing I had to take Saturdays.

To break down the possibilities i've been thinking about. 1) someone else has taken them. Possible suspects could be my 2 sisters, especially because i just leave my pill box in the dining room unguarded. But when i took my thursday pill in the morning they were both asleep and i left the house before they were awake. I then went to my bf's house and took my pill box with me, we went out and I left the box at his, this brings up the next possible suspects which could be his mum or brother, both are unlikely since his mum has gone through menopause and is highly religious (ie doesn't steal). his brother is unlikely to even know I have contraceptives and even then it would be very illogical for him to steal my pills. Those are the only people they could have at least possibly taken them but nothing adds up.

2) Perhaps I took them by accident
This is also highly unlikely because I remember taking them correctly and i remember seeing everything fine Thursday morning. And again I couldn't have taken 3 extra pills without knowing it because i've always been aware of side effects of things and am very cautious with these things. ",17Aug2018,1

236,"Just a warning before you begin reading, this post is long, because this is a little bit of a complicated situation. I really just need some advice or anybody's thoughts who have been through similar situations before...

I am kind of having a crisis in my life right now and don't know what to do. Back in March or so, I met this great girl. She really is super special to me and can be really motivating. Back in October/November of 2017 I literally lost a large sum of money after investing it across a few projects I was working on at the time. After meeting her I told her what had happened to me and she told me she had been through kind of similar circumstances so she could relate. We both have entrepreneurial tendencies and are super into making passive income especially through the internet. Recently, I purchased an investment property and she is helping me sell it because she has been in real estate for some time and knows a thing or two about it. Every time I feel like quitting I feel like she motivates me and lifts me up. She says we are in this together and she is hungry to make money as much as I am.

One thing that is difficult in our relationship is that she recently moved to Florida to live with her family. I'm from NY. She was living close to me for some time but just after we met she moved - this was the plan before I ever got into the picture. It was hard for both of us because we quickly learned that we love being together. Even when I had to work the next day at my traditional job, I wouldn't want to go to sleep bc I loved spending time with her. So naturally, she came back from Florida to visit me in May and has been here ever since. We do everything together. We go grocery shopping, blog, find freelancing jobs and work on selling the house I just bought.

About 3 weeks ago my dad sold the house I've  been living in since I was a boy. My girlfriend and I were living in it from May to July. 

My dad had hired an agent who in turn found a woman who bought the house quickly. The move in date was August 1st so I had to scramble to find an apartment. My dad and I found a private home of an older couple in a town near where I grew up. So it wasn't a big adjustment moving to this new area. I've lived in this town before with my mom when I was younger and she was renting.

The traditional job I had been working at in 2017-2018 was as a teacher in NYC. My girlfriend and I both share the same sentiment that working for someone else is not really the way to go for us at least. Also, after being in the NYC school system for so long, I'm starting to feel like it's less about helping children and more about getting them to pass tests and jump through hoops. I just don't believe in it anymore. But I do believe in the house flipping business and passive income streams I've been creating. 

Needless to say, I'm down on my luck, with about $1200 to my name. This may seem like a decent amount to some but I live in the suburbs of NYC so that sort of money doesn't go far around here.

I screwed up from the beginning I suppose. When sitting down with the landlord and real estate agent, as well as my father to sign the lease, they asked me if I was married or if I smoked. I said no because I am not married and I do not smoke. But apparently my lease states that only one person can live in my apartment. 

So over the last week of July at my dads house, I was literally helping him clean out the house. And when I say I was helping him , I mean I literally cleaned out the whole house and moved furniture myself because he is getting old and can't move as well as he used to. I like to help my dad as much as I can. The point is I was wiped out.

Fast forward to move in day. I came to the apartment and moved my things inside with my brother and girlfriend. Because there was a lot going on, and my brother was in a rush to leave because he and his wife and friends had tickets to go see a show, I was furiously moving things myself into my apartment. By the end I was so tired I just fell asleep on the floor. 

My dad kept pressuring me to go talk to the landlord about my girlfriend staying because in the lease it said that only one person should be living at my apartment. The next day, my girlfriend and I baked my landlord some bread and explained to him that she would be leaving on August 22nd. She and I also explained that she comes over from time to time to stay because she lives in Florida the rest of the year.

So he said oh okay. We will talk later about the lease. 

Since I work on selling my property and building income via the computer, I tend to be inside most days. My landlord is usually home because he's semi-retired but he and I rarely cross paths or haven't much yet. 

Anyhow, yesterday my dad came back to New York to deal with some legal matters. While he dealt with them, I was watching his dog. He comes back and tells me that the lady who bought his house is turning around and flipping it. Which doesn't bother me at all. More power to her. I was annoyed because she wasn't even living in it. And my dad was annoyed because he spoke to some neighbors who told him the new owner was going to sell it for the price he actually wanted to sell it for. Meaning he would have held on to it longer and left it on the market. Which would also have left me with a place to stay and more time to look for apartments instead of jumping on the first one I see out of necessity or rather, desperation.

Anyway, my dad and I had a pretty great conversation about life and work. He's been pressuring me to get back into teaching but I'm not interested in it anymore. I am interested in real estate and expanding my business. I just am having a hard time telling him because he really paid for my education and continues to. He is pretty well off - especially after inheriting a large lump sum of money from my Grandma after she died in 2017. I just don't know how he will react because I don't have results my system to make money works yet - especially not consistently. He really just wants me to have stability in life and I feel like I don't have enough of that yet. But I can taste it.  It's close.

Anyway, my dad dropped me back at my apartment yesterday. 

I saw my landlord next to the house working on his lawnmower. So I waved to him and say hello. As I'm about to walk in the house he walks up to me and confronts me about my girlfriend staying over.

He says ""I wasn't trying to embarrass you the other day (I guess he meant when my girlfriend and I knocked on his door to give him bread and explain the situation) but the lease says one person should be living in your apartment.""

He then says ""You sat down with your father when you signed the lease and looked me in the eye and you told me that you wouldn't have anyone stay over at the apartment.""

I immediately snapped at him and said ""you didn't mention that to me."" - why I said this was because the landlord and real estate agent asked me if I'm married and I said no. They asked me if I smoke and I said no. So I don't feel I lied as the landlord is insinuating. I just misunderstood what they were getting at I suppose.

Besides this being a money issue, this landlord had been burned by the people who lived here before me who said that it was just going to be him and his wife who were staying at the apartment and it turned out that they had three kids that the landlord didn't know about. So he definitely has a certain perspective on this issue which I totally understand. I just feel like the guy is calling me a liar all because I misunderstood his question and gave him a literal answer - the question he asked me was bad and I wasn't thinking. I do acknowledge that I should have told him about my gf staying over sooner. But I did tell him after the fact and he does know that she is leaving.

Because she's stayed with me two weeks, he is charging me an extra $100 for the month which is added to the rent. The reason for this is that he pays utilities. We barely use electric beside for our business, we watch TV here and there and water and gas are definitely down to a minimum use. 

Anyway, he then starts carrying on and saying you have to take your trash out more than once a week. My girlfriend and I cook a decent amount but there isn't enough trash between the two of us to fill a fresh bag before Thursday. So at this point I'm like whatever man. Not sure if he thinks I'm dirty and that roaches or mice will come into the apartment, but I now have to take out my garbage a few times a week. Just don't understand why..

So I tell my girlfriend this. And of course she becomes upset. But she keeps saying I need to rectify the situation and apologize to the guy. Tell him I'm sorry for lying to him from the getgo. I feel very angry about the situation. Normally I can swallow my pride but it made me really upset when he indirectly called me a liar. I am probably one of the most reasonable people you'll meet and am more than willing to work things out with people, but the way the landlord spoke to me it just seemed like I was abusing his property. I'm wrong because of the lease I get that. It just makes me a little upset that we couldn't just talk things out civilly because snapping at people I feel is what children or teenagers do. I am not that way and I feel angry at myself for allowing myself to stoop so low. If that is how he acts, that's fine but I'm not like that.

I need to let it go. But my girlfriend keeps telling me that I need to ask what happens if she stays with me again, would it be a $100 charge like it was this month? Or would she be forced to stay on the lease.

I feel really anxious and apprehensive about going to talk to him again. It also feels really uncomfortable living here knowing that this is what the landlord thinks of me and my girlfriend. I feel like the landlord wants this place to be like a dorm room and not a private living area that I and my dad pay a lot of money to rent.

My fear is that this guy is just going to tell me that she will have to be put on the lease. 

She doesn't have a lot of money and I'm getting tapped out on funds because I have no job - will have something temporary soon but won't get paid until mid September  - and have to still pay for groceries, cable/internet, part of the rent etc. 

It feels like I'm being presented with a choice to either choose my house and keep my money and abandon seeing my girlfriend who is helping me free myself of work and move closer to economic independence or keep my girlfriend, continue to have headaches with my landlord, go deeper into debt etc.

I don't know what to do...",17Aug2018,5

238,"Hello everyone. 

A little backstory, i’m a 23 (soon 24) year old male, living in a south american country. I have a bachelor’s degree and I have 2 years of work experience (1 as an an intern, 1 and months counting full time currently). I work at a port/sea terminal, and i’ve been here since my internship in the commercial department. After a year of internship, i went back to school for a semester and was later called up by the company after graduating for the commercial assistant job, which i’ve been working in since may 2017. 

This week, the commercial coordinator resigned for personal reasons, leaving an opening in the area. It’s certainly a step up from my assistant level job, it’s twice my salary and tbh it’s fewer responsibilities than my actual job. 

I would love to have that job, but only for the salary increase really since I find the responsibilities very boring and office like, while mines include more port activities and such. How do I know the coordinator’s responsibilities? I had some of her responsibilities for 5 months while she was on maternity leave, so I have experience in the job going in for me as a bonus. 

How should I approach my boss, telling her i’m interested in participating in this job opportunity, but keeping my responsibilities? I’m open to keeping my functions and adding new ones as well, but not sure my boss is. I’ve heard she would prefer a woman for that job. 

Thank you for your kind assistance. ",17Aug2018,1

243,"Ok, here we go: I’m a team leader (official title) and **project manager** (some projects), my team was initially formed by two women and me last year, and both of them became, eventually, friends.

Becoming friends made it difficult when I had to reprimend one or tell them to do their tasks and stop “helping each other” if the “helping” was just enabling bad behavior. Eg, woman A wouldn’t study something because the other one was better at it, even though woman A needed to know it anyway.

In other instances, one of them would treat the other as her “secretary” by offloading onto her every little thing she thought was “too hard for her”, and because of their friendship, I came off as the asshole if I needed to stop this.

Eventually one of them got transferred after she tried to undermine me and get me to lose my position. The other one remained, and I got a new guy as a replacement.

I recently found out, however, that the woman who works with me regularily chats with the other one about me and my “negative sides”.

The one who got transferred, in turn, spills all of this to other people in the company, and it already got to my manager.

For example, during one of this chit chat events, my manager’s secretary (another close friend of the ex-team member, and an ex PM who couldn’t do her job and got demoted) is now suggesting that they tell my coworker to talk to my manager about me because “I’m not in charge and I need to stop treating my team members like interns”

I had had a misunderstanding with my team member so she vented and the other two blew it out of proportion, without even having been in the room whne it happened...

All of this is worrying me because the whole thing is aimed at undermining me, and it’s done by people who aren’t even working with me.

How on earth can I protect myself against this and go to work with complete ease? I can take my team members complaining about me because, well, I’m the boss so that’s to be expected sometimes, but I cannot tolerate that every single complain is a tragedy blown out of proportion because it’ll end up costing me my position.

Am I not supposed to have a bad day without my reputation being tarnished? Unaccepatble...

And the woman who’s enabling this outside my team is using it to cover her own ass. If I end up as the dictator asshole who wants to boss other people around, her own deficiencies, that actually require being bossed around, can be forgiven...

So, she strikes from afar, saying “see? Not even her current saint of a coworker can tolerate him...”, spinned, casually, in the direction of my manager...

And I swear to god, if I lose my position because of this, I’m gonna raise so much hell with the owners that these two will either get fired or seriously reprimended... but I don’t want to be *that* coworker...

What can I do guys? Any advice?

—————————————————

**edit:** all of this is being framed as me not being able to do my job, and the people doing this have been isolated for their inability to do their jobs (except they were not told this specifically to avoid hurting them):

- First it was about “how I was a good techie but bad at managing people because I had to cut slack to those who *did things differently* (ie, didn’t want to work)”.

- Now it became “he’s too micromanaging and can’t do this with seniors”, or otherwise

- “it’s not his job to check on other people’s work because he isn’t the boss (ie, manager/owner), he asks for X, let the coworker do X and shut up about the rest”.

247,"I've been working a seasonal job at a new place for the summer and my last day is today. Recently one of my coworkers has been texting me asking if I want shifts covered (they've probably done it around 4ish times) and if I don't respond fast enough to their liking they will keep texting me till I get a response. I have turned them down before but I get so annoyed at them keep texting me as they must need the money that badly that I started to let them cover my shift a few times.

A freak accident happened with a family member last night so I texted my manager I may need coverage (I don't anymore) but my manager texted me asking why I kept giving my shifts away when I was almost down working. I told my manager that I'm sorry I gave away my shifts sometimes people would ask me if I wanted them covered and I would let them. I've never called out in the few months I've been there. Thats all I said.

I get a message within 5 mins later from the person who kept asking to cover for me saying I was so rude and that I apparently told our manager she was harassing me for my shifts and that I was just an ungrateful person who she was doing a favor for. I texted my coworker back and apologized for the misunderstanding I told her I never accused her of harassing me or name dropped her and that I was also super grateful for her being so kind to me.... She never responded.

So now I'm stuck in an awkward and uncomfortable position, my manager clearly texted this person about me and now I have to go into work and work with my coworker who flipped at me. I don't even want to go into work this is stupid drama. This was only a summer job and another reference I was going to keep for the future but now I feel like I ruined having them as a reference clearly my manager thinks I'm not a good worker since i keep giving shifts away.

Do you think it was unprofessional of my manager to text my coworker about this? Clearly my manager said something that pissed off my coworker and makes me look like a bad person. I feel like I screwed myself over by letting the girl keep working for me but this was her full time job not mine and she obviously needed the money more than I did.

tl;dr: coworker kept asking to take my shifts so I would let her. Manager asked why I kept giving shifts away so I told her and my manager must've told my coworker because she flipped at me over text 5 mins later saying I'm accusing her of harassment.

248,"Alright, so I'm asking for one of my best friends. She is a single mom or two boys, 21 and 15 years old. Her eldest is fine but her youngest is causing more stress than anyone deserves.

The things he has done that I am aware of...

A year or two ago he ""ran away"" from home with a group of friends and walked to another city over. They walked along a busy highway. This was obviously bad and he was missing for a couple of days. He doesn't have a cell phone as my friend recently got a better paying job and hasn't spent money on one for him yet.

He constantly skips school to the point where she would have to miss work or be late to drive him to school. She has now decided to do at home online school for him as the calls from public school were causing her too much stress.

She tried sending him to live with his dad in another state, but that didn't work out as his dad didn't stay on him and he did the same things.

He sneaks out at night thinking she won't notice. Spoiler alert she does.

Then came the big one...

He took her car while she was at work, drove to a friends house, and his friend then drove her car. None of then have their drivers license.

She honestly is at her wits end. The amount of stress this boy is causing her has made her have a break down at work and go on short term disability. I want to help her find something but I don't know where to start.

Anyone have any ideas?

249,"I've lived in an in-law suite (separate house) for two years. Up until October of last year, the main house was leased; however, my landlady lost her job and decided to kick them out so she could move in. She's friendly - in her mid-60s, single, hip, and liked to talk about gardening. We got along well and would talk when we saw each other in the yard. It has since become very obvious that she is an alcoholic. Cans of bottom shelf beer and single serve wine bottles filling the recycling bin and her slurring her words half the time we spoke made that apparent. I chose to just disregard it since it isn't my business. She frequently complained about money issues and not being able to find a job. I listened but didn't contribute to the conversation as I didn't want to get into any weird situations. In the last few months, she's been asking me for small favors here and there - grabbing the mail while she's out of town, replacing her AC filter, etc. Recently it has ramped up to ""my tire pressure is low, does that mean it needs air?"" Fine. I already pay way less in rent than I ought to, so it evens out. However, she fell and hurt her back about a month ago and has been having a lot of pain since. 

Yesterday, I heard her scream in the yard and went to investigate. She had fallen, so I helped her get up (her screaming in pain the whole time) and went on my way. Later, she texted me saying she couldn't open her car door and needed my help. Now I've become a caretaker - she texted me saying her foot was asleep and she was scared. I can't tell this uninsured woman to go to the ER, so I just told her to call her subscription based doctor (???) and see what he thought. I also asked if her daughter who lives a couple of states over knew about this and could come help her and she said she knew but was busy with work.

I didn't hear from her again until this morning when she texted asked me to come unlock the door so her friend could get in. She's in bed, in underwear, and tells me she can't walk. There's a piss covered towel on the floor and everything is just a mess. She said her friend was coming to take her to the ER and I (stupidly) offered to help her get out to the car. The friend knocks on my door 15 minutes later and asks if I can help. She also said ""I'm sure you've figured out she's an alcoholic"" and is obviously annoyed with her. Then we spend nearly an hour practically dragging this woman around to try to get her in the car. I broke my foot two weeks ago taking out the recycling (that my landlady asked me to do because she was in too much pain!) so I'm sure it wasn't good for me, but what could I do? After we got her in the car, I pulled the friend to the side and asked if the landlady's family knew about what was going on. She said the sister might come help for a couple of days, but the daughter was mad at her for the drinking. I think I'm now just substitute daughter since I'm the same age. Anyway, I don't think the ER will have any magic solution to this problem, so she will likely be out of commission at least partially for a while.

So, tl;dr, my landlady has crossed WAY over the line of landlord/tenant and is using me. I'm not sure what I can do as ignoring the texts of an alone, disabled woman is cruel. Should I just outright tell her I'm not comfortable and risk getting evicted? What is the best way to handle this situation? Thanks in advance.

I'm 25 turning 26 in 2 months. I'm living in Japan teaching English and I'm pretty comfortable. However, I applied to Law School because I thought that was what I wanted to do and I got a surprise acceptance 2 days ago. 

They want me to start September 3rd. I cannot defer.

The Law School is UNB in Canada. It's on the East Coast, but my family lives in Ontario (near the great lakes). I have about $30 000 Canadian in savings and my friend said I could stay at his house for a time in NB. 

Tuition is $12 000 a year.

This is obviously a good opportunity IF I want it, however I was becoming a lot more comfortable with teaching and I was starting to think that I might like to do that for a career. You know, teach in Japan but in a Highschool or maybe go to teacher's college in Canada in the future.

I've been teaching for almost 3 years now, and I applied to Law School every year, partially to tell myself I was doing something productive instead of just messing around in glorious Nippon. 

Now suddenly I've been accepted and I'm not sure what to think. I feel I must choose between teaching and Law NOW! I might not ever get in again, since my application is not so strong.

However, I could waste my life savings on an expensive but ultimately not enjoyable or worthwhile experience.

She lied lied lied. For years. Lived with us for 5 years and it was constant lying. I finally had enough last year and went off on her. She stopped talking to us. Treated us horribly. Moved out without telling us with a guy she had been with for 2 weeks!!, and has blocked us on all social media. This was in January of this year. 
I recently found out she’s pregnant, due in November, and I’m heartbroken that after everything and how close we’ve always been... she didn’t even tell us and hasn’t reached out. 

Should I reach out? Or just leave it alone? 
We were very close, and it’s almost like I’ve had to mourn the loss of someone who is still alive. I’m just so sad.

261,"I got a new job about a month ago and I was excited to get it, as it's in my field, but it's not all I thought it would be. It's supposed to be a writing job, creating pulp novels for a small publishing company. The problem is that there's too much paperwork, meetings, and nitpicking that I don't feel like I can get anything done creatively. My boss also has all these ideas already for stories and really forces the point in including his ideas, even when they're dreadful (like rape as a point of interest and not a major plot).

I think I'm never going to be happy working for somebody else. It's too stifling to bend to someone else's creative process. So I'm thinking about taking out a small loan, quitting my job, and self-publishing a novel I've been working on for the past two years.

I know this is risky and couldn't pan out, but I'm not sure what else to do. My dream is to be a novelist and I can't see any other way to set out on that journey. In summation, is this a terrible, terrible idea?",17Aug2018,3

267,"So i dont know what i should do. Ive been at my current job for 2 years now, in one of the few original staff remaining that opened the place. Ive been dating my supervisor for 8 months now, my managers know about it. Its not agaisnt the rules or anything. About a month ago, me and my boyfriend were called into the office to speak with my main manager and my HR manager. We were told that we werent in trouble, but that ""multiple"" complaints had been filed for 3rd party sexual harassment. The specific behavior was my boyfriend sending me on breaks at the same time as him, him hanging around the areas that im in, and us touching each other on the shoulders when passing by each other. My main manager told us that it was a new employee that had filed the complaints and that they were letting us know about the complaint because legally they were supposed to try to stop the behavior, even though they thought the complaints were ridiculous. Of course the complaints were bs, me and him would go on breaks last out of all the staff because we always start later than everyone else on shift. He only hangs around a certain area on the floor because thats the busiest area, hes there whether I'm in that area or not, and we touch everyones shoulders when we're walking behind them its just a habit.

So i told a few of my coworkers about the harassment complaint and that me and my bf had no idea who it was because we were cool with everyone. Then one someone tells me that this one new worker, someone that i had never worked with before, has been complaining about me to other workers(???) and saying that my bf is constantly following me around.

So i thought whatever, theres nothing i can do about it. It was possible that she percieved me and my bf's behavior as flirty or innappropriate since she doesnt know us. So a few weeks go by and now this girl is working in the main busy area, the one where my bf always is and the area of the store where im usually scheduled. My manager that night told my bf and told me that I was to train the 2 new people on how to clean the main equipment. So i said ok. My bf tells the 2 new people, that girl included, that I am to train them. They both said ok. As soon as he walks away, the chick goes off and starts doing her own thing. I told her that we were all gonna start cleaning the equipment, then she walks into the corner and glares at me for about a minute then just sits down on the floor. So i show the other new person how to clean the equipment and the chick kinda just watches from a few feet away. She only helped after i asked her a second time to do something.

I have made sure to talk politely and calmly to her in every interaction, but she always does the same thing. Ignores what I say or ask her and glares at me. I have also made sure there is always a witness to verify my actions. I have told 2 of my on duty managers about said behavior and theyve basically told me that karma will get her. Its so extremely frustrating to be in a position where I'm told to fix the mistakes of new hires, let them know how to do things, and then to be so blatantly disrespected. This is literally the only person that has ever done this to me in a work environment.

 The lower managers know about her behavior and dont seem to plan on acting. Shes actually spoken over a few of them while they were giving her directions. I'm 100% sure that this girl is the one who reported us. We have now been being scheduled in a way where my bf is no longer my immediate supervisor, im always placed in areas far away from him or we aren't schduled on the same days.

 Then just last night, i walked into the break room (on my off day) to check my upcoming work schedule and I walked in on her telling 2 new employees that me and my bf ""are always together"". And one of the employees goes ""who is this girl? She sounds nuts"". 

Should I take this to my head manager or my HR manager? I have epilepsy and I'm getting so stressed and upset to the point where I can feel seizures coming on at work.

I dont want to be constantly tattling to my managers but i really dont know what im supposed to do.",17Aug2018,1

I do not like being around immature people and I have been around them for a very long time (since preschool). I also have a lot of sketchy people that are in my classes at school and it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would like to do online school so that I am more comfortable. My parents are telling me that I have two more years and that I can do it. Why do I have to suffer 2 more years? They want me to go to public school because it’s “normal to socialize at school and be around a lot of people.” I have a couple good friends that I’m more than happy with and that’s all I need. Staying at school won’t do anything for me.  Being way more mature than everyone else and hearing about people and the things they do, the things that happened at parties, the mean girls, all that crap is so annoying and honestly depresses me because there’s a lot more to life than that, they just can’t see it.

I understand that there are always going to be immature people, but I do not have to deal with it. I’ve dealt with a lot of reality in my young life so far.

There’s a guy who looks to be about my age (41) who sits outside asking for food.  He never asks for money.  I have given him some crackers, a granola bar, nuts, candy and an orange on different days.  He now expects food from me.  I can afford something small easily and he does legitimately seem to be hungry but I’m starting to feel taken advantage of.

He's been sick this week, we met Sunday, and then I looked after him Wednesday. Yesterday, he said he felt much better already, and originally we planned to meet that day, but since he didn't mention it I thought I'd give him his peace, and I guess he gladly accepted it. And today, we could've met again, I mean, we did talk about meeting on Thursday but also mentioned Friday as an option because his plans got cancelled, but today he asked me what series I recommended, to which I replied with the name and the question, oh, are you planning a binge watch day? And he just said yes, he doesn't even really want to do it, but he feels a lot better and can *finally* do something else other than lying around and so he'll watch series.

And I'm just so irrationally sad? Obviously he must've thought about me as an option and not wanted it. What's bothering me so much is that I've wanted it so much I visited him when he was sick, at risk I'd get sick and of course all he did was lie around sick so there was nothing in it for me, so to say. I feel so stupid. I mean, how desperate am I? I never was that person. And now I'm sad because he doesn't want to see me, even though he's still a little sick. What the fuck is my problem??

276,"what do you think? i dormed in the NYC area. so i was always going out and having fun whenever i was free. i always took the subway everywhere, even by myself. as a college student i did go to frat parties and hung around those kind of people and i never had any issues. i’ve never been in a fight or in any life threatening situations while away from home. i’ve been pretty responsible and street smart. i had a good time at school. my mom is freaking tf out saying she doesn’t really want me to go. she’s making me feel guilty af that i’m going. because she never met my bf’s parents. she’s worried that they’re racist (i’m blasian, my bf is white. my mom is the most discriminating person i know tbh) she also thinks i’m gonna disappear, get trafficked, his family might gang rape me, etc. i met them a few times already and these people are nicer than my own family. my mom is horrified that i could be having sex or sleeping with my bf overnight but the thing is i dormed for so long and i’ve been doing all those things already. i’m even on the pill and my mom knows. when i dormed i didn’t have any close friends, just sorta tagged along with acquaintances so no one was really looking after me. my mom knows my bf is a nice guy. he comes to my house all the time. he treats me well and even gets my mom gifts on special occasions. why is it such an issue for me to go away for a few days with a TRUSTED PERSON when i left home for years?? btw i live in long island, ny and my bf’s parents are in danbury, ct so the driving is like an hour and a half.

my mom always has a problem with me having friends. if i want to go out with friends she will make me feel stupid because “i should know better” that the world is dangerous. she always says something like “this girl had good grades, nice friends, and she just got snatched off of the street and never came back” or she would tell me some gut wrenching story (she watches a lot of murder/crime shows on the ID channel) but if i wanted to go somewhere like to the mall by myself she doesn’t say anything. also one time when i was volunteering at an animal shelter i befriended a woman, told her about my school/future career and i said i wanted to do dental hygiene. her husband is a dentist so she had her husband come in the next week and he was giving me great advice, his information, and if i needed anything i could ask him. i made a connection. my mom wasn’t happy at all. she said that they just want to traffic me. is this normal? should i just disregard my mom and enjoy? she’s still letting me go to CT but i feel awful, because she’s acting like i’m throwing my life away. “you can go but i don’t really want you to. if you get raped then it’s not my fault” 

how do i deal with this from now on? i’m not dorming anymore i’m back home. seems like everyone my age studies abroad in europe, they go to miami or cancun for spring break, toronto, even my polish roommate when to china without her parents during the semester. my school offered a medical volunteering opportunity trip to honduras. my mom wants me to be a dentist (not a hygienist) but to me that idea is far fetched because i “have a small brain/don’t know any better” and i need to have mommy approve of everything for me

That is fucking stupid. The house is in the middle of nowhere. Ive got nothing to do here and they expect me to ask if i can stay in the city? Bitch please.

282,"Last Saturday night my girlfriend's went out to the bar with her best friends since middle School who we'll call Shannon and Shannon's boyfriend who we'll call Steve went too. I couldn't go because I had to get up for work at 4am on Sunday for work but I went to bed extra early so I could wake up to pick her up then go back to sleep so she could have a safe ride home. They left for the bar at ten and I had been asleep for a while at this point around 12 my girlfriend comes into my room and tells me the drinks sucked and she doesn't even feel the alcohol (she was very obviously at least buzzed and is classic known for denying how drink she is) because of this they wanted to go back to Steve and Shannon's to drink more.

At this point I was too tired to think it all the way through and I said yeah go for it just call when you want to be picked up. She then said that she could just sleep on their couch and I told her I would feel more comfortable just picking her up. 
She left and I couldn't sleep so we were texting around 1:30 is when I first asked if she wanted to be picked up she got defensive asking why she couldn't have a fun night with her friends. Which is understandable I guess but I wasn't telling her what to do I was only offering and that just added to my anxiety. Around 2:30 I told her I wanted to pick her up and to please let me come get her she declined again and said she was going to sleep. 

According to my girlfriend (she doesn't remember much of anything) sometime after we stopped texting is where she and Steve had sex with Shannon in the room. My girlfriend feels like she was taken advantage of because Steve poured the drinks and made them too strong and then used that against her. I do agree with her that it was fucked up and Steve is a scum bag. If this was the only information given it would feel a lot more cut and dry but there are a lot more factors that have me confused and spiraling.

1. Shannon is bisexual and has had a crush on my girlfriend since highschool. Before my girlfriend and I started dating she had a one night stand with Shannon and Steve. My girlfriend says she regrets that because it was hard on their friendship. She also kissed Shannon and slept in her own bed naked next to them when we were about a month into dating but not explicitly stated that we were exclusive. The ladder did hurt my feelings but I don't hold it against her.

2. I told her that I wasn't 100% comfortable with her going out without me given her past with Shannon and Steve but I didn't want to stop her from going because I try my best not to be controlling but just open about my feelings. So given we had that conversation my girlfriend and got into a fight before she told me she slept with Steve. The fight was over the fact that I practically begged her to let me pick her up and she refused knowing that I was uncomfortable with her just going out alone with these particular people much less staying the night at their house.

3. My girlfriend always gets super horny when she drinks. Obviously I don't find this to be damning evidence that she was just tipsy and cheated on me while knowing full well what she was doing but I can't get that fact out of my head. 

4. Steve was most likely really drunk too and as much as don't like him if they were both too drunk that makes me feel like maybe they're equally responsible for what happened but I don't know if that's the right way to feel about it.

Currently I'm trying to be supportive of my girlfriend although I don't feel like I'm doing a good job because I'm a mess. She has a therapist appointment today and I told her I would go with her to it. But other than that I don't know what steps to take.

290,"So for the past couple of years I've been hanging out (or at least trying to) with a group of friends I've known since high school.  The group consist of many more than just them but to keep it simple I'll focus on the main three guys I've known since high school. 

So I'm 22 and the main issue I've have had has been that most of them either are busy weekdays but free on weekends. Unfortunately I am free on weekdays but unavailable during weekends. This has been the constant for three years now.

Because of this I could not hang out with them as often as I'd like. As I started to notice this more and more I decided to take off the occasional friday or saturday and then noticed that they were not doing anything or forget to invite me. So I thought that on those days off I would call them early and half the time I still would not end up doing anything with them. 

During this whole time I would get the occasional request to hang out but usually had to decline because of work. So I decided to take off Friday or saturday off my availability so I can hang out and enjoy my youth. So I would have months where I didnt work friday or saturday and still would rarely hang out with them. This included me called and texting a lot of them asking if they wanted to do someone or had something planned. I would even tell them a week in advance and several times after that, that I would in fact be able to hang out with them. Yet I'd rarely hear from them if ever. Then I would see that on my days off they would be doing stuff together and I was home doing nothing. 

So fast forward till a month or two ago and I was telling one of my friends about this problem, asking for adive, and feeling frustrated tell him how I thought the others were excluding me and I felt like they didnt want to be friends. I was frustrated and annoyed and told him the things I didnt like about them. Like one of them being extremely cheap and a moocher. Another one just being really cheap. And the third one slowly getting their negative attributes. 

After a few of these talks he says he wont tell anyone and I say you know what Idc if you do I'm done trying. So he tells them and the cheap and moocher guy let's call him Dr.cheap. texts me and says that he didnt figure me as a gossiping type and starts going off on me by doing a me versus them arguement. Pretty much looking down on me and acting like everything is completely my fault. So I told him how I feel and what I think of him and he still just shrugged it off saying that it's not his problem and that I'm a shitty friend. So when I realized that everything that I was saying was just being ignored I apologized for any possible thing I could have done wrong and how I could of tried more so we could meet in the middle and both take some blame but he refused to do so. So with that I pretty much said I have to go and never texted him again. 

I honestly dont think I'm at fault for any of this I did try to be friends with all of them and everything. If I am responsible I think it's only a part of it. I just want to see what you guys think. I'm sorry for rambling but I tried to keep things short. I just want to know an outside perspective and feel free to ask any questions.

TL:DR- I tried to hang out with friends but rarely did I reached out over various years until I gave up. I ended up asking a friend for advice who knew them... frustrated I said what I hated about them. The last talk i had with him i gave up and told him he could tell them if he wants. One of them texts me and blames me for everything not taking a single shred of responsibility.

293,"Hey! (23,M) 

My girlfriend has been away for over two months on her travels. We got together shortly before she left, and knew each other not long before that.

I feel so strongly about this girl, like I haven’t before, FOR ANYONE. I believe she feels the same, as she tells me a lot. 

She’s mentioned a few times that she thinks I’m too good for her, and she feels super lucky to have me. I feel exactly the same. But I don’t want that to become a factor which affects our relationship because I know she overthinks things a lot. Well recently she’s been getting a lot of attention off other guys on her travels, and she keeps on telling me about it, I don’t know if that’s because she wants to keep me in the loop, she’s trying to make me jealous, or maybe she feels like she needs to let me know that other guys are after her? 

I don’t really get it, because obviously I don’t like hearing about it, and personally I wouldn’t mention it if it happened to me? 

Could I just please get some little insight from female redditors? 

She gets back from her travels in a week or so, I’m so exciting to see her but I’m really hoping she’s not got a taste of the attention and will change her mind once she gets back.

297,"Bit of background, we’re both 27, met in college, have been dating for 7 years. She has a super nice family and is a good person.

I don’t know if I should marry her because my feelings for her aren’t where I think they should be. People always ask me if I love her or if “she’s the one” and I just don’t know. I’ve always thought that love at first sight was a load of bull and that you had to earn love, but it’s been 7 years and I just have not grown to love her enough to know if I want this forever. I’ve never felt that crazy passion for her.

To make matters worse, she REALLY REALLY loves me and I don’t know why. I’m a pain in the ass and moody AF. One day I’ll be awesome and be in a great mood and the next my self-esteem is in the garbage and I’m miserable to be around but she is always there for me. She deals with me remarkably well when I’m in a shit mood.

To complicate things further it’s been almost a year since we’ve “been intimate” which sucks cuz we’re not even married yet, but we’re at that point already. (I’ve also heard a good sex life is very important to a strong marriage). She’s not a very sexual person so doesn’t seem to care, but I am very sexual so it bothers me a lot. I’m always thinking about other girls which bums me out because it makes me feel shitty. I’ve talked to her about it but it never leads to anything changing. 

I’ve even tried to break up with her before but she basically begs me not to break up and then we stay together. I’ve asked to take breaks, wanted to break up, but she always talks me out of it.

Idk what to do. I am pretty clearly the bad guy in this situation and this relationship doesn’t make me feel like a good person. Why does she even want to be with me still when I’ve tried to break up with her multiple times? 

Part of me thinks I’d be an idiot to leave her and part of me thinks I’m being a coward if I stay. We’ve been dating so long that I feel like I need to make a decision to move forward or end it, otherwise I’d just be stringing her along.

Should I just break it off for good based off of my gut feelings or stick it through and maybe I’ll finally love &amp; appreciate her? She is a very good person, much better than I am and waaayy too good for me, but I just don’t know if I am in love with her. I want to be with someone I love and also want her to be with someone who loves her.  She deserves that. ",17Aug2018,2
298,"TLDR - my friends and I got lied to and split up in our apartments, and I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to keep us together. 

So my three friends and I decided to move in together to a 4 room apartment. When we applied, they asked us to write down the names of the people we wanted to room with, and we did. We also made tons of calls each to assure that we were gonna be roomed together, which the apartment complex assured us that we did. 

Today we got assigned to our rooms and we all got split up. I’m with one girl, the other two are together. I called to see what had happened and they informed us that they have priority when it comes to rooms. Therefore, since we all signed the lease at different times, we couldn’t be roomed together. They NEVER told us any of this and instead assured us that we were going to be together. 

Is there anything I can do? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Thank you!",17Aug2018,2
299,"I honestly can't handle it much longer. Let me explain my life.

I graduated in summer 2017 with a bachelors, now been working in a clerical accounting job for the past 10 months make $17/hr in central valley, CA. As a way to save money, my parents let me stay in their place until I can afford a place of my own, or in their terms, until I can afford a down payment for a house. My parents are good people and they honestly did more than enough in raising me, so I appreciate them very much. But at the same time, I can't stand some of the things they do.

1. First off, we are chinese.

2. My dad bought this house that we can barely afford, and even roped my older brother in to sign with him in order for them to approve the purchase. My mom works two jobs in order to barely support the house, even though my family said we were fine with our smaller old one. But my mom went with my dad's wishes cause he's the dad and he wanted a bigger house. His argument is that in the future when house prices go up, he will sell and split the money to me and my brother. But who knows when or if that will happen.

3. In addition to this poor decision, my dad bought a dog. We already had a small dog that my brother bought, and a big dog that sadly passed away early, so really we were not ready for a dog. But the more important thing is that we are all full time workers in the house, and I don't think we have the time to raise a dog, especially since he bought a golden retriever. I think it has caused nothing but stress, due to needing to buy food, cleaning, barking, etc. My dad's not an athletic person so the rest of the family ended up having to do all the work.

4. My mom and dad in general like to complain about things and overall negative. I don't know if it's their stress or because honestly chinese people complain as a form of communication. But it just hurts my heart seeing them upset.

I end up coming home and locking myself in my room because I don't want to go out and hear all of this. I feel so stressed because I can't have a place of my own. At the same time, I don't know if I'm just overly sensitive and I shouldn't let others get to me, but I can't help it as I've always been a very empathetic person.

I'm only 23, I may not get a home until 30, especially in California, and my brother who is 27 still lives with us too. 

I know this is a wall of text, but I guess what I am trying to say is that: I am very fortunate to have this ""privilege"" of a nice house and free rent. But quite frankly, I would scrape pennies if it meant I can live on my own and get away from this negativity. But it is hard to argue against my parents, who love me very much, to justify living on my own vs living with them rent free, cause they want me to save money too. What are your thoughts?

301,"I'm a 3rd year at UC Berkeley majoring in applied math, and I'm having a rough time. I have a 1.6 gpa and I've failed almost every class for the past year. 

I was a straight A student in high school, I finished 2 associates degrees in math and physics by the time I was a senior in high school, and even got a full ride to Cal -- my entire life my parents and other people in my life have always hyped me up to be so smart and capable, the model child. But after a year at Cal, I only now passed my first classes this summer session, I feel so stupid and incompetent. 

I just feel so lost on what I'm doing, Berkeley is such a big school and it's been challenging getting help. There's times where it takes a month for me to see my counselor for 30 minutes. And Cal being hyper-competitive so many other students make it a point to put down others, and I'm finding myself being put down a lot by my math peers and myself as of late.

It's just lately my mental state has been deteriorating fast, I'm starting to feel demotivated, lethargic, and sad. I'm starting to absolutely hate school and just hate where I'm at in life right now. There have been several times in the past couple months where I just wanted to drop out of school and enlist in the Navy. 

 It's been a month since I've had a conversation with another human other than my parents.  I feel like such a failure, my scholarship and financial aide have been taken away forcing me to ask my parents for help and pick up work myself to make ends meet. 

It's been hard to approach my parents, my dad being a chief in the Navy wants to see results -- ""not self-pity,"" and my mom being an immigrant from the Philippines has been through much worst situations. 

In a week the fall semester starts and it's my last chance to make it right. Otherwise, Berkeley is going to dismiss me.

Initially we'll be moving into our new apartment September 20th but I figured I'll leave a few things behind and move them out slowly until Oct 1st hits.

We live in the basement area which is quite nice. We have 2 bedrooms, laundry, a small living room and a bar area with a mini fridge (To make matters a little more complicated, the mini fridge broke a week ago and now I either need to buy a brand new one or give them money for it). So basically, they're getting married next week on August 25th. They've been planning this wedding since we moved in last year. I'm assuming they're already stressed out about the wedding finally coming up and I'm not sure when to tell them we're moving out. Should I tell them before or after the wedding?

317,"A few weeks back a coworker asked for this Monday off (8/20) to take a family member to a doctor's appointment. A couple of days before that I saw that he was purchasing tickets to Vegas for the weekend before, and up to that day (8/18 - 8/20). He told me that he was going to Vegas for a 2 night, 3 day stay, but didn't give me dates. Today he finally said that they're going this weekend. I asked about the appointment for Monday, and he explained that they're flying out Saturday, coming back Sunday, and he's still taking his family member to the doctor on Monday.

He's a crappy worker, and has BS excuses all the time. I'm 99.99% positive he's lying, and would like to express my concerns to HR, but I'm not sure if I should for the reason that he didn't admit directly to me that he'll still be in Vegas Monday.

I've already thought it through, and have decided that if I were to go to HR I'd just explain that he told me he was taking a 3 day, 2 night trip there, and then told me that it's this weekend even though he took Monday off for a different reason.

324,"tl;dr Since January, each of my already separated parents has gotten a divorce, my mom has turned into an extreme tiger mom, my sisters were violated and molested by my dad, and my dad has kidnapped my 6-year old sister and skipped town with hints of suicide.

Before I get into what I've been going through, I want to say that I am currently going through therapy and my therapist has recommended I post my troubles anonymously online to help me since he knows I use reddit as a way to cope with life. Therefore, this post will be me telling my story to look for advice and to help relieve some of the weight.

If the me from a year ago looked at me now, I would be unrecognizable. Over the past few months, a series of major life changes that I have gone along with have left me with some insomnia, eating problems, depression, and severe anxiety (not diagnosed yet, but I will have the diagnosis by next week). As a bit of background, I am entering my senior year of high school after skipping my sophomore and junior year (due to my mom; more later) and would consider myself competitive for top schools. My mom's family is from Mexico, so she wants us to get the best education possible, but she ends up putting a lot of pressure on me and my two sisters to do well in school to the point where anything below a 97% is unacceptable. She constantly micromanages my studying, makes sure I will be valedictorian, made me take the SAT until I got a 1560, and made me take more classes this summer than I did in all of last school year. My parents got divorced about 11 years ago and both quickly remarried. My dad was abused growing up and has a history of being violent with my mother, which is why she left. I have been going between houses every week as part of the divorce agreement, but my mom has custody of me and my sisters.

Now for what happened over the last few months. My troubles all started in January when my mom got a divorce from my step-dad after he was caught stealing from her company and cheating on her. This caused my mom to shut down and go into a deep depression. I was fine at this point because I was never attached to my step-dad, but my mom started to focus all of her frustrations and anger on me by controlling every aspect of my life and forcing me to study and not allowing me to do anything with my friends (isolating me in my room with prep books and cancelling all of my plans). This went on for a few months until she found a new boyfriend, but once she did, she started giving him all of her attention and forgetting about me and my sisters (ex. not buying food for several days because she forgot, forgetting the plans we had for months to go on a date, etc.).

Around the same time, problems started occurring at my dad's house. One of my sister's friends found a video camera that was hidden in her room and I had found several in other private locations. My dad dismissed these as ""alarm systems"", but we all knew what they were. A few weeks later, we went on a vacation where I slept in the same room as my sisters (nothing abnormal). On the last night of the vacation, one of my sisters (technically my step-sister from my step-mom) was told to sleep in my dad's room (with my step-mom there too). I later asked why and my dad told me it was because I had ""touched my sister inappropriately"" the night before. This was a shock to me because nothing like that happened and my other sisters were up later than me and defended me; but he didn't listen.

Fast forward a week later and my dad was engaged in another screaming match with my step-mom and somehow I had become involved. A lot of things were said that I felt had threatened my safety, so the next morning, I woke my (biological) sisters, we packed our bags, and we went to school. That afternoon, we were supposed to return to my dad's house. But because none of us felt safe there, me and my sisters took the bus to my mom's house. When he found out where we were (he tracks our phones), he furiously called and rushed over to come get us. Because we were scared of what he might do if my dad managed to get us in his car, we called the police. When the police arrived, we informed him of the situation and said we refused to go over to my dad's house. When my dad arrived, he had a talk with the police officer and quickly sped away.

I have now been living with my mother for about 4 months, but since then, a lot has happened at my dad's house. It has come out that he was videoing and molesting/raping my step-sister (which is what was happening earlier in the hotel), my step-mom is getting a divorce, and naked videos of one of my biological sisters was distributed online. After all of this coming to light, my dad skipped town with my 6-year-old sister and cannot be found or contacted. The FBI and CPS have been looking for him for a while, but he has so far evaded arrest. The scary part is, the week before he left, he was dropping hints of suicide and talked about who was in his will, the fact that life insurance covers suicide, sadness, and the inevitability of death a lot.

On top of all of this, I am managing 3 internships, countless awards, college essays, a blog, coding, 8 summer classes, getting eagle scout, pressure from my mom, and maintaining a cheery outward composure while I'm crumbling inside. I have been interviewed by CPS several times and have had several breakdowns and slumps of bad depression. My mom has taken notice to this and put me in counseling, but I'm still having a lot of difficulties coping with all of this. I try to keep myself happy by saying stuff like ""If I make it through, this would make one hell of a movie/book/autobiography"" and ""one more year of school and you can move to California and it will all go away"", but deep down I really wonder if I can do it. My sisters have also taken this really hard with one on pills after being diagnosed with depression, and the other sad all the time.

I know this has kind of turned into a rant/me venting, but over the hour it has taken me to write this, I feel I've calmed down significantly like some of the load is released, so thank you for reading. I would appreciate any advice or positive comments that are not hotlines or medical help (I already have that much covered by my counselor and therapist) because my mom has destroyed all of the friendships that I could really use right now to talk about all of this. Thanks!",17Aug2018,0

I kinda suggested to my brother that we back out, or at least I do, and he got really angry. We have ticket insurance for the flights and concert. I UNDERSTAND that it’s a dick move. I won’t argue that. 

He went on about how pissed off him and his girlfriend is gonna be if I do back out, and pretty much begged me to stay. But this is where my dilemma comes in: do I care enough to spend 1000+ dollars just so people aren’t pissed at me?

His gf told my brother I don’t have to worry about paying the hotel since she picked an expensive one and makes way more money than I do. But I can’t begin to explain how guilty I’d feel if she payed for it all by herself.

If I’m being honest another big factor is Paul McCartney. I’m a huge Beatles fan and they’ve played a big part in my life. I’m not sure Paul will come back to LA in his lifetime and I’ve never seen him live.

Again, I get I should’ve done more research beforehand and that I’m being a bit of a dick. But I can’t help but see the smart thing is to just get refunds and save money for college. Any advice you all have would be lovely. Thank you!

328,"I find it impossible to make friends. Maybe I just don't belong here, or maybe I just fail miserably at understanding what friendship is supposed to be about.

Let me tell you what it feels like when I try to connect with people. 

Right now, I'm trying to make friends online because it's less stressful. But it is still stressful because I never know what to say.

Nothing ever happens in my life. I don't have amazing stories to tell. I feel like everyone expects me to tell them something really interesting, some story about ""That time I got so drunk I woke up in Kenya the next day"", something like that. I don't have stories to tell. And I don't want to force those stories by doing something that would probably ruin my life. I just want someone to be next to me every now and then, to talk to me about useless stuff every now and then.

But that's so hard. I try to find stuff I have in common with other people and, even when there is something we both like, there isn't much to say about it. ""Hey, how good was that thing we both like?"" ""It was pretty good alright"". Yeah, I don't know what else to say, it all just feels unnecessary. When I open my mouth, there's this voice telling me to not bother talking, because I have nothing interesting to say.

Now, I did say I didn't mind talking about useless stuff. But maybe that's just because I'm so lonely anything will do. I don't think other people feel this way. They expect interesting content from me, and I cannot provide.

Now what about making friends irl? Well, it's even harder to find people that share the same interests as I do. We could go to events together, except there are hardly any events here where I live that I find interesting. Would we just meet 2 or 3 times a year? I want something taken straight out of Friends or HIMYM!

It's hard to find people that share the same interests. It's hard to create conversations out of those interests. It's hard to break this ""awkward silence"", even if I don't personally mind it myself. Everything feels so robotic, fake and I never know what to say.

Please help TT TT",17Aug2018,1
329,"So I'm headed to college in a week, like many others here, and I have a roommate situation. I met my roommate a month ago at orientation and although he seemed like a nice person it was clear that he had some sort of mental disability (difficult to understand speaking, random scattered thoughts, unkempt, face looked different than that of a normal person). I myself am a quite shy person and am trying to break out of the ""shell"" I had throughout high school while I'm at college. Everyone I've talked to about the situation, and partly myself, think that it would be better for me to have a ""normal"" roommate. However, the other part of me feels that it is morally reprehensible to leave my roommate based on what I stated about him earlier. Not to mention that if I did decide to room with him I feel that I would be able to provide him with a positive rooming experience, more so than he may have with someone else. Anyways, I feel very torn about whether I should stay or leave and with college right around the corner it's time I made a decision, thanks for the help.",17Aug2018,1
331,"So me and my boyfriend have been together 10 years. We have a 6 year old boy and a 4 year old girl.
We have always done really well together. We were never rich but always got by without stressing too badly. 
Our apartment got a new landlord who let anyone move in. Place got roaches bad. Had drug addicts all around us climbing the building to beat his bm and it was crazy. We couldn't afford to leave and get a new home so decided we would go to his parents home where they are fairly rich. We stay downstairs but it is basically a little apartment. We would pay the same as were paying now. Kids bedrooms upstairs though.
My son is the shy, sweet but emotional one. He's got my mentality. My daughter is loud and outrageous like her dad. 
We move in and all is well except we can't save any money because they charge us the same as our old place. Ok, whatever. 
I noticed my son started wetting the bed and did not like these people and tbh I didn't either. They are dirty, disgusting, rude arrogant twats. They clearly have serious mental health issues but constantly rave how other people make up shit and mental illness doesn't exist except in severe cases. Ya, I know. 
So I notice they love my daughter enough that I would find her with a big bag of candy every night, not going to bed till 12 or 1, 2 in the morning. I, finally, after a year, freaked out and said she's my kid u all need to back the fuck off. If I say no I mean it. My daughter had to have 3 ""mini"" root canals despite brushing every morning and night. I was devastated. 
Since my son is so reserved anyway I figured he picked up my vibes of hating where I'm at in life and despising these people so that's why he never wanted to be with them. About 3 to 5 months after moving in I told my boyfriend I wasn't comfortable leaving them here without me, like to go to work, since he's not comfortable. He disagreed but understood and basically said I do what I want. 
Ok fast forward and there's little incidents here and there that make me not trust them with my kids, especially my son. My son picks up a toy and my daughter wants it and they tell him he will no.longer be able to play with it since he didn't hand it over right away and they bought it so he has to listen. My son not sleeping in his room which is next to theirs upstairs, peeing the bed, being generally unhappy for a kid.

 Last night, I was cooking in the kitchen and their grandpa was on the couch sleeping. My son was on the floor in front of him with their dog who they've had 3 years and has attacked 4 different children and they refuse to rehome.. the dogs good with my kids but I try to keep them away. My daughter runs in and wakes up her grandpa to show him her new shopkins (very small plastic/rubber toys) he grabs them and throws them at my son's head as hard as a grown man could. It hit him right on his face. Then he tried to justify it saying the dog was about to bite because my son was being mean to it. Once my daughter came in and tried waking him, I watched because I didn't want her to wake him and was kind of mad at the fact she acts so entitles now that they buy and do everything she asks or wants. My son was gently petting his head and the dog was sleeping so It was ok in my eyes.
I told my boyfriend that I would be taking out student loans to try and get out of here with or without him in September. I told my son his grabdpa was wrong and he no longer has to go upstairs and I'm currently packing all his shit from his room and he will sleep with me. 
My boyfriend is speechless basically but doesn't think it's a big deal. I'm freaking out. I think it's abuse. I've talked to my mom and she said it is abuse and we need to go somewhere like a shelter now till school money but I don't want to. He starts school on Tuesday, I start the following week and we aren't going to be able to have anything except for shelter life and I don't want to. 
For more background: in the beginning I questioned why we would pay as much as our old apartment since we weren't living half as good as we were but my boyfriend said that's what they want and we had nowhere to go. They have a large swimming pool in the backyard and they tell my 4 and 6 year old to go play outside all the time unsupervised. Since day one if I can't find a kid, I run out hoping they aren't drowned. I quit my job cuz I'm fucking stressed and worry for my children every minute of every day. I figured since im a full time student it would be ok since were here anyway. With my boyfriends income we could have everything we needed but nothing else which is fine. We planned to move at income tax time and me find a part time job. They threaten my son to ""wop"" him because he made my daughter mad, don't buy him anything meanwhile my daughter gets any and everything. Literally guys. We were told in the beginning that this was our little apartment and we could do whatever we want as long as we pay. 1 month in we're told we will cook every night for them or to get out. We were told we have to be social or get out. Because they hadn't seen us in 2 days because were fucking grown ass adults with separate schedules. We mow the land they have or get out and no this doesn't come off what we pay, when the dog attacked the last kid they got another dog, same breed and let it in to eat maybe every other day, it isn't trained and they won't try so I have to feed and try to train the dog and I'm not a dog person, never had one in my life. I'm constantly picking up shit and piss so I let it in to eat then put it back outside. If it rains, they'll say the dog can't stay in the garage and put it downstairs and lock the door while I'm asleep so I wake up to surprises every fucking day. They leave out food like chicken and eggs for 24 hours then feed it to guests. They don't pick up so the back yard where they have a large pool, fire pits, horse shoes is trashed. Literally they dump in shock and they come in like little paper type bags and they throw them on the ground so there's trash and shit everywhere. 
I've decided I will take pictures and video of the house once they leave so if they try to take me to court over grandparent rights I will be ok along with allegations against them.. I hope I get enough from student loans to move. We have 1 car and I'm obviously going to have to go back out and a get a job once we move somewhere safe which isn't a problem but fuck I'm so stressed. My boyfriend sat our son down and then later told me my 6 year old says he hates them all doesn't want to see them ever again but said that's the worst they have done to him.. 
My daughter is now an entitled prick. "" I can do what I want mom, get my iPad and snacks... NOW"" Yes I spank her ass after telling her over and over she can't talk that way and explaining what she should say and to not expect. She will repeat herself over and over that I have to do what she asks. Her grandparents have 4 kids, 3 have nothing to do with them. When they visit once a year the parents make them help build shit or fix shit. Their kids r free labor. My boyfriend is probably the most well off of all them. I get it now. I have complained starting at month 1 about favoritism, the amount we pay, the work we do here, me being the only one of 4 adults who does ANY dishes, laundry or anything. That's why I honestly quit my job. I literally will have a break down over dirty shit and I would work a 10hr shift 3 days straight and come home, my son would be reclused, my daughter mouthy, dishes all over every counter top, poop everywhere and 10 loads of laundry. Im a fucking maid to them. Then they beg money off grandpa's 86 year old extremely wealthy mom to buy new cars, tractors, whatever. Anything they want. Then lecture me of my spending habits and tell me to go buy a 150k house when we would struggle with a 60k house. I hate it. I hate my life. If I didnt  have kids I would sleep on fiends couches but I want some kind of normalcy. Something. 
Idk what to do and my boyfriend turned into a lazybslob the moment we moved in and is no help. I will leave him when I get the chance and have told him this plus my kids won't be visiting if he stays with them. 
He has talked to them in the past about behavior and dirtiness and treating us like kids when they should expect nothing more than a tenant but nothing has changed. I'm going to go take pics so u can understand. I will upload. I guess I can just put them in the comments or whatever. I've been on Reddit like 6 years buy just recently made this account and just now starting to post and stuff.

A is best friends with B but wants to date me. I also want to date A, but also wouldn't mind just staying friends. B \*really\* wants to date A; B also has depression, to the point that I know it would crush her if she was turned down by A in favor of me.

Basically, neither A or I know what to tell B, so A and I agreed to make a post. Personally I'm tempted to tell A to accept B's feelings (unless he isn't willing to), because the alternative would destroy B emotionally due to her depression.

Right now me(16M) and my parents, sister(13F), my uncle, aunt and my little cousin(15M)  are enjoying out holidays in the Mediterranean.  I'd like to preface this by saying that I generally have a fine relationship with everyone in my family. Also I'd like to say that my little cousin is kind of a loner and has an introverted personality and has previously endured some bullying from his peers because of that. Also I know for a fact that he has never even has a female friend but he is a good kid.

So, not to tire you anymore with background info 3 days ago I was told by my sister that the last couple of days she saw my cousin just blatantly staring at her in the morning while he thought that she was sleeping(FYI we all sleep in the same room in bunk beds), I just brushed that off as her being overly dramatic and I thought that he probably was looking at something in the bed or whatever, I didn't think of this as anything sinister. Fast forward to an hour ago I was snooping around his phone(something he absolutely hates other people doing, he is very private about his phone e.t.c but not overly; as in once you get access to his phone and you open his browser you'll instantly see a ton of pornhub tabs just lying there) and I decided to check his picture gallery;beyond all the pictures of titty models and pornstars that I expected to find I very unfortunately stumbled upon an abundance of pictures of my sisters ass(while she was wearing short shorts and her bikini) I'm sick to my stomach and as angry as I've ever felt, all I want to do is beat his pathetic ass up. Someone please help me, how do I approach this?I'll probably tell his brother when he visits us tomorrow(He is 19 and I'm closer to him). But someone tell me please what do I do??In part I want to believe that it's his hormones getting the better of him due to his lack of experience with girls his age but on the other hand I can't stop myself from thinking it's some sort of incest fetish he has developed through watching all this porn.

They treat me just like I’m their own kid and I really like them and I think they like me. 

However, my bf brought up to me today that I should start giving them some rent money for staying there. After all, they let me live there, they feed me, and let me use their cars sometimes. And I’m completely happy to pay them! They have been so kind to me. 

But right now I have a shit job and rarely get any hours (think 8 per week!) and they keep cutting my shifts because they hire too many people and can’t pay them all... my shifts for this whole past week were cut because of this. So I really don’t make much at all. I get 100something every 2 weeks. 

So how much should I give them per month? I don’t want to pay so much that I can’t afford anything else (I’m saving up for my own car right now and to eventually move out with my bf) but I also don’t want it to be too little that it seems like I’m ungrateful. ",17Aug2018,1

345,"Hi. I really don’t know what the right way about going about this and I need help.
So, first let me add some context and then I’ll get into it.
I’m an 18 year old, female. I was pretty naïve when applying for the job. I saw a cute guy on the register and that’s why I decided to apply. Even though I knew back then that it wouldn’t be a good idea, I did it anyways. I got hired, and we became friends, and I developed a bit of an infatuation with him, but I soon realized he was not “boyfriend material” at all. He’s a huge player, and he’d tell me about the girls he was going after and what not. 
I got over him, and although I still craved his praise and approval, I no longer wanted to pursue him...until we went out to smoke and drink a bit together.
He pulled up to a lake front, set up a hammock, and we smoked a few J’s and drank a few beers. And the hammock started getting uncomfortable to sit in... so we laid down.. and we started to make out. 
The next day, we worked together. And he tried to talk to me about it, but I’m not the greatest at those types of conversations.
We established (throughout the day) that we both were into it, but we shouldn’t pursue anything further. Or, at least I established that... he was a bit curious on why hooking up wouldn’t be a good idea. But I told him it’d be stressful in the future, and left it at that.
The rest of the day was awful. I felt like shit. My self-esteem dropped. We act like everything is fine at work, and I believe it for a second, until we do something alone for a second and there’s a bit of tension. Or when he gets flirty with another girl... 
I’m confused on what I want and what I should do. I enjoyed making out with him... but I know it’s wrong to continue. My subconscious and normal conscious are really battling it out right now. 
I’m not sure what to do at this point. Something feels off. I’m not sure if I should tell him about my past infatuation with him and how that ties in with the confusion and what I’m feeling now, or if I should let things die down naturally. 
I feel like something’s not right and I need to do or say something to fix it, but I’m not quite sure what to do. 
Any advice you have to offer would be nice. I know, I’m an idiot for what I did... I knew it was a bad idea and I did it anyways and now I have to face the consequences.",17Aug2018,0

Within seconds this guy sitting with his little brother or son offered me his seat and sat down next to the little boy. So I say thank you and take a seat, mostly just shocked by the kindness.

We’ve been ‘friends’ for over 8 years. We barely saw each other cause we live far away but we messaged and called each other a lot.

Long story short, she started dating this guy a couple months ago and I noticed our friendship sort of drifted.

Last month, I had an argument with him because he started yelling at me over the phone for no apparent reason. Then she got mad at me for fighting her bf.

We’re both in our early 20’s and to me she seems to be still caught up with high school stuff. I also found out that she’s been using me as an excuse so her parents would let her go out.

Then a week after that argument I had a conversation with her. She told me she didn’t want to be friends anymore but after our talk we both decided to save the friendship.

But nothing has happened since. I still haven’t heard from her and we haven’t talked or seen each other. She goes through a lot of friends. Now she’s friendless, but in a relationship.

I didn’t realize how proud and egotistical she was until now, and how shallow our friendship was considering that things are the way they are now because of some stupid minor things. 

It’s been a month. Should I message her? Or just leave her be?",17Aug2018,1

355,"Most places would recommend HR. My jobs were usually small, local businesses, so no one other than the owners to report to.

I even used to work with this elderly person who would roll up the silverware while eating a piece of greasy pizza. I thought that was so absurd I took a photo of the table (she wasn’t around when I took the pic). To top it off, I reminded her that she couldn’t do that, or she had to actually wash the food baskets before putting them back up to be reused. I also told her that ‘dipping your hands in soapy water in that’s used for dishwashing isn’t actually washing your hands’.

Her responses were always “fuck this” or “fuck you” or whatever. The owners didn’t care. She put dirty baskets on the clean stack in front of them many times.

I quit this job quite a few months ago but it still irritates me obviously. One time, the owner was prepping food with his hands, and he dragged the trashcan with his bare hand, and then continued prepping food with his hands.


I know I probably sound like a germaphobe, but if someone was serving your food and their hands were dirty and they just dip them in some soapy dishwater or prepared clean silverware with greasy hands, how would you feel about that?",17Aug2018,0

However, I would like to save money and may travel too. I'm also worried that I might have problems with women if I'm making less some of them.

359,"So I was born in Jordan, and until grade 2, I went to another country to study because I didn’t have an actual id number( this is what prevented me from studying there). So my whole fam from my fathers side lives there. And my mothers live in a country near by. So Because of my country, i have become an introvert. I have started rejecting meeting new people. It’s just been horrible from me. In my summer break, I decided to visit Jordan, and it’s just amazing until now. I’ve been honestly okay with foreignness but now that I’ve come here, it just feels so sad that I’m not gonna stay for long. People love me here. I’m more of an extrovert here. However I still love the country that I live in. I won’t really be able to go anywhere else because all my life is there.

360,"So I have an ex (who I've posted about before and yes I agree it's a mess) [29 m] who I've been able to become friends with over time and I've always had an attachment to him. I've been able to branch out, seek a therapist, and find my own sense of peace and self-love while he's stayed kind of the same. He broke up with me by saying it was the best for us because we needed to work on ourselves. I've been able to find a bit of happiness and self-love through yoga, therapy, and being a bit more social than I have before.

We had this problem where he would lie to me, however, and he wouldn't confess unless he had seen that I had proof and then would relent. When we broke up, he denied talking to other females and such and kind of made it a hell for me but I was able to get past it and actually just find a line with just being his close friend. It turns out that he'd been lying to me about having a gaia account where he'd been talking absolute trash about me, even around my birthday this year, and making me out to be this terrible person. But yet to my face he'll still be super sweet and tell me how important I am to him and how he still has romantic feelings for me (but is unsure if he wants to be in a relationship). 

He denied this account was is, but everything points to it being him including very personal information being shared about him and his mannerisms in the texts. It's very blatantly him but he continues to deny the claims even though I found proof and showed him.

I think i'm honestly just really bothered that even after all this time, he's still lying to me and can't even confess the truth to me after I've even said I'd forgive him if it was him. I don't really care that he talked trash about me, I think I just really wished I could see that he had the ability to be honest with me.
How do you get over a deep rooted feeling of love and care for someone who won't ever be honest with you?



tl:dr; Ex/best friend has a past history of lying and I thought he was over it but it turns out he lied about something and the evidence is damning and I don't know how to proceed with protecting my heart.",17Aug2018,1

I've tried to seek advice on saving up for things like plastic surgery and the like but people usually tell me my ""nose is fine"" however I know that it's not, as you can see it's very large and bulbous especially from the front-on angle.

What I'm asking is - is there a way to get my mind off of this? Even for just a while?

I've tried chewing gum several hours a day for a stronger face, listening to Mike Mew's advice on jaw position etc, and all and I've seen absolutely 0 change.

Don't recommend therapy, I can't get it. My parents won't let me (I'm 16 - I know I look way older). My school counselor is totally terrible, and I've tried online therapy for several years to no avail (some, like BetterHelp, have rejected me and said I need IRL hel - which I can't get).

“Your granddaughter is a good fucker.”

She’s upset, I’m upset and angry that someone would do this, and I want to know who would have done this, because I have never in my life given out her phone number to anyone in the last 5 years.

I want to call the police and ask if there’s any way to investigate, she insists I should not look into it and I shouldn’t tell anyone because it would upset them too and it would be a waste of time.

But no one I know outside of my family knows her number so I don’t know how this person would know she even has a granddaughter to even say this.

Part of me is wondering if she made this up or if she’s just that old school that she thinks I should keep quiet about it.

I don’t charge much for my arrangements. I charge a service fee if they need a big order for an event (that’s practically like the “tip” sort of I guess).

Should I enforce tip if people ask me to make an arrangement for them on the dot? What about last minute event? (Like they order the day of their event and need it within X  amount hours before their event).

Ex. As of currently my cousin doing a huge ass order, like 100 small bouquets, some flowers in bulk  for only $800 seems pretty cheap... (I think it’s for a friend since they talk casually with each other)

368,"Hey, so I’m a 16 year old male teenager who constantly comes up with creative ideas and I’m looking for some advice as to how I should go about a clear progression to making myself successful in one/some/all of these different avenues that I want to take in life. Before you offer your help/thoughts/opinion, here are the different main concepts that I want to do.

I’ve always wanted to be a “creator”. That’s what I want to do as a career. I constantly think about it, for hours every single day. Here are the main creative avenues I’ve decided I want to try to pursue, or at least consider.

First, I want to be a music artist. I can sing fairly well, as well as understand music theory and can produce my own music using software such as FL Studio. I have spent money on gear for music making. I’ve considered getting a partner/partners to help me make music, and release it, but it is hard to find people who share my vision or are interested in working with me with the chance of pay if the music is successful. 

Second, I want to be a writer. I want to write books of poetry regarding emotions and life experiences and lessons I’ve learned. I want to write TV shows and movies. I’ve considered in the past being a journalist, but I think I’ve decided I’d rather focus on writings more personal to me than news topics. But again, would love to hear your thoughts on that and if I made the right choice.

Third, I want to be an actor in my own TV shows and movies, provided I end up writing them. I always would envision myself as one of the characters, and because of that, I feel I would be best at nailing the performance of the envisioned character. 

Fourth, I want to be someone who creates social media-based photography and videography. I have invested in quality camera gear, and understand photo editing as well as movie editing. I’d create comedy-based pieces and such. These would be projects done on the side of the other creative options, more so as a way to connect with my audience more on a personal level. They’d be released on all major social media sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Fifth, I want a podcast.

So, those are some of my creative avenues I’d like to take. The others would involve some form of success beforehand, whether that be traction or money, before I can comfortably pursue them. I was inquiring about your thoughts on what I should do. I know I am young and I have some years to figure it out, but I hate not knowing how to go about becoming a success in the industries I want to go into. It’s almost like I need a mentor or manager or someone to help me process this all better. All my creative avenues come back to the core concept that I like to tell stories, whether fiction or real to me, through different mediums. I’m very curious as to what I should, and was wondering if you had any thoughts, or potentially yourself or one of your connections who would be interested in contacting me to discuss further. I can answer any questions and discuss my thoughts. Just let me know your thoughts, but to some it up, my question is, what should a creative teenager with no major successes like me do in this situation?",17Aug2018,3

371,He moved away(about 4.5 hours) for college dating this girl and had in total dated her for over 4 years. Recently he and my parents had decided that he would move an hour away and study at a college closer by. Then a couple weeks ago I find out he broke up with his girlfriend who he loves saying that she deserves better. She is great but he is a good guy too and deserved her. Then he tells me he's planning to stay at the far college and work full time. And enroll in classes the next semester. Yet he doesn't have a job and just partied the last month away. I'm worried he might just not come home and tell them over the phone he's staying. But my parents won't financially support him if he's living up there so he wouldn't have the money to live on his own. AT ALL.

372,"I have been renting a car for the past month and my contract says that I am to return the vehicle on Saturday August 18th (tomorrow). This will have been in my possession for 4 weeks now. On saturday, I should be billed for the full amount plus any additional wear to the vehicle to be deemed at the time of inspection.

On Thursday I received a charge on my visa for the full amount owed to the vehicle plus what I imagine to be a deposit.

What is weird to me, is that the office I am doing business with is no longer open on Saturdays which is when I'd have to return the car. So they have a drop box I could put the keys in and leave it, but if thats the case, why would I be charged so early, and without an inspection, and a receipt printed to close the transaction?

If I have already paid the full amount due on my contract before I am required to return the vehicle how does that work? Do they just expect me to return it on the day of with no problems?

That early charge set me back negative $600 in my checking account as I was not planning to make funds available until the weekend.

Can they charge me for having the vehicle longer even though I have paid my obligated amount?

If there is a system in place for the car to be returned to any location even after hours, how would they ever find out that I am still driving it? 

Sans a tracking device, if that vehicle is paid and my name cleared, would they come looking for it?

Obviously I am not trying to steal a car here, but the company appears to have made a slight miscalculation.

I guess my biggest concern is that I continue to drive it and somehow accrue a lot of late charges on the vehicle because the information in the system says I was the last one to have it.

Rental Car employees of reddit, wtf do I do?

to add to the story, I already tried to do the right thing by calling their office and explaining the situation, but the guy was confused about how I could be charged without returning the vehicle so he referred me to another office as he was swamped at the time and sounded new

So tell me. Did I get a free car, or at least unlimited access to one? My gut says no, but logic says maybe.",17Aug2018,1

374,"Hi, I'm an 18 year old guy going into college. I'm currently (maybe not for long) with a girl for about 6 weeks now. Before we dated, we were super close friends for 5 years and got to know each other alike to how a couple would in that span of time. Needless to say, because of our past and us already knowing a lot about each other, her confidence in the relationship working out is kind of low. She (and me too, but I'm not reacting as negatively) often has trouble talking to me over text (even though in person we mesh really well and always have a good time) and she says that since it keeps happening, she thinks that it's a ""sign"" that things won't work out and that we would be better off staying as friends. Of course the first thing that you think of at this point is ""if they were friends before and she wants to be friends again, that means that she just doesn't like him in that way right?"" Or at least that's the first thing that I thought, so I asked. She INSISTED that she ""definitely"" still liked me and that wasn't the reason at all. Of course she could be lying to try to not hurt my feelings, but lets just assume for the sake of this post that shes not (and yes, I also mentioned that ""if you're doing this to not hurt my feelings please just tell me the truth"" and she still insisted). 

Specifically, she stated that ""shes having a hard time putting the effort into the relationship"" , ""it's hard to see myself in a long term relationship at this point in time"" (which, since we've only been together for 6 weeks, I told her not to worry about so early) , and that it wasn't because of another guy she has feelings for (which is more likely to be a lie than her telling me that she still likes me, but I still believe her). She also said ""I think I'm a better as a friend than a girlfriend"".

375,"Since day 1 of my life I've always looked down on people, so I never made many friends (but I cherished those whom I kept close).

This surplus time, plus topping grades with little studying, made me interested in a wide range of activities; manga, writing/making comics, and filmmaking theory etc until I was about 12.

After that, I started playing videogames but I stopped around October of 2017, when I turned 15. 

Since then, my hobbies are these:

Playing the guitar

Learning languages (right now - Japanese, German, and Spanish)

Reading books

This summer I started exercising as well, and going to the gym. I got a trainer and everything.

I'm going to a British school somewhere in Asia. I just finished my GCSEs and I'm starting the IB in September, but I have to revise for my ACTs right now. I'm hovering around 32 points.

My mom told me yesterday that all my going to the gym was a total waste and that I could have spent all that time revising for the IB yesterday.

She also says that all my hobbies like playing the guitar, learning languages and the like, are wastes of time and don't contribute to what I ""want to do."" She keeps hassling me about choosing a major, even though I don't really think I should be so focused on that at this age (16). I mean, I know I want to do something along the lines of engineering.

He was suicidal in the past and my dad had to take a gun away from him when my brother was drunk years ago, so I know he goes to painfully dark places at times. Now he's dealing with financial issues and health issues with his kid, and it seems like he's starting to unravel and possibly even drink again. The point is, he's getting to the point where it just seems like he's about to snap and these comments are happening more frequently. I know this comes off as super callous cause of how stressed out he is, but his behavior is irrational and he's full of so much rage. How seriously should I take these threats? I also don't have any evidence of these comments other than what his gf tells me, and to boot she may also have just kicked him out of her parent's house.

383,"Some background:

I am a 19yo male who is of Indian descent.  My family practices Hinduism and are very conservative.  They are very active at our local temple and are very religious.  

Today my dad invited a priest over for lunch.  In the Hindu religion, it is a common custom of having a priest or an enlightened person over for food; it's considered an honor for us to host them.  This priest has a good relationship with my parents.  We all sit down for lunch.  After lunch the priest asks if I want to take a little stroll to burn off the calories.  He starts asking me about American life and culture (he is an immigrant btw) and I respond.  He then asked my permission about a personal question, I hesitate but say yes.  He asks about a rumor that they teach Sex Ed in elementary school.  He's planning on bringing his kids to the states and was worried about this.  I tell him most schools teach Sex Ed at the middle school level and parents have the option to opt their kids out.  Well he then goes onto to talk about his college life and experiences with sex (at this point I was really, really uncomfortable with the convo).  He tells me that he had a gay roommate and was confused with homosexuality growing up.  Fast forward a few mins later he is still talking about sex and masturbation and asks me if I watch porn, masturbate, have any relationships.  

I was devastated to be having this convo with a man whom I thought was to be filled with innocence and morality.

I somehow conclude our convo and he asks me for my number.  I tell him just to be polite.

Back home now,  I'm sitting in my basement, studying for an exam and start getting sleazy texts from him. 

He actually ends up asking me if I want a blow job.

My gut wrenched.  I was filled with a flood of emotions.  Frankly I was really fking pissed off that this supposedly ""man of God"" came to my house and ate the food my mom made and had the audacity to come onto me like this when I specifically mentioned that I am not a homosexual.  I am confused and somewhat disappointed right now.

Obviously the man swore me to secrecy but I feel the need to tell someone (hence the reddit post)

I have mulled over the possible outcomes of me telling someone/my parents:

1. temple gets a bad name
2. Priest loses his job
3. Some people not believe me and may even view me as the bad guy

384,"Im 18 now and since I was 14 I have been working for a agricultural company (family business) that my grandfather and my uncle own, it a 100 year old tradition. I wasn’t forced to do it but my mom took me there at 14 to “help out”, since I am a part of the family.

It’s a very succesful but small business. Basically all workers there are family members. We all eat, work together and have good relations. It’s in a village at the end of my home town where they also live.

They are basically farmers and they work way too much and way too hard for normal people. Most people on reddit or the Internet have never worked out on a farm, in a wineyard or an orchard for 12 hours a day. 

During the season its extremely hard and exhausting; I feel dizzy sometimes, my legs are always sore, my head hurts, my arms are all cut and bruised up from scrathes, I have allergie problems when im in a field etc...

I have proven to my grandfather over these 4 years that I am a really good worker. I suck it all up and I never complain about anything. I am pretty strong so I can do the hard physical work as well. He is now very proud of me and obviously wants me to continue working but I just don’t want to do it anymore.

My mom’s cousin started the same as I did at around 15 years old, he is 30 now and STILL works there. He doesn’t like it either but can’t find another job.

I don’t want to go into detail why I don’t like it but It’s just too hard for me. I’ve been working my ass off for 4 years while going to school, keeping up with my training everyday as well.

I don’t want to be there forever, this job was NEVER in my interest, it just happened. I can’t let it take over my life. Collage is just around the corner and I was considering other jobs.
 
How do I tell my grandfather, my uncle AND my whole family that I can’t work for them anymore now that they see and believe so much in me? I don’t have the balls to just go up in their face and tell them im leaving...

So, my boss, this is a woman I have for the most part had a good relationship with, as in she’s my boss, we have a bit of a laugher, but honestly I don’t really know her and she doesn’t really know me. 

Recently my team has seriously began to fall apart (Team of 7), one of the key members of my team left 3 weeks ago and the main reason he left is because the relationship he had with my boss fell apart. What I witnessed when it fell apart was my boss and another female colleague bitching constantly about him, whispering constantly and just being generally unprofessional.

Since then I decided I would move desk to get away from listening to the bitching because it was constant and I felt like I was being dragged into it.

The whispering and sly comments about other people in the wider department are still ongoing between my boss and the other female colleague but I am a bit away and not directly listening which is a plus! 

In general other than the bitching and whispering between them too my boss has a really bad tendency to curse aloud a lot but try’s to play it off as a laugh which I always do awkwardly laugh to because I don’t know what else to do.. she doesn’t have any 1:1 meetings with anyone only the colleague she bitches with and a guy she hired who is her friend, Ive had no performance feedback, a lot of us feel really in edge thinking who’s next to be hated.. stuff like that..

But now something has happened which did impact me and has really pissed me off. So at my level on the team I have 3 equals (we all get payed relatively the same and are supposed to do the same work).  Two of us have just came out of college and work really hard and have got involved in so many projects and he other guy is her friend from outside work, does zero, only texts on his phone all day, initially he was hired on a 3 month contract as a favor to him till he got sorted with a new job as he was recently made redundant, he’d never worked in the area he is now working in and has openly said tones of times he hates it. But she keeps extending his contract. So i had a meeting 3 weeks ago when I asked will I be extended and she said “yeah look I’ll try give you the 11/12 months extra” which would bring us up to November/December 2019 she said the same to the other guy who just came out of college! Last week we were both told by our boss “oh due to budget constraints we can only extend you till June 2019” and at the time I said yeah cool better than nothing and so did the other guy! But then we found out she also extended her friend an extra 10 months (he was supposed to be finished next week and now is finished in June too)!! And doing the calculation the extra months he’s gaining we are losing of the original extension plan.. 

Both of us were extremely annoyed and we mentioned it to the only person on he team we actually trust she admitted to us she is having an awful time with our boss and is interviewing for a new job, so we all agreed we want to say it someone and get help, and we said we would go to our bosses boss, but as we don’t know her (sits in another country) we would say it to the HR manager, she wasn’t taken back at all by it (as if she knew, I had heard rumors there had been compliant of her conduct were made but wasn’t sure) anyway she listened to us and said we did the right thing going to her, she said she will sit with each of us individual and go through how we have been impacted and she would set up the meeting with our bosses boss about what was going on.. 


Now I am freaking out and not know if I have over reacted or not... so any advice is really appreciated if I should talk to my bosses boss?  ",17Aug2018,1
387,"About 3 years ago husband and I got in a huge drunken fight. It was an enormous mistake. We went to therapy &amp; AA. That was the last time we drank and put intense effort into rebuilding our marriage. That being said, this is what happened and I want to know if there is a record of this anywhere. I feel like even if I do my own background check, it won't show up. But police will be able to see it if they pull my information. Please limit the responses to the actual question. This was 3 years ago. We know it was really bad and we have clocked 100's of hours in couples therapy, individual therapy and AA. 

We got into a verbal altercation at home after leaving a mutual friends house in not so good spirits and had been drinking. The fight escalated completely out of control and we continued to drink MORE and it got more and more out of hand. He started throwing things around the house. I was saying crazy mean things to him. I locked myself in a room. He started banging on the door. I said that I had the gun in the room with me and if he busted down the door, I would shoot. There was in fact a gun in the room as that was its usual location. I never picked it up. I told him what I did to stop him from busting down the door. He called the cops and said we were having a huge (verbal only) fight and he wanted to leave but he also wanted the cops to escort him and the guns as we had multiple guns in the home (he is a hunter and this is a rural area so it's quite the norm). That's all he remembers telling them as he was so drunk. I know he must have given more details because when the police got there, they mentioned some aspects of the fight. I'm unsure if that makes a difference and I don't know what was said. Though I'm 100% confident neither of us at any time claimed there was an physical confrontation. Being extremely drunk, I refused to tell the police my name and date of birth. I said I didn't have to as they were in my home and I hadn't done anything wrong. They insisted they would arrest me if I didn't give them this information. I again drunkenly told them""I have rights and I absolutely don't have to give you that information"". I also was worried about them putting me in a file with whatever crap my husband told them. Eventually I told them my name and DOB, they escorted husband and left. I'm not even sure why they were insisting on my name and DOB when neither of us were claiming a physical fight had occurred. And no crimes were being committed. And they were inside my home. With my husbands permission and he told them I was his wife. But that's beyond the point. Is there a record of this that the cops will see if I was stopped for something or had to have a more intense background check....like working within law enforcement or something similar. If they can see it, is that something I can see as well? How do I obtain it so I can look it over before potentially embarrassing myself by opening up my record to a more in depth background check? Or is it so accessible that they might see it if I was to be pulled over for something?",17Aug2018,1

389,"Three years ago, I got out of a relationship with a girl. It was fairly on and off and I was just looking to have sex. She had expressed to me on a couple occasions that she wanted to have sex with me and that she was planning on have sex with me, but wanted it to be right because she was nervous to do it for her first time.

Towards the end of the relationship, after the times when she told me she had planned on having sex with me, when we would hook up, we'd only be in our underwear. I would pull my dick out of my boxers and guide it to be thrusting into her vagina *overtop* of her underwear. For a while this is what we did, but then I took it into my own hands to try and push it a little bit and get her to ask/have sex with me.

When I would be thrusting over top of her underwear, I would reach down and move her underwear to the side and slowly thrust more and more til the tip of my dick was in her. I did check to make sure she was still actively participating which she was. At the time, I wasn't sure if it was totally right to be doing this, but I figured since she was still participating and not objecting that it must be okay. There was one time when she asked if I was over top of her underwear still and I moved my dick back from underneath to being overtop of her underwear. There was never another time when she questioned it, but she never asked to take it further, so I was always stuck in a state of limbo and kept inching towards seeing what she was okay with.

We never did end up having full blown sex, but now that I look back on it, I wonder if she actually knew that I was moving her underwear or not. I've also done some soul searching and realized that I shouldn't just wait until a girl says no, but rather be proactive in asking for consent. I know that if she was actively participating and not objecting that I had no idea if she wanted it or not, but I feel like I took advantage of the situation and am super regretful about it. I have a feeling that she wanted to wait more and that what I was doing wasn't right. This has caused me a ton of anxiety and I constantly worry if I sexually assaulted her or harmed her in any way cause that was never my intention. I knew I would have stopped if she had expressed any discomfort or stopped participating, but I now want to make sure that I 100% know the other person knows what is going on.

I would love advice, however critical it may be. But I am working to forgive myself for being so pushy and am actively getting 100% consent and not leaving things to a grey area or up in limbo.",17Aug2018,1
390,"This is a throw away account.

Tl;dr: I haven't changed my cell number so I have a warning if he decides to text me before he does something crazy. Now that I've moved away, should I change my number so he can't contact me at all?

Long story short, I have three restraining orders against my ex. He has broken the restraining order 5 times and has been arrested for doing so twice (hence the triple restraining orders; the court adds a new one each time he breaks the last). The original restraining order was for harassment (call and text with threats) but he has never physically hurt me or showed up at my place since his first arrest.  

It has been 2 full years of this pattern: he gets drunk, texts or calls me, then I call the cops and he gets arrested for violating the no-contact order. Even though he hasn't hurt me, I am afraid of him for how unpredictable he is:

* He's an alcoholic (many of the times, he contacted me while drunk).
* He has no care or respect for the law or law enforcement (has two DUI's and continues to contact me despite being arrested multiple times, plus had a past of law-breaking).
* During his probation for the first arrest, he failed over 20 UAs and missed several others. He also graduated from the lowest-risk domestic violence class to the highest risk domestic violence class during his treatment.
* I'm pretty sure he is manic-depressive ( Ik I'm not a psychiatrist but I am in nursing school and have had a lot of education on psychology) - this one is worrying because in a manic state he is likely to make rash decisions and has an inflated sense of entitlement etc. Additionally, I believe he is manic depressive with psychosis (he told me before we broke up that the government was after him for writing defamatory raps about Hillary Clinton and that he had to move away to Alaska).
* He does not understand my role in this case: one of the times he got arrested was for texting me to ""drop the charges"" which made it clear to me that he didn't realize I had no role in his arrest (the police asked me to hand over my phone so they could see our texts etc. and from there they decided that he was guilty of harassment and arrested him without giving me a say. Same with the proceedings in court, the original restraining order and probation, as well as his subsequent arrests were done without my say.)- In other words I am more afraid of him because he seems to blame me for all of the arrests and charges, when in reality I had no say once the evidence was turned over.

He's been in jail since May because the court finally decided that he deserved jail time for breaking the no-contact orders so many times. For his original charge (harassment with a DV enhancer) people don't usually serve jail time (it's a 3rd degree misdemeanor). From what I've been told, his situation is *very* rare because most harassers stop after the first arrest and subsequent restraining order and yet he continues. He gets out soon meaning the restraining orders will be dropped (because he has served his time) but I am now filing for a permanent civil restraining order so I am protected once he is released.

He used to know where I lived but since he's been in jail, I've moved to the next county over. My address and school/work are all hidden from him so I am 90% confident he won't be able to find me. Before I moved, I chose not to change my number or block his because if he was going to text or call me, I wanted to have any evidence (text or voicemail) that may alert me to his plans or whereabouts. As a disclaimer: I have not texted, called, written, said etc. a single word to this person since my last text to him 2 years ago in which I told him I would call the cops if he kept texting/calling me.

Now that I've moved away, I'm less worried about him finding me. However, from his pattern so far, he is more than likely going to try to contact me despite the permanent civil protection order I am getting. He has even gone so far as to use a different number I didn't know to contact me. This has ruined his life and has seriously effected mine so I'm hoping that by changing my number, it will finally put this to rest for the both of us. 

The drawbacks to changing numbers are obviously the hassle, but also the fact that I'm not sure how hard he is willing to work to find me. He has stalked me in the past and I have no idea if he will continue after being released or if he will ever leave me alone. So should I not change my number in order to keep tabs on his interest in me? PLEASE HELP.",17Aug2018,1
391,"&gt;lost without any path to go at all in life

&gt;no motivation to finish my education, i fucking hate working with computers nowadays

&gt;i barely passed elementary school anyhow, so the academic life is not for me

&gt;started working out 2 years ago

&gt;don't wanna become a wagecuck sitting in an office cubicle working for his fat corporate overlord, i wanna do something meaningful to my country

&gt;working out is my passion, physical work and labour is also really enjoyable

&gt;figure that the army might be a good idea, go do the military service that we are usually exempted from (åland, finland)

&gt;doing something for my country in return all that it has given me sounds like a great deal right? not to mention the free food, cameraderine and learning new practical things
&gt;also wanna do it because everyone else has done it, my father, my grandpa, every male relative

&gt;turns out i have aspergers and i'm not allowed at all to do military service, even though i'm high functioning

&gt;so i figure, why not become a police? they get to work with people which is interesting, and it is very physically heavy

&gt;turns out that you are not allowed at all because of aspergers

&gt;fireman is the closest thing to this, but fireman as a fulltime job doesn't exist where i live

&gt;there's not even an education for becoming a fireman here, it's only in sweden and mainland finland you can get it (and my finnish is not very good)

392,"So today I saw this super cute girl when I was going to my school’s pep rally. I see cute/hot girls all the time but this one was different. I think she’s a grade below me and I don’t know if we even have the same lunch period. She was alone at a pep rally which makes me think she doesn’t have many friends yet. (She’s a freshman and I’m pretty sure she’s from Korea because literally everything she had had Korean writing on it.) I am a sophomore but it is my first year at a new school so I don’t have many friends either. I just want to become her friend for now but I have no clue how to do that as I will most likely only see her in the hallway in between classes.

398,"I [20F] don’t know if this is the right place for this but here goes. 

I’m staying with my boyfriend for a month until I go back to college. I keep my key to his apartment on my car keys, but I gave him the car keys and ubered back to the apartment after his break from work. So I was locked out, and I couldn’t get the keys from him because his job is really strict about visitors. 

I went to the corner store and got Bobby pins to pick the front door lock and I tried that for over an hour. Then a guy [40-50M] from the street walked up to me and asked me what I was doing. We got to chatting and he seemed nice and friendly - he offered to help me with the lock but said he didn’t have any lockpicking experience. Anyway I realized I could get into the apartment by pushing the AC in through the window, but I needed a ladder to do it. 

He happened to be a construction worker and offered to grab me a ladder from his house across the street. I accepted and he brought it over. While I was on the ladder working on the AC, he asked if he could slap away a mosquito from my leg. That’s when it got weird. He slapped harder than he needed too, and then he commented on how tight my shorts were. I got into the apartment and, not wanting to be rude, offered him a glass of water and some of the dessert I brought home from lunch. 

He said we should go over to his place to eat the dessert. I’m normally very careful about this sort of thing, but I felt pressured to accept the invitation because he helped me. So I went over. I gave him half of the dessert. He chose topics of conversation that were weird - like he started talking about massages. His “place” was a shed converted into a room in his adult childrens’ house’s backyard. I kept trying to get rid of him without saying anything rude throughout this whole encounter, but it didn’t take. He walked me back to my apartment and lingered on the doorstep for too long. 

I went inside and locked the door and he deadbolt, but now I’m kind of creeped out. I let slip a lot of information about my plans for the rest of the day, and what time my boyfriend gets off work, and how long I’m in the area. Now this guy knows how to get into my apartment (the AC). Am I just being silly by worrying that he had/has anything but good, helpful intentions?

404,"So one of my best friends is quite aggressive and defensive most of the time. She gets quite hotheaded quite quickly when something bothers her or doesn’t go her way. That’s not to say that she acts like a child or is childish, she doesn’t do that. She’s just quick to get mad at relatively small things.

Also in the same vein, she is very defensive when she is questioned. It seems to me she thinks that much of what is said around her is a personal attack that she needs to defend herself from. 

I really like being friends with her, and we are quite close, but damn it’s exhausting sometimes. Sometime she says things in anger that I know she doesn’t mean but it still hurts.

This is not to say all of this is to an extreme point, but I’m wondering how I should approach this with her.

 9 days ago I switched my phones settings to connect with GSM towers for no reason other than boredom.  This caused my phone to restart, and when finished it picked up on the GSM towers.  Of course this data I couldn't use, which I knew already. 

This became frivolous so I set my phone back too the original LTE (again for no reason).  This caused my phone to restart, and when it start up I suddenly had unpaid access to LTE data. 

Fearing detection, I do not abuse this data.  I use it for messages when I'm walking, and when I really need to look something up.  However, in 9 days I used 200 mb so maybe I need to work harder on using less of it.

This is not a contract or post paid service.  I was never required to give a credit check.  If I am detected, will I be legally obligated to pay for the date? Will it hurt my credit score?  Do I have any eligible legal arguments for a legal defense at this point?  How will they deterim how much I owe?  What can I do to reduce my chance of being detected?

My mother was a nurse for around 28 years, and just around 4 years ago she had a stroke due to medical negligence and became paralyzed in the whole left side of her body. I was 16, my sister was 26. At the time my sister was taking pre-medical classes and had to drop them in order to provide complete care for my mother.

I insisted I help take care of her for the first 2 years and it was a complete havoc. Constant issues with seizures, falling in the bathroom and much more due to her stroke. Come senior year of high school and when I graduated I put everything aside college wise, law enforcement wise to help take care of my mother because of how much work she is regarding her becoming disabled, it was hard for my sister and I just saw it. 

So I stayed and helped for another year. After that year was up, my mother and my sister told me to move out of state to go back where I was born to live with my long-time girlfriend so I can live my life like I've always should have and continue things I left behind.  It hurt me more than anything leaving my disabled mother and knowing I was going to be putting all those responsibility on my sister herself. 

So I did, about a year later into the move I get a phone call from my sister saying my mother is declining and she could use some help for a few months. So I move away from my girlfriend, again. What was originally planned for 6 months, turned into 9 and I came home 10 months later. During this stay I see how my mother is gradually getting worse and more and more work to take care of. Multiple doctors appointments weekly, co-pays for visits, medicine and much more. Tie work and other things in to that and you barely had time to sleep.

Fast forward to now living back with my girlfriend, I still haven't continued my studies and nor has my sister 4 years later. My sister is having extreme issues providing care for my mother as she is slowly declining in her physical and partially mental health state. One of the main issues my sister is having is financial stability. Some months her medications can range from $400-600 per month depending on health care insurance, so that leads to my sister calling me to ask for some financial support with my mothers needs. And of course, I help because that is my mother and I would do absolutely anything for her. But this is killing me as I have still YET to get into studies or into the Law Enforcement field. It's killing my future with my girlfriend as well as it's killing my sisters future. 

We are both extremely hesitant on putting my mother in a nursing home or even an assistant living facility, but it feels as it's truly coming to that point. I feel as if my mother would have extreme hate or anger towards me and my sister, and I don't want that. Because my mother would never of put one of us in one of those facilities. 

I don't know what to do, or what way to turn. Any comments, or even suggestions or similar life stories on what you did would be absolutely awesome, thank you.

TL;DR: 

Mother got disabled when I was young, older sister and I became dependents and took care of my mother for the next couple of years. Fast forward to now, my mother is slowly getting worse, medications are getting more expensive. Get bi-weekly calls from sister asking for financial help. We have both yet to get back to our studies. This slowly affecting me, my relationship and life in genertal and I don't know what to do.",17Aug2018,1
416,"So I'm about to go on an 8 hour train ride and I need a show to binge. I've already finished Black Mirror and I can say confidently it's my favorite show. I've also finished Ozark which I loved, and Trailer Park Boys which was hilarious. I also watched Big Mouth but I hated it so much. So those are what I'm into/not into. What shows do you like and would recommend? I prefer shows with longer episodes but if it doesn't have them that's ok too.",17Aug2018,2
417,Why is my cpu usage 100% after I put my laptop motherboard into a pc case? I tried task manager already and it says cpu usage is normal between 10 and 20 % but a different piece of software says it idles at 40%. I know this is true because if I try to play a 1080p video in vlc the video track lags. Badly. Also just about every part of my pc is lagging in some way or another. I googled and tried everything already nothing helps.,17Aug2018,1
418,"I'm in my thirties and my life is a mess, I want to have a career as well as have friends and find love.   


I'm long-term unemployed - this is not  choice - it seems as soon as I say this there's the assumption I'm choosing not to work or that I somehow don't realise how bad it is not to be working, I know and I am trying to change this situation but it's a result of life changes and disability as well as a lack of support to help me overcome those issues.   


Problem is whenever I talk about wanting to make friends and find love I'm told my only priority should be to find work - of course finding work will help me find fiends and make me more appealing to potential partners, but as a woman in my thirties I can't wait around to find a partner and social isolation is causing severe depression - I literally spend all day very day on my own and this is not healthy. People seem to think if I'm unemployed I don't deserve friendship or love.   


I have no idea what to do to try to help myself, every time I try anything I fail and any time I reach out for help I seem to be scolded for daring to suggest I need to address my social isolation as well a my employment situation. I don't know where to turn to help with any of these issues, when I have nothing in my life where do I even start? ",17Aug2018,4
419,"People you spent years of your life with. People you built a home with. For one reason or another, you couldn't be with them anymore - but does that love ever really go away?

To me, my ex will always be my best friend. Even though I don't necessarily want to date him ever again, I think about him all the time, and still consider him to be one of the most important people to ever come into my life.

Do people's significances ever fade?

420," So I found out today that my landlord is requiring all dogs over 25 lbs, of which both of mine apply, to have emotional support animal certificates in order to be kept. I've had these dogs for years, and the park has known about them. Obviously I would be very sad if I had to lose them. I don't know what qualifies some thing as an emotional support animal. I thought you needed to have a diagnosed mental disorder such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD. I have never been diagnosed with any of these I have felt depressed from time to time.

I posted a similar question over on the legal advice subreddit. I'm getting a lot of flak because people think I am trying to cheat the system.   I'm really not, I just love my dogs and couldn't stand to get rid of them. If that doesn't count as emotional that I don't know what does

 The question is how to go about getting a letter. I don't have health insurance, so going to a doctor just to get them to write a little piece of paper would be very expensive. I also looked online, and there are apparently companies that can write you a letter for cheap. The legitimacy of these companies or doctors is questionable, but if it gets me to keep my pets then I am on board with paying $100.

What can I do?",17Aug2018,0
421,"About 9 months ago I moved in with one of my really close friends (both late 20s). We've known each other for a couple years, traveled together for a few weeks before this and genuinely loved each others company. She had married young (19) and about 18 months ago they divorced. She has no kids but they had bought a house together years before and he decided to move out. I've lived on my own since college and have had dorm mates and after college roommates both friends and a relative stranger. She has never had a roommate. Since 26 (I'm 29), I've lived on my own without a roomie. She asked if i would move in as she though it would be a great idea as we got along so well. I was paying 1000 plus all utilizes for a top floor 1100 sqft cathederal ceiling apartment in one of the nicest suburbs right outside the city. No pets for me. Her house is in the city and about 1300 sqft with four pets (two dogs and two cats) Being single, I was always in the city and thought saving some money would be a great idea. I pay her 700 a month for everything.

Okay, now comes the tricky part. We personally get along great. However, throught out my 20s' we've lived different lifestyles. I've been single and loved my independence. After initially talking about this 6 months before my lease was up, she started dating a guy and within a few months he moved in with her. She still wanted me to move in surprisingly and since the ball was already rolling in that direction. I decided to do it. 

Sharing a 1200-1300 sq ft house with a couple,two dogs and two cats hasn't been the easiest adjustment but we get along so great and I was saving some money so I just put it in the back of my mind. Before I moved in we made the agreement that except for my bedroom (I have organized chaos in my bedroom of clothes ect) we'd keep the common areas clean of course. Which we do. 

I keep my bedroom door closed to 1) keep the animals out 2) so her live in boyfriend who is 15 yrs older doesn't see my undies or bras laying on my bed or around ect. 3) just for privacy as their bedroom is feet away. 

A month after I moved in, I came home and she had gone into my bedroom and completely cleaned and organized it. She left a note saying she went to put a few of my laundry items on my bed  (could've left them on the hallway stand we normally do or just left them in the basement) and she then decided to clean my entire room because it was ""a bit messy."" and ""although it might feel like an invasion of privacy, she just wants me to start the new year fresh."" I felt extremely violated. However, feeling she meant well and had never had a roommate, I let it go also thinking it wouldnt happen again. 

A few months later, I was out running errands and she asked if I'd like her to throw in my white bedding in the laundry as she was doing whites. It took me 20 mins to respond and I said ""No. I'll take care of it but thank you."" When I arrived home shortly after, she said she had already put them in the laundry as it took me 20 mins to text her back so she just went ahead and did it anyways. I was LIVID. My face said it all. As I went to say ""why would you just go.."" she cut me off and said ""I just thought you'd want to have fresh sheets for the week."" I said ""Ok, just don't do it again."" After that incident which I thought would be the last, I dropped it. 

Before this final incident, It should be noted I was asked two months ago to only park on the street 4 days a week bc her boyfriend has a truck and there's less spaces for him on that side of the street. I agreed thinking then on the other three days he'd be fair and let me park in the driveway. Nope. I park in the street almost 100 percent of the time unless they are away. (its a large two car driveway)

The pets. Since I live there, it seemed to just happen that I care for all 4 animals while the two go away on vacation or trips. I agreed to it thinking I'm helping out a close friend and saving her money.  The backyard is fenced in but even if I'm staying in town for the weekend, with dogs, I have to care for them at least twice daily (morning/night) which includes getting up at 7 am on weekends to feed and let them out otherwise one will wander into the basement and go.(which then I have to clean up and its happened before). This has now steadily increased to a list of daily chores to do while they are gone (water the gardens in back and front, scooping the cats litter plus the dogs). One of my friends got a lake house days before the 4th weekend an hour away. I told my friend this as she was going out of town that same weekend. I said I planned on spending the night as its far and its a holiday weekend. She then did hire someone to come over that night to let them out for $30. She proceeded to ask me if I was planning on coming back the next morning by 7 am or 8 am for the dogs. I was shocked as she knows I never get up early on weekends and this is a holiday at a lake house over an hour away. Even though she has told me the dogs alone has cost her a small fortune to board when she went out of town and even sites like Rover charge $30 a visit for two dogs times twice daily plus extra for the two cats as well. She has never once offered to take ANY money off the rent the in the month in which I do this for her.  Since January, I've had to do this about 5 or 6 times. The entire reason I didn't want pets, especially dogs is because I wanted to come and go as I please. If I was getting a bit cheaper rent that month or being paid something, It would be different but I'm not. 

I'm also paying half for internet and utilities even though there's 3 of us. Whatever arrangement they have is between them but me paying half of those things seems a bit unfair. 

I have never had anyone over because its small common areas and I feel like I live with a married couple rather than a good friend. Her boyfriend being 15 years older and very opinionated, I dont feel like hes a peer in my age group, late 20's-early 30s', I feel I'd be judged by him or it wouldn't feel right inviting either a guy over or a few friends over. It would feel really awkward. 

The final straw came last week. I had just started a new job that I was very excited about but much higher stress. I come home after a very long day, open my bedroom door and she did it again. My room was completely reorganized and cleaned up to the point where I didn't know where this important note I wrote was left. She and boyfriend weren't home at the time. I was so mad I screamed. 

I am not saying I am the worlds perfect person/roommate but for the most part, I keep the common areas clean, never have people over, anytime she tells me something ""put these dishes on the top of the dishwasher, these on bottom ect"" I do it. 

Is there any justification for going into your friends/roommates room who pays you 700 a month to live there? I mean unless there's a fire or it smells like a dead body? I mean, am I overreacting? Ive never encountered this in my life. If she thought I had lets say a drinking glass in my room she needed or thought maybe a shirt of hers got mixed up in the laundry and I had it, why wouldn't she just text me or just ask me to check?! Is there any reason to do this!?",17Aug2018,1
422,"I have a pretty tight-knit group of friends, we all work together, one of them is living at my house rent free and we spend a lot of time together playing Pokemon go, Going to Magic the gathering events, playing DnD and just spending time together. I've had problems with them in the past where I was feeling very used because we would only every spend time at my house, eat my food (That I pay for out of pocket), and one of them would seemingly only spend time here to have sex with his girlfriend in my spare room. I talked to the sex-havers and their response was to stop coming over. I love them all dearly but recently I took a 5-day trip out of state and I came back to find my main table a mess, a painting in my room taken down and faced backwards leaned up against a wall, my mouse mat completely missing (I found out later that they had borrowed it without asking), and a bunch of my Magic cards and accessories strewn about the floor of my room.

TLDR: I feel that some very close friends are encroaching on my personal space and using me (even if its unintentional)

I really just need advice on how to bring up to them that they're being bad guests without coming off like a dick and scaring them off because at the end of they day I do love them a ton.",17Aug2018,1
