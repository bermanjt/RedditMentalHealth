7,"ill try to sum it up as best i can.  i am confused about all of this.

i was in a 10 year relationship, fiance was a cheater, we split

my best friend which was our mutual best friend, except the fiance has always been hot/cold with went through a similar shit show

one night after a few drinks, were going to grab food and she turns down a different road.  pulls over, turns off lights to the car, puts it in park.  im like sup?

she says have you ever thought about us?  i said no..

she says she feels like kissing me to see if there is something there

i tell her she needs to handle her situation at home first because they werent quite 100&amp;#37; split up at the time... even though i wanted to kiss

so they wind up splitting and it began to feel like a miss opportunity to be honest

few months later go by and we wind up making out one night

we hang out more, kissing and more things happen

a lot of people comment how they have always seen us together... except im totally not the normal person she would be with because she typically dates buff guys with flat bill hats who are assholes and im not that

she starts coming over more, staying the night and such, were spending time kind of seeing where its going

she begins to tell me over the next month or so she feels something is missing but doesnt know what

im kind of confused because im like you wanted this?  

well whats missing?  she says dunno

just says she knows when she is 100&amp;#37; in love and somethings missing

shortening the story, this goes on for the past five months now but gets worse.  

straight tells me she just wants to be friends, we will be out with mutual friends and she is drawn to me begins kissing and such

couple of days go by, she pulls away, same cycle every week

and here we are now.  the latest is she wants to put space between us and our friendship.  im of course in love and feeling like the hot and cold has fucked with my head.  i don't understand though why she will say she doesn't feel a certain way for me yet her actions she is the one that persues?  we have always talked daily by the way

so she tells me she wants space friday and she has to do this.  i kinda get pissy but im like you know, you do whatever you wanna do ive always been a good friend to you if you can ditch me like that so be it.  i don't talk to her the rest of the day and around 2:20am when she is leaving a bar, she calls me on the phone, i of course answer.  anyway, she tells me once again on the phone she has to do this.... like why call me on the phone then and tell me the same thing you told me through text messages?  it hasn't even been 24 hours.

at the same time, she has also said her feelings are completely gone... which is what she told me last weekend but she also wound up kissing me and staying with me.  and kissed me in the morning.  i don't think she is purposely playing mind games, she isn't a hurtful person.  i can honestly tell she is frustrated with herself why she is doing this.

i am not asking anyone to comment and say ""move on"" blahblah

i am asking why is this happening in her head?  i have never been hot and cold with someone i care about like that as a friend or more.  i don't get it.  i also don't know how someone cannot identify what is missing?",16Jul2018,0
8,"This is the prompt, I just need a lead or a jist of what this even has to be about 

What can be done to satisfy the people (and there are many) who dislike Multiculturalism because they believe that the only way to have a unified country, or a country at all, is to encourage a single Canadian culture and identity?

Please remember to discuss the Canadian situation, with references to US comparisons where appropriate.  We are not really discussing the USA.

Points to ponder - Melting Pot vs Multiculturalism:

Bilingualism was meant to satisfy the French Canadians, who have been in Canada longer than any other people of European descent.
Multiculturalism was meant to satisfy all the peoples who felt snubbed by bilingualism.

Does the US melting pot theory really work?  Ask any Italian-American, African-American, or anyone else born here who puts anything other than American (or in Canada, Canadian) on their census form.

If you think it works, would it work in Canada? (remember that the French have held on to their culture through 250 years of living in a sea of English speakers).",16Jul2018,1
9,"So my roommate, “Jane,” is a barely 18 year old stoner who lives in the extra room in my house. We work together, and I’m actually technically her boss. I know she also deals weed on the side. I don’t have any problems with weed, I do live in a state where it’s illegal. Whatever. 

I found these needles probably a month or so ago, clean, never used, and I was really hoping it was just one of her idiot friend’s needles. And honestly, I forgot about them. But yesterday I saw some more needles, except these were clearly used, bent at the end? I also found one of the tubes used for snorting. 

So today I confronted her about it!! I said “what is that shit?” Most of the time I sound sarcastic and not very serious, but she got shy really quick after I asked her. Which is good cause she at least knows she should be ashamed about it. 

She did tell me it was for heroin and coke! And I put her at using for probably about a month when I found the first needles. She told me she doesn’t do it “that much” but I don’t really know what that means or if she was just saying that to lessen it. I just, I don’t know what to do. I know how bad heroin is and how anyone whose ever used it is basically fucked for the rest of their lives whether they get off it or not. I need some help, some advice, on what’s the best way to help her get off. 

I told her she shouldn’t hang out with her friends that do it too, but I don’t know if she’s going to listen. And I know she has a terrible relationship with her mom so I don’t want to contact her either.

12,"First off, this is a throw away account for obvious reasons. This is also my friend’s story that I have permission to share. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My friend, let’s call him B, had an affair with a woman, we’ll call her R, while he was in a relationship with his pregnant (now ex) girlfriend, who we can refer to as M.  Well R got pregnant by B and kept the baby. M decided that, despite her hurt and betrayal, she would make an attempt to salvage her relationship with B. A few months after the baby with R was born, M left B. B tried even still to make things with M work out, to no avail. 

Well since it’s been some time, R brought up the idea of trying to have a relationship with B, in a “get together for the kid” type of thing since they’d never actually tried a relationship. *here’s where the advice is needed* B is convinced that it wouldn’t be fair to M and their child to make any relationship work with R. He feels that neither child should have both parents together because he doesn’t want either child to feel less important to him. I’m trying to help him see that it doesn’t have to be that way but I’m failing..any advice?

17,"This is my first post so forgive me if I’m doing this wrong. It’s kind of long but I think all of these details are important. 

My whole life I’ve wanted to move far away, by myself, just to see if I could do it. It’s been on my bucket list since I was 10. No plans, no job, no friends or people to rely on, just a big adventure and being resourceful ... 

I just graduated college in May and I knew this was the best time to do it. My boyfriend and I had just broke up, everyone was moving far away, back in with their parents, etc. I lived in a town bordering Canada and now live fairly close to the border of Mexico. Like, I couldn’t get further away without leaving the country. 

The first day I got here, I signed a lease with some people needing a new roommate. It has been best case scenario. I feel like I have three built in best friends. I ended up landing an incredible job (my absolute dream job) about two weeks after moving here. I love it, I love my coworkers, and the pay is incredible for someone right out of college (especially since I graduated early and am only recently 21). 

Seriously, things could not be going better. I’d mentally prepared myself for setbacks and having no friends or money for the first few months, but the opposite has happened and it’s only been great— all of this has happened in about a months time. 

Despite all this, I’m beginning to regret it. I’ve never been homesick before, but suddenly I am. I have a little sister [9], and a brother [23] who I’ve taken care of basically my whole life as he’s struggled with addiction since an early age. I feel like I’ve abandoned them (both of my parents are great and with them so I know this isn’t logical) and like my sister is going to grow up without a relationship with me. They’ve all been nothing but supportive and happy for me but I can’t help missing everyone terribly. My ex recently reached out and he wants to get back together and he’s willing to move across the country for me (not sure how I feel about that as it’s a big step and I don’t want him to make that big of a choice FOR me. We broke up so we could make choices independently of each other, which we’ve now done. There was no big issues and we’ve always respected one another.) Thinking about dating him again and having someone to kind of “care for me” makes me even more homesick. 

I guess what I’m asking for here is advice. Do you think I’m jus getting homesick because things are settling down and I shouldn’t back out now? Or do you think I’ve made a horrible mistake by moving all the way out here? (Bonus points if you have an opinion on what to do about my ex) I really don’t know if this is normal and I’m just having a freak out as it sets in that /I really live here/. 

TL;DR: I moved across the country and am starting to get homesick. I’m not sure if I made a huge mistake or the best decision of my life. ",16Jul2018,1

19,"If I'm being honest, my life is the destination of trashy. I'm certifiable white trash. Here's some examples of my trash:

I was born to two drug addicts and raised poor as fuck. I ended up homeless when I was 15 because of this and didn't actually have stable housing until I was 18.  

I met a ""really great guy"" shortly after turning 19. He got me pregnant three months into dating. He convinced me getting married was the best option for my child. I should have been on birth control but he was wearing a condom and I thought that was enough. Later on I learned he would take the condom off right before finishing because he thought I'd make a great mother. He started beating the fuck out of me once we married and I ended up leaving him within a year. I love my daughter more than anything but let's be honest, being a young single mom definitely adds to my level of ""trashiness"".

I'm trying really, really hard to get my life together. I have a decent job and I'm set to start a year long LVN program in January. From there I plan on advancing my education and moving up in the world of nursing. 

Truthfully though? I'm fucking terrified. I'm terrified of becoming homeless again. I'm terrified of my daughter growing up poor and making the same mistakes I did. Even with everything going right at the moment, I'm so afraid of life throwing something else my way and causing me to lose my progress. I'm scared, I really am. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is my life a lost cause? Is there any hope at all? I can't imagine ever being a homeowner. I can't imagine having a decent chunk of money in savings. All these things seem unobtainable to me but I am trying. ",16Jul2018,2

I never had a father figure growing up and its always left a space in my heart.  Last night I confessed to my male friend (29, he is in a relationship) that he helped fill that space in my heart.  I got to talking about my past because he doesn't know much about it and when I was about to start crying he hugged me into his chest for me to cry.  He rubbed my back and the back of my head.  It was really nice to just sob and be selfish in a sense with my emotions, to just be sad and not try to make sure I didn't make him sad.  I felt so loved and relieved a hole in my life was filled.  Afterwards we went home and all was well, I didn't feel weird, he didn't feel weird, I told my fiance and he was understanding and felt fine with it.

I have literally no reason to feel bad, because nothing happened, I have no feelings for him, he has none for me, and my fiance was not upset.  I still feel anxious though, and it's because I feel like other people wouls judge and call me weird.

About 6 months later I had a panic attack, I wouldn’t say it was just because of my hair but it was definitely a big part of the reason, the hair loss really had a negative effect. Anyway after the panic attack I started having them every day and it turned into panic disorder and health anxiety, I was practically in a state of panic for a year after that. I did counselling during that year (and still do now) and I refused to take anti-depressants for a while due to the health anxiety making me feel like they would kill me. During this time I had to leave work, I had to move back in with my parents and I got in so much debt as I still had financial commitments because I simply couldn’t work. I’ve now been on antidepressants for 4-5 years and my anxiety is not as severe as it was but it’s still there and my depression has been so bad that I’ve attempted suicide twice within the last year. I know I shouldn’t put my happiness down to material things but I’m only considering a fundraiser because I just think it will help me gain confidence if I get a transplant.

25,"To start off, I never really thought I was ugly. That’s because when I was younger I wasn’t really ugly. I was actually a good looking kid. But now I’m 16, things changed. It wasn’t until I was 14 that something weird started happening. People started calling me ugly. Most notably, my own friends. I started to get really conscience about how I really looked like. Now these “friends” really started to call me out on my looks, and one time it got me really mad that I stood up for myself and said, “At least I’m not as ugly as you.” At first I thought I just did some bad ass comeback right there, but I only made it worse for me. Everyone there started to pick apart my physical features and described how ugly I was. That was when I really started to consider I was ugly. So I found new friends that I enjoyed being around. More “pure” friends is the bests way to describe it. But once again eventually over time one of them, not as a joke, called me ugly. Soon after another one started to say that almost every time he saw me in the hallway. Once he just looked at me with a disgusted look and told me how I was really ugly. At this point, I was called ugly so much that it started to make me feel numb to that. Eventually, a lot of people I knew started saying that I was ugly. Even my own uncle greeted me by saying, “What’s up you ugly fucker?” (He said fucker just because that’s the type of language he uses. It’s how he normally greets others. I know). 

But schools been out for over a month. I’ve been busy at my job. I’ve met a lot of great people here, and it’s been a while since I’ve had any toxicity in my life. So I’ve built a pretty strong self esteem again. I started to tell myself that I’m not as ugly as I thought I was. I started taking care of myself better, I started working out, I was actually starting to become a talkative person again. Until today. 

One of my co workers, who I’ve become good friends with, was wearing glasses today. He normally doesn’t, and so I questioned what’s with the glasses. His reply was he doesn’t need to wear glasses, but then he said it. “But the benefit of not wearing glasses is you don’t see how ugly you really are.” That fucked me up real good. He just put his hand on my shoulder and said sorry, and then he started rambling about something else that I didn’t get to hear because I was too busy being stuck frozen. Now I can’t stop thinking about how ugly I actually am. That I’ve been lying to myself, which only made all of this so much worse. So how do I deal with being ugly? ",16Jul2018,2

My therapist says I should quit because of “self care”. But also, isn’t it better to search for jobs while having a job? Doesn’t it look better? I want to quit so badly. I want an administrative position where I know my hours are going to be the same every week and I have weekends off and I can spend time with people that have the same schedule as me.

34,"So there are the final two places me and my decided roommate have been looking at. They are spacious enough for the two of, close to the school, and affordable. The issue: I would really like to do this on my own without the help of anyone. My mother's guidance is always appreciated and accepted and taken into account, but she wants to come with to look at the places and read over the lease for me, even worse is that the place is only 30 mins from home and she says she will visit every weekend. I feel as if this is stepping over an unspoken boundary. It doesn't feel like I will really be allowed to be free, which is part of the point of moving out. If she wants to visit fine, but between work and school I will almost never be home which I think would just be a waste of her time, I wouldn't want her busting into what I consider is to be my house and just sitting and rearranging my things as she pleases. Anyway my question is I want to know if it's such a bad idea to simply just go in, take a good thorough look at the places, and sign the lease of which one we like most. We've been searching and looking for months. We've visited places and put most places on the back burner because we weren't impressed by either the rooms, the space for the price, or the how the people treated us. My mom thinks the landlords will give us respect just because she's there, and even if that were true I feel as if she is stripping me of a chance to be a real adult and that is in a way unfair. I understand she wants to help and protect me, but quite frankly I want to do this on my own. 

TL;DR: I want to move out but my mother is basically trying to shadow me. I feel fairly confident in all of my life choices so far, so how can I tell her I want to do this on my own because it feels like she's robbing me of being an adult and really starting to live my life?",16Jul2018,1

37,"After going through a lot of crisis moments and emotional/psychological and a bit of physical damage, I've matured to a state where I am currently, fine. School will end this year. I'm already 18. Time to be an adult now?

Truth is, I'm really sick in the head. The state I'm now is good because I'm not struggling much at all, and things are just happening. But I'm still absolutely faithless about everything. Life sucks, I suck, I'll just always be miserable and live a mediocre life and then I'll die and it'll all be over, yay. I'm still alone out here and will always be, etc etc. 

Honestly the problem is not this(?), it's that I've gone through all of this, typing so many of these posts, thinking and worrying about things so much, that I'm tired. I never really get anywhere when I try to 'talk' about my 'problems', ever. It's just some sick self-indulgency. It helped me during my awful psychotic moments and suicidal moments, but mostly just as a distraction. The only thing that actually led me through my awful moments was time. I could keep just going with the flow, in this reasonably nice, neutral/balanced mindset, and I can do things such as watch and play and read all the stuff I still wanna do ( hopefully a finite list so that I won't die beforehand, haha! ) and all. I did some things. Went out with friends for the first time this year. Told my first crush I liked him ( he's ok with it, we're still friends ). The 3ds emulator is working so I can play the games I've always wanted to play. I'm almost finishing the first 'book' of the little story I'm doing.

But it's only a matter of time until time passes long enough for another big thing to come before me and stress me out. I can't do anything about it. So, huh. Idk. I'm also completely helpless. Why am I even typing this? You see, it's hard to even put it all into words. I usually say ''typing this is ruining my mood'' and I'll say it like this to give it some variety because boy I've said it too many times already. 

My interests ( all those little things I said ) are the only thing that truly matters. For all else, I really don't wanna deal with it. Jobs, living in society/adaptating to the adult world, family, relationships ( sounds fun, but all I really wanna do is fool around and have fun as a dumb teenager (not sure if I'm going to succeed in that ...technically I'm not a teenager anymore, rip ) everything beyond that is out of my league, and I'm not very interested in it beyond imagining ideal, fantasized scenarios. I even made some slight effort to attempt to 'care' about y'know, the whole ''oh shit guys school is almost over what are your career choices and shit let's socialize as fellow soon-to-be-adults and talk about our doubts and expectations'', but I got a little tired of it. I really don't know. I just don't know. None of this stuff ever goes anywhere because I'm just so abstract about it. It's so tiring...it's exhausting. I'll stop now. I know that the more effort I put, usually the more satisfactory response I get...I long for the day something will just 'click', and some miracle solution will happen, and I'll find some hidden 'answer' or some huge ambition or dream and my life will be like that of those people who do inspirational videos and TED talks, lol. It's easy for them right? Struggle -&gt; Something magical happens, Fate/God decides to be kind for you for once -&gt; You're now fixed and filled with some kind of infinite willpower and determination or some shit, you're practically a mindset demigod, life is good somehow, yay, let's make money doing speeches. 

Well I don't wanna do speeches. I'm just hoping something magical happens and gives me a solution. I can do anything as long as I'm given the steps to do it. Probably too much to ask. But I'm just being honest. 'Talking to people' never really helps, and it never will. I'll never take a counselor, nor a therapist, nor whatever ( partially because then I'd have to commit to the impossible, exhausting task of talking to my family about my deep struggles or some shit, lol, that thought disgusts me ).

I also wish more than like, 1 or 2 people said something. It's like no one ever reads what I type. I type so much. If I posted one single dumb suicidal sentence on suicidewatch then like 10 people would come and say the same 'oh we're here to talk uwu' like empathetic robots. Lol. Seems like it's easier to just parrot the same shit to people undergoing a crisis, and feel good about yourself, than to actually put some effort and have an honest, unbiased intent to try to understand someone, and maybe say something to them that was made with some actual thought or feelings of your own put behind it.

38,"I (20 F) got off work today around 4 and as I’m leaving a man (probably around 25) sitting at the bus stop asked if the bus ran on Sunday’s to which i responded no. As i was walking back to my car the man called out to me. I initially tried to ignore him and continue walking but i eventually felt bad for him. 

He asked for a ride to the Transit Station. “I’m sorry it’s nothing against you but it’s a little dangerous” and gave him an awkward chuckle. He removed his glasses, formally introduced himself, and begged me for the ride, promising to pay me. He seemed clean, nice, and being that it was around 100 degrees outside and the Transit station is across town I gave in.

As i drive he asks me questions about myself; how old i am, where i work, what i study. He eventually asks if i have a boyfriend and upon discovering that i don’t he tells me he’s surprised because of how “cute and sexy” I am. At this point i start to regret agreeing to help him but figure I’m on a busy street in broad daylight, he can’t really do anything. He then says for me to give him my phone number, i give him my actual number because i figured i shouldn’t risk upsetting or making the ride any more uncomfortable for myself (terrible thought i know) should he do anything to verify the number is correct. 

I ensured to stay on only main, busy roads and as we pass our first liquor store he ask if we can stop there to which i respond i cannot because i need to get home. Hes okay with this and then asks if i can break a $10 so he can give me $5 for the ride but i insist that there’s no need to pay me, it wasn’t far from where i was going at all. Again, he mentions how sexy i am and that we should hang out sometime but i just say “maybe another time” and laugh.” He then asks how much money i do have and i tell him only about a dollar or two. As we approach another liquor store about 3 blocks from the Transit station he says O can just stop there. I verify this is fine instead of the Transit station and after getting out then taps on the window. I roll it down and he requests the cash i have to buy a drink, i reach into my wallet and give him the $2 i had and tell him to stay safe before driving off. 

Not only did i put myself in a dangerous situation, but this guy has my number! I don’t think he’s any threat, he may just bug me for more money/a ride but i can just block his number. 

If he does text me do i bother answering or should i not respond and hope he doesn’t continue? Immediately block his number? What’s my best option in this situation?",16Jul2018,3
39,"A little background. My sister and I are lifeguards at the local pool. All lifeguards have to teach swim lessons, as they are very popular and the main source of income. My grandfather also passed away mid January.

In late April, My sister and I were asked what weeks we could work swim lessons. I wasn’t aware of when I was going on vacation so I just said I can work the days I would be on vacation and the days I would be out of town for my grandfathers funeral.

Evidently, I was notified the date of the funeral, July 5th, so I let my boss know that I could not work the 4th-the 7th, as I would be staying down there to keep my grandmother company. My sister, failed to notify the boss within time, so she had to hassle to find a sub for her lessons and there was a bit of commotion. She got written up. 

All is going smooth, until I am notified the date of our vacation, July 28th-August 4th, a whole week. I notified my boss I really could not work those days after I was aware of the date, however things are a bit tricky. 

See, she already had my sister and I down for swim lessons that week. For both of us to cancel, it would have to involve our lesson coordinator (who is on deck during lessons) getting in the pool and teaching, while our boss would be on deck. The first issue with that, our bosses don’t get paid, they are all volunteers. Second issue, it’s a real hassle and it shows that my sister and I are unreliable.

I need advice. On one hand, my sister and I might lose our jobs because we should asked when we were going on vacation a lot earlier, and let our boss know a lot earlier. On the other hand, my grandmother would really like the support and it may be one of the last times I see her. 

What do I do? I don’t want to pull the pity card, especially since I already had a funeral to attend earlier this month. I want to see my grandmother and she wants to see me, but I want to keep my job. I’ve never been written up but my history of things coming up at the last second before lessons might just get me fired. My sister, who has been written up for missing a shift on a busy day, would probably lose her job.

40,"I feel like I don’t have any hobbies. I do have interest. But my interests are things that I don’t entertain me for hours unless I want to be wasteful and or consume too much. For example, I love makeup and all of that. I enjoy applying my makeup in the morning and when I go out at time. Purchasing makeup and playing with new makeup makes me happy. However, it’s not something I should indulge too frequently. It’s expensive and i just don’t need more makeup. A lot of hobbies are like this. Just stuff I need to do on a daily basis, which is a blessing and a curse. Ie: cooking, working out etc.

41,"I’m a 23 year old guy who I thought was healthy, but for the past year I’ve had progressively worse fatigue such that now it’s unbearable. I’ve made no bad lifestyle decisions, I’m not an alcoholic, i’m not morbidly obese or a pack-a-day smoker. I have no idea why I’m miserably exhausted all the time. I’ve tried exercise routines, vitamins, cutting out coffee/cigarette(I have one daily)/etc, drinking more water, perfecting my sleep schedule... I’ve been to two doctors and four referred specialists... I’ve questioned whether it’s all in my mind and delved into self-help books and everything else... NOTHING. Nothing has helped or even given me a glimpse of what could help. I sometimes take notes of my days to see if there is ANYTHING that is causing my pants-on-head ridiculous fatigue, and as an example here’s today’s: 

&gt;7.15 9:30am, Feeling a bit tired, mildly fatigued, after a big breakfast of broccoli, three eggs with Parmesan and butter, two bacon strips, two tsp fish oil. Feeling continues after 10 minute meditation (not so good). Haven’t had coffee yet.

&gt;7.15 Run at 10:15am. Ran for 5 minutes. Feeling fatigued and burdened. Definitely no energy. Very short run. Did run last night too, though.

&gt;7.15 12:30 Starting to feel more tired; Maybe exercised too close to breakfast and should have waited an hour —Maybe zinc vitamin? Need to lay in bed 12:35 to 1

&gt;7.15 3:30 So incredibly fatigued still, back to lying down again.

&gt;7.15 9pm Tired still up until now, couldn’t do anything. Some neck pain 1pm until now btw. Whole day was nothing, just sitting on computer

I try to note whenever my energy fluctuates and I’ve found no patterns. Today was a particularly bad day but it seems every day I have seriously shitty fatigue now. And here are some health issues i’ve looked into —

* full blood count and vitamin check — no vitamin deficiency except for D (found 6 months ago and corrected 4 months ago)

* full STD screening, nothing

* tested for celiac, nothing

* no autonuclear antibodies

* no elevated TSH level

* normal lung function

I honestly wish there was something terribly wrong with me just so that I’d *know* what the god damn source is. It’s the worst thing ever. I don’t even know what to try now. Do I just resign myself to a life of incapacitating fatigue for the rest of my life?

The only other test I have coming up is a cardiologist, which is pretty much a Hail Mary possibility because heart problems run in my family. But being 23, that’s really quite unlikely, and I feel like I’ll be just be stuck with this shit forever. ",16Jul2018,23
42,"My online friend, a muslim girl of 19 might be homeless soon due to her family. I cannot immediately help because I live in Canada.

I've spoken with her for two years and have received picture verifying things she's said. Her family is incredibly abusive, she has received beatings and verbal abuse all her life. She has a lot of family living in a small house because of her many siblings and in laws, she is forced to sleep in the living room on a couch. She can only speak to me through a phone on a fake facebook account. Her family is so horrendous they nearly married her off but thankfully it fell through.

I've encouraged her to leave sooner but she's terrified as she's basically lived in a bubble her whole life. She also has some strange mental illness, getting random seizures and fainting spells and some truly terrifying hallucinations. Due to the constant abuse, bubble life, and general frail state of her life, I'm afraid she's not a very mentally strong person as anyone could expect in this situation.

She has a secret boyfriend from high school in India. They basically have a plan to work and save up for him to get a visa and come in 6 years and they could live together. She has a teaching assistant job starting in September because she has a college education. However, her family might be taking away her phone soon, she has no other friends besides me and the boyfriend. She might be forced to leave because I don't think she can handle being alone with that awful freaking family.

I would post puzzles that i came up with and would encourage others to solve them for a reward. This person didn’t manage to solve a single puzzle but yet struck up constant conversation. 

I feel like it should be less. It’s not like i don’t enjoy it i am just shocked by how much it is. I usually don’t talk to people through chat ( i don’t talk to anyone to be honest) so this feels a bit strange. I am not sure if i should continue chatting this much. I am afraid if i tell the person to talk less it would scare them off. That is  not something i want. 

If i don’t respond for an hour i don’t get spam with question marks or any other pushy behavior to get me to talk. Its just that if i reply the person would be engaged the whole time replying instantly. Like we would be talking face to face having constant focus.

The age of this person is so young i am not sure what that means.

Subjects are league of legends, this persons culture, my culture, life stories (heavy stories), music videos, dumb memes and random subjects in between (not serious ones). I would try to help this person understand how to solve my puzzles but that doesn’t work out well. This person lives in a country which you are not free to talk whereas i live in the most free country of the world. 

What should i do. Continue talking or is there a way to make me feel less uncomfortable. The age gap makes it feel like strange. I’m a solid 4/10 and this person is 8/10 or higher. It’s stupid but i would like to see some improvement in feeling better.",16Jul2018,3

Every time I hear my birth name I cringe. I feel like I’m deceiving everyone close to me, which I am...and that scares me. 

I’m now 18, trying to figure out what to do and how to bring this about. I know my ndad could possibly kill me for changing my name. Mom knows/acts oblivious to my ndad, never acts on anything. I know a lot of people will be confused, disturbed, or judge me highly. It’s a scary thought. 

Only a small few know I have 2 names, and plan to change my name. Those people don’t even mean too much to me..I just needed to get it out. Once I told someone I thought I trusted and we had a fight and he told some people, which furthers me to believe people’s reactions will be bad.

Some of the people that knew about my name situation are no longer in my life. Nothing to do with the name though.

Once I tried to ask my mom if she’d hate me if I’d change my name and she said she wouldn’t hate me, she just finds it weird. It makes me kinda sad, but it’s a reasonable reaction to have. At least she wouldn’t hate me. I guess my dad is really the only thing scaring me/holding me back. My dad would probably publicly shame me as well. It’s scary.

He's been adamant about me becoming a doctor. As a junior in college I've decided that being a doctor isn't the best path for me. I don't want to deal with med school and residency (the idea 60-80 hours a week scares me). I don't hate the idea but it doesn't click with me either. So I've been exploring alternatives and am currently interested in physical therapy. I like what I've found so far about the career and am looking to volunteer to see if i truly like it.

Then I told my Dad. He obviously was against it. His main reasons are that I won't get the same ""respect"" I would get out of being a doctor (which I don't give a fuck about) and the pay would be higher (but at what cost, with loans and the grind, and it's not like physical therapists don't make much money). I basically told him I don't care about impressing people when I walk into a room and if I'm unsatisfied with the pay I could always just become a Physician's Assistant with the experience I would get from being a PT. 

He tells me the only reason that I don't want to become a doctor is because I'm afraid of hard work and that I'm just going to be a failure asking my brother for money when he becomes a doctor.

54,"This is going to be a little long, but please read. I am suffering.

To give you guys a little background,

I'm a 20 year old male. I suffer with social anxiety disorder and I pretty much had it my whole life. However this incident has made my anxiety worse, and I've never really recovered since.

When I was young, I used to always be a teacher's pet. Teachers used to love me, and I was always their favorite student. I used to always get special acknowledgment from teachers because of this.

In 8th grade (2010-2011 school year) I had a history teacher. At the beginning of the school year he would acknowledge me and give me attention. However, one day after lunch I was walking to his classroom to get to his class. I was down the hall and he was at the door. I guess I was walking a little slow and he yelled, ""Devin hurry up!"". (Looking back on it he didn't even say it in an angry way and I'm mad at myself for letting that get to me.)

Ever since that incident I felt like he was mad at me and he didn't like me. Because of this I was always desperate for his approval again. However, I never got it! He never acknowledged me or called on me in class ever! He would acknowledge all of his students except for me. I would stare him down in the hallway or in his classroom hoping he would say something to me, but he never did. I didn't like how every one else got attention from him except for me. I even raised my hand once in his class to answer a question, and he looked at me and didn't call on me! All I wanted was his approval.

I have never been treated like this by a teacher before, so it was hard for me to take. I was so used to being a teacher's favorite student. He pretty much ignored me the entire school year.

Because of this incident, I'm now desperate for approval from everyone! When I go shopping I get upset when an employee chooses to acknowledge the person I'm with and not me. When people choose to acknowledge someone else over me I get jealous! I struggle making eye contact with people! I'm very sensitive to how people look at me and what people think about me! It's hard for me to relax in public!

It's like I want approval from everyone! If I don't get it I get upset and feel like there's something wrong with me. Before the incident with my History teacher, I never had these issues! I'm so upset because I feel like if it wasn't for that situation, my anxiety wouldn't be so bad now and I wouldn't have all these issues. 

Ever since this incident, my anxiety has been horrible! My anxiety was never this bad prior to this incident. I just feel like I will never be the same person I was before 8th grade. I still had anxiety, but I was able to enjoy life more and interacting with people didn't make me so anxious. Now my anxiety is debilitating. Every time I go outside I instantly get nervous. When people look at me or when cars drive by me I get uncomfortable. I just feel like I will never get better and I'm going to spend the rest of my life being a people pleaser with crippling anxiety.

I'm mad at myself that I let a petty incident like this ruin my life! I'm sorry for this rant. I just feel like I will never be able to enjoy life to the fullest again.

Any advice for me would be appreciated.",16Jul2018,2

Unfortunately, I am a university student working a part time job where I am essentially living check to check.

59,"I try to be a humble person. Through and through, I am introverted and look forward to spending my evenings at home and alone. But I also enjoy talking to people. A lot. I'll make conversation with my regulars while barista-ing, and I get a thrill out of seeing their face light up when I ask, ""How's your daughter's semester going?"" or ""How'd that interview go?"". I'll turn to a classmate on the first day of class that I've never met before and introduce myself. When going out to lunch with friends, I make sure to ask plenty of questions about them and their life. 

I get contentment and satisfaction out of conversations and seeing the joy in others' faces when they see that I'm interested in engaging in deep conversations with them. I think it's because I like feeling the same way, like I'm important and I matter to the person I'm talking to.

So I know a lot of students at my university. Only a handful of which I'd consider close friends that I hang out with often, but still I'm generally friends with a lot of people. I know that there'll be at least 5 people I know conversationally-well in any single class.

My issue comes in when some of these friends (I'm in a male-dominated field, so most of my classmates are guys) push my personal limits on friendship a bit too far. I try my hardest to make my denials to date offerings and going outs that I'm just not interested in casual, but some have been so persistent and I'm at a loss. 

I've said, ""No, I really don't want to"" or ""No thanks, I'm good."" as my main phrases in hopes that that'd leave a simple friendship as an option still, since I'm likely to continue having most of them in my classes for the next two years. But things can get uncomfortable reallyyy quick and I'm left with just leaving them on read which just doesn't leave a good feeling in me.

\---

This example is probably the worst and longest I've had to work though, and I'm still trying to figure out how to deal. My first semester I took chemistry. A guy, G, sat in front of me. The first two or three weeks we talked a bit before class, about class, as I did with the other people around me too. Apparently he dormed in the same hall as me too and he had seen me around, but I hadn't seen him. Either way, he had my number from a (failed) study group. As the semester continued he'd occasionally make comments to me like,

G: ""Hm, I have to make some weekend plans.""

Me: ""Oh yeah."" (continue to talk to friend next to me, show little interest)

\-

G: ""What are you doing this weekend?""

Me: ""Not much, probably study or hang out with my roommates.""

G: ""Do you want to see a movie \_\_\_ night?

Me: ""Nah, I'm good.""

Basically, I knew I wanted to keep my relationship with him low-key and stick to in-class. But he persisted with this until halfway through the semester when he dropped the class. I thought that'd be the end, but he started texting me the same type of thing. One day I was walking into my dorm and I ran into him running out and sobbing. He just broke down from stress, I guess?? But still, it's worth noting. He stopped me and rambled a bit about how horrible he felt about himself and so on. 

That was the last I heard of him that semester. That spring semester he began texting me again. Sometimes a simple ""hi."" ""Hey."" ""What are you doing right now?"". Sometimes I'd respond, most of the time I wouldn't though. If anything I'd say,

Me: ""Nothing really""

G: ""Do you want to meet up?"" 

Me: ""No""

And I'd leave it there. I stuck with keeping my answers boring and simple. If he asked why, I'd either not respond or say ""I don't want to."" 

I really don't know how much more transparent I could have been.

He asked me on Valentine's that year if I wanted to see a movie, and in the same way my last message to him was ""Not much."" ""I don't want to.""

I had ignored his shit for months, every so often saying ""No"" just to show that no, I'm not interested. But he kept messaging me. The next fall semester began, he began messaging me on Facebook, I'd see him near the entrance of my dorm because those two years we lived in the same dorm. He'd message me at 1am asking if I wanted to stop by and see a movie. I'd say no.

I'm going into my third year now and its currently summer, and yet I still get his text/Facebook messages and honestly? It's driving me insane. I've ignored him for the past three months and yet here we are. 

\---

As I've said, I know a lot of my classmates from casual conversations in the past, and several of them are friends with one another as well. The reason I decided to ask for advice here isn''t because of G funnily enough, but because of another guy, J. I was good friends with his best friend my first semester. I went on a date with his best friend second semester - it didn't work out, and we're honestly pretty good friends still. 

I know J from TAing together. We were 2 out of 30 TAs and lead different sections, and I never had the time to talk to him. His personality came off a bit too strong to me, and I honestly wasn't ever intent on being more than coworkers with him.  The same semester we TAed, we had a class together and would occasionally talk in the same group of classmates when waiting for class to begin. His off-hand comments to me always felt flirtatious. It made me uncomfortable so I'd laugh it off and talk with someone else or go over to someone else.

This past spring semester we had a class together again, and me being friends with his best friend, I saw him around. 

One day (after class I think) we talked after leaving class and he told me he brought me something. Yes, it was nice of him and I was thankful for him for thinking of me, but it felt unnecessary and made me uncomfortable. He brought me like instant coffee packets that he said his family makes. Ok, cool. He knew I worked in a coffee shop sometimes so I see where he was coming from. I didn't want to not take it, he had good intentions and that took guts, so I said, ""Thank you for thinking of me, you didn't have to do that."" and left it at that. 

He had my number from a study group. After the gift incident, he texted me one or twice, and like I did with G, I responded to J in a similar way: simple, boring answers. Please, feel free to strike up conversations with me in/around class, but I didn't have any interest in being more than casual friends. 

Things got weird when he began calling me out of the blue, beginning a week after the gift. I never answered. Another week later, and he called me past midnight. Yes I was up, but no way in hell was I going to answer. He left me a voicemail that night, and after discussing with my roommate, we agreed he was drunk. He called me ""his superhero"", offered to buy me makeup, and complained he couldn't find his keys. 

I never responded, never answered his texts. We still had class together, but after that he never looked my way, and to make it worse I saw him often because of our mutual friends. 

Two months later, he messaged me on social media out of the blue asking if I wanted to see a movie, and again I responded ""Not really."" Afterwards, he continued ignoring me.

I didn't hear from him again until last night, hence this post. Honestly, I should've ignored it but I didn't because I had a good day and again, I really like talking with people and wanted to be friendly. 

J: ""Hi, how are you doing?""

Me: ""I'm doing well. You?""

J: ""Great to hear from you. I'm great and (insert what he's up to)!""

Me: ""Oh nice. I've seen from social media!""

J: ""What have you been up to? Haven't talked for a while.""

Me: ""(insert what I'm up to, classes, work, etc.). They've been going well.""

J: ""Are you still doing \_\_\_? I'm sure you'll be done with school sooner than me (emoji)""

J: ""Do you still have my number?""

Me: ""No, not anymore, just finishing up with \_\_\_.""

Me: ""And probably not, I added that major so I have an extra semester

Me: ""I think I do, it's somewhere in my phone

J: ""That's impressive (insert more about what I'm doing)!

J: ""If you like, we can text/call if you're up for it.""

I know I should have just said I didn't want to then and there, but I was tired, didn't want to deal with answering, and went to bed. He messaged me 'Morning' with an emoji this morning and I don't know what to say now. 

\---

I guess what I'm looking for is advice on how to better handle situations like these. Would you have replied to G or J differently? Should I be more direct in saying no, even though in some situations they haven't asked me on a date? A part of me tells myself there's no need to be more direct, or that I can't reply ""No, I'm not interested."" when their messages are more vague. And how am I supposed to reply to J? 

I wish I could be the type of person to text my close friends screenshots and asking them since they know these guys but at the same time I don't because it's not my place sharing my texts with people we both know and making things uncomfortable for my friends as well.

&lt;b&gt; TL:DR; College friends/classmates push my personal limits on friendship a bit too far. I try my hardest to make my denials to date offerings and going outs that I'm just not interested in casual, but some have been so persistent and I'm at a loss. &lt;/b&gt;",16Jul2018,1

61,"Hey first post on Reddit and made this account for it. Im 22 and have a really weird situation that might seem stupid to most. A little back story, ive been with my now ex fiancee for 3 years and we recently called off our engagement a couple months ago. We have been talking off and on and we really believe that we can make things work again. I seriously love this woman and personally want to take the risk to be with her again. During this little time I foolishly went into a recruiting office went to meps and signed a contract for 5 years. I honestly don't know what I should do since I'm afraid of losing her since she's really the only person I have since my family disowned me. What do you guys think I should do?",16Jul2018,1
62,"Here’s the story, When I was grade 6 (that was 2005-2006) I got moved in a new section so I have, I was essentially a new kid in the Class. At first, I was getting to know some people and trying to make friends. But when I try to introduce myself in front of the Class thats when I received my first time teasing that even Teacher joined in the fun. So my self-esteem was fractured. So each day, I would receive different kinds of teasings like insult on how I look, talk, and weird I was. Back then I didn’t know how to take a joke so I use to cry a lot because of it. 

But the real bully in my class was the one I considered  as a friend. I was trying my best to make friends in the class and when a seatmate of mine wanted to talk I felt a sign of relief and joy that I have somebody to talk too. So at first my friend we got along we had common interest manga, anime,  pokemon cards and bakugan. But after awhile hanging out with he was a bit controlling, so he would occasionally ask for money for stuff he want or food he wanna eat. Then he started taking some of my favorite Pokémon cards and mangas. Then result to every week he would ask for a a toy (bakugan) every week from me. But it didn’t stop there, at times when I didn’t do his instruction he would hurt me physically like punching me in stomach and hitting me in the head. He also joins the other people who bully me and at times would kick me out of my seat and make me sit on the floor and throw away my school things. But what was my breaking point was when he insulted my family on how dumb they were and how worthless we were. I tried telling on a teacher but he would pester me more and he says that his father hurt him because of me. But I endured it until the end of the SY.

After that, he moved to different school and we never got much contact. But when I entered a new school year most of the bullies that were teasing me said sorry to me and we have reconciled. But that bully who I considered as a friend hadn’t said anything. With the advent he recently added me in FB and all the experiences came back to me. 

I was wondering if I should tell him i felt during that time and how he hurt me when I was young. I know we were kids back then and it’s my fault for being so weak. But I feel he should know it and that I forgive for those times but I can’t consider him a friend or should I let it pass and ignore it. ",16Jul2018,2

idek where to post this so ig here pl lmk if there’s a better spot for this. 


okay so about 2 months ago I found out that my mom was cheating on my dad from around 2015-2017. my only other sibling knows (she’s older). we both want to tell my parents that we know but we don’t know how to do it. stuffs really complicated with family before I even found out about it. 

I tried to convince my parents to let me see a therapist for stress due to school and just ask the therapist how to deal with it but they said no to therapy and to just talk to them about it. 
 
just looking to see if it’s stupid to say anything now because we have proof of the affair ending in 2017. 

parents relationship now as it is, is-kinda wack but they still get along and don’t argue or anything. I had no idea about it until my mom got sloppy and asked me to back up her phone for her and I saw some stuff. 

no one knows about it besides me and sister.

64,"So, I had a goal that I’d try and get varsity reps my freshman year for football, and I’ve gone above and beyond what the coaches want. I’ve attended camps, I’ve sat in their rooms asking for the areas I could use improvement in, and I showed up for their summer training program. 

We had our team camp this past week, and I didn’t get any varsity reps, in fact none of us freshman got varsity reps. It’s disappointing to say the least, I can out lift, and out hustle some of the sophomore and juniors in varsity rotation. Instead, the coaches wanted me to play scout team the entire week.

65,"My sister and I thought it would be a good idea to try LSD together, and she ended up having a total psychotic break. I tried it a quite a few times and pretty much always liked it, she had tried it once before and had a bad trip. She thought because she was in a good environment she would be okay, and she actually went off her meds a month prior because acid doesn't work as well when you're taking anti-depressants. What I didn't know was that she was also supposed to be taking anti-psychotics, which she also stopped taking. No one who is psychotic or schizophrenic should ever try acid, and if she was completely honest me about her condition I never would have given it to her.

 The trip destoyed her consciousness and I witnessed her descend into madness. She had no idea what was going on and looked absolutely terrified the whole time, and I had to take care of her for like 10 hours when she was like that.  There were certain points where she looked at my friend and I like she was thinking about killing us, and she wouldn't stop staring at me like that. She even hit me at one point. I got sleeping meds to calm her down and try to get her to sleep, but after many hours she still couldn't. She ended up walking away with her phone off and my dad found her being talked to by fire and rescue after someone had called 911 because they knew she obviously wasn't okay. At this it was long enough that the acid had totally left her system and her psychosis alone was causing her to hallucinate. She checked herself into a hospital and then a psych ward. When my parents went to visit her after she had spent a night and most of the day there she was much worse and was singing and just acting like a crazy person. The doctor says shes psychotic and hearing voices, and I feel like it will be a long time before she's okay again.

I don't know how to get the image out of my head of the way her face looked. The way she stared at me. I can't sleep, I'm so anxious, I can't stop thinking about her and how terrified she must be right now locked in a place full of more people like that. I don't even think I can visit her again because of the trauma of watching her break. I visited her with my parents and it was really difficult but when they saw her a second time they said it was even worse. This is by far the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life. I never want to try any drug besides weed or alcohol for the rest of my life after seeing that. I feel like such an idiot for sharing it with her and somehow thinking it would be a good idea. How do I sleep? How do I make myself okay with what's going on? I feel so awful and guilty and sad for her and I don't know what to do. Please help me.

66,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 years. For someone who has been clinically depressed and suicidal for his entire life, it's been amazing having someone who has been so supportive and understanding. She has essentially been the only person I've been able to communicate with about things in that area, and I know I've been really good for her too in a lot of ways. We make each other laugh and try our best to make everyone else's lives better. We actually have a relationship that other people say they ""hope they find someday""(multiple people have said that directly). So while it sounds like I'm bragging about having a perfect relationship, the fact that it's been so amazing is really making things awful for me.

Im just not happy with my life. And the worst part about it is that Im certain I will never actually be happy with life. And saying that makes me hate myself even more because it sounds like stupid you don't adult whining. And I know it sounds so cliché but I really don't want to hold her back for the rest of her life.

The main point of friction in our relationship is that she wants to get married and have kids and have the perfect family she's always dreamed of. I maybe wanted some version of that years ago but for a long time, I've been finding it difficult to picture myself committing to a life like that when everyday I hope I die in my sleep. And admittedly it's not like I'm feeling this purely for some noble, self-sacrificing reason. I honestly feel like just being alone. 

The problem is that if we broke up, I know I would destroy so much of her happiness. I know how much she loves me and I really love her too. I just don't think I can make her happy in the long term. And we've been dating for quite some time so we've cultivated relationships with others based on us being a couple. I would have no problem being the one to step back, even move away, so that she could receive all the support from our mutual friends and not have to worry about splitting them up you know?

there's so much Ive been thinking about this and I know the smartest and easiest thing to do would be to talk to this wonderful girl about it all. I hate hurting people almist as much as I hate being emotionally vulnerable,so that's going to be hard for me to do.

67,"A few months ago at my workplace (fortune 50 company) a position opened up that I would normally cover or backup as needed. It was expected of me to take over full time until further notice (without the extra benefits/pay) when they lost the person in that position right at the peak of a busy season. 

Today I trained my replacement. Now I did not expect the job would just be handed to me, but I waited for the position to be posted and applied for a position that could also apply to the role I was standing in for. I waited patiently for an interview (a month), and trained my replacement before I could interview. 

Now my replacement was promoted to the level of the role I was standing in for a few months back. He did not like the role he was given because he claims he did not want a baby sitting job. Managment decided to have him continue doing the work of the level I was supposed to be doing.

The job I'm actually interviewing for? His. The one he was supposed to be doing, but was actually doing the work of a level below him. 

Now I did not see myself in that position before today, but it is better than going back to what I was doing before. I didn't mind not having the extra pay because I generally did enioy the work better. But it pissed me off when I got home and realized, he was being paid more than I was, and all he did was shadow me. Training will also continue for 1-2 additional days (depending on how well he follows day 2).

72,"I think a huge part of it is that I was bullied and excluded by girls for a long time in elementary and middle school. Things like being talked about behind my back by so called female ""friends"", being socially excluded, and being giggled and laughed at by groups of pretty girls. I feel like an alien around beautiful girls, and generally they seem to dislike me. These days, I have no female friends. At the moment, exclusively male friends. I tend to feel like if a girl is pretty, she automatically doesn't like me and that feeling (which I think stems from all the giggling, taunting, nasty comments and bullying in school) additionally turned into resenting pretty women. I don't feel that resentment as much to those that aren't conventionally beautiful, though my thought process/feelings go like this - she's a girl so she doesn't like me and I'm inferior. I also can't talk to another girl without feeling weird and like this *thing*. 

I don't want to be sexist, I know I sound awful, and I won't lie, I resent women. I'm aware I do sound sexist, and probably very shallow because of these feelings of resentment. But I really don't want to feel this way anymore. I know this will get a lot of downvotes and maybe some hate, but it's perfectly understandable.

77,"Hey. I've been dealing with this for weeks and I don't know what to do. I also have a terrible fear of conflict, which doesn't help. Skip to the end for a TLDR.

My roommate is a girl I worked with for a while, she seemed sweet and nice enough, and she needed a place to live, so I offered her one of the unused rooms in my house. Her situation is complicated, and it's ever changing, but I'll try to be as concise as possible. She was okay for a while, I usually didn't even see her because she spends 99&amp;#37; of her time with whatever guy she is currently dating. A couple months ago she was basically gone for a couple weeks with some new guy and whenever she'd come home it was pretty clear she had been doing some kind of drugs. I'm not sure what. I guess that relationship fell through and she started hanging around here more often. This is when things started getting weird. Half the things she says don't make sense. Kinda like word salad. She seems to think someone's following her or out to get her. She has said she's a ""prophet"" and ""following bread crumbs"" and will get excited at any minor coincidence. She's quick to make connections between unrelated things.  She thinks the cat is ""communicating"" with her and she'll leave cat food all around the house. She clearly doesn't eat enough. She is very disorganized and will spend entire days just sort of shuffling papers and leaving things around the house. My partner and I can't focus or do anything peacefully because she's constantly pacing around, sighing, crying, laughing, and coming up, showing us random articles or pictures she's found that she thinks mean something. Just today she said she was interested in the ""federal reserve in San Francisco"" and wondered if I'd like to road trip out there with her. 

Every day I have a harder time humoring and being patient with her and it's leading to me feeling very anxious all the time and avoiding her.  Her intentions are good and she doesn't get violent or offensive or anything. I'm not sure how to handle this. How do you confront someone and tell them they're possibly schizophrenic and they need help? Or should I just bypass that and give her an eviction notice straight away? Is there some service I call? She considers me her ""best friend"" and I don't want to break her heart.

So the house is 5,400 sq ft and was built in the 70’s and hasn’t been updated in any way and we’ve come to find that the craftsmanship is all kinds of shoddy (poor job tiling/hardwood floors, doors don’t shut properly, electric wiring is wonky, and the ceiling leaks through the light fixtures in 2 different places and also through the range hood vent in the kitchen). Also, the AC didn’t work upon move in but the landlord did get that fixed within a couple days. We have noticed a big bug problem with spiders, roaches, ants, and even termites (a pest control guy did come by the other day to treat for those specifically). They sent a roofer to repair the leak last Tuesday but tonight it rained hard again and the leaks are all still happening. They are charging $2,300 a month for rent and we both agree this is too much for the quality and condition of the house. They failed to let us do an official walk through to assess current damages although most of what we’re dealing with would have been impossible to discern from a 20 minute visit. 

We will be contacting them again first thing tomorrow to notify them of the continued leaking and to also request some money off rent since these issues have been piling up and causing undue stress. 

Are there any specific recourses we have to negotiate further or insist upon certain reparations? I have time stamped photos and videos of all the aforementioned damages and problems we’ve encountered thus far, and we really don’t want to go the route of small claims court, but would rather just have the rent lowered or else we’ll be vacating. 

It’s a shitty situation because we both spent quite a bit getting moved here on top of the already expensive rent. Any advice would be much appreciated. ",16Jul2018,1

86,"Hey guys,

So I'll keep this brief.

Two leadership roles in my team recently opened up, and I applied for it.

I was super confident that I'd get it, as I am the most qualified and experienced person in my team. That is a fact, not just my biased opinion. 

I didn't get it. 

It went to two others in my team; one of which, I understand, but I would still consider myself to be a better candidate, and the other was just a choice that neither myself or the rest of the team would understand, let's call them Charles. 

Charles has many flaws which is why no one in the team understood how they got the promotion. I won't go in detail. 

My first question is whether I should even have a chat with the managers to discuss the hiring. Even if I have a chat with them, my plan is not to change the outcome, but to talk to them about my concerns.  Is this wise? 

Secondly, if I do sit down with the managers, besides telling them why I should have gotten the promotion, should I talk about why Charles should not have? Bring up examples of their work, and why am they aren't fit to be in a leadership role? Or is bringing up someone's flaws a straight up no-go? 

Those were my questions for now. 

Cheers!",16Jul2018,2

89,"Hey, i accidentally missed too many payments and got cut off off my kaiser coverage.

I'm not sure what I have but i think it might be some kind of arthritis. It all started with back pain and sciatica. I sit all day at work ""chat center"" and are work stations aren't the best so I said ""makes sense"" and filled a workers comp thing. Started seeing the workers comp doc (while I still had Kaiser but I was still sure it was a work thing. I got a low back/hip x ray and it showed an osteophyte. Somewhere in my hip. It kinda freaked me out but the Dr didn't seem concerned. Dr said I had a sprained lumbar and recommended physical therapy.

Soon after my ears would start to sting at work and started looking online about that. Told work too. Seems it can be cervical spine issues. Wound up getting some exercises online that seem to work ok. i did this because The Dr just said to keep doing the phys therapy which did ok on my back but not much for my ears.

Recently I went hiking and started feeling intense pain where my right femur meets my hip. Just last week or so my knees started to go . First my right knee then my left. I walk very stiffly now and it's really apparent. I was trying to do laundry and it's pretty hard.

I really want to do something about them but i don't know whatto do without coverage. Itsnot clear what I have but I'm pretty sure sitting isn't bad for your knees, is it? 

I could try to call kaiser back and see if they can get my coverage back of I paid? I remember getting a past due notice, paying it with confirmation of the payment on the twelfth and notice on the 13th that coverage ended June 9th. I stupidly didn't call and get clarity and see my options then and now I guess I'm screwed?

91,"My best friend and I have been friends since junior high. Her husband and her, and my husband and I often hang out together. There has long been tension between her husband towards my husband. Small insults, etc....her husband has a very bad temper. Once we were in a restruant and the waitress was new. She made a mistake and charged his ticket with our to-go order(It was expensive). He got manager. He made a huge scene, and everyone was looking at us. They fixed the problem. The poor waitress looked so frazzled. My husband called when we got to our car and told the manager that the waitress was not bad, and apologized for our friend's scene. 
Another instance happened at another restruant. My husband was joking around and playing with my friend's stepson. He was play hiding a toy. The kid was having fun. They were being silly. My friend's husband got in my husband's face and told him to stop. He told him he didn't appreciate him doing this. It was so bad that the lady at the pay counter asked my husband if that guy was his dad. 
My friend's husband is always making snide remarks about my husband. He treats him like he is ignorant, and knows nothing about marriage, etc....now my husband is a joker and enjoys making sly comical, quirky remarks. I think he is hilarious. It's odd because my friend's husband often laughs, then sometimes he acts like he is schooling my husband on what he does wrong. I forgot to mention, this guy is a counselor. 
The other night they had invited us to see his kids in a play. My husband decided not to go, and my friend's husband proudly said, ""called it, we were just talking saying we get he didn't show up!"" My husband has sat through 2 of this guy's kids plays. 
Now here is another thing. He is constantly all over my friend. He kisses her constantly, and tells her all this comments like how beautiful she is, etc....it can be sweet, but enough is enough in front of people. It really bothers me when their hands are all over each other.
This guy also constantly bashes his ex wife. When his kids are around, he calls my friend the kids mom, and always says your son, or your daughter. Just completely ignoring the fact that those kids have a mom.

100,"Hi Reddit,

So I wanted to sort of vent/seek guidance on this matter that has been plaguing my life for the past few years and has gotten dramatically worse since graduating college. I am a 23 year old man, graduated college 7 months ago; and have trouble believing in myself. I got my BFA and have a genuine love for animation and illustration, and I live in NYC. The past 7 months has consisted of me grinding every day to try and better my skills/portfolio, network, and work up the courage to apply for jobs. Some of my work has made it into CUNY film festivals but yet I still find myself brushing off my accomplishments as i am still broke and living at home. 

I’ve watched my peers land full-time jobs and at first I said; “it’s alright, I kinda needed a break after college anyway” but as time goes on, I realize how much I really want to start my life. I haven’t been applying to many jobs lately and even felt like giving up many times. When I walked with a friend today and kinda vented he asked “Well what are you missing in terms of the things you need in order to apply and get jobs?” And I paused and said...”I don’t know” then I thought about it some more and reframed my response and said “I don’t know, but i think I just doubt myself too much”.

When I look at it deeply, my expectations/desires don’t match my inner beliefs. I don’t believe that I can find success and I don’t believe I’m actually good enough. I don’t know why that belief system exists in me... I never used to doubt myself as an artist before college and now that’s all I can do. 

There are little moments where I can clear my head and say “hey you CAN do this” and it feels true. But it’s not long before I’m trying to fix my old work up and I’m asking myself “what’s the point?”  I don’t know how to stop this, I want to. I would love to have my own back, but I just don’t. 

Then I wonder how any employer would believe in me if I can’t even do that for myself. Any advice on how to cope/move through this? It causes a lot of anxiety for me and gets me super depressed. Any advice would help. ",16Jul2018,2

102,"I am an incoming high school senior with quite a small friend pool. When I think of the word 'friend', I think of people that I see/hang out with on the daily basis, talk about practically anything personal, and am very close to and vibe with. Given my standards, I only have 2 people I consider 'friends' that fit that description believe it or not.

Every other classmate in my periods I'll keep in touch with here and there, making small talk on what's going on in classes, homework and y'know, the usual gossip that goes around the school and all. It's hard to get advice from an outside acquaintance of the 2 friends that I'm really tight with because I don't really know my classmates in that way, or enough to ask them for advice. I turned to Reddit.

  
To have gotten through 6 years now with these two friends says a lot to me. But lately, 1 out of the 2 friends has been keeping herself distant from me. We'll call her C.

C and I go way back. To the 6th grade to be exact. In essence, we stuck through everything thick and thin. C and I were always there for each other during elementary, the ever so awkward years of middle school, and now our final year of high school. Through these 5 years that I'd known her, she'd been one of my two best friends. Part of what I think made our friendship last so long was through the hardships of losing other friends of our group ever since middle school slowly walk out the door into things that they wanted. We'd go from like 10 people to what now remains 3.

I get it. People are revolving around different people in middle and high school and getting into relationships and all. We're figuring out life, not to mention the real world is in front of us once we graduate.  


I go to a school in Hawai'i. Our Summers start earlier and end earlier than the mainland. This year, I went on a trip to Washington for the entirety of my Summer. Being how close C and I were before I left, I thought nothing would happen to where we stood in our friendship as the weeks unfolded. So far we've only talked once this whole break late-ish June and caught up with what was going on with our lives. Ever since then, I've been trying to get in touch with her. Texting things like ""hey, when are you free this week?"" or ""want to talk?"". From there it just never happened. I'm the type of person that wants to be there for their friends. And with how many friends I consider true still, I didn't get that out of everyone who left since middle school. 

  
She'd say she's free on one day/time of the day through text, and when I tried to call she wouldn't pick up. What worried me even more was that as I called her everyday at around the same times, I wouldn't get a response at all. She didn't acknowledge that she'd missed my call either. I know she's on her phone and all because she watches my Snapchat story, but it bothers me to think that she simply doesn't want anything to do with my anymore.

Calling her everyday in hindsight probably wouldn't have been the best idea, but I felt that if she truly did not want to talk to me for whatever reason, I wish she'd tell me instead of flat out ignoring me. I'd stopped communicating with her totally after about a week now, realizing that calling her multiple times wasn't going to do anything.  


Where I'm coming from is that us as soon to be adults now are all going our separate ways. I can come to an understanding that sometimes things aren't meant to be, but what I saw in C ever since then was that we were going to be friends for life. I still want it to be that way, but with how she hasn't put a tiny bit of effort or share into our friendship to say that she's been busy with her Summer, or that she couldn't get to my call speaks to me as not wanting to be friends anymore. 

People walk in and out of your life. Some stay for a little while, some a lot. And just a handful for a lifetime.

I'm now contemplating whether or not to let this friendship go.

  
What do you think? Am I overreacting? What should I do?

Thanks in advance for your help.",16Jul2018,2

106,"Hi all reading this!

I know it’s summer and it’s a time for relaxation, but since I’m a rising senior in high school, I’m thinking about majors and college. I told my parents that I wanted to be a Physicist yesterday, major in physics and do research or work in labs, and they flat out scoffed at me. They told me that my major was an awful choice and that I would have no success outside of college, calling a degree in physics a “wall decoration.” This broke my heart because it’s a subject I’m passionate about and really want to pursue, but the fact that my parents aren’t behind me really feels like there’s a knife stuck in my back. This morning my parents brought it up during breakfast, saying that if I did apply to schools for their science programs then they wouldn’t pay for the tuition and that they won’t “waste” their money on a “useless” degree. My sisters then came into the mix and started to shit on my decision as well calling it “pathetic” and “useless.” My parents want me to become a doctor or an engineer, all of my sisters are engineers, saying it’s a safer and better choice. I know some engineering majors, especially mechanical, use a lot of physics but I find the work of an engineer to be tedious and stressful (mad respect to all engineers). Whenever I do physics problems or anything related to astrophysics, I always enjoy what I do and I want to do more, it encapsulates and entertains me. I’ve had problems with depression before and I feel that going into a major that I won’t enjoy will bring it back. That was the darkest time in my life and a time where I thought everyday was my last, worst experience I’ve ever had and I’m glad I found my release hobby that made me more and more happy as the years went on. Physics helped me and I want to help physics, but seeing how my parents view my dreams now, it’ll never happen. What should I do to show my parents that I’m serious about majoring in physics? What should I do if they reject it again?",16Jul2018,2
107,"I lived with my brother and his family for two years and recently turned 18. My brother, who has a felony(drug related), has two daughters, one 11 and the other 1 years old. Living with them I’ve noticed how horrible he treats his 11 year old daughter. He constantly mocks her, calls her names, and orders her to do everything such as fetching items around the house to care for her 1 y/o sister and even bathing her sister. When she declines, he yells “Hurry up!” or “Go now!” and if she still refuses, he slaps her hard on her legs or arms until she goes. My niece began to just obey everything he says to avoid being hit. This occurs at least 5 times a day, ordering her to do something. Her mom would sometimes talk to my brother about his treatment but it never goes through. She gave up and doesn’t care anymore and just lets him do whatever. The mother also has to listens to everything he says, (he doesn’t hit or yell at her though). She often neglects her daughter, never showing any care for her. 

I try my best to support my niece by talking to her, but she doesn’t seem like she wants to talk about it and then acts as if everything is fine. She’s very strong willed and hardly ever cries, but when she does, she always tries to hide it by locking herself in her room or in the bathroom and then returns back like nothing happens, with my brother mocking her again and she laughs it off and continues playing. She loves her parents more than anyone, but I hate to see how they are treating her. I am unable to speak to my brother as he takes everything as offensive and responds with violence. He is just mentally unable to understand what I’m trying to tell him. Just today, we just got back from a long and hot car ride and she was irritated and he kept mocking her so she got frustrated and hit him once with her bag. Afterwards he kept slapping her arms until he was told to stop. She began to tear up and locked herself in the bathroom for around 15 minutes. When confronted, he said “she thinks she can do whatever she wants by hitting me. Next time I’ll punch her in the face” pissed off.

So here I am now, furious and depressed. I want to help my niece before anything gets worse, but i don’t know what to do anymore. She was mostly raised by her grandmother since my brother was in prison for 5 years and the mother was always working, never spending time with her daughter. My niece doesn’t ever want to be separated by her parents since he came out, seeing as how she was unable to be with them for those 5 years. I don’t want to split them apart, since she has already been through the experience of not being with them and is probably scarred by that event. I just don’t see this family being able to function with a controlling husband and father. I want my niece to be happy but I can’t just let this go on.

I’m sorry for the long read but I need to let this out and also get some advice. What should I do? Thank you very much in advance.",16Jul2018,4

The bully, two other friends, and I are really close friends and hangout almost every other day. This bully is sort of the class clown and is never serious, no matter the situation. I am sort of sensitive to mean comments and hate becoming angry at people because I have a temper problem(cannot control myself when I'm angry). Despite this, I am the quiet kid who never gets mad at people because I cannot control my anger. I hate making fun of people and Im a nice kid.

For the past year and a little more, this guy would call me rude names and make fun of the way I look. It would be in almost every conversation that he would make fun of the way I look insult me. He would always put me down wherever I was. Usually I walk away, or tell him, ""That's kinda rude"", but he does not understand. He exploits the few things that get me very angry and loves seeing my reaction. For example, I have curly hair and he thinks its funny to throw small pieces of paper in my hair. This sucks because I cannot tell if its there or not. It feels kinda fucked up to cut off ties with a friend that I've had for so long, so I usually forgive him. That was until he would only talk to me for the reason of putting me down.

I put off the idea of telling him that I did not like him and did not want to hangout with him kind of felt scary to me. Not because of how he would feel but how our group would. It would feel too awkward kicking one person out, but I stopped caring at this point. 

So, a few weeks ago, I sent him a text message which basically was me telling him that he treated me bad and that I don't want to talk to you anymore, leave me alone, lets go separate ways etc. I was expecting an apology like, ""Oh I am so sorry"", or ""I had no idea, please forgive me"". It was the complete opposite, he denied all of my complaints and even pulled out the victim card; you made fun of me so I did the same back. What set me off was the fact that he kept asking whether it was serious. His large ass ego came in between and did not even apologize. I ignored every text and call that he sent from that day forward. Once he realized that I wouldn't answer, he decided to give my number out to a few people to reach me, I found it creepy and blocked all of them.

During this period of ignoring this person, our group of four friends had not spoken to each other in over a week. One  of my other friends decides to call me to see if we can plan something. The call I had with this friend was so heartwarming and genuine that I decided to just make up with the bully; It was at this moment, I knew I fucked up. I called the bully and his apology was very full. Very full of bullshit, he didn't apologize. A minute into the call, I realized that I had made a serious mistake.

Currently I am in summer break, and I am still being made fun of to this day by the same bully over social media. His profile picture is a goofy-faced selfie I took. I requested him to change it to something else, but he said no and called me a coon.

I do not know how to handle this situation for what it has become. I would appreciate any advice on my situation, and thank you so much reading this. :)

TLDR: I am being bullied by best friend and makes fun of me every day. I am confused on what to do, please help me. I just needed to vent out my frustration, please read my story for more details. ",16Jul2018,2

111,"Currently, there are four things that I keep thinking of doing at some point in my life:

1. Starting Drawing and Animating
2. Making A Game (using the drawing and animating)
3. Getting A Girlfriend
4. Going To The Gym

I've tried doing all four and I couldn't persist in doing it. I went to the gym for a week straight and stopped because I didn't want to diet anymore. I tried to pick up drawing and art three times and I dropped it all three times because eventually I just really didn't want to do it anymore. I have to force myself to make a game, and there's multiple issues with getting a GF apart from actually forcing myself to go socialize with people.

Eventually, I've come to a conclusion: **Why should I have to force myself to enjoy something?** I didn't enjoy doing art, I didn't enjoy making a game, I didn't enjoy trying to get a GF, and I **definitely** didn't enjoy going to the gym. Therefore, I've decided that it might be better to just stop doing these things. 

The problem is, when I don't contribute some type of effort to the first three things (Art, Programming, GF), I get bothered. The feeling of not making any progress at all starts to annoy me, but then I remember back to when I tried to make progress and failed. So the question is: **How do I stop caring about my goals?**

What tips does one have for giving up a goal? A lot of people say your quality of life will be increased when you have passions or goals, but my goals have caused me nothing but dissatisfaction and irritation.",16Jul2018,1

114,"I (19F) have been dating this guy ‘Chris’ (18M) for 1yr 7mo. We are currently living with our two friends Monica (21F) and James (23M) (no they aren’t dating) and we live in a small town in Southern California, USA it’s about an hour alway from the beach, the mountain, the city, the desert, anything and everything is at our disposal. Well recently  Chris(boyfriend) was told his sister ‘Julia’ (23F) is moving to Colorado, USA for a job opportunity and asked if he’d/we’d go with him!! I immediately said no, no way would I leave the beach and my mom and we’ve talked about it a little bit... well more recently we realize it’s getting to become a lot more serious. And have decided to go, if we can find a place to live. 
so now I’m looking at so much I need to do, I need to pack, I need to find a job out there and place to live. I need to spend time with my family and my friends and I need to appreciate the beach and oh did I mention I have 6 weeks until my current lease is up conveniently when Julia’s lease is up. We were originally going to stay and renew the lease... but just a few days ago we were told that the landlord needs to move back into her house&amp; we need to get out. Also I just got a new job I’m starting in about a week. So regardless we need to find a place to live here or there in 6 weeks. 

Now that I have pretty much covered the basics let me go into a little more depth..  my current roommate situation is moving together, we all are packing and going out of state together &amp; that eases my mind a little knowing I will have my 3 best friends with me. My boyfriend parents a while back had mailed us a letter saying hi, and sending over some stuff in the letter they had randomly also offering to help us get situated in a new state.. with anyone ever mentioning wanting to move.. so that being said he thinks if he ask  for some financial help getting us out there they would love to help&amp; again that eases my mind a little more. And I love change, I love adventure! And the new city were looking at had a river flowing through it, it’s warm, it pretty, it a lot Cheaper, it seems awesome!! I’m super excited 


Except I’m not... I’m terrified, I can’t stop crying, I don’t know what to do first, idk how to pack and work and look for a new job and a place to live and say bye to everyone, and this and that. Whatever I can’t get everything.. I think... let’s say we pull this off. That only means I have 6 weeks with my mom... my world, My best friend, My #1 person, My main support beam, my idol, my mom..... I can’t leave my mom, I can, but I can’t, we talk everyday some times  two or three times, we hang out 1-2 x a week, we are very involved in each others lives. It’s not just my mom, it’s my dad &amp; it’s my brothers, &amp; my large family, Ive got cousin, 2nd cousins, aunts, uncles, grandmas and grandpas, great grandmas and a great grandpa. I have sick family, i have a foster dog I can’t bring, I have so much stuff I don’t need.. where do I start? 
 Idk what advice I’m looking for, I guess this way more of a vent.

115,"Well, my best friend and I became friends when we were both 14.  We’re both going to be 20 soon.  We were absolutely inseparable.  We talked about moving and living together, raising our future kids together as friends, blah blah.  Can’t really get into it as I’m just so disappointed.   A little after we met we also became friends with this guy.  I fell for this guy really hard, and he basically destroyed all of our mutual friendships I had with him.  Except the friendship with my best friend, and he did it because he didn’t want anything to do with me after finding out I had feelings.  And of course cut me off too.   

No idea why he did it but it’s not my point here.  Skip forward almost 5 years later she’s really close with him.   I felt / feel really betrayed she’d associate herself with him and I’ve expressed this.  I know it’s wrong to give someone an ultimatum ( which I didn’t ) but I know for her it felt like it.  Of course we argued, I didn’t speak to her for a month and a half.  She finally texted me, I was still hurt, we ended up arguing again... lol.   I gave it a few days, apologized, told her I loved her and that was that.  

I’ve been trying for a few weeks now to reach her and she won’t answer the phone whenever I call,  and replies with one word texts if she replies at all.  And she’d rather be spending time with him, watching movies, talking on the phone, and being friends with him.   She’ll tell me she’s busy and yet has time for him?  Am I justified in being angry?  I just don’t understand what happened but I brought up the awkwardness tonight.  She confirmed it, however, still gave one word replies when I tried going in depth.  

So, I said fuck it, and texted her “Well I hope _____ is a better best friend than me.”  Blocked her on everything and I’m just so frustrated and ready to be done.  Yeah,  I know it was childish.  She doesn’t understand the issues I have with it, we’re not close anymore,  I don’t even think she enjoys talking to me.   Do I just let it go?

117,"Bit of a story. I worked with this woman for the last 3 years or so and the entire time we never really spoke any time we were around each other. Alot of awkward silences. I always chalked it up to that her best friends at work all hated my guts so I just assumed she did too and never paid her any attention. I found out she was leaving though and on her last day I gave her a note telling her about some of the crap I went through in my life and it all kind of made me anti social and that I was sorry I never got to know her. I knew it could of backfired. But she was actually really nice and it made me wish I had started talking to her from day one. But then she left and that was that. I asked her to keep some of the private stuff in the letter between us and she said that was fine.  But I always wondered because she was friends with people outside of work so if she said something to them I would really never know.... And then like a month later she came back and took her old job back. And since... We don't talk ALL the time,  but now we make small talk sometimes and I can tell she goes out of her way to be extra nice to me. The problem is, any time I'm talking to her at work or something it's always very brief and if one of her friends walk by I can tell she's embarrassed to be seen with me, she will look at the ground or look around nervously like she's seen a ghost. I feel awful, like I've put her in a awkward situation unintentionally. When I gave her that letter I thought I would never see her again because we're from different cities and everything. We have a week shut down for work this week, so on Friday I gave her my number and asked her if she would get coffee with me. She said yes but again looked super uncomfortable. I think she thinks I have the hots for her or something and that I want to confess my love for her, when really I just want to say to her that she doesn't have to be nice to me at work, I know her friends give her a hard time about talking to me so the last thing I would want would be for her to have a headache just because of me.

122,"Let me give you some context, over the course of this year I've been really into this one girl. I only recently started attempting to talk to her, as in around a month, and we hit it off really quick and she seemed to really enjoy talking to me.  

So I began plotting with some mutual friends on how I could ask this girl out and I thought everything was going peachy until I was talking with another group of friends and all of a sudden one mentioned liking this same girl that I fancy. 

Admittedly, I was pretty shocked. I assumed that in this situation the correct thing to do would be to tell him that I was talking with her and planning on asking her out.

Unfortunately, he got pretty hostile about this and told me that asking her out would make me a terrible friend.

This friend has not once talked to her, has no classes with her, and as far as I know, hasn't even mentioned her in conversation with anyone up until that point and still believes that he deserves the right to ask her out more than I do.

It seemed to me that he wanted me to ruin my relationship I'd been building up with this girl and to give up on asking her out just for the sake of a crush he had on her.  
Personally, I think that I was in the right thinking that it would be a bad idea to not go through with this fantasy I'd been planning.

Fast forward a few days later and I decided to go through with asking her out. Obviously if I were in the position of my friend I woul be quite pissed off as well, but for him to think that he deserves her or likes her more than I do is just bullshit to me. Surprise surprise, she said yes. I was happy, but all the people I thought were my friends looked down on me as if I had just murdered someone.

Sometimes they would reply, 99% of the time they would not.

One-sidedness is a big issue in our friendship. I doubt we would have been friends for so long if I hadn't been persistent about keeping in touch and catching up. I know this friend is very fond of me - there's no doubt about that - but I am in a different space that I was in previous years and would like to tone down the enthusiasm.

I would really like to get out of the habit of telling them everything that is going on in my life because I suspect it has been a burden for them. I know it's a problem for both of us, my compulsive need to brain dump, except I don't seem to be able to stop.

I'm in the process of organising a psychologist, but in the meantime, does anyone have a way of contacting this friend less? Or just advice about breaking addictive habits in general?

Today we spoke about it (kind of) and compromised about the time he’d spend on it. I had to go back to work so I left him be at home. 
When I returned home he said he bought me a gift. 
I got a little excited.. thinking something corny like flowers but he comes out with a $220 Fitbit.
I looked at him sideways and he said he had to spend $300 to get the finance to hire purchase some gaming things so he “bought me something “
I got so angry I threw it at him n told him to fuck off.
I reacted this way because who in their right fucking mind puts gaming stuff to the value of $80 on finance and tops it up with a $220 Fitbit?
Secondly he bought me a Fitbit a year ago and I tried it and didn’t like it so he knows this.

He’s in a shitty because I didn’t appreciate his gift but I’m like, you didn’t actively go out and buy me something for me... you grabbed something that was $220 on the shelf so you could get your gaming shit. 

His mindset is... but I bought it for you and I’m being ungrateful..

Fuck off! I don’t feel this was bought with me in mind coz I don’t even like them or want one... 

Now all I’ve got is a gift I don’t want and a hire purchase I’ll have to pay because he is absolutely terrible at paying shit off!

However, this money doesn't ever last, because, if we don't immediately spend it, our grandmother will take it (we live with her). She is crazy and stubborn at the same time, so there is no way of changing that. And of course we haven't ever immediately spent it all.

Anyway, recently we've been thinking quite a lot about getting a Wii (and some accessories for it of course) from eBay, because we really want to play Mario Kart and a few other Wii games. On eBay, I've found this (I think it's a great deal):

Wii- Black, comes with Mario Kart Wii, two steering wheels, connection cord, and the sensor bar, and a white controller.- $40+$12.50 for shipping, $52.50 total

Controllers- Two pack, Motion Plus, black, comes with two black nunchucks and black cases- $35.99 (Free shipping)

Controller charging dock station- Black, charges two controllers, comes with two rechargable batteries- $8.99 (Free shipping)

Total- $97.48

I asked my older sister (21) about getting a Wii, and she said we should save our money for a newer console. But we can't do that. We wouldn't be able to get enough money for a newer console in one shot like we can with the Wii, and we can't save up our birthday money, because our grandma always takes it if we don't immediately spend it.

Oh and one last thing, I’d love to move to a different area but since I’m living paycheck to paycheck it’s just not doable right now. That’s why I am looking for advice. I’d absolutely love to be a bigger area with tons of opportunities but alas I’m stuck in a mostly rural area with high unemployment and in a state that’s not doing well as a whole.

140,"I’d just like some perspectives on this—my students have a mini project (equivalent to some homework and a report). I gave two extensions in class, as this is a short semester and many of my students had other class midterms right after the July 4th holiday, and work as well. The extensions amounted to 1 week extra. The work is due this coming week. I received an online system message from one of my students tonight asking for another extension due to a family member visiting. 

This student has not asked any questions about the work, strongly suggesting they have not started, and several other students have finished the homework. I don’t feel that it is fair to is a good move for my reputation to give a third extension (I’m already dropping a homework score, gave a bonus on the midterm, and I offer Q&amp;A sessions to help students, but those don’t have a high attendance rate this semester—I don’t want to inflate grades.)

The end of the semester is fast approaching (summer is quick), and there are two more homework assignments and a final. If this student doesn’t get the assignment done this week, work will be stacking up—I don’t see how they could get everything done (but that’s not my place to decide).

I am very much dreading confrontation with this student after the first test.

Basically just looking for confirmation that I’m not being heartless here in denying the request for an extension....could there be something I’m missing?

TL;DR— student wants extension on the homework after two extensions have already been given. The end of he semester is fast approaching and I don’t believe this is the best course of action. I don’t believe it is fair and may possibly put the student in a worse situation.

152,"So I've been working at my local Mcdonald's just for the summer. I attend college for the rest of the year in another town so at the end of this summer I have to quit anyways to go back to school. I only have about two weeks of work left before I leave, but the working conditions are getting so bad im wondering if it would be justified to just quit now instead of sticking out to the end. There's a lot of things I've noticed that are seriously wrong at this store that ill list below.

1. Safety: I don't think I've actually really been given any training other than to watch people do things for about 39 minutes then try it myself. I didn't get any information in regards to safety with the grill, oven, and deep fryer other than not to touch hot things. About a month ago I discovered an emergency shut off button for the grill in case it lights on fire that I never new existed. I feel like I should have been told the location of this my first day, but whatever. I also only discovered the locatiom of the emergency eyewash station about a week ago when I needed to use it after I got hit grease in my eye and had to have a manager lead me to it. When we got there the manager couldn't figure out how to turn it on, and I ended up having to use a little bottle of one use emergeny eye drops. The most concerning thing I've seen so far however was the grill cleaning safety equipment. I'm not actually trained in cleaning the grill, I just cook on it. My coworkers that have been their for over a year always clean the grill. Tonight at work we discovered the grill cleaning safety equipment. This is the first time any of us had ever seen it, and some of the people have been cleaning the grill for over a year without knowing it existed. We clean our grills by pouring some kind of acid on the surface and scrubbing it, so part of the equipment is a full face shield in case acid gets splashed in someones face. Whats even worse about this is someone told me tonight that a while back someone was scrubbing the grill a little too vigorously and splashed acid directly in their eye, and had their vision impaired. Even after thus injury happenedb Mcdonalds still did not feel it was necessary to make sure it's employers knew about the proper safety equipment that would have prevented this injury. I've also slipped on the floor several times and almost fallen because there's so much grease everywhere.

2. Personal Injuries: throughout my short summer career I've managed to give myself to pretty bad 1st degree burns from being bumped into hot deep fryer baskets. I can't tell if im doing somethi g wrong or if its just too crowded by the deep fryer, because like i mentoined earlier I was never really given proper training. About a week ago I had hot grease pop directly into my eye. I was putting chicken nuggets into the deep fryer and the grease often pops when they're put in. On grease pop landed directly in the white of my eye, and like I mentioned earlier the managers could not get the eyewash to work. My eye ended up turning red and swelling a little where the grease hit so I filed a workmans comp. claim and went to the doctor. I ended up having a corneal abrasion and was prescribed antibiotics to put in my eye 5 times a day. This latest shift I had grease fly at my face again, and this time it hit the skin right next to my, but it didn't actually go in. At this point im basically terrified of putting chicken nuggets in the deep fryer because of this. I've also slipped and fallen on the greasy or wet floor several times even though I'm not running, and I wear the required treaded anti-slip shoes.

3. Faulty Equipment: We've had a grill that wont properly cook quarter pounders basically all summer, they always come up undercooked. It still hasn't been fixed. Our grills also keep breaking just about every week, whether its the tops not closing properly, not coming up properly, or the grill itself just not heating right and becoming too cool to cook anything. Our bun toaster also gets buns stuck in it every so often and start burning. One of our freezer doors doesn't stay shut half the time and everything inside starts thawing. All of this has been going on for months and none of the equipment ever seems to get fixed or replaced, which is a little concerning to me.

tl;dr: The safety standards at my job seem to be almost nonexist, and ive been minorly injured several times. Is thus good enough reason to quit without giving a two weeks notice?

I went on Monday to do fittings and the alterations were a lot more complicated than they said (everything was too small, but they should have taken measurements and ordered stock accordingly) so they needed to buy new stock which they said they were doing the next day and would contact me asap. I took one garment home to alter and completed that day hoping to drop off the Tuesday. They contacted me asking how things were and I said it was completed.

She was going through horrible withdrawals and this past week, she tried to get into a drug rehab facility to kick her addiction to the pills. She wasn't able to get in and it made things worse.

July 11th was the day that caused everything to go to shit. My wife was at work, I had gotten up early to call a few places for a job, and my mother was in pain, as per usual. She called and called a different rehab facility and when she couldn't get into it, decided her best course of action was to scream and berate the poor person on the other end. I brought up that even though she may be having a tough time, that didn't mean she was allowed to scream at people Judy doing thier jobs.

My wife got home at 5 and we decided to have her go to a facility that would monitor her and make sure she didn't have any horrible problems from these withdrawals, since she is diabetic and also has high af blood pressure. She gets down there, and she immediately turns back around because they wouldn't give her the help she wanted (such as a Valium).

My mother gets home, screaming and berating me, causing my wife to go off a bit, and me having to calm everyone down.

My mother apologized and things were okay for about an hour or so until something trivial happened, causing my mother to fly into a rage and basically tell us to leave.

166,"I am a 24 year old and have been in junior college for 5 years. I have* really* been struggling for years with deciding on what I want to pursue for my career. I have many interests and have switched my major multiple times, but have never committed to one. I'm at the point now when I just need to make a decision so I can move forward towards a goal, I'm really tired of being stagnant. Ever since I was young, I have always dreamed of being a doctor; I always excelled in academics as a kid and love learning. But as I became older and disillusioned, and honestly hugely lacking in self esteem, I convinced myself that I couldn't do that- it was too big of a goal. Some more time went by and I decided it was *really* too big of a goal since I was older and I'd already been stagnant for so many years. So I decided on Psychology because it's something I find fascinating, and was set to transfer in 6 months from now. Then the plan would be to get my Bachelors, then go on to get my Masters. If I switch to Biology in order to pursue Med School, it will push me back at the junior college I am attending now for an extra year. But, I keep having this feeling that I should just pursue Med School after all, and commit to the time it takes because it's always been a dream of mine. 
I know it's a huge commitment and nothing to take lightly. I am afraid to take the leap of faith and switch out of my Psychology classes for this upcoming semester. The classes I would need for Biology are very full and if I wait much longer I might not have a shot at taking them this semester which will push me back yet another semester. So I feel that I need to make a decision rather quickly. I can't help but *really* want this for myself, but it is a huge decision I don't know how to make.

168,"So I hope it don’t ramble but here it goes. I’m a 21 year old male who is going to be a senior in college for the upcoming semester. Over the past 5 years my mental health has deteriorated to something that has negatively impacting my life. This issue has multiple layers. First is that I have deep anxiety problems about everything. I have fear of going out and doing stuff but also fear staying at home. When there is a small problem it escalates because of my fear of asking for help. I also can never get any sleep because I’m afraid of dying in my sleep, so I get like 2 hours a sleep a day (basically when my body has given up and needs me to sleep against my will). I’m also severely depressed. I have no hope for the future and no longer care about anything. I used to love football and music but now I just use them to pass the time, I’m basically miserable. These two problems have been getting worse and worse over the years. This is added to my terrible addictive personality (to gambling primarily, but also for a short stint to alcohol) and my bad anger issues. I’ve been to anger management twice but I still flip out over small things. Like if I miss the train I’ll act like it’s the end of the world. I also think I might have OCD and ADHD. OCD because I need things to not be touched from where I put them, I need to always rewash my dishes before I use them, I need to do everything in the pattern 1-2-2-1 and if something happens to one half of my body I need to do it to the other half, like the other day I accidentally pruned my pinky on my right side and was in so much pain, but I was physically forced to do it to my other side to have it be even no matter how much it hurt.

The change in my life that drew me to ask for advice was that recently I think I’ve been experiencing a mental breakdown. I have been seeing things that aren’t there, I’ve been apparently yelling things out loud without noticing and the scariest thing is that I’ve found myself talking to people that aren’t there. Like I’m having a conversation with someone next to me on the front of the house, but they aren’t there. I’m not schizophrenic because I don’t imagine them per se, but I talk to them and they sometimes talk back. The other day I was sitting on a bench waiting for the city bus and I had a conversation about this game I have in my phone. We spoke for about 6 minutes (mostly me) and throughout the conversation I would shift between knowing I’m talking to myself and thinking that’s a real person. 

What do I do? In high school I was a state math and debate champion, I did great on my SAT, I got a full scholarship to a good college; now I feel like I should be in a mental hospital.

169,"For a bit of back story. I'm currently in a relationship of 3 years. I had moved to a different state. I started dating her at a low point in my life and kind of settled. She brought some happiness
 But I slowly learned that we enable each others habits. Because of this I saw what she was like, realized that I'm the same and I started to change
 I didn't want to be a fat lazy slob anymore. So, my life is getting back in order, I've lost 40 pounds (10 from goal) have saved money and gone back to college. She has claimed to want to change time and time again. But unless I force her to do something she won't.  I know I'm going to leave her one way or another. 

But, here's where the need for advice comes in. I didn't really push myself for this change until about 8 months ago, I went on a trip to my home town with my GF. While there we ran into my ex. But, this isn't the average ex. We were each others first crush all the way back in 5th grade. Have remained friends and on off crushes/lovers since then. I was still quite chubby at that point. And to be seen there in that state stand there with my even more over weight GF embarrassed me. EX GF I'll call Sage. Sage, looked just as i remembered her. She was beautiful, full of energy and made me think of days when I was like that. Days when I was like that WITH her.

Seeing Sage again was the biggest push in this change. Since then my life has improved drastically for the better. So, this is a win win either way, but my question to you all is:

Is it ridiculous to try to get back together with Sage? I'm moving back to that town anyway to finish college. Again we've remained close and there has always been a tension. Even if months or a year go by, we pick right up. But I also, don't want to make it seem like ""oh he just wants me because he thinks it easy"" or for it to be weird.  She is someone that has always made me happy.

So, the advice that I need is:  Can this be done. And how should I do it if So?

I don't care about the psychology of why I'm doing it. I just want to know what you think if I should try.
 

Thanks!

TL;DR:  Saw ex/lifelong friend in home town. Caused me to improve my life drastically, want to get back together with her. We've always had a great time together.

173,"I recently got this on my Reddit feed: [https://np.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/8z60xx/alyssa\_carson\_is\_a\_star/](https://np.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/8z60xx/alyssa_carson_is_a_star/). It is about [Alyssa Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Carson), a 17 year old who is the only person to have completed every NASA space camp and the youngest person to graduate from the Advanced Space Academy.  Reading about Alyssa Carson, I learnt that at age 3, she decided she wanted to become an astronaut who goes to Mars after being inspired by the animated TV show [*The Backyardigans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backyardigans), and she simply spent the next 14 years working towards that goal. 

In contrast, I can only remember a few snippets of being a 3 year old, and being hardworking was a concept I didn't even know about back then. Even though I am a research student now (at age 22), I wasn't into science until I was age 8. I am innately a quitter, and the only way I was able to stop myself from quitting university was because I decided that my ambition was more important than my nature, but regardless, I didn't have any ambition at all when I was 3.

Being an astronaut is hard work, and even people who are both fit and intelligent can give up due to its difficulty. It takes insane amounts of perseverance, willpower and diligence to follow through with a dream to become an astronaut**.** In other words, [Tiger parenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting) wouldn't work - **pushing or pressuring your kids to become astronauts will simply fail because becoming an astronaut requires an intrinsic willpower, ambition and drive to achieve**. 

Even though I do not encourage people to become astronauts, how can one ensure that their kid develops intrinsic willpower, ambition and drive to achieve at an early age? If I learnt to be as hardworking and persevering in my early years as Alyssa Carson was, instead of just muddling along, I could have had a PhD by now.",16Jul2018,7
174,"Hey, 

I'm an incoming high school senior. I do know what I want to do in my future, but I know that is contrary to what my parents want me to do. I want to either become an accountant or a therapist (two different things, but that's besides the point). I want to do either of those, but I'm just worried about getting a stable job really. I want to divert the attention to my cousin who:

\- Graduated college a few years ago at UC Riverside for Management Information Systems

\- Now she works at the DMV, and as I know the DMV pays like 35,000 so she doesn't earn that much

\- She still lives with her parents, and has no boyfriend

\- She cosplays and goes to anime conventions with her friends (which I can honestly respect)

\- Sells her art as a side hustle to get money going sometimes

\- Partied instead of getting an internship in college, leading her to have a 2 year unemployment gap (and subsequently take the DMV job)

She is looked at as the black sheep of the family, but I still respect her. She's not any less of a person for it. I want to know how I can guarantee I won't be like that... I don't look down on her, but I just want some sense of stability so I can afford to do what I want while being compensated well. ",16Jul2018,6
175,"So I have a few questions when it comes to cleaning, decluterring, and organizing closets and the house in general. I'm going through a lot of old sentimental things like cards, clothes, toys, and relationship things. I plan on keeping one tote for childhood toys but no more than that. I have alot and it's very hard, but I'm managing to do that. A lot of old clothes I'm donating and recycling a lot of electronics and cords I know I won't need.

The question I have right now is, I have a full tote of game cases (no disc's). These cases are from pc Sims games, to ps2 thrillville and even hitman. I have roughly 50 cases but I'm unsure what to do with them. In reality they are a waste of space because it's just plastic and paper, but there is some sort of sentimental but also a valuable thing for me about having the cases.

Second question is I have a box full of old relationship things. I was with a girl from 2012 to 2016 but we broke off. I'm already in a relationship with someone else and it's been a year. I'm not sure what I should do. I've moved on but it's just something I don't know if I want to get rid of because of the memories. What do you think? ",16Jul2018,2
177,"I know this question is kinda idiotic and I know the gig is going to be great, but there's some  aspects to it. For context, I'm a 18 y/o male who likes all kinds of rock, but especially hard rock.

So tonight, Guns are playing in Tallinn, Estonia. I want to go, but there's some setbacks.

I'm not a big Guns n Roses fan, I just like a few of their songs and it would be nice to see Axl and Slash going at it. However a big portion of their setlist are some covers I've never heard of, and I don't really like their ballads either.

First of all, I don't happen to have a car right now, which means I got to take an hour long bus ride there and maybe back as well. It's between my workdays, so I'd miss all the supporting acts, who seem pretty cool.
I would have to spend the night at my sister's place and get on a bus at 6 in the morning. I'd get back at 7, maybe sleep an hour and then go to work. Can't imagine I'd be very efficient at my job the next day.

Secondly, the biggest problem is that I have no friends with whom to go there. None of my closer friends are that big of a rock fans to go see them between workdays. One of my classmates is going with his father and brother, and he actually invited me to go with him, but he was pretty drunk at the time so I don't think it was that sincere. My aunt and cousin are going, but I don't think I'd want to go with them. I imagine it would be a bit awkward and I couldn't drink then.

Lastly, money is not a huge problem, but keep in mind, I'm a student who only works during the summer holidays for about a month. So I could invest the ticket money, about 100$, in my hobby for example (electric guitar, I could buy a new pickup)

Again, I know it's hard to give advice just based on this, but any reply is welcome.

Recently I've hit a severe slump in my life. I'm unmotivated , lazy and just completely disconnected from life. I'm honestly just going through the motions. Im not studying well , I haven't been consistently working out (which is something I normally enjoy) and even if I do , I have to force myself. All I do once I get home is lay on my bed and if my mum and dad see me , I just pretend I'm studying. My parents try and motivate me and appreciate me for everything that I do ( I get work done around the house) , but if I forget to do one thing , my mum just annoys the living f*ck out of me. Their form of motivation consists of trying to belittle me hoping I'll do better which is utter bullshit and just hurts me. While I'm friendly with everyone , I don't have anyone I'd genuinely call as a friend. I don't really do anything else nowadays as far as activities are concerned because I'm in *12th grade* (Parents , exams etc etc)

 I don't know what to do. I'm afraid that I won't reach anywhere in life and accomplish my goals. I have an exam coming up and while I want to study for it and score good marks , I just can't get myself to do it. I want to pursue my career and become successfull. But right now my mind and body are just completely disconnected. I just don't know what I'm doing. I don't tell anyone about it other than my math tutor who is the only person who gives me advice and believes in me. He's like a brother to me and one of the only people I trust. But recently , as I didn't complete my daily homework , he told me that , if I continue this way ,he would stop coming as it isnt helping  me and  would be a waste of my parent's money. He constantly asks me what my problem is so the he can give advice but I don't know what it is. This shocked me a bit and even he said that he never thought it would come to a situation like this.

183,"Last night I had a party with my closest friends, we went out drinking and my sober friend drove me and my drunk friend back to my place. When my sober friend left and I got my drunk friend to bed in my guest bedroom, I myself, went to lay down in my bedroom because I was extremely intoxicated.

I remember laying down and woke up to a text message. At this point, I thought I was dreaming (I dream a lot and in color, the dreams that feel real and you don't notice they are a dream until you wake up). The message was from a male co-worker (I'm female). This particular co-worker would randomly come over after work sometimes and we would just casually discuss conspiracy theories, politics, current events, etc. No funny business. He text me and asked me what I was up to and I told him I just got home and I was ""drunk as shit"" were my exact words. I reiterated how drunk I was a few times. He tells me when my friend falls asleep, he's going to come by and say hey.

After that, I don't remember meeting him at my door, but apparently I unlocked my door and let him in. From there I remember he suggested we go to my bedroom because my living room was right next to the bedroom my friend was sleeping in. When we got to my bedroom, all I remember is that I basically stumbled and fell face first into my bed (I had on my pajamas at this point). He starts rubbing my back. Remember, I still think I'm dreaming. From there I kind of blackout again and wake up to him pulling my shorts and underwear down and then him inserting his penis into me. I don't remember what happened next or how much time went by, just that he stopped and said he couldn't do this, it was wrong and he felt guilty for doing this to me and cheating on his wife.

I don't remember him leaving or me getting back into bed, I know I had to have let him out because my door was locked in the morning, and there was no way he could have locked it from outside.

Wake up in the morning feeling extremely hungover, do my routine and go to work. When I get to work, he won't make eye contact with me and was avoiding me all together (which is unusual for him). That's when I start to remember my ""dream"" and get curious and start going through my text messages. Low and behold, I didn't dream this, it actually happened and I started freaking out at work once I realized I was sexually assaulted.

I only told one close friend about it and they called it rape but I'm not sure if it is classified as rape or sexual asssult. I really don't know what to do either because, as I was reading the messages he sent afterwards, he kept apologizing to me and saying that he feels guilty and for some reason, my extremely intoxicated self replied to him that everything was ok. He stated that he hoped when I became sober that I wouldn't hate him, and my drunk self told him I wouldn't hate him and that everything is going to be ok.

I really don't know what to do because, what's really messed up is that his wife's cousin is my best friend, who just so happened to be my friend that was sleeping in my guest bedroom during the time this all happened. I don't want to destroy his family, I don't want to potentially ruin my friendship with my best friend, I'm stuck. Please help me.",16Jul2018,1

186,"Reddit, I am in a pickle and I'm not sure how to proceed.

First, have some background;

During my last year of college in 2017 I was helping the IT-Technician at school, helping him fix computers and in general support with him when things got overwhelming. We became pretty good friends over time, and he informed me that he found a job with better pay, and that if I wanted to, he would recommend me to his boss (the principal) that I can take over, with an additional person.

I agreed of course. I had some plans on studying, but wasnt all that excited about it. Just wanted to move out and start living ""for real"". 

The principal took the 3 recommendations given by IT-Technician, and decided that me and a person with some more experience should take over. The deal was, that the guy with more experience would have a full-time job, meanwhile I would only work part-time, with the possibility of full-time in the future.

This all happened last summer, and I was very clear with the principal (now my boss) that I want that full-time job, and that they HAVE TO give it to me, if they want things to run smoothly.

Sometime during novermber I got more hours, meaning more money, but was still not working at full time. I told my boss that I would like to be working full-time by the summer of 2018, otherwise I might have to reconsider working there, as I am not making enough to be able to move out.

Summer came, and my boss said he is doing his best to get the funds to be able to assign me the full-time job, but he isnt there quite yet.

Now, onto the problem.

I want to move out from my current place of residence. I live in a 3-room apartment with a total of 5 people + a dog, which as you can imagine, is pretty damn crowded. With the current salary that I have, even combined with the salary of my SO (works part-time until september, then she will be working full-time), we cannot afford our own place. 

If I do get full-time by the end of the year, I will still be making way less money than I should be with one year of experience, which I am planning to talk about with my boss.

Here's where I need the help of the collective mindhive of reddit.

Right now, I see 3 options:

1. Ask my boss for full-time AND a raise and hope he doesnt fire me/hope he can deliver that by the end of the year at the latest

2. Wait until I get full-time, and THEN talk about my salary increase, which will most likely not be until December.

3. Quit and get a job that pays me well enough (the previous IT-Tech said they have openings at his work, so he could give in a good word for me, but this job requires much more IT-knowledge than I have at this moment).


So Reddit, tips and tricks? What do?",16Jul2018,1
188,"At the beginning of the year I got into an IT apprenticeship, which I have been going to one day a week and school for 4 days instead of the 5, which was good at the start, because I hated school and it also gave me an excuse to be lazy with schoolwork, but now I have grown to hate it. I hate everything about it except the little money I get ($8/hr) and the excuse from schoolwork. I honestly want to just drop it and go back to school 5 days a week but there are a few things keeping from that:

1. My weekend job is at the same place, if I drop the apprenticeship I'll most likely lose this job

189,"I'm 19, and I want to get my drivers license. That's pretty much the goal at this point.

For 7 months I worked with my brother working 12 hour shifts for 12 dollars an hour. I made pretty good money, especially for my first job. I currently hold 3,000 dollars in my possession from not spending. I want to use this money to make car payments, but I am not going to do so until I know someone can teach me how to drive.

3 months ago, I quit my job because we moved away because our landlords wanted to sell the house, and I walked there. My brother lived at home, but upon being told that we were going to move out he decided to find his own place. During his search he asked me if I wanted to be his roommate because I am reliable, but the place he was looking at fell through and he went to go live with some friends. So he still works at this place.

I quit way prematurely by accident, because my parents told me that we were moving out by the beginning of May, at which that didn't happen until the middle of June. This was frustrating, I had no idea whether to ask for my job back or not because I had no time frame at which we are moving.

Now, my brother had moved again to another place that's 15 minutes from work, and has a guest room, which he talked to me about getting another roommate eventually, which he wanted someone who isn't a shit roommate, but for now he wants to enjoy living on his own with his girlfriend.

Upon hearing this I decided that I can make a decision.

Stay where I am at, find a job and very slowly work on getting a driver's license, as my parents are busy and lazy.

Ask my brother if I can go stay with him, return to my old job with him making good money and getting him to teach me how to drive on our days off. Which would get the job done significantly faster than having my parents do so.

I feel like I can accomplish a lot more with my brother, not only would he be more reliable, it would motivate to get more done.

I'm obviously leaning towards my brother, but I don't know, it just seems weird to me to have sat around for several months to move, and finally get here, to go back to my old job.

I haven't told anyone about this, but I'd have to ask what my brother thinks and contact my old job to see if I can return, but otherwise nothing is really holding me back from doing such.",16Jul2018,1

So I have my final year school formal coming in just over 2 weeks, I went alone for the formal last year which was the semi, however I didn't really bother asking anyone so it was a bit of a different case and I really enjoyed it, although this year I started to talk with an old school friend and asked if she would go, she said yes luckily and organised to meet basically for the first time in 8 years ago, just yesterday, we went to watch a movie &amp; honestly it was pretty awkward overall (my own doing) I mean there wasn't any long periods of silence or anything it's more like some of the stuff I said didn't make sense at all and I keep stressing over it. I have ASD (aspergers) also so really doesn't help with social situations, I'm not really sure if I ruined anything at all but in the end she asked me if she wanted to organise something for another time before the formal which was I guess was a pretty good end to it. We did ask quite a few questions about each other throughout it but I can't help but always thinking about things I could've asked to know a bit more, as I think it wasn't enough.

About maybe 2h after I ended up asking if she wanted to head to a gaming lounge with another friend of mine and who he was taking to the formal also, which was a really dumb move on my behalf as she told me she doesn't really game (which I do quite often) and the lounge isn't just going to give out game accounts so I said we could organise something else instead, that was last night and so far she hasn't replied back which is how I'm starting to think I might of come off too awkward.

The thing is she seems to be really outgoing/finds it much easier to talk to people then I do (I mean alot) so if I was to take her to formal I would have massive anxiety over all the potential things I could do to embarrass myself, etc, it's hard to explain what goes on in my head...

I'm asking you guys, what should I do, have I messed up? Do I just need to wait a while? I'm not sure if she's just busy but generally it does take a while for her to respond when I ask about things (meeting up at places, etc), but then at other times she actually wants to make conversation and sends messages to me first...

I don't know, I would just really like your advice on how I can improve speaking and making conversation in general because I am completely fine when it's just conversation with friends and people I don't know at my school. To add on to that, I'm year 12 and this is basically one of the first times I've ever actually done something with a girl, so yeah bit of a dilemma...

I know I can't just ignore her if she was to reply back when the formal was to come around just because I'm socially inept, although I would've liked to go alone also at the same time this girl is a really nice person and I'd like to talk again more.

But I have a thyroid issue an need to get blook taken quite often. I just made an appointment and expected it to be in two months or so, but they gave me one for next week. GUYS, I'M SHITTING MY PANTS I'M SO SCARED! :( 
it's super hard to get blood from me anyway (small thin girl with super low blood pressure/not much blood in my body to begin with), and they try for several times, and IF they manage to get some, I struggle the whole day to get back home: I faint often immediately, wait half an hour in the office, try to get home when I feel like I'm good, get dizzy again..it's really hard. I usually don't want my friends or so to come with me because it's really embarassing. 

How do I get over this stupid thing? I got over so much in my life and nothing ever scares, but THIS?? Damn. 
I don't really want to start therapy or so. I just want to handle this little thing like a proper grown up! ",16Jul2018,1

205,"Just to preface I'm a 17 year old male.

So I recently went to a party at a friends house, many of my friends were there and a majority of us were drinking (including myself). One of the attendees was a friend of multiple friends of mine who we'll call Emma. Emma and I have barely ever spoken to one another despite the fact that we have many mutual friends.

At some point during the night we struck up a conversation and we hung out with each other for the rest of the night. Eventually we began lying down next to each other and I had my arm around her. She started saying to my friends, ""I love qwerxoid"" and other things that gave the impression that she was in to me.

While I thought this strange seeing as we barely knew each other I originally attributed it to her being slightly drunk. However, the way and context in which she said it made be rethink this, as she seemed calm when doing so. She eventually kissed me on the cheek but nothing more became of it. One of my friends was telling me that i should hook up with her but I dismissed that as she was drunk.

Thinking back on the night the next morning I found it incredibly odd that this girl who I'd barely spoken to showed such an interest in me. Flash forward a week to school and we haven't spoken since. I have noticed her glancing at me but I don't know if I should talk to her as I'm afraid it'll be too awkward. I've thought about it and I genuinely like her and would like to spend more time with her but I don't know what to do.",16Jul2018,1

So while this is our spring break and that doesn't seem very far away, I work a very draining job in a warehouse North of Dallas. I work 7 to 3 most days and occasionally even more earlier so i can work overtime. So after my 45 minute commute there and back, by the time 3 pm comes around I just want to sleep.

I also however really want to see her. At the moment we see each other or have a date about once a week. So while this is better than not seeing each other at all it does make it difficult for me. If it wasn't for Smart phones, I don't know how I would maintain this relationship! 

To make this situation more difficult... She is a year older than me. This means she is heading out for college in Idaho in September. We are kind of living in the moment right now, and we've acknowledge that she will be gone for a while, but not much other than that.

So how can I cope with not seeing her often? I feel that working through these emotions is worth it, rather than just ending the relationship. She is one of the best things to happen to me.

217,"I am a 15 year old female who works as a professional lifeguard. The company states that the work attire required is to wear a black one piece swimsuit and the provided lifeguard shirts into the pool complex. Once inside we are still required to wear the swimsuit, but the shirt is optional. We are allowed to also wear black athletic shorts, but it’s an optional decision, not required.

My father noticed yesterday that I don’t wear the shorts while i’m working and is now requiring me to wear them by threatening to not let me work. 

I feel this is unreasonable as I wear a normal black one piece suit (which isn’t overly revealing by any means) and its part of the allowed dress code. Everyone else in my work, including the managers and owners, tend to only wear the swimsuits, and not shorts.

We have no religious reasons for covering skin. Also, it’s uncomfortable to wear them as I often get wet at work and the shorts don’t allow my suit underneath to dry. Similarly, it feels unhygienic to sit in a wet swimsuit/shorts for up to 12 hours at a time in the heat.

What can I do to convince my father that I don’t need to wear the shorts and that he’s being unreasonable?

She has been working as an editor for the last 3 years and currently working with one of the big 5 publishers full-time. However, she is bored of the job and wants to venture into new fields. 

Her educational background: She has a bachelor's in English literature and a Masters in linguistics. 

Her interests: She generally likes things that involve logic. Think coding and related fields. She hates 9-5. She would rather stab herself than work in a 9-5 job for another year. She also likes to write and has won a small writing content last year. 

The problem: There are three main problems- a. She cannot decide what she wants to do, since she wants to do everything at once. b. She does not have a lot of savings and she is not very comfortable asking her parents for help or taking out a loan. c. She thinks it is too late to pick up a new skill or jump into an entirely new field. 

Here's what I am seeking from the people here:

How can I convince her to take a calculated risk and make her understand that she still has a lot of time to do things she wants to do?

2. **he asked if i've had a boyfriend**

6. **he sends me memes privately hours after a conversation and says ""this reminds me of you"" (more of a sign of a friendship tho**)

They wouldn't let me work in high school because i didnt have good grades so they wanted me to focus. They never made me do chores or anything for that matter. They bought me cigarettes regularly since i was about 15. (2 years tobacco free July 1st!) 
 When mom was around she never instilled any real values in me. I handpicked some good ones.. Like respect, cleanliness, friendliness. 
  In short if Granny wasn't caring for me financially, a spouse was. I'm not a totally useless human, I promise. When I do work, I work well, and hard. I've just always had a problem staying at a job more than a couple months but ive also never had to pay for anything really like rent, or a car payment. 

Well my partner has some money saved up, about 1200 and adding 100 weekly. This is for emergencies should anything happen, and if it's still there when we find a place that will take us w our dog.. Its going to be our moving fund. 

She has a really great job, and we've decided that I should also come work there. I'm really excited about this and I'm preparing myself mentally for a long-term job. With this money we will be able to move out sooner and we can up the budget a tad so our options arent so limited. I'm just scared that I'm going to pull a ""me"" and fuck up somehow and want to stay home instead..?

And to me that sounds so stupid but that's what happens usually! I'm not sure what's led me to make those bad dexisions, I just know that I don't want to be that person anymore! 
I want to make money, and get insurance and contribute to society. 

Babysitting is the job ive held down longest. Key to this though is that theyre my friends kids so I love them already and like to teach them and its great but never enough money. Nor are the preschool teacher jobs around here. 

My question is, what did you do to make the transition from never holding a job down to working everyday? 
How do I make it through a work day without trying to find ways to go home? 
How do I grow up?

She left for a month in May for a military job, it didn't work out and she came home a month later. I understand she may feel pressured from the 'failure' but I've been nothing but supportive. I don't make her talk about it if she doesn't want to, I've even helped get her enrolled in school. 

I pay for 100% of everything for us and it requires me to work 60 hours a week to afford our lives. I'm totally ok with killing myself at work and seeing her a couple hours a night because it makes her happy. I spend my weekends with her at the beach, dog park, road trips, pay for her to go out with her girls,  you name it. At the end of the day all I need to get up and push hard the next day is some appreciation. 

We are always friendly, playful, and flirty but at the end of the day that's all. I haven't been kissed like it matters all year let alone the intimacy only occurs when I mention it and then, feels awkward and unnatural. I've never hit her, verbally abused her, or anything. Why do I feel like I give 150% all day for nothing? I think it would be easier to live alone sometimes because the only thing she could do for me that I can't do myself is have sex which she never does. 

Maybe I'm rambling but it literally takes 10 minutes to blow me so even if you aren't into sex is it that hard to throw me a bone? Have I not earned your respect or appreciation? What else can I possibly do? 

Also, I'm not in bad shape at all, I'm 6' tall 165lbs and thin and I put 150% into the few fleeting moments she gives me in bed as well and she's never left hanging.


Personal confession, I also watch porn most days, not to masturbate to, but to get me excited and horny on the off chance she wants to play I can cum faster so she doesnt have to spend too much time with me. I'd love to masturbate to take the edge off but I'm afraid that the moment I do she'll want to have sex and I won't be prepared/willing and having been rejected so much I dont want her to feel that way.

Somebody please help, I love her but this isn't fair, yes, we've had this exact conversation and it usually ends up in me getting laid that day.

Finally made it over to his house yesterday, and he spent about 5 hours (chatty) telling me in's and out's and loading his RetroPie image onto a microSD card for me. Tested out build together, and all is great.

I continually asked him if I could ""bring"" him anything (snacks, a bottle of whisky, etc), and he conceded I could bring donuts for his kids. He also kept a cord I didn't need that could provide a safe shutdown for his Plex Media Server (my kit already had a safe shutdown included). But otherwise said he didn't need anything.

243,"I'm a 16m 17 soon. Me and my girlfriend have been together into a few months now. I've known her for a few years we were friends and then hooked up. This girl I'm so skeptical about since the start and I don't know wether or not I should trust her. 

She has a very bad background and a very shitty past. She used to be heavy into drugs, was pretty much a hoe cheated ALOT, hung out with older guys talking between 18 and 30, even dated one or 2 as a 15 year old, used to lie and cheat on her old boyfriends. 

She said she's changed and she hates the person she used to be, and she doesn't wanna do that to me. I've already had 4 times with her where we got into a fight because she was talking to another guy, she stop talking to all of them for me as far as I know. 

I love this girl she's awesome, but I can't get over the person she used to be. All I can think about is what if she's just messing with me cause I'm very ugly and she gets tons of attention. Or she's lieing to me, I'm trying to accept she's changed but I cant. If we get into a fight she'll talk to other guys to piss me off more. She always turns everything around on me like it's always my fault.

246,"I’m originally from Atlanta, GA. I currently live in a small town in the Central Valley of California. My wife and I both have great careers here, but it comes with a lot of sacrifice. We are 2,600 miles from any family. We have a 9-month-old that that has really made more clear how far away we are. We are also in an area of California that isn’t close to much. It has the usual amenities, but even trying to take our kid to the aquarium or a baseball game for the day requires 4 hours of driving, more if we hit traffic. 

My job has opened up to allow me remote flexibility. I can technically work from anywhere. Moving would require that my wife find a new job, but as a teacher, she is hopeful it can come quickly. 

Our family dynamics have been interesting. Lots of arguing between our parents and us over the years. We are still on decent enough terms to visit during the holidays, but usually are drained after that. Moving to Atlanta would obviously bring us closer, but we see it as beneficial for our child as our parents are AWESOME grandparents. Also, the perks that come with living in a bigger city are a draw. 

Lastly, $$. It is cheaper to live in the heart of Atlanta than it is to live in our current small CA town. But we have to cover our own moving costs. We have a pretty decent amount of debt already with a new kid and recent house purchase in CA. I think we re-coup the house costs when we sell here but it’s still on my mind.

Hello, and welcome to a post like none other! Today I will explain to you why I’m tired of even being able to think! To start off, I have a very mature mind, so I find it difficult to enjoy a typical teenage life, or  a nearly worry free one. I will also point out that I believe I have severe self esteem issues before we begin. 

About almost a year ago, I tried to date this girl. I realized too late that she was not a good person to even be friends with. That’s the short story. But somehow, I think I gained lasting effects.  Like trust issues. She lied constantly. I have such a bad self esteem right now, I feel like everyone is better than me in every way. And it’s affecting me hard. I can’t date anyone because for some reason all that comes to mind is my self esteem. And then for some reason, I poor into how I feel inadequate and I scare them off. 

Recently, I tried to date a new girl. I have been friends for years, and we had liked each other for a while now. Things were going great until.. uh oh! Who would’ve guest it! My mind! I start telling her how I don’t really like myself and that anyone else is a better option. She was definitely uncomfortable because of how I was feeling, she told me she doesn’t like me talking bad about myself and she said we can try again in a few months. How do I know she meant this? I don’t. And it’s making me crazy. I haven’t spoken to her since, but it was only 2 days ago. I don’t know if she wants to speak to me, I don’t know if she’s thinking about me, I don’t know if she even cares about me anymore. And it’s driving me crazy. She was talking with another friend of mine and she said the only guy she wants to be with is me. But I can’t stop thinking about how what if she falls for someone else? How do I know she won’t feel the same way? I don’t! And it’s making me crazy! Everything is making me crazy!

I can’t eat, I feel sick all the time, I’m miserable, and when I try to tell a family member, they get mad at me! I feel like I’m going absolutely insane, and it needs to stop. Now. 

Someone, please give me advice on what I should do. If I should talk to her. How I can calm my mind. How I can get healthy again. I need this to end, because I’m actually suffering and I have no where else to go. ",16Jul2018,5

252,"I'll try to keep this as a brief as possible, which is hard. I really need some advice on this and am willing to reach out to online communities to get life advice here.

I had a ""friend"" (whom I have considered ditching for the past year or so) go off the rails on me over something to do with his ex. Ok, so I knew a guy, a weird guy, from way back in high school. During my high school years I didn't really know him too well. I always saw him as weird but friendly-ish. He was a serious pot-head in high school. I didn't smoke pot at all back then so we never associated too much. He is this big white guy, very rarely saw him but when I did he was very chatty and outgoing, kinda sketchy when he was younger. So, over time, as I got into my 20s I would run into him every now and again. 

As time went on I started noticing a pattern with him though. He would often have great ideas, projects (some farming related, others not) and he would try to get me in on stuff, telling me he would possibly pay me in the future. Almost all the time, I would check in with him a few weeks later and he'd have stopped doing this project and moved on to something else. Anyway, so we chilled on and off for the past 6 years or so. In my post-University years I had little social life and hanging out with him every now and then was nice (especially since I smoke often now). I'd just sometimes run into him and we'll chill. though he was always kind of off. I know from his past that he has struggled with mental health issues (I have too, esp with anxiety and depression in my youth), but I am generally open-minded and non-judgmental about stuff like that. The guy is not dumb by any stretch but not intellectual either, sometimes it's hard to have a serious talk with him about issues, for instance. Sometimes he would do odd things, like I would chill with him and we might have a plan to do something and he'd just ditch be out of nowhere to go chill with someone else or something. He would often have big plans and be involved with a business or claim to be starting one and then tell me he might be able to get me a paying job, but whenever I follow up with him he'd have moved on to something else. Flake in other words.

So, time goes on, we chill. At one point I realize he was the only semi-consistent friend I'd had (outside of work friends). My social life in the past few years since leaving Uni hasn't been that active for a number of reasons. Anyway, let me hurry up with this story. The guy is strange, sometimes he seems on top of the world and in the best mood, other times he is in the worst mood and doesn't even want to talk. He gets jobs, seems to be doing really well, making decent money, and then he always just quits abruptly, usually on one of his emotional downturns. 

So, about a year ago or so he starts dating a young woman, Let's call her Ellis (let's call him Guy). Me and her and him chill a few times and I like Ellis and start seeing her as a friend as well. She is a bit of a hippie, kind weird too but so am I so we all get along. I meet some of her friends, these dudes and I end up getting along with them too. Overtime I start chilling with these dudes, and as more time passes I end up spending more time with them than Guy.

So, one day I run into Ellis in my neighbourhood. I ask her where Guy is and she tells me he just dumped her. We talk for a while and she tells me he was going through some episode and just dumped her, after telling her they were going to move in together, a few days before they are to move-in together he just dumps her and goes back to his parent's house, kind of stranding her. This kind of goes with a pattern I am seeing this Guy. She tells me he goes through weird times and tells me not to mention this to him since me and him are buds. It kind of blows my mind why he dumps her as they seemed so happy, but that's Guy for you. During this time I contemplated dating her but I don't for 3 reasons 1) don't date your buddy's ex 2) rebound bad idea, and 3) I get the vibe that she just sees me as a friend. So I had a short-lived semi-crush on her, but it lasted like a week or two and that's it. Anyway, so time goes on and me and her chill a bunch of times with her dude friends.  I chill with her dude friends a bunch of times, they have parties, go to bars, go for hikes, one of them teaches self-defense. I get a social life. I think it kind of ironic how I was friends with Guy, became friends with his ex, and then through her I make a group of good friends and things are great.

So, Guy and I are still sort of friends. We hang out a few times and smoke, etc. One day he offers me a job doing a write-up for a business he works for. I have a feeling he will flake out but agree to do it anyway. He brags about sleeping with a bunch of girls to me which is like whatever and he tells me him and Ellis are kind of talking things over and 'might' get back together. I actually want them to get back together because I like both of them and hanging out with them is like getting 2 for 1 friends, y'know? One time I hear him yelling at someone on the phone while I am visiting him. He isn't just raising his voice but yelling, swearing, putting the person down really brutally, saying he is going to f\*\*\* another girl. I tell him that him screaming at someone on the phone while I am visiting makes me uncomfortable. I find out he was talking to Ellis just then. I grow more uncomfortable and tell him he shouldn't be talking to his girlfriend that way, he goes into a diatribe about how I never had a serious relationship and talks about how 'all girls are b\*\*\*es. I know he's having a rough time with the break-up so I just say whatever. 

Later on that night we chill with a friend of his, this other guy (call him Ishmael). Ishmael is also a writer. Guy wants Ishmael to write something up for his company as well. During a brief break Ishmael tells me he likes Guy, but finds his behaviour erratic sometimes and thinks he flakes a lot. I am relieves to hear someone else thinks this as well. He tells me, in private, that he sees Guy as a scam artist and tells me he wont write up the thing for him because he doesn't see it going anyway. I ended up writing the thing up, sending it to Guy, and lo and behold, a week later Guy tells me the company was looking for something else.

Ok, so time passes. I end up seeing Ellis one time with her friends. Ellis takes me aside and tells me not to tell Guy where she lives now (she lives with her dude friends) because she is worried that he might show up on her doorstep and harass them. This sends red flags off in my mind. I don't know the context fully regarding their relationship and I am sure there is more to it than I know, but the fact that she's telling me this makes me really start to question Guy. She tells me she doesn't think he would ever hurt her, but if he goes through a bad episode he might show up at her place. She tells me they are working things out but she constantly blocks him for months at a time, but is still in love with him, blah blah blah.

So, time passes. Guy and I drift apart and as summer rolls around I contemplate not associating with him anymore as I start seeing him less positive. Just the fact that his ex made me promise not to tell him where she lives really freaked me out. So, one day I run into Ishmael and we talk for a while. I tell him I don't know if I will chill with Guy anymore, Ishmael says he feels the same. I tell him I became friends with Ellis and her friends and chill with them more than anyone else lately. I mention that part of me wanted them to get back together because I liked both of them, and I mention (naively) that she is cool and I say, very off-handidly, something along the lines of ""hell, even I had a bit of a crush on her, but obviously wouldn't do anything"". 

About two or three weeks pass. 

Guy texts me when I am at work one day asking me to talk to him. I call him and he goes off on me, yelling that he knows I talked to Ishmael and said ""I have a crush on Ellis"" (I remember saying had, not have mind you), then starts yelling at me to stay away from her. I'm taken aback by all this. Then he goes off on me, tells me to explain myself. I try to explain it to him, and tell him that I only thought about it briefly when he dumped her but would never do anything and only saw her as my friend. He then goes on about me saying ""I hang out with her friends"" to Ishmael. So, he goes off on me. I hang up on him, text him not to contact me anymore. He goes nuts, sending me text after text of abuse, telling me I am a loser, Ellis is only nice to me because she feels sorry for me, he trusted me and I am a snake, etc. I then go on my facebook and see he is talking crap about me on facebook, saying I betrayed him (carrying on as if I cheated with her). He then sends abusive e-mails, long blocks of text, bigger than this one, going on about how I betrayed him and he hates me, semi-threatens me, makes vague threats about running into me, warns me to turn the other way if I see him. I tell him I am gonna call the cops if he doesn't stop threatening me.

I get in touch with one of Ellis' dude friends. He says Guy started harassing me as well. I find out he's been harassing pretty much everyone online, including other mutual friends, insulting people. I get in touch with Ellis. She says he's doing the same and tells me to ignore him, not to take it personal, he's not in the right state of mind. She tells me she heard he is abusing over the counter drugs and is going off on everyone. I don't know if he is abusing everyone equally, and I wonder if him finding out what I said caused him to start abusing drugs. Apparently he has substance abuse issues, far more serious than weed. I find out other people have called the police on him. I got mixed feelings about Ellis at this point and I wonder, as time has passed since, why she would ever put up with this. I tell her Guy and I are done permanently, even if Guy ends up apologizing I can't go back to ever being friends with him after this. She says ""fair enough"" but kind of insinuates that she might continue speaking with him later on when he is through this episode.

(who puts up with that?) Time goes by, I don't hear from him. The last thing he told me was ""this is a life lesson, don't go talking sh\*\* about your friend's wife, you lost a friend today"".  Part of me is relieved that I am finally done with him since I was planning to cut him off anyway. I am debating whether to stay friends with Ellis or cut her off too. Some people I've spoken to say to cut her off, some say cut all the dudes off just because if I chill with them (and her) news might get back to Guy and, even if he is in a good place at the time, I have no guarantee that he wont go through a bad time again and go off on me.

254,"It's kind of a complicated tale, so bear with me.

I've had kind of a rough time of things over the past decade or so, starting with an intense bipolar break around 2008 and continuing on through self-medication, job loss, a divorce, several moves across the country and trips to rehab.

That said, I got my medication in order in CA, eventually I was able to set down the bottle and get my life in a little bit or order. I've been working with my ex-wife to help her build her business, which has been great but it kind of put my plans on hold.

Once she was set up, I decided to go on a search for what I wanted to do with my life. I spent a while staying with friends in LA and going to parties. It wasn't really my thing, so I found a place in Temecula, a horse ranch, where I could work for a while and kind of clear my head. I also wrote a novel and had editing to do, so I figured that would be a quiet place to work.

Well, I worked my ass off, learned a lot about horses, got my novel edited, and actually became a pretty good camp cook. I was planning to go to a Buddhist temple next, just to work and continue my thinking process. However, life is always subject to the blind will of the Great Magnet, and one night around the campfire, one of my co-workers had a little too much tequila, and in a fit of high spirits, lovingly tackled me into a gulch and broke my ankle in 3 places.

Ah, life. 

So I was on my ass for the past two and a half months, on my ex-wife's couch, who was frankly getting a little sick of me being around. So I used the last of my savings to fly out NC to visit my parents.

(Meanwhile, to make matters worse (or better, I guess) I met someone in LA. A girl who is fast becoming my soul mate even though we've only had a short time to spend together.)

So now I'm only fairly mobile, I've got a winning smile, what I think might be a staph infection from one of the pins in my ankle, and I have to figure out how I can raise enough money to get back to LA, survive long enough to get a job driving Lyft, and meet back up with Melina, who has an amazing smile and smells like berries.

So, the advice. What can I do, really and immediately, to get some scratch together? I don't care what it is. I'd dig ditches if I thought my ankle would support it. I'm already signed up to freelance places: I'm a pretty good designer but those places are so awash with cheap labor it's really tough to get started. 

Data entry? Design? Video editing? My skill set is limited to what I can do off my feet but it's fairly broad.

Any help would be hot.

Thanks in advance.

I’ve had problems with a coworker— nothing major, just little annoying digs— but one issue is getting pretty bad. No matter what we talk about, in what context, it always seems to cycle back to her being sexually assaulted. It’s a horrific act, I know, life changing and can be all consuming. I had been assaulted in the past too. But when we’re at work, trying to code and look at spreadsheets and do work, constantly talking about rape feels like a shock or a big slap in the face. It’s a combo of me not wanting to think about my own experiences, not wanting to be her therapist, and it making it much more difficult to get back into the zone of working. It isn’t aimed directly at me, but when you have a tiny team and she says it to the group it hits everyone. But there’s no way you can say “stop talking about being raped, I’m trying to work.” I have no idea what to do. So far I just kind of awkwardly ignore it and try to keep working.

257,"I'm 22, female (my name is an alias don't let it fool you) and I developed a serious drinking problem completely out of nowhere. I can't exactly remember when it started but I found myself drinking alcohol daily, I didn't want to go out with friends unless I could drink, I have severe memory problems, gained about 10kg , I stopped going to work so I could drink and sometimes even showed up to work slightly drunk. The worst of it has struck within the past month where I threw up all over a friends bed and ruined their sheets and brand new expensive clothing and then a separate time dislocated my knee really badly tripping over myself. I'm still recovering from the dislocated knee, I spent about a week heavily depressed because I couldn't walk and I knew exactly what the root cause of it all was. 

Eventually my goal is to drink in moderation but at this point it's day 4 and I haven't had a drop of alcohol. However I do know there will be times where it's going to be hard to say no (I've already started having cravings)

260,"Hey guys, this is my first advice post so please bear with me. I started dating the most amazing girl I’ve ever met about nine months ago. In that time, we’ve learned a lot about each other and I fell more and more in love with her. However, it quickly became clear that her home life was causing her severe anxiety and depression, to the point of self harm in her past. She comes from a single mother who does not know how to parent. My girlfriend (let’s call her Amelia) and her mom (let’s call her Susan) have an extremely toxic relationship. Here are just a few of the abusive behaviors I’ve seen while at their house. 

Susan says “Can you use your brain yet?” during Maggie’s panic attacks

Never cleans the house to the point of hygiene problems

Tells Amelia she pushes everyone away and makes them leave

Constantly tells Amelia she’s not doing enough for me or showing me any love

Tells Amelia that she’s just “hard on her” because she just wants her to be better and for her to not make me leave her. 

Sides with anyone else over Amelia

Lies on the couch watching tv all day (I cleaned the backyard, and set up a home gym for her. Neither is used.)

Tells Amelia nobody will want to live with her because of her disgusting habits 

Susan complains about her knee, weight, heartburn, headaches, legs, anxiety, etc. while any time that Amelia has a medical problem, it is just considered Amelia being dramatic. (Exercise would definitely improve every aspect of her health, but even after setting up a comprehensive home gym for her, she has never used it. Meanwhile, Amelia needs her wisdom teeth out, has severe anxiety and depression, and a past boyfriend dislocated her kneecap)

Amelia attempts to talk about how the family makes her feel and try to get support from her mother, but instead Susan turns the conversation into how the family makes HER feel. 

Doesn’t brush her teeth or shower, sometimes for days. Oftentimes then forces Amelia to come embrace her as “lovin’s”

Doesn’t clean the litter box or do dishes

Any time Amelia tries to even imply that she’s unhappy, Susan freaks out and starts apologizing filled with crocodile tears and guilts Amelia into saying that Susan’s not doing anything wrong. 

Makes repeated “jokes” about how useless and worthless Amelia is, but if Amelia doesn’t like it/ignores her she yells that she’s joking and sulks until she’s comforted. 

Tries to inject herself into every relationship Amelia has. (Professional and personal)

Deliberately sabotages Amelia (oh, just don’t do this assignment. Oh, just call in sick, you don’t have to be there)

Denies Amelia the ability to get a job

Controls every financial aspect of Amelia’s life in order to keep power over her. However, because she’s so bad with money, this leads to Amelia not having necessary payments, such as tuition or car fees. 

Demands 24/7 attention. When Amelia is home, she’s expected to sit in the living room with her, watching tv all day. When Amelia is not at the house, she texts her constantly and gets angry if she is not texted back immediately. 

Gets pets for Amelia and then “jokes” about getting rid of them

Susan refuses to get a job, will stop applying after one rejection. 

If Amelia starts crying then Susan gets angry and tells her “don’t you dare” and sulks/ whines until she stops. 

Tells Amelia she is going to move and leave Amelia behind. 

Has their phones synced so that any new contact, app, or call goes into hers as well. 

Yells for Amelia and won’t stop until she comes to appease her with whatever it is she wants. 

Holds everything she’s done for Amelia (almost exclusively financial) as leverage for Amelia to do things for her. 

Holds everything Amelia does “wrong” over her head in order to reinforce how useless she is and how much she needs Susan. 

Will moan and sulk about how nobody likes her until Amelia comforts her. 

Will tell Amelia that I’ve found someone else when I’m not with them.  

Susan will become extremely suspicious and whine about how Amelia doesn’t want to spend time with her if Amelia  decides she wants to do anything on her own (i.e.: if we want to just go up to the town that I live in). 

Will be suspicious and interrogate us if she thinks we aren’t acting the way that she likes. (Always assumes it’s because of something that Amelia did that’s going to end the relationship)

The worst part is that Susan is so unpredictable. It’s impossible to know what will set her off. 

As we get close to the house, I feel all of Amelias muscles tense up and her shrink into herself. 

To make matters worse, Amelia has a brother (17) with Down’s syndrome who also lives in the house. If she tries to leave this situation, Susan will undoubtedly use this as leverage to guilt her. I have convinced Amelia to get counseling, but she’s waiting until she moves back into my town for school in August (in an apartment her mother pays for). 

Sorry for the long post, I just don’t know where to turn and the situation is really complicated.

Well it turns out that Daisy had to cancel due to work obligations or something to that effect. Because the name on the ticket was Daisy she can use is as a credit under her name but she cannot transfer the cost of the ticket back to Pauline as it is the policy of the airlines, no way around that. The cost of the flight was equivalent to $350 CAD.

270,"My school is known for Greek life, but I didn't think it was for me so I didn't rush as a freshman. I now want to as a sophomore, but my parents don't want me to because they think I'll just drink and party. My parents are very against drinking in general, not even underage drinking in particular.

First of all, I partied hard my freshman year. I regret it. Is my GPA bad? No. Could it have been better? For sure. My parents obviously don't know this, and it's not something I would ever tell them. But because I partied hard as a freshman, I know I won't as a sophomore, because it's not something I would like to repeat. My school also has deferred rush, so I'd only be with upperclassmen who are also more likely to be over the initial freshman partying high. Even if I didn't rush, I could still party hard. This is their biggest qualm with Greek life but it's a nonissue with me, but I can't exactly reveal that to them.

I mainly want to join a sorority for the connections and sisterhood, which I've expressed to them, but they still think sororities are glorified drinking clubs. Even if they're right, Greek culture at my school is pretty different than it is at the stereotypical southern public schools, especially because our administration cracks down on it a lot.

I'd join without their permission, but I'd need their help to pay for it. I know what you're thinking- pay for it yourself. Which I'm trying to, but sorority fees can be as much as 3k per semester at my school. I have 1k saved up, and if I work around 10-12 hours a week I probably wouldn't make more than an additional 1k per semester. I'd work more, but I have an stipend based internship that doesn't cash out until the end of the school year, not semester. I don't want to work a 20 hr/wk job + 10 hr/wk internship, as my school work would definitely be compromised. Something I'm considering is asking them to help me cover the costs of the first semester, and if I don't get good grades because ""I'm partying too hard"", I'll drop the sorority, but I'm unsure how they'll take it.

271,"Hey for a while now I have had sort of a problem with my very close friend group,

We have known each other for about 1½ years now and I know that's not that long but due to all of use talking online we have spend basically every day together since all of us don't do much outside of being on the pc. They are very important to me and obviously I want to maintain the friendship. 

For a while now things have just felt off. I just don't feel valued anymore is the best way to put it. Very often I am the odd one out that people like to argue against, the butt of their jokes or just made fun off. A lot of the times when I want to talk about things I care about I am just shut down. Were all very creative people and just like to ask each other for feedback on our work and mine is just often disregarded. I very much feels like they are talking down to me a lot of the time or don't see me as an equal/friend anymore (doesn't really help that I am the youngest). Maybe I am imagining a bit to much or they just see the stuff they do as harmless but its a problem for me. I don't know wether to talk to them about it, I don't wanna offend them or burn some bridges on accident. I still enjoy talking to them but I feel more and more like an outsider rather than a close friend.

Anyone got any advice on what I should do? Maybe a tip to approach them about it? Or am I just being to sensitive? As I said I dont wanna fuck up our friendship because I imagine something that isnt even there,

272,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible!

I am currently a PhD student in Biostatistics, but I am pretty certain (\~ 80&amp;#37; sure) that I'm going to fail my qualifying exam next week (this is not self-deprecating - I'm just being honest). I will most likely not receive my results for another month, so if I take the exam, I won't know if I've passed or failed until mid- to late August.

In the unlikely event I take the exam and pass, I would continue to receive funding and health insurance and be able to finish my degree.

There is an opportunity for me to take an ""exit"" without attempting the exam - the Director of Graduate Studies for the Master's program in my department has offered me a spot in their program for the Fall semester, but I would have to pay tuition and fees for that semester (\~ $19,000). My husband and I think we'd be able to pay for a big enough chunk out-of-pocket so that our loans would come out to &lt; $10,000, which we think we'd be able to pay off within a year given his salary (if I find a job quickly, it could be paid off even sooner). If everything goes as planned, I'd finish the requirements for the Master's degree in one semester and graduate in December.

These are my concerns:  
1. I am unsure which looks worse: taking the exam and failing, or matriculating into the Master's program before           
trying the exam (I think this would kind of look like I gave up). The reason I care is because I will need reference letters   
for either future grad school and/or job applications.  
2. Finishing the Master's Degree is contingent upon me completing a thesis. If I take the exam, fail, and then   
matriculate into the Master's program, I will have shortchanged myself out of a month that I could have been working   
on my thesis.  
3. On the flip side, if I don't take the exam, I may miss an opportunity to continue my degree and save   
my hubs and I from a financial headache.

With those in mind, here is my question:

\- Should I give the exam a try, or should I matriculate into the Master's program without taking the exam?

I’ve always been quite introverted and content with spending a decent amount of time on my own.  However, it seems I haven’t been feeding enough of my social needs and I’m beginning to get worried I don’t have anywhere to fill these needs.

I’m currently living in the city of a neighboring state from where I grew up and still have a small friend circle back home, however I’ve felt disconnected from them for a long time (has been 5+ years since I lived in my hometown).  My coworkers are all significantly older than I am so it seems difficult to relate on personal levels with them.  I do have a couple roommates, but I don’t seem to fit in with them or their friend group either.

I’ve wanted to get out and meet people more, but it’s always been difficult for my introverted personality to meet new people without at least someone else to walk into new places with.  I figure I’ll eventually just run into people who will expand my network and be more likely to find somewhere to call home, but it’s been a few years and feeling more lonely as time passes.

283,"TL;DR: I am friends and live with a person who is very serious and it's grinding at times. They live by ""word is worth"" and they are always on a defensive and don't take it easy.  I just want to know what you have done in situations with such serious people and what would you suggest?

The kind of serious person I describe is someone who lives by the term ""Word is your worth."" I understand keeping your word and doing what you say is an admirable thing in today's world. But, we are all human and bound to mess up and be fickle at times. This person seems to have grown to detest such people who can't seem to be like him and do what they claim, though he himself doesn't do this all the time (more like 8/10 times he'll keep to what he says).

The event that spark this whole question was a simple thing, which I'll provide you in order so it makes some sense. He did not request or ask me if he could plug in some of his devices into my room so that he could use to have a better experience in his room (modem / router in my room and we have deplorable wifi signal). I didn't say anything about it since he's a friend and I try to be nice and let him have some fun. The next day I decide to get a new router, and to plug it in. I unplug his device, so there's no interference with the new one I bought. When returning, he blows up on me for touching his things.

I don't point out the fact that he didn't request permission to plug his device in, as this person has become very skillful in verbal manipulation. With his strong and serious demeanor he has caused most confrontation he is in to his favor and the other person is usually in silence. due to his skill. I already knew from experience with others that no matter what facts I point out, he would turn it around to favor his point of view.

How do you deal with such serious people who can't seem to relax or constantly look at things from a serious perspective, as if everything is attacking them and if it's not spoken or written and agreed upon, then it means nothing?

So I didn’t want to bother the people in the legal advice subreddit since I’ve already found the information I needed (where to file paperwork and whatnot). But I still wanted advice from people who have gotten a restraining order and how it worked out for them. I have a lot of screenshots, at least two people to back me up (SO, who would be going under the order with me and his landlord who has an unfortunate front row seat to a lot of this nonsense) and I could have a third if my SOs sisters ex husband would be willing to help us. She’s stalked, threatened with violence, harassed, manipulated and even hacked SOs social media to try and get us to break up. 

She is currently out on bail/bond from what we know. She is on meth and/or heroin. Her mother actually called the cops on her for meth, and told SO this in person. And apologized for her daughters psycho behavior. But someone bailed her out and she’s been upping the threats and crazy against me. She’s dead set on cracking my skull claiming that “it’s only jail time if jaw is broken” (direct quote) and at this point I’m reasonably sure she wants to kill me, not beat me up. The police here say that they can’t do anything unless they catch her on the property, but there is currently a warrant out for her as of last Saturday because (the cop wasn’t treating us like a couple of children and seemed to take us seriously this time) they’re interested in why she keeps showing up. 
( I can put a full compilation of everything she’s done to date in the comments, but that would make this post SO long) 

This has made it hard for me to sleep. I’m constantly nervous and I feel sick a lot of the time. I don’t eat until I’m doubling over from stomach cramps because I’m worried about throwing up. Any time I see a truck that looks like hers I jump and get ready to run or hide until I see it’s not her driving. Fortunately, her truck got repoed for lack of payments. So she can’t come chase us herself, but unfortunately, it means that she relies on other people’s vehicles and that now any car could be the one she’s in. But I still panic at the trucks (and of course I live in a state full of people who drive trucks) 

TL;DR: besides screenshots and two witnesses (maybe three) what else should I put together for the restraining order? Should I go see a therapist to get an official document stating that she’s causing me to stress and lose sleep? Are there any loopholes I should know about? Would her being out on bail/ bond for drugs affect anything? Would her just being on drugs affect anything? Should I get a lawyer even though I doubt the ex can get one? And finally, if I have absolutely no idea whatsoever where she lives, does that mean I can’t get the order?

I’m sorry if I’m being confusing, like I mentioned I haven’t been sleeping well and putting together comprehensive phrases is apparently difficult. Thank you

288,"So I just spent months curating the perfect garden for bees, they love it, and I have attracted a lot, like, the most bees you have ever seen in a confined space, more even than in a bee hive. Problem started last week when the honey bees disappeared and the bumblebees took over my land.

Now, I'm a great fan of bumblebees, they are some of the greatest bees and I have seen some really amazing bees in my time, so big, fat, cuddly, normally some of the most snuggly bugs around. But last week a family of bumblebees with orange bums turned up, and they have attempted to take control of my garden, as if they were some kind of mafia bees. If I go within two meters of them they circle around my head buzzing into my ear until I evacuate from the garden. I'm pretty brave, but when I go in the garden one of them will eventually see me and buzz into my ears until I have left the garden. Nobody wants to be chased out of their own garden by bumblebees.

What I really want to know is, is this some kind of power play? Do I make myself look weak if I return to the house when they chase me? Will they sting me if I ignore them? I read that bumblebee stings are not barbed like honeybees, so at least they will not die if they sting me? Is that thing about them not having barbed stings wrong?

291,"let's call my co-worker ""Josh"".


when Josh first started at my company, he was a pleasant guy. he would make pretty funny jokes and you could count on him to be reliable, trustworthy, and a hard worker. fast forward to today (about 2 years from when he started) and he is none of those things.


Josh has developed this ""alpha"" and ""beta"" mindset. he believes that certain men (like himself) are ""alpha"" (very aggressive) and others are ""beta"". he will rant for hours about how gender equality is ""not a real problem"". (note: i am one of two women working in my entire department.) he tells stories about how he's such a dick to his girlfriend and her female family members, and spin it as ""men no longer being oppressed"". he calls college-educated people (like myself and other co-workers) ""idiots with problems"" for going to college, never having been to college himself. he proudly verbally bashes transgender folks behind their backs, saying they're mentally screwed up. (we have a handful of transgender co-workers). Josh also claims white men are ""under attack"" and the white race is ""dying"". he calls co-workers things like ""sheep"" for doing their jobs and following our  bosses requests. he laughingly boasts about how he would like to take down the gov't by lining up and shooting every politician and their families. if you are having a discussion with him and he thinks you're wrong, he'll talk even louder over you. he consistently spouts incorrect and outdated information to support any and all of his views. and i have been told by numerous co-workers that he consistently bad mouths *me* when i'm not there. (probably because i have strong female personality.) however, i ignore this because i don't give two shits what he thinks about me.


his work ethic is damn near dead. he complains if he's given more than two tasks to complete and bad mouthes our bosses. he does the bare minimum, all the while making fun of other co-workers, claiming they're working for an ""easy payday"". he thinks he's untouchable because he's outside friends with one of our direct bosses.


recently, one of our bosses asked me and another co-worker why Josh hadn't yet finished some work. we truthfully responded that we thought Josh was taking his time on purpose. later in the day, he approached us and asked if we had heard any rumors about him. i said no, and he proceeded to spin this long, passive-aggressive rant about how people need to tell him the truth so he could ""defend himself"". by this time, i was annoyed with his faux macho passive-aggressiveness, and i flatly told him that he worried too much about what people think of him and he needed to get over it. needless to say, he was foaming at the mouth the rest of the day.


i have considered speaking with HR, but i have reported someone else in the past and i was told they couldn't do anything. also, Josh has previously been reprimanded for tampering with another co-worker's car after a disagreement. so what do i do? i work closely with him and am unable to avoid or ignore him, but i literally can't take his toxic bullshit anymore.",16Jul2018,1

Any time I tell people this, they say I should start looking for a new job before quitting, but I don't want to and I don't see why I should. I wouldn't mind taking a month/a couple months off from full time work. Especially because I want to travel and sidegrade into a slightly different (but related) field, so I need some time to work on side projects for my resume.

Also I don't want to job hunt when I get home from work while I'm at this place. That sounds awful. I already have no free time. I don't want to think about work at home.

I don't know if people think a gap of a few months/up to a year (but likely much less) looks bad. But I took 6 months off after graduating and interviews didn't even mention the break. I also live with my parents currently and they don't mind, I don't have kids or anything, and I have a fair amount of savings.

Is it possible to coexist with someone who is your antithesis? If so, how?

296,"Basically I play rugby and I’ve had a really good season resulting in me being offered a a deal with a club between October - April for 2 seasons. There are multiple examples of players who’ve gone onto play proffesionally through the club and there are a couple of players currently who county and who’ve played for England. The facilities are good, the coach is involved with a professional club as well. The salary will cover the travel and as of next month I can’t start looking into learning to drive. 

The only problem is to get there it will take a 15 minute walk, a 35 minute train and a 20 minute bus/10 minute uber assuming nothing is delayed and I’ll have to do it 3 times a week minimum. The last train is something like 23:40, baring in mind it will be in the middle of winter as well. On a Monday I’ll have to do it after I’ve had lessons all day, on a Wednesday and Saturday I don’t have lessons so I’ll only have training. I’ve looked at hotels nearby and I can probably get one for £40, AirBnb is something like £20 + but I’m not sure how practical that is. With it being rugby there’s a social side to it which travelling doesn’t favour, also a lot of the lads will live locally and I’m a bit nervous of being different and them thinking I’m weird. 

I’ve considered moving but I’d have to transfer my college and my whole life. Also after the season finishes I’ll be back playing for my old club anyway. I just don’t know if the travel is too much or how the practicalities fit in. If you were in a position what would you do?",16Jul2018,1

298,"I went to a culinary vocational school in high school. I have my AS in culinary. I have been working in kitchens since I was 16. I have never had a job outside of cooking. I am 25 years old and I have dedicated my short adult life to the fact that I will be in the culinary industry for my whole life. I am a sous chef at a restaurant at the moment. I love the creativity, the fast pace, and the satisfaction I get after a good service. Recently, I've sort of fell out of love with it. Going into this, I knew about the lower pay, the long, late hours, and the dedication I needed to the job, but I was passionate and ready to do it. Now that I am engaged, have a future step son, want more kids and am really looking into my future, I don't feel the same way. I want the regular hours and secure future. I don't want to be a dad that works nights and weekends and can't spend much time with his family. Work was my priority 5 years ago, now a family has replaced that. This industry rarely offers retirement plans and good insurance plans. I still like what I do, just not as much. I feel as though if I want to change something, I have to do it now. I have no idea how to go about doing this. I can't even see myself doing anything else since cooking is all I know. I'm open to going back to school.

299,"Am 23 male, coworker is 23 female. 3 years since we've worked together. Almost no contact since, save for a few texts for the first two years.

I've always struggled connecting with people, and haven't really had any close friends since grade school. This person cared about me. She told me about her problems and asked me about mine. 

I never thanked her for being the only person in my life to care about me. I want her to know how grateful I am, but I don't want to make it seem like I want to reestablish a friendship, because I'm not sure if I would want that.

We never spent time together in our free time, only at work. Mostly because of me and my anxieties. 

I'm afraid I might come across as if I'm looking for her attention. I don't want to be a part of her life. I just want some closure which I never got, and I want her to know how much she meant to me. I want to get this off my chest.

302," Hi guys. Throwaway account here, I read a few entries on this thread and realized I have a question of my own.

How do you deal with crushing loneliness?

For context, I’m an incoming high school senior and I go to a arts-based HS in the United States. I have a loving family, friends, and am incredibly lucky to go to such a highly-commended school; I am able to go to bed with a full stomach every night, I have no financial troubles at all, my parents are kind and amazing and I really, really should be happy, but sometimes...I feel so, so lonely.

It’s summer break right now so I don’t have a lot on my plate, just homework (4 books to read and painting hw) and 2 classes a week (SAT prep and art classes). I can’t really drive yet (just got my permit) but even if I could I don’t really have anywhere to go. I have multiple hobbies, such as making art, reading, writing, and gaming, but for whatever reason I have no motivation to do anything. I feel lazy and unproductive and most of all I feel so...idk. Weirdly useless? I stay home all day and try to do a little bit of homework every day, occasionally seeing some friends and etc but like...I don’t know. Hm.

What do I want to do? I guess I want to go travelling, specifically back to Asia. I really want to visit Japan again and also China. Another option is going to Seattle, I love the summer weather there. I mean, I say this, but I can’t really go because I have classes so...idk. 

More info is that I have a lot of self-esteem issues. I only recently decided to dive into fashion and refining my appearance because I want to look nicer, but as a person who’s struggled identifying their gender and sexuality for a long, long time it’s really hard to accept me for me I guess? I don’t really know what I’m asking about at this point lol. Some words of comfort would be nice. Thanks everyone.

**TL;DR:** Despite having an extremely privileged life and having people I love around me, I still feel incredibly alone/lonely. How do you deal with managing these emotions?",16Jul2018,1

305,"Hey! Im a 17 year old boy from The Netherlands.
This summer vacation I wanted to do a full time job and I got one at a warehouse.
I have to work from 6-2(morning to afternoon) or from 2-10(afternoon to evening) switching in weeks. The first week(today) being from 6-2.
I have 2 breaks every day, each being 15 minutes long.
I had a job before but that was 3 times a week, 4 hours a day in a shop, instead of 8 hours a day, what Im doing right now. ""So this should not be that much harder. And there are alot of other guys from my age and even younger working here, so I should be fine too"" . (I thought).
Today, I started my first day of the 30 days I got planned in to work here (5 days per week for 6 weeks). 
The work I have to do is very simple, get products, put them in a box, tape the box and then put it on a pallet. The products are not heavy, but all of them together in a box can weight quite alot! The products differ from books, to pencils, to clay and alot more.
The first few hours went great! I did not enjoy it, but did not hate it either.
And when I had my first break after 3 hours, I didnt think it would be thought. When I got to work again after the brake it still went fine, it went slowly downhill, but whatever, ""I can do this"".
The job is not a job where you can take small breaks, because there is constant work to do, and even if you dont have work to do, they will get mad if you sit down on something. My feet did not really enjoy that but I knew I had to stand alot, and sore feet go away after a quick while when at home, so I didnt really care. When I had the second break after 5 hours of work, my feet were torn down, and I was very happy that I could sit.
I spoke to some people, asking if the ""higher up"" people cared about being not very fast. They said: ""Youre new so now it doesnt really matter, but its normal for experienced workers to do atleast 1000 orders every day""(I got 700 in the end). So after your ""training"" days/week you cant really take it easy too. (The main reason im worried).
After the break I was just done, I wanted to go home and sit down for a longgg time, maybe even take a nap. I started to get really tired, feeling dizzy even a little nauseous. After 8 hours of work, wich 2 of them being horrible. I was broken.
And here I am, feeling super tired and having a headache. I know millions of people work like this every day, but I just wanna know, will I get used to this?
Im not unhealthy, I eat and drink enough and am normal weight.
Sleeping is a problem for me tho, because of the hot eveings (especially becuase I sleep on the attic) and the early wakeups.
I really really wanna finish the 30 days, since finding this job was not easy at all, and I really need the money. Also my parents wont like me sitting at home all day.
Of course the job is not gonna get fun all of a sudden, and I dont really care thats its boring, Im just worried if this is normal. And if im gonna be fine, even after a week or so, when they expect results of me.
Tommorow I m expected there again hoping it goes better and really really hoping the annoying ""debuffs"" will not start to pill up on eachoder and so I would be incapable of doing this job I really really want to do.

306,"I know all I can do is wait right now, but I'm so worried about my friend I want to ask Reddit if anyone as had similar experiences or knows what might be happening, and potentially knows what I can do to help. I'll preface this by guaranteeing this is not a situation caused by drugs or alcohol.

For some background, my online friend and I, who know each other very well and are close, were chatting normally yesterday. We were discussing simple things like the fact that my birthday was the next day and what we would do. Two hours later, suddenly my friend starts exiting group chats on Discord. I thought it was no big deal, until she starts exiting personal chats with me, and then suddenly she starts deleting every message she's ever sent to me in private and on Skype. Another friend and I start desperately asking what's wrong, because she has a tendency to delete messages when she's unnerved. However, she didn't respond, and even changed her online status to hidden even though we could see her deleting messages in real time. I know for a fact that she isn't doing this because some hidden secret of ours was revealed or we were talking smack or something. I've never said a mean thing about her in my life and have no major secrets that are hidden from her. This also isn't some sort of attention grab because she is absolutely not that kind of person.

What I do know is that she lives with an abusive family that she has recently moved back in with, and their relationship had seemed much better than before when she had to move out. It's also important to note that she has bad depression and anxiety that she normally hides, and she takes medication for these things. During the period of time that she moved out, she was living with (equally crazy in my opinion) people who pushed her to have a nervous breakdown. During this time we were very scared because she simply sent ""goodbye I'm going out onto the streets"" and didn't respond after. Luckily nothing crazy happened that time and the situation was fixed. Afterwards she was in a very bad mental state though, and I stayed in the chat with her all day to keep her rooted to reality. When this happened her texts were extremely jumbled and sounded like she was throwing her train of thought down into text, to the point I could barely understand them, when normally her texts are very polished. 

As of typing this post, she just sent a text, I now know she hasn't run away or worse, but the single text she sent before disappearing has me worried even more. In it, she types in the same jumbled format that she did when she seemed to be having that psychotic episode back in winter. I'll just copy and paste what she sent:

""im really confused i dont remember what happened but it's not  there so I guess i did im going to go back to sleep my head hurts""

The way she wrote this is the exact same style as during her bad episode, but I'm extremely worried at the fact that she has no memory of doing any of it and I have no idea what that could mean. She doesn't touch alcohol or drugs, the only ""drugs"" she takes is anti depressants. If anyone knows what could cause someone to black out and then delete that many messages and then have their head hurt, please share because I'm too worried to sit still.",16Jul2018,1
307,"So hello Reddit!   


I've no one to ask this question, so I will ask everyone.   
I'm a guy who lived his life in Hungary, Budapest, 28 years of it, and I want to change it, all of it.   
It feels like I'm stuck here, going from job to job, from office to office, but found no purpose of it, just something that keeps me afloat, from one day to another. But nothing makes sense anymore.  
For a few years at the same time I'm fighting my depression, and trying to balance my daily life with it, yet again something I never got any advice or help on, just you know...laughed at.   


I want to change it, I want to change me. I want to be somewhere else, and not this gloomy hellhole.  
Nothing that really matters ties me here, no family, loved ones, and so on.  
So that is what I'm asking advice on. How should I start? Where should I start?   
Things to know:   


\- Mostly I've been working in offices as a support, be it financial, IT, I have experience in a good few fields, the point is, my job were always revolved around communicating with people. I'm kinda good at that.  
For a long time I've been working on LiveJasmins support as a quality assurance thingy.   
\- As my schooling goes, I've gone through high school ofc, and started to learn at Berkley as a sound designer, did that too for a good few years as well on my own. Music is a lifelong passion of mine. Unfortunately I couldn't finish the school because I was just unable to pay for the schooling, it is way too steep with the wages I managed to get here.   
\- Savings: Non at all.   


So dear people, tell me, have you any advice for me? ",16Jul2018,2
308,"Hi Reddit, I am a 27 yo guy and I am struggling to make a decision about my present and future life: I'm studying right now to become an IT technician so that my future career will be more satisfying but, since I began to study, my girlfriend moved out after three years living together and she went to do some summer job in a hotel. We've had our up and downs during this period, I know she'd been talking (TBH I don't know whether they did something else or not) to one of her ex boyfriend when she was back home waiting for the job to start. I found out and she told me she was so sorry and that it was just a stupid mistake that won't happen again. At first I broke up with her but we eventually managed to make things work again, now though, I am truly unhappy as I would want to stay with her since my course isn't going that great and to be honest all I want in life is to be by her side. I put together all my experiences(and even things I didn't do) and made up a CV, sent it to an hotel in her same city and to my surprise they gave me a call this morning telling me they were interested and that they would offer me meals and accommodation.
Now what is really stressing me is that she isn't really participating in this whole situation, well, to be honest after I found out about the other guy she seemed different to me, she told me how sorry she was and everything but she had been acting different between us. Almost seems like we don't even know each other anymore, we were good a good couple and good friends before all went downhill and now it feels like I'm just some guy to her. Should I drop my course and just accept the offer I received to go and be with her or am I just over thinking this whole thing and I should just let it go?

 Before anyone asks YES, I truly love her and I truly want to spend my life with her even though she hurt me, I love her unconditionally and as of few days ago I thought she felt the same.

TLDR there shouldn't be such thing as TLDR, get back on top and read the whole thing!! Sorry for my English (I'm Italian) and also excuse me for the formatting I'm on mobile.
Thanks in advance to whoever is going to give some advice.

Peace and love to all Redditors !!",16Jul2018,1
309,"So I have an associates degree in engineering from a community college, I then attended a top 10 university for engineering but my second semester there I broke down. I had some really bad depression issues and I’ve always loathed engineering. It always seemed to go like this between me and my mom. My mom would say just try it for a year, I did. I didn’t want to do it anymore and she’d say well you’re just one year away from your associates just stick it out. I did and say I didn’t want to do it, but well just try it one more year at the university the upper level classes are more interesting. I don’t blame her, parents want their kids to follow a safe path in life and I’m good at math. But whenever I’d talk to my parents about a business degree they’d say so many people get a business degree it’s hard to get a job. Now since the last spring I’ve been out of school, traveling and this past spring I was living at home taking business classes at the community college. I feel like I’ve been lazy in my school work partly from depression and I had become an alcoholic. Now I’m taking care of myself and I feel good and I have this mindset that I can do anything literally accomplish anything I set myself towards. 
And I came across this great opportunity to go to a smaller college near me for only $500 a semester because our state gave this school a special grant, and I can live at home to save money.
I’ve decided I want to try something new and I have this idea that I’ll major in biophysics and go on to get a masters in something like nano technology or anything to have a reputable college under my belt. 
I feel like I will just get this bachelors degree and then see what doors it opens and then make the next step. 
But my mom is wondering what jobs I can get with a biophysics degree and I’m starting to second guess what I’m doing.

It doesn't stop there. She can't accept that no man ever truly wanted her so she has to break any happy couple that catches her attention. She sends her nudes, her anything to guys, and she sends threat or fake breakup message to girls, she's fucking insane! But no one is stopping her. It's crazy!

311,"Ok so I don't really know how to start this, but I just need some general advice and some opinions. So I'm a girl, I'm 17 and I'm bisexual (And I'm ngl it took me a long time just to type that because it's the first time I'm actually putting it out there other than to the 2 people who I've told and although none of you know me, this is still hard for me to do). I've know for around 2 years I'd say, I never been with a girl  or anything like that (Due to being in a relationship when I figured it out), but I know I'm not just curious about it. One of the two people who know is my boyfriend of 3 years and I told him about a year and a half ago now he didn't know too much about bisexuality when I told him so he asked a lot of questions but he's never been anything but supportive. The other guy who knows I have been close friends with for about 4 years and I literally only told him a couple of days ago.

They've both said they would never have guessed that and I think that's because I'm quite a 'girly-girl'; so I doubt anyone in my family or friend group has any sort of inkling that I'm bi. I'd like to tell my mum soon, but I'm not sure exactly how to tell her; we don't exactly openly talk about anything personal and talking about stuff like that just makes me very awkward and causes me to clam up. It literally took me about 3 hours to get the words out to the 2 people I've told. Like I have no clue whatsoever how to start that conversation or what to say or anything really. I also don't want anyone I tell to think of me differently or think it's a phase because I think that's quite a big misconception with bisexuality. As for telling my dad I'm sure he'd be fine once I told him but he's verrrry narrow minded and old-fashioned in the way he thinks about things like this, like I'm sure it would be fine but I'm more nervous telling him than anyone else. He's said some \*slightly\* homophobic things and I know he doesn't hate gay people or mean it to be malicious and I'm certain that he'd be fine with me but it just makes me more nervous than I already am.

One thing that has just tipped the scales for me wanting to come out, and this is going to sound cliche, but I recently watched Love Simon (Which on a side note is an amazing movie which you should defiantly watch if you haven't already) as well as reading a number of other peoples coming out stories and it just makes me want to tell people rather than to keep hiding it from everyone. I'm ready, I just don't know how to.

So I mainly just need advice/help with how to come out to people whilst being as awkward as I am talking about things like this.

312,"I’ve been considering art school, but having difficulty committing to it. I have recently fell in love with a more creative world and need to find a way to communicate what I see in my head to the world. 

From what I can tell, there are a few factors that hold me back: Money, relationships, skill, and ROI. 

Money: I payed for my first bachelors with student loans and I’m drowning month to month as it is. The schools I’m looking at would double down on that mess. 

Relationships: if I do it, I’m leaving my current state. That would effectively end most of my friendships and love life. I’m old enough that those circles have been rapidly closing and a classroom full of teenagers will not help. 

Skill: I am by no means a prodigy, but I’ve been working on my basics as I’ve aged. I can’t use color for shit, and my line thickness makes everything look cartoony, but I think I have a good foundation to build on. I find myself wanting to learn more when I encounter a roadblock of skill, but get frustrated when I can’t just ask for a hint. 

Return on investment: My dream job - at the moment - is to be a concept artist for games or movies, but I know after working in my current field that I’ll end up settling for something way less exciting. So, I’m worried that I won’t be any happier than I am now, in twice as much debt, and even less likely to pay off my loans. 

When I went to business school, I knew the roadmap for what I was doing to learn, but for art school everything seems abstract. What will I learn? Is it useful? Does it matter where I go? I’m spiraling. 

I know that only I can choose what’s right for me, but the experience of others can be used to mitigate risk. 
Thank you for reading my book. I appreciate that you made it this far :)

2 years ago i went to an eye doctor several times because i had some serious vision issues due to things like allergies and infections.

316,"Long story, I appreciate those who have the time to read it. Perhaps my struggles will also help others put things into perspective in their own troubles.

When I was born, I had a negligent doctor who took my parents money and botched my circumcision. My parents weren't around, and my grandfather who was with me at that point, didn't realize what had happened and that was that. (And i was unaware of the true story of what had happened until two months ago!)

Fast forward. I grew up bitter, angry, isolated and depressed because I was left with alot of scarring and foreskin that wasn't retractable (phimosis). As a kid I wasn't sure what was wrong with me (I thought I had some deformity) and I became isolated in my shame. I blamed everyone for my issue, my parents, my friends, myself, because I did not know what was wrong with me and why I was born with such a problem (not yet knowing at the time of the negligence of said doctor).  I never took any chances with women (just one girlfriend in HS) because I felt ashamed. I lost all of my college years not having any real experiences of love, and dug deeper into my shame. I went through addictions to alcohol, pornography, games, movies, anything that would dull the pain. When I was 24 I had a situation where my loan for school didn't clear so, for the first time in my life, I decided to drown the pain with a more healthy ""addiction"", exercise. Then, when I was 25, I had a sort of awakening. I realized my isolation, shame, and various addictions were on a path to ruin my life (luckily I was still consistently, and still am, lifting and doing cardio). So I drove cross country to Burning Man, hoping that it would be a sort of ritual for me to break out of my self-imposed misery. I had both a wonderful and a dreadful experience but I came home from it with a deeper understanding of my pain. I was up and down for the next year and a half, making improvements and then taking a step back. Anyway here is where the story becomes relevant to today:

A few months ago I met someone wonderful who worked at the office I was working at. Her and I clicked and our dates were picture perfect. I was still struggling with my shame but I gave her my entire self. A few months in she didn't like the environment at work (the boss was pretty bad) so she left. She told me about a job in her new office and, because I really cared for her, I quit and went to where she was working. But she got distant soon after and always had an excuse why she couldn't see or talk to me. (She was rarely in the office due to the nature of her position). I went through two months of horrible pain and isolation, always thinking that I was inadequate. But it inspired me to do something, finally do what I've always wanted. I went to see a doctor, he told me it's a simple procedure and I got circumcised. When my Mom found out she told me what happened when I was a baby (me still not knowing why I had this issue). I let go of alot of pain and bitterness finally being told the truth. 

Anyway, back to my situation. I still love the coworker very much. But it is painfully clear that she doesn't from the few exchanges I had with her over the last two months. So my issue: I took this job to be with her. I am greatly heartbroken over her and it is causing me great stress and depression. I don't want to revert back to the bitter horrid person I was, especially now that the one thing I blamed has been fixed. Continuing to work here puts me under great stress. I feel as if I won't get closure and won't be able to move on and manifest a new me if I continue my employment here. My work is also suffering, obviously.  And I tried to meet other people but I can't seem to put myself out there unless I get closure here. 

So, would you recommend quitting to get closure, preserve my sanity, and give myself an opportunity to grow as a new me?

Or do I power through the pain which can be quite debilitating.

Also any advice on how to get over the heartbreak?",16Jul2018,1
317,"I’ve always been great with girls probably because I was raised by a single mom so I’m a lot more emotional than your average guy.

320,"How did you know were home?

Sorry for length, tldr at bottom.

Background: Partner and I moved from our hometown of Edmonton, Alberta (Canada) to a small town in BC a few years ago. We have a small family and want to settle down while we raise our kids. There is so much to LOVE about our town, and yet it has never truly felt like home. 

We probably would have already moved away somewhere if we didn't own a small house that keeps our cost of living really low. (That and not wanting to move while pregnant/with a newborn) At times our cheap home feels like a cage, keeping us trapped here, but maybe the real cage is our mind. We need to move, but don't know if we should move to a new city or just move into a better home/location in our town.

Is the town wrong for us, or are our attitudes preventing us from really feeling at home? How do we answer this question? How did you answer these types of questions?

How do you know you're living in the right place? How do you know when to stop looking and instead be happy with what you have?

No place is perfect, so how did you know which problems were tolerable and which were deal-breakers? Is my perfectionism and freedom to choose clouding my judgment? Am I already living in the right place but don't see it because of my own issues? 

How do I see past the fear of making the wrong decision?

Please share your experiences with finding the right city/country to help give me perspective!

We haven't traveled too much, especially as adults with our own family. How do we know if our town is right if we don't have much to compare it to? Should we spend years exploring and travelling to find the right city? I want to settle into a community asap and worry about wasting time/money looking at other towns when we aren't 100% sure what we want.

When thinking of the future, how do you know how important some dreams are? I.e. regular travel requires access to an international airport, which we don't have. How do we place value on our dreams or judge how important these things are?

Career/employment isn't our primary consideration. I work from home (author) and my partner is in the service industry with plans to eventually work from home, ideally before we move. We don't have careers paths influencing our decision, which admittedly is a blessing, but it also means it's hard to narrow anything down. 

We would like to move in the next 18mos. We need time to save and decide where to go. We don't have much money to travel while saving which is why we need to be careful about visiting too many places before making our decision. 

Feels like there are too many widely different yet altogether very similar options. We are overwhelmed by choice, and feel a huge responsibility to pick a good place to settle down with our young kids.

I've seriously about living abroad, like New Zealand or Holland, but moving a family (and our cats who are family) seems like too big of a risk. Even places on the other end of Canada, like Montreal, sounds exciting but seems so foreign. (I've always wanted to move to montreal but I've never actually been there) Moving without seeing these places first sounds irresponsible, but I also don't want to spend years and $$$ looking for the perfect city. I want to settle down.

How do we see past fear and our own anxiety so we can make a good decision?  

I can share more if needed. Thanks for reading my 1st reddit post!

TL;DR: Beyond moving for employment reasons, how did you decide where to live, and how did you know you're living in the right place?",16Jul2018,2
321,"I’m 22 and just started a master’s program in Counseling. I’m completely reliant on my parents financially. They pay for everything I need and give me a lot of nice things, but in turn, I never ask for anything either. I hate asking them to give me money and never argue with them or do anything outside what they want me to do because I feel like I have an obligation to be grateful to them. It’s nice but it sucks when it comes to one thing: tattoos. I want to get a tattoo on my back that would cost $400+ dollars. I had a job before I started school, but used the money I made to buy groceries, shit I wanted, etc, so my parents were only paying my rent and utilities. It was only about $450/2 weeks so I didn’t save any of it for the long-term (stupid, I know). I don’t have a job now because my parents want me to focus on school. I didn’t work in undergrad either for the same reason. So today I asked my mom to pay for a tattoo, and since she HATES them, she got really upset and said no, they’re ugly, not until I’m on my own financially, etc. Mind you, I have 3 siblings who are all 10+ years older than me that they also financially support to varying extents. I want to have a relationship with my mom where she can accept the things I want to do (to an extent, I don’t think asking for a tattoo is that extreme) because I don’t feel like I can do them without her money/approval. I’m not the type to go behind my parents’ backs and spend their money, especially on something they wouldn’t want me to. I feel upset because I always do what they ask of me and feel like the one thing I ask for that they don’t agree with is just shot down. Compared to my siblings, I’m the most frugal and don’t ask for anything, while my sister spends their money buying $1000 purses and is currently wasting tens of thousands of their dollars on a divorce (that they don’t agree with but still support) that has no end in sight. I kind of have my hands tied because they don’t want me to get a job so I can focus on school, but when I have a job and make money I spend it on groceries and other stuff so they don’t have to spend as much money on me (because I’m not going to ask for money from them while I’m getting a paycheck unless I absolutely need it), but in order to get what I want I have to have my own money or be financially stable, which I don’t see happening for quite some time. I don’t want to go against my parents’ wishes, but selfishly, I feel like I deserve getting something I want. I always do exactly what they ask, try to be the “perfect child,” which they say I am.

329,"So, long story short, I turned 18 in June. My mother has always demanded way too much control over my life. She wants me to stay with her while I'm in college so I can help her with her bills (read: pay them for her) since she's bieng cut off from all the funds she used to get ie adoption support, etc.

I've already started paying her rent. I don't have the option of moving out unless I find somewhere ridiculously cheap or share rent with multiple people due to the fact that I don't make enough money at work and I'm not allowed to go find a new job.

Yet she hasn't let up on any of her restrictions on my life. I still can't invite friends over or go to their houses, I can't leave the house without permission unless it's for work, I can't play video games or use my computer without permission, and once I get permission it's 1 hour then I'm off *OR ELSE*, I can't spend my money without her approving what I buy first, I'm not allowed to listen to explicit music or pick my own religious beliefs (aka leave her hate-mongering evil fundamentalist cousin sect to the Westboro Baptist Church), I'm not allowed to date people, not allowed to have friends without her approval of said friends, and I'm not allowed privacy whatsoever.

What should I do or say to convince my mother to lay the fuck off me? Like I said, moving out isn't an option since I can't afford it financially. I'm barely making enough for my mother's rent and my phone/internet as it is.",16Jul2018,2
330,"Reddit, I have a problem.  It's a long one.

I have an aunt (unmarried, mid-50s) that lives with my grandfather (late-80s walks fine, going deaf).  My grandparents sold the house to my aunt ~13 years ago, but the family has lived there for almost 40.

Not totally relevant, but kind of, my grandmother recently (~6 months ago) went into a memory care facility for severe Alzheimers.  It was a hard decision that took years to come to.  My aunt has been living my grandmother and increasingly senile grandfather the whole time.

They currently live about an hour away from my family(mom dad 2 adult kids 2 houses).  My aunt is still constantly checking in on my grandmother while living with my grandfather and she can't take it anymore.  She wants to sell the house and move into my neighborhood to be near our family.   We would also move my grandmother over to me so we could visit her and spread the responsibility for her care.

My grandfather refuses to move.  He has become increasingly senile over the years.  I wouldn't say hes become completely illogical, but he has become selfish and single minded.  It doesnt help that he doesnt wear his hearing aid and probably hasnt had real conversation in over a decade.

The plan is to move him with my aunt to her new home, but realistically he will have 3 houses to choose from here, or he can move an hour flight away to live with my uncle.

We've been trying to talk to him about it for the last few weeks but he gets angry and says he doesnt want to talk about it.  We called some junk guys yesterday and hauled a bunch of stuff out and he got angry and said we couldnt do that without discussing with him.  He called 911 on us.  The cops told him the homeowner (aunt) was in control of the situation and they couldnt do anything.  He said he would lawyer up.  He literally said ""I'll see you in court.""

So I guess i'm looking for advice in 2 areas,

1)What do we need to know on the technical end  for moving day?  What if he refuses to leave the premises?  What if he locks himself in a room?  This move is very important for my aunt's mental health and I cannot allow my Grandfather to stop it.

2) What can I do to help my grandfather with the situation?  He keeps saying things like he's being kicked out into the street and that he should never have sold the house to my aunt.  He feels that everyone is ganging up on him.

The reality is though, that he doesn't want to move and refuses to have any conversation about it.  He put on his hearing aid only to speak to the police and took them off after.  Maybe it's fear or just too much changing at once for him, but does anyone have some input?  I want him to trust us with caring for him because he won't be able to care for himself much longer.

He cannot afford to buy or rent a place on his own, but I believe he may be proud enough to not stay with any of us, which will put him on the streets.

Sorry in advance for long post and mobile formatting. 

When I was 17 years old my mom confessed to me that my father had been sexually abusing her for the majority of their 20+ year marriage. I always new he was abusive because I also suffered the emotional abuse, manipulation, and the occasional smack to the face. He never allowed her to have a job, or friends, or visit her family overseas (she only went back three times in 20 years, twice for funerals). I love my mother more than anything in the world, so I told her that she needed to leave him and that I would work and rent an apartment during college and she could live with me for as long as she needed. 

I’ve accepted this and that I will be taking care of her for probably the rest of her life. It is what it is. I am fine with that, she is my mother after all and she stayed with us for all those years so that we could have a good childhood, cooking three meals a day, cleaning our house, being there for us emotionally whereas my dad really only provided money (which I know is a contribution and sacrifice in itself but doesn’t excuse his actions). The problem is that I don’t know how to balance this without sacrificing my own life in the process.

I am the only person she has. Her only real friend and family (all of her family overseas passed away except one estranged sibling). We got her a job at a grocery store so she could feel good about contributing and have something to do, but she’s miserable at the job. On top of that she recently had heart surgery to have a defibrillator implanted since she has an ejection fracture of 31% (two stress related heart attacks in the last four years) so now it’s even a struggle for her to do that job. I’ve tried finding her office jobs or something but she has a 20 year blank space on her resume, graduated high school in a foreign country and has no college degree.

It’s gotten to the point where she’s just depressed ALL of the time. Talking about wanting it all to end, how she had nothing in this life, no purpose except her children. Honestly she’s been this way a while but I’ve always managed to make her feel good by hanging out with her, making her laugh and just generally talking it out like a pseudo therapist for her since she trusts me. Last year I met my boyfriend, a relationship that is headed into serious territory. Sometimes I spend the night, spend a day with him and don’t really see her since she works 2-11 and I work 9-5. I think she is resentful that I’m in a relationship and hates when I spend time with him. I’m always stressed out about splitting my time evenly between them. I feel like I’m going insane. I need, NEED to take care of her. But I also do NOT want to sacrifice love and life experiences in general. I already talked to my boyfriend, he understands that I’ll be supporting her the rest of her life and is fine with that. It’s to the point where I only sleep a few hours a day because I spend till 2-3am with my boyfriend because that’s when she is asleep. 

I know a lot of people are going to say oh your mom is using you, is abusive, etc etc. but that’s really not the case. She’s just so depressed about her horrible life situation that everything seems like an attack at her. Every time I spend the night at his place it’s “whenever you need me to move out let me know, I’m sorry I’m a burden on your life” and it’s genuine, unfounded guilt. Probably a reaction from being in an abusive relationship forever. 

Don’t be mistaken she does contribute. She knows I have some built up credit card debt from some emergencies that were had, so despite me making three times as much as her she still tries to force me to let her pay half the rent (writes checks and leaves them in my room) even though I try to refuse knowing she needs to save her money for herself. She even still tries to make me let her do my laundry and clean the apartment and cook me food out of her guilt. 

Not taking care of her is not an option. Leaving my boyfriend is not an option. What are some ways to remedy this situation for the better? She’s lonely, depressed, hopeless, but it’s so hard to cheer her up since our schedules are opposite and I only see her on her days off for after I get home from work at 6pm. I’ve even tried to ask if she wants to quit her job but she’s too guilty to not contribute to bills even though I make enough to cover it all. 

Tl;dr: Told my mom I would support her at 17 so she could get away from my abusive dad, she is depressed about having a life with no hope for independence (since she has heart problems and is 55 with no education or experience) and it’s starting to effect my mental well being because it seems like there’s nothing I can do to help her.

342,"First of all, I apologize if this question is too unethical, and I'll understand if it needs to be removed. And I'm sorry for hiding behind a throwaway, obviously I don't want anyone finding out who I am.

I have a job interview tomorrow for something that I'm really qualified for, and really want to do. It's looking good for me, I'm optimistic about it. Just worried about one thing - I was fired from a previous job, and don't want them to know about it.

A bit of background about my situation - about five years ago I was reported to my company's HR department for sexual harassment on two separate occasions, both of which I have admitted to and signed an employee improvement plan documenting the incident. In hindsight, I never should have agreed to this because that's something you don't want in your past; the incidents were using the words ""lady"" to refer to a female co-worker and then later ""misses"" to the same person. Bullshit, but according to the sexual harassment seminar I was required to attend and my company's lawyers, entirely legitimate. I should have quit on the spot, but instead I thought I could keep my job by agreeing to this.

.

So anyway, bullshit or not, this is in my background now and I worry it may cause me trouble in the future.

It's a very convincing lie because the company was in the middle of huge layoffs at the same time, which were heavily publicized in the area. I got a job a few months after being fired and just told them I was laid off, and they never questioned it, I doubt they bothered to contact my previous employer. Don't know why I'm worrying about it so much now, I've been successfully lying about my work history for about three years now.

My question is this: What ability does an employer have to actually find out? I know my old boss doesn't work there anymore, the entire IT department has been outsourced and there isn't anybody still working for the company who would even know me. Short of calling my supervisor's personal phone which I don't even know to give it to them, how could the find out I'm lying to them?",16Jul2018,1
343,"My oldest sister recently got my niece a Samsung tablet to basically shut her up for a bit. I wouldn't have a problem with this if my niece was actually benefiting from use of it but ever since she got it she has had an attitude problem, is way more whiny than she usually is, and acts more spoiled than ever. I am aware of the stuff that went on not too long ago with videos that are very inappropriate for kids being on YouTube (and getting big numbers so they climb up in the algorithm easily) so i keep an eye out for those kind of videos (which I haven't seen her watching). The worst i see her watching is adults with crying baby masks breaking stuff and MAYBE saying the color of whatever it is they're breaking, which i quickly turned off. Whenever i try to have her watch something with value to it such as Mr Rogers or Super Why she squeals and hurries back to the nonsense. Could the two be related? Any help is appreciated",16Jul2018,1

He invited me to stay with him in Australia this winter when I get a break from school and said that when he comes to America next summer, he'd love to stay with me for a few weeks.

348,"Hi everyone. Sorry if this is a little messy since I'm writing this on my phone and english isn't my first language. To understand this we need to go back to 3rd grade. In third grade I didn't have friends, then in fourth grade I found my best friend who we'll call Britney. Britney and I were friends from 4th grade until around 7th grade. In 6th grade I didn't like her because she was kind of obnoxious. She'd sing loudly and just do a lot of stuff that annoyed me I told her to stop, she didn't. ( I regret it now) I tried to abandon her in 6th grade( I tried to go with other people during break time) she wouldn't let me. Anyway, in 7th grade which was my final year at this school, I made two best friends. I told her that I don't want to go with her in break but I would still be friends with her. I didn't keep in touch with her. When 7th grade was ending my two best friends that I made decided that they didn't want me anymore. (a whole another story) I went back to Britney ( the friend that I had since 4th grade) but she seemed like she didn't want me. She finally told me that her mother doesn't want her hanging out with me anymore since I basically stabbed her in the back. I remember dragging her to just come with me during break time. Out conversations at break were awkward. She asked me if the friends that I made this year abandoned me and I denied it because my ego was too inflated. Now I moved to a new school and I'm in 8th grade ( in summer break going to 9th grade) and I realized I did the wrong thing. I want yo talk to her again and become her friend. But, we're not in the same school so i can't just go to her. Not to mention, the fact that I apologized to her by writing a text, but she didn't respond ( she uses her mother phone) I don't know if her mother read the text and decided that she didn't accept my apology and never showed it to her daughter, or she forgot to show the text to Britney. I'm afraid. I want my friend back, but I'm more afraid that the mother doesn't want me or that Britney doesn't want me. 

What I'm basically saying is that, should I move on and forget about Britney and all of what happened in 7th grade, or should I try to revive an old friendship?",16Jul2018,1

I have an option of going to a Cal State and getting my bachelors there to then go to law school after some internship or work experience

363,"I have been taking a Business/licensing course for almost 2 years (last exam deadline is in a month) now 90% due to my parents wanting me to take it because this job (don’t want to get in depth) has really good pay and you also work when you want. I realize this and do think this is a great opportunity for me but I just can’t get myself to study to pass the exam. 

I failed the exam once pretty badly but they don’t know how bad I failed it by but do have 1 more try or I have to wait a couple months and restart the entire course and complete all the required assignments before again. 

A lot of people where we live are taking this course and getting licensed because it’s a highly popular job here with great pay as far as I heard and because of this they think the exam is easy since so many people have passed it which is another reason my parents want me to study and pass this exam. The other huge reason my parents want me to take this course is because they have always dreamt of me working in this profession (involves houses but don’t want to say much more due to privacy reasons) as it is a job that may have me good financial wise for years to come. 

However, I just can’t get myself to focus and study for this course (the course book is very big and I’m just unmotivated and lazy)  It’s been almost a year since I attempted my first exam try and since then I’ve been lying to my parents telling them I study everyday when I barely study at all and delaying booking my last exam try. 

I’m almost certain that if I do tell my parents (my dad especially) that I do not want to complete this course, they will be really mad and shattered because they have dreamt and put faith in me completing this course but I wasn’t able to do it which is really tough for me to swallow as I would never want to disappoint my parents this much.  I really do realize and regret the huge pool of lies I have been telling them but I’m too scared to tell them I simply can’t do it.

Although they have always supported everything I did/ still do and have always told me to “do what you want and the money will follow”, telling them I can’t do it will actually really disappoint them. This is the exact reason why I am unable to get myself to tell them this until I really started considering telling them a couple days ago because almost every interaction with them revolved around them asking me where I am going to take the exam. 

I do think if I try and attempt the exam but fail, they will be less disappointed because I gave it a try. If I tell them I do not want to give the exam another shot, they will be disappointed because I have lied and delayed it for months and months. The percentage to pass the exam is either 65% or 70% from either a 100 or 200 multiple choice question exam (don’t fully remember)

My question to y’all is should I straight up tell them and be fully honest or just study as much of the book as I can and take the exam in a couple weeks but will 95% fail it because the book is too big to study in a couple weeks?

For the past like 6 months I've had less and less energy and focus overall.  
Every once in awhile I'd get some days where I can't do anything; the front of my brain feels numb but with slight pain, and I have this intense ""TV static"" sensation distinctly in the front of my head (instead of the usual fog)   
My heart rate definitely feels *way* higher overall, when I work out it instantly shoots up and I have to pause sometimes because it feels it's going to beat out of my chest. This also happens occasionally at random (happened just now, while I was lying down)

I had a blood test and checked with 2 doctors, my results and diet were apparently excellent, they didn't take me seriously because I was ""young"" (am 20) and one told me to follow god more.  
Only one gave me some Vitamin D pills.

I wasn't like this like 6 months ago, I woke up with a clear head, exercised without any problems, and focused for multiple hours on my studies and hobbies really easily. One doctor suggested I might have post-viral fatigue but I really haven't been sick in a long time.  
As I noticed this building up I've seriously focused on sleep (8hrs a day), eating healthy, and getting exercise but nothing seems to change it and it's only getting worse.

Since December I tried to call him a few times but he said he wasn't in the mood to talk so I was like okay, it's normal. In April, he tells me that he wants to talk to me because it had been months since we talked but he didn't, said he was too tired the next day. So I called him a few days later because he had been giving me a cold shoulder for few days. He picks up, tells me he's not in the mood so I hang up. A month later I see the story of an other friend of mine in which he talked to the friend I'm talking about for like an hour or so. It really hurt me so I stopped texting him for a month or two. He also didn't wish me birthday which was in June (he knows how big of a deal it is for me) which again hurt me. 

But I decided to call him tonight and make things clear. But he didn't think that any of this was a big deal. He said he'd been giving me cold shoulder for past 4 or 5 months because he was going through some things but absolutely refused to share anything.

368,"I just started my first job about two and a half months ago. I work at a bagel place and so far it's been pretty good. But I can't stand one of my managers, and I'm actually considering quitting because of her. Let's call her Linda for now. She was fine for the first month, but lately she's been doing nothing but yelling at me and overreacting to everything. When I make a mistake, she yells at me. When I don't know something because I haven't been taught it yet, she yells at me. When I don't work fast enough because I'm still new, she yells at me. When she bumps into me and causes me to spill something, she yells at me for not being careful enough. No matter *what* I do, she yells at me. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to take the initiative to do something because I don't want to get yelled at. My coworkers have similar experiences with Linda, and nobody really likes her.

I know myself pretty well, and I know that I don't respond well to being yelled at, especially if I haven't actually done anything wrong. And the fact that Linda has been yelling at me everyday is making my work experience miserable. The only time I enjoy going to work is when she has the day off. I really don't want to stay in this job for too much longer, but I'm hesitant to actually quit for a couple of reasons. 

1) My best friend got me the job. She recommended me to the other manager, Cathy, and I don't want to throw her under the bus in case Cathy's opinion of me ends up affecting my friend. Cathy is also a nice person and I like her a lot more than Linda, and I don't want to disappoint her.

2) I don't want to seem like I'm just giving up. I've never had a job before and I don't want to call it in at the first sign of trouble. I mean, this is pretty much what the adult world is like, right? A big part of me is just telling me to get over it and stop being so whiny, even though I know it's not that simple. 

Money isn't really the biggest issue, and there are other jobs available in my area that I can apply for. I guess my main question is, should I quit my job? How would I go about doing it? Am I just being too sensitive? Thanks for reading and I hope I can find a solution soon.",16Jul2018,1
369,"My biological parents split when I was a young toddler and I met my real father only two times in my life. As a child, my mom was reluctant for me to establish a relationship with him, however she never prevented me from trying. In fact, as a child I would write letters to my father. Of the dozen or so letters I wrote, I had only received one in reply when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I never understood his apparent unwillingness to communicate or to establish a bond and I assumed he was just a dirtbag father or maybe my mom wasn't actually mailing all the letters. 

Well, the second and last time I met my father was at my mom's memorial service when I was 24 in 2009. During which, and after speaking with my grandmother and my biological father's wife in private, I discovered that the entire reason my father had been mostly absent for my life was due to his wife had coerced him into not communicating with me due to her fear that he would one day potentially leave her and run back my mom (despite that my mom had remarried and that my bio father and his wife had been together for nearly 20 years as well). He got all my letters but she would prevent him for replying and would threaten to leave him if he did. 

By this point, I didn't really care to establish a relationship with him. For one, I had grown up. Secondly, we live on opposite ends of the country and I'd likely never see him anyway seeing that I have no ties to where he lives. So, we both seem content with not being in each other's lives, but out of acceptance and not out of spite or anything toward each other, despite that I did and still do have a significant level of resentment for his wife. 

So, fast-forward to present day. After decades of smoking like a chimney, my bio father's wife is dying from cancer and expected to pass literally any day now. However for the past month or two, I had been receiving calls and emails from my grandmother and a few other people on that side of the family (again, whom I've only met once or twice) wanting me call and offer my condolences my bio father and his dying wife. It was also expressed that I should consider going to the funeral service. Well, the latter is out of the question. I have neither the time, money, or desire to fly across the country to attend the funeral of someone I honestly don't care for and who quite literally kept my father from me as a child. 

However, I feel I am also going to be looked down upon for not reaching out and offering words of support and sympathy to her or her family. Quite frankly, I don't see it as being appropriate or my place. First, I am not going to fake sympathy. I can't. Secondly, while I understand why people close to her are mourning, I am not. I don't care for her for obvious reasons and so I find it hard to offer condolances to those that do. I feel I was robbed of a potential relationship as a child with my father. Like any other robber, I don't expect the victim to call and offer condolences to the relatives of the offender. 

Am I wrong for feeling this way? How to I explain to the relatives asking me to essentially participate in their mourning that I won't without coming off like a giant asshole? ",16Jul2018,1

I know, I know...no one gets the life they wanted but I'm nowhere near where I thought I'd be at my age and my peers seem to be ahead in terms of careers, having been married, buying houses, and having had kids.   


I'm long-term unemployed, although I'm working on this due to disability and a lack of support I don't see this changing any time soon, even once back in work I'd be a long way off a good job or feeling stable enough to consider going back into education to advance my career - while other people my age are professionals. No work means no social life and I have no friends, which makes me feel like I'm missing out on a lot in terms of enjoying myself before I settle down, social isolation has huge knock-on impact on wellbeing too. I'm living in rented authority housing and don't see myself ever being able to buy a house. I'm single and thus also no kid - at 35 I don't have long left to have a child, it seems very unlikely I'll be able to find a partner and get my life together in time to have a child, right now I'm just struggling to survive so having a child isn't a priority...but I know not having a child is something I'll regret.   


I'm intelligent, I'm hard working, etc. so I didn't expect to be where I am now but disability has been a huge factor in holding me back, such as keeping me from going to university and hampering my ability to work. My situation has come about from bad decisions made in bad situations where my options were limited, I'm not sure what else I was supposed to have done in the time I've wasted to have changed my situation...now I don't feel I can recover, even if I knew how to change things I'm too far behind and I can't even face my situation without feeling suicidal.

I despise this child and will fight back when she’s being a brat which is immature of me, but I’m sick of being pushed around by this entitled brat. Anything I do she tries to make fun of me for it and she just won’t leave me alone. The worst part is that I have to share a room with her, but my dad is thinking of moving her into a different part of the house.

My parents rarely do anything to stop her and tell us to get along. She is mentally exhausting and I just want to hide and cry. I’m a teen who suffers from anxiety and mild OCD. I have small rituals and things I do and things such as sitting in the same spot and my parents know that I will get very anxious if I can’t sit in my spot, but she just loves to argue back and plop right down in my seat.

What can I do to make her leave me alone? I’m so honestly exhausted and worn out.",16Jul2018,1
377,"So little background information I’m a soon to be 20 yr. old. I graduated high school last year but wasn’t ready for college so I decided to just work for a year to save up money, which my mother (single parent) agreed to. So I’ve spent the last year working some menial jobs. And although my mother hadn’t brought it up for the whole past year she told me for the last two weeks that I’ll have to go to college next year, which is fine except the only thing I know about going to college is that I would like to go to college since it more or less betters your chances of finding a good job, and I definitely don’t want to work those menial jobs for the rest of my life. But there are two big problems I hate studying not necessarily the act of studying in and of itself but more the time consuming part of studying which takes time away from doing what I really enjoy at the moment, playing football. The second problem is that is that there isn’t any specific subject I’m truly interested in enough to study for a long period of time (my interests are more or less miles wide but inches deep). The reason I’m asking how to figure this out is that I’m kind of on a deadline since my mom is forcing me to go to college next year, since she wants to leave Europe and go back to Africa ASAP. I don’t really have anyone who I can ask advice from since my mother isn’t really all that knowledgeable on problems adolescents face because of the way her life turned out. So some advice or another forum where I can figure this shit out would be much appreciated.",16Jul2018,1

381,"My mother and her boyfriend are breaking up with each other every few months/years. The first time was 6 years ago and we actually had to move out of his house, because he didn't want us to live with him anymore (It was too stressful for him,because my mother cared more about my sister and me. He would literally get jealous when she was holding hands with us when we were 3 or 4) . 1 month later they got back together. They told us we were at fault, because we didn't help enough in the household. I later found out that a few days after the break-up he already had a girlfriend who was 30 years younger. So yeah, not our fault at all, now I'm older and I understand that he was not thinking with his brain but rather with a body part located between the legs. Unfortunately, thinking that I was at fault caused some mental issues when I was younger, like depression. 11 months ago my mother asked my sister and me for advice, because she wanted to break up with him. We gave her emotional support and helped to make a decision. She broke up and 2 weeks after that they were back together. 3 months after that it happened again. It atleast took them 2 months to get back together. My ""step dad"" is basically killing himself at the moment. Not doing sport, overweight, high blood pressure and he is too stupid too understand that medicine isn't there to support his unhealthy lifestyle. That's happening for 2 years now.

I've been doing a lot of reflecting lately and the truth is I've always been one of those people who's been able to get by on a low work ethic but above average intelligence and an ability to pull it out of the bag at the last minute.

Well that's just caught up to me. I ran from my last job after 3 years before I was sacked and I've just lasted all of 3 weeks in my new one before they realised I didn't have the drive for it.

I know that I can't go into another job in that industry, I just don't have the drive for it but I don't know where to go next.

I have my passions, I love football, I get furious about politics, I love video gaming, I adore travelling.

But I don't love these things quite as much as people in those industries, I've never loved them enough to make the sacrifices they require.

To add to this, I can't afford my rent, and my savings won't last, I have a wife to look after and I am so angry with myself for letting this happen, I've let her down through a basic lack of ability to apply myself and it's so hard not to punish myself for that.

My boss said unless some one could cover my shift I had to go in.  (No one ever covers anyone else's shifts) Here's my problem with that.  A lot of our residents don't have great immune systems.  A simple stomach flu could put them in the hospital, but never less,  I sucked it up and went to work.  ( I also got a text from my boss while I was at work saying ""pull yourself together, corporate is coming"")
Our schedules are put out a month in advance. My birthday is at the end of the month and I so requested it off. My request got approved and so I started making plans with my bf and family to go out of town.  The prn girl quits (even though she only had 2 days to work this ENTIRE month and at the time she quit my birthday was the only day she had to work.) and my boss said that same day that she would work it for me.  I think great,  I can continue with my plans. I text my boss today and I find out that now it's my responsibility to find coverage or I have to work it.  We don't have any extra people that can cover it and no one is will to work it. So now I have to cancel all my plans and work it.  That same week, I'm covering for another girl so she can go on vacation. 
I love the residents I work with.  It's like having 100+ grand parents.  I just cannot stand the managers. (if you call my manager when she isn't at work,  she'll charge it as overtime for her)  I'm at odds here.

I've always been prone to feeling a little blue from time to time but it always dissipated and I took great assurance in that. For that very same reason, I never worried too much about it - I knew it would pass. But this past year and a half and particularly today (exactly why I'm posting this here tonight) have been really intense for me.

It's hard to articulate into words but I just feel sort of empty? I have a constant feeling discomfort almost and it really sucks. Sometimes it feels like i'm watching myself in 3rd person (as strange as that sounds) I'm not really sure exactly why I am going through but I guess I point towards low self esteem and a lack of fulfilment in my life (i'd rather not delve into the details of all that, it's just mundane and the usual crap to be honest) I also just feel really lonely. Despite the fact I do have lot of friends, I do feel ever so slightly distant from them all at the moment.  I really wish I had the balls to talk to them about it but I don't. I feel a bit embarrassed.

Am I depressed? Probably but Christ, as I said I feel embarrassed saying that. There are people out there with so many horrible pasts, afflictions etc that have way more reason to be unhappy than me. I never thought i'd say this but I really am just an unhappy person and have been for a while now.

Had become pretty friendly over this time, a few texts back and forth every week or so, but about work stuff.  After the new bid, I asked her out again, and she had pretty much the same answer, but she said she would get back to me in like a week, when she could see which day she felt the least drained on, and maybe we could figure something out.  A few weeks passed and I never heard from her, our shifts now don't overlap so I didn't see her at work either.

409,"Background: I (19 F) have been dating my boyfriend (20 M) for 2 years and it’s been a pretty good relationship for the most part. I really love this guy and he knows I does, he’s my best friend at this point. Anyway, then his sister came to study at the same university as us and pretty much everything went kind of downhill from there. His sister is about the same age as me but is one of the rudest, uncaring, frustrating people that I have ever met.

Since I wanted to make a good impression initially, I was incredibly nice to her and overlooked a lot. I would stay up with her until 3am to edit essays and bring her snacks after her performances and let her eat all of the food in my room when she’d show up unannounced and just hoped really hard that she’d like me. But she never did. She wrote essays about “less white” people when referring to the natives in Hispanic countries and was offended when I tried to correct her since I am Hispanic. She asked me if I “liked my hair now that it was straight” after I straightened it for an event. She told me that it was “so difficult” to distinguish me from other Spanish women. She told me the only important Spanish dialect to know is Mexican Spanish because this is America and I have to deal with that when I was telling her mom about language differences and faults in translation. She spent half an hour yelling at me that I don’t matter and that she’ll always have her family’s support because I mean nothing to her and they’ll take her side. I could write a book about worse things but that’s some of the stuff she’s done. 

Whenever I tell my boyfriend about it, he always tries to partially defend her since she’s his family. But I’ve tried to talk to her after she yelled at me and her response was that she was too busy with her trip to Europe to deal with it and to be honest I’m so tired of it. My boyfriend will always be her brother and her family defends her every action because she’s the baby of the family. I just, I don’t know where I stand. I once asked her to stop yelling at her mom once because the mom was feeling ill and I was just visiting but both of her brothers were trying to diffuse the situation and her mom’s response was that I was making fights last longer so it was my fault that her daughter was so rude toward me. Don’t get me wrong, my boyfriend still usually supports me and tries to be there for me but he can never be unbiased and as much as I love him, I don’t really see how I can fit into his life. We’re still young and relationships shouldn’t be this complicated. The conflict with his sister has at this point been happening for about a year. 

I really just don’t know what to do at this point. Any advice would be really appreciated.

413,"I don't know for how long this has been going on but i know that i am becoming more self aware of it and it made me lose all of my friends. I've found 3 new ones though, and i don't want to fuck it up.

This feels really embarrassing to write about because it's so ridiculous and dumb and makes me a huge asshole and generally, a really unlikable person.

I don't even know what to call it so i'll just start by describing it.

I was talking to a friend and she went offline for like a minute. I got mad because in my head, she wasn't browsing reddit and find an interesting post or had to do something, no in my head it all means ""she doesn't care about you and is not as a good friend as you are"" which means that our friendship is not ""just"" which means that i get mad. I didn't tell her that, i try to hide it. She answered and i forgot about it, it happened again and i know how dumb it is to be mad over a person going offline for a minute but i don't know how to stop it. Every reason of logic says not to be mad and that i have ruined all of my friendships because of dumb shit like this but my dumb brain just won't listen.

Another thing happened when i was talking to two of my friends over discord and one of them had to go so i said ""it was nice talking to you"" she said thanks you too. Another friend told me how weird she finds it that i can tell that to people without being really awkward and that she hates telling it because her dad always made her do it (it's a long story but there is some pretty serious issues with her dad and she doesn't like him) and stuff, i said that i get it. She also has pretty bad social anxiety so everything is kinda awkward to her, but yeah i've told her that it was nice talking to her when she had to go too, she said yeah (as expected, she literally told me she doesn't like saying it) and i was like cya. Even though it's completely unreasonable to think this way, i was really mad and salty for her not saying that back even though i knew she hates saying it and she literally told me. I hate feeling this way, i am a manipulative oversensitive needy piece of shit and i don't know how to stop it and control it.

Anyone has any advice for me? Thanks",16Jul2018,1
414,"Yesterday my phone was stolen, however, due to keeping location services on and having google maps enabled at all times. I have all travel data logged and recorded. 


tl;dr: I now know where my phone is and who stole it.


however, I'm not sure what to do from here on. I could tell the cops, I have proof, but the people who stole my phone are pretty white trash and I know they would lie to the police, destroy the phone, and hide the evidence before the cop could get a search warrant, if a cop even would get one for this small of an item.


I could attempt to sympathize with the thief and play along with the fact that, ""Did you find my phone? It says its here, thank you so much for grabbing it before it got rained on! You're a life saver!"" Basically giving them a free card to give it up before taking legal action. However, they could again say ""no we don't have it"", destroy the evidence, and then that would be that.

Not sure what to do in this situation. I only care about the phone because it has hundreds of baby photos and memories on it that are unfortunately not backed up anywhere else.

415,"I've been best friends with N for 8 years. My main complaints are:
- She's very critical, judgmental and negative.
- I dont agree with one of her main life choices (she is using her husband to get a green card but doesnt love him or particularly like him)
- I dont agree with the way she treats her (13 year old step daughter)
- I dont think she's happy for me when good things happen in my life and would go so far as to say she is happy when bad things happen.
- I find her very selfish
- Whenever I tell her I dont agree with her actions she replies that she doesnt want to be judged and wont tell me anything anymore.
- I dont think she's honest / sincere with me when talking about her life.

On the other hand I do think she could just be very unhappy and if that's the case I want to be a good friend and help her get through it.

It would be very difficult for me to cut her out of my life because I really do love her, we have been through a lot together and she is my daughter's godmother.
But the way it is now, the only thing I'm getting from our friendship is sadness.

416,"I’m 22 years old and this is something that just started hitting me after a breakup with my girl of almost 4 years..

So I’m not blaming my parents for me having these insecurities and anxiety but they completely, 100% contributed to it and cause it to Be much worse before or after I see them.

As I grew up I thought they were just absent minded or honestly just not the brightest people. I lived with my mom and saw my dad on weekends, so my relationship is better with my mom than my dad, or so I thought. Basically as I’ve gotten older I’ve started thinking about all the shit my childhood was, only before I never realized that this was on my mom and not myself. And somehow, I took on the blame for all that was wrong throughout my childhood. Living with my mom I was evicted at least 5 times that I can remember, which is fine nothings wrong with moving. The issue is being evicted 5 times, I just chalked this up to my mom not making a lot of money not realizing that a lot of people didn’t make a lot of money. Only this wasn’t the case at all, my mom made $16 an hour working as a cashier and my dad payed her child support from around the time I was 11/12. Obviously making around $2000 a month, with child support, you should be able to support yourself and 1 child. But this never happened.

Now why this is important because these are things my girl would bring up, as she knew all about my childhood and always tried to help me with it. I never let her help me, and this drove her away. 

As I’ve gotten older I’ve learned a lot about my mom, she seems ditzy but I’m beginning to see this as a form of manipulation, she definitely manipulates people by guilt tripping.. I never realized how bad this was for someone to do, I never understood until now, the kind of damage this can cause. This is probably the reason why my sisters have moved far away a long time ago. She’s always talking about how she doesn’t make enough money however, my dad still pays her rent and gives her additional money on top of what she makes. She is still behind on every single one of the bills they pay and she never seems to progress as a human.

 My mom is a hoarder and her homes have always shown this, only it’s got worse as she has gotten older.. it is now to the point where not only is she a hoarder who doesn’t pay her bills for whatever reason but her house is filthy and causes me extreme anxiety whenever I am there. I can’t think straight because it smells so bad, she always seems to be in a foul mood over something so that doesn’t help when I see her. 

My dad was in a severe car accident when I was 10 and has basically never been the same due to a brain aneurism. He’s an alcoholic on top of the medication he takes for his injury. 

My mom and dad now live together, have been for about 4 years. 

If I’m at their home they fight constantly. This combined with her home, her greediness for money and the way I’m starting to view my mom send my anxiety through the roof. I’m trying to better myself and learn from the way I’ve acted in the past to push the love of my life away.  and being around them completely brings back feelings of resentment, confusion.. and... and I just can’t do it anymore, I can’t stand being around them or talking to them, they have no drive, passion, excitement to live, and I can’t revert back to that. The stress they cause is me is one of my biggest demises, I love them, but I can’t do this anymore.. 

Idk if anyone has been in a similar situation but I need help because this is not going to work anymore. I’m going to end up never seeing them so that I can actually better myself and never feel the way I do around them. ",16Jul2018,2

I have no friends, and no one to confide in. I have many issues regarding my self esteem, sexuality, anger, and future. I feel alienated and disillusioned with everything. I have chronic illness, one of which being severe acid reflux disease. I have to take medication and antacids throughout the day just so be able to function, but even then, the pain is hard to deal with. Every since going of the SSRIs, my acid reflux is worse than ever. I have a restricted diet, but I hardly have an appetite anyway. I'm about to start my final year of high school and I honestly can't see myself being able to get through it. I feel like I'm going to fail most of my classes, even though that's never really been an issue for me.

TL;DR: neighbor left garage door open and tools were stolen. I filed a police report. My insurance deductible is too high to make it worth it. Can I do anything else? 


Relationship with my downstairs neighbor is strained and she is extremely difficult and petty. When we first moved in over a year ago she greeted me with a “Im not happy you guys are moving in”...so great start. She also makes a wall in the shared garage out of patio furniture to make sure we stay on our side (which has never been an issue) and soaks our stairs and porch with water while watering her plants just to be especially annoying. Occasionally she’ll yell at guests as they’re leaving (I.e., nice heels or are you finally done for the night”)... mind you this occurs very early in the evening ~6-7pm as we are not a party house. Anyways, the garage door to our shared garage was left open and all my power tools were stolen. All my roommates were out of town so it wasn’t our unit. She left for work around 730 and when I left an hour later I noticed the garage door left open and the tools were gone. I told her about this and she tried to blame it on my roommates at which point I explained it would be impossible since they have been out of town. She says she’s sorry it happened and that sometimes the door is left open (blaming us again) and that’s why she hides or locks her valuables in the back of the garage uhhh ok. 

I filed a police report but I doubt that will result in anything. The deductible of my renters insurance is $500 and the tools did not surpass that in value so that’s a bust. One roommate wants me to tell the landlord (since we’re both renting a unit in the same house) but what would that solve? Another says they’d make her pay for my tools, that’s cool but how? I’m pretty sure there’s no legal recourse because much of this would be deemed speculation. Am I SOL? ",16Jul2018,1
431,"So I feel perplexed. I was part of an all age women's soccer team this year and played every game except two because i badly sprained my ankle. The team was undefeated the whole season and we won the premiership so the club is giving the team a jacket each.

One woman injured herself so badly in the trial game at the beginning of the season she was out. She commented on the group post asking if she still gets a jacket and giving her size. I commented saying ""but you didn't play?"" Another team member commented saying ""I am sure she would have if she didn't get injured"" hardly seems the point? The intention of playing hardly seems enough reason for her to receive something she doesn't deserve.

That means anyone can sign up, not play and then share in the teams rewards that they didn't contribute to. Kind of spoils it for me. Another player, who was working most of the season and played two games tops also asked if she got one because she ""paid her fees"". So what? She still would have paid fees even if we didn't win.

432,"This topic is basically what brought me to Reddit in the first place. For some reason, I feel like I am absolutely powerless when it comes to my food habits / eating. I'm 5 foot tall and I went from 105 to 120lb, I gained 15 lb my freshman year (classic i know ) and now I'm a junior and still haven't been able to lose the weight. I was really skinny my whole life and able to eat a diet consisting mainly of chocolate, cereals and pizza and never gained a pound. Today those unhealthy eating habits have finally caught up with me at 20 years old. I now have really high cholesterol, and I barely get my period anymore due to my unhealthy lifestyle (I have PCOS). I know and have been told by my doctors numerous times that it would help me get my period back tremendously if I just ate healthier and worked out. I'm definitely not overweight but I feel as though my body is used to being skinnier than I am now. Everywhere I go I feel like people are judging how fat I am, or I feel like my friends are probably judging me for how much weight I've gained. I went from being someone who didn't even think about food at all other than when she was hungry to someone who obsessively thinks about food at all hours of the day and as a result I just eat much more. I try all these fad diets but give up after a few days because they're too hard and then just end up stuffing my face with food. Even when I try just counting calories I give up within 3 or 4 days and I really just don't know why. Since I'm really short and fairly small all the calorie calculators online tell me to eat less than 1000 calories a day if I would want to lose 2 lb a week. I just feel disgusting and self conscious and I just wish I could be skinny again just so I could feel normal again. I feel like I'm stuck in this body right now that I don't even recognize, like this body isn't me. I'm generally a pretty confident person but when it comes to my weight I'm just totally ashamed. I know I'm not that heavy, so please don't reply that I should be okay with my weight because I'm just not. I want to go back to being how I was and I just can't stop eating shit.

436,"Everyone I have talked to about this has agreed I am in a tough position right now. I am 20 years old, and have been out of high school for two years. I originally planned on going to a local college and getting a computer science degree but because my grades were too low and my family makes too much money, it would cost me at minimum $60k to do that since I would have no scholarships at all. I was also worried I wouldn't be able to pass my classes since I couldn't do high school math when I graduated. As far as I am aware I can do math up to a 7th maybe 8th grade level. For most of my life I have been far behind and thinking logically is very difficult for me. 

So I looked around for jobs and quickly found out I have the employability of a meth head or a felon. The only jobs I could get were the ones where my coworkers were going to jail on a regular basis because they can't pass a drug test by their PO, or they have multiple felonies on their record. I got an office job for two months and was promptly fired after I couldn't learn how to do the work fast enough, then I was back to working with felons and meth heads. This is how I worked for a while. 

Right now I am part time washing dishes, pulling muscles lifting 50lb of plates because I am weak and very out of shape, my metabolism makes it very hard to gain muscle or weight. Making any jobs that pay well and require physical labor very hard since I am stressing the crap out of my back and joints trying to keep up with just dishes, much less dressers or flooring or whatever. I've tried finding better jobs but they all worse pay, worse hours(either early in the morning or only two days a week) and worse location(far from my parents house where i live). 

Now I am stuck in a hard situation. I have tried learning to program before, and it didn't work. I could never find the drive to do it. Its all monetary motivation which dries up very fast because I quickly learn to hate it. But programming would be the easiest job for me to get and pay the best. It also works remotely since I want to travel around for a bit. I have never tried actual school, so I found one that is near me that offers a AAS degree for $20k(at least, thats what the site makes it out to be, could be $40k) but I don't want to take it, end up not being able to connect the dots on a concept, fail, lose a shit load of money and then go back to washing dishes with debt now. Or spend the $20-40k that I could have just learned by myself. I mean I've been trying to learn how to code since I was 13, it should be painfully obvious its not going to happen, several thousand dollars won't change that. There's also the problem where I have depression which prevents me from actually learning anything on my own because my brain screams at me tell I stop and go game or do something useless. I don't want to spend a shit load of money to go to therapy when all they are going to do is put me on meds which will cost more money and more than likely make things worse. 

I have no record(not even a parking ticket), but no degree or experience or actual skills except in PC repair and Linux but no one gives a shit about that because the skills i have in them are slightly above beginner. I am physically weak and can barely do the work I do now. I feel like I am completely fucked with every turn and plan I make and I am totally useless in the job market. Weak in mind and body, literally no redeemable qualities whatsoever. My parents are asking me what my plan is and how long I am going to be, ""just planning"" and if I am going to get a better job than washing dishes. I feel completely backed into a corner with no way to improve my situation. 

What can I do to fix this? Where do I even begin?

442,"Hello,

So I made a mistake and did poorly on an assignment because I did not fully understand what was expected of me.  I was of course a little upset, but understood my work was just not up to the standard the professor wanted- no big deal, it happens.  I went back to the syllabus (which is, at least for me, hard to follow, but that's a discussion for another day) but literally found nothing really outlining the exact format or content of the assignment.  I emailed and asked if he could better clarify to me where he had put the expectations so that I could do better on the next project for the course.  I did not ask for a redo or any additional points, or even for him to ""reconsider"".  I owned up to having misread or misunderstood, but just wanted to make sure that I had a better understanding moving forward as I did not want to make the same mistakes again.  

He emails back later and completely accuses me of ""whining"" and says essentially that if I had submitted what I did to my boss I would have been fired.  I was shocked.  I never asked for anything other than clarification and re-reading my email several times, I literally do not see where I could have come off that way.  He referred me to an article on the merits of good writing, but nothing on the actual requirements of the assignment, which is what I asked for.  

I responded apologizing for the misunderstanding and coming off the wrong way, and clarified that I simply just wanted to make sure I was on the right track for the next assignment and left it at that.  He then copy and pasted his email response and sent it to the whole class.

I am terrified that this may impact my grade adversely.  I do not want to assume the worst here, but I simply asked for clarification and he essentially blew up on me.  I do not see how I was wrong or rude for asking for some help, because clearly I just did not understand what was expected of me or know where to look for it.  I have never met this teacher in real life, and this is a summer course. (Thank god because if this email alone made me have a full-fledged panic attack I can't imagine what the hostility would be like IRL)  Our next project is worth half of our grade, so I have a lot at stake here.  

Any advice on how to handle this?

That's because I reproved in a lot of classes, and also beacuse I paused my graduation for a whole semester because I wanted to change my area.

Now I'm completely sure I want to persue an programming career. I don't wanna sound arrongant, but I consider my self to be very smart. I like to study a lot modern technology topics and think I can be a very good professional without a bachalor's degree. But I'm afraid it will close to many doors for my career. What do you guys think? Is it possible to have a good carrer without a degree?

Let tell you a little about my frustration on college and why I wanna quit it.

1. There are a lot of useless classes you are obliged to attempt. I say useless in the meaning that 90% of the students won't use anything learned in the class on their professions, and actually will forget everything about a month after finishing the class.
2. On the small number of classes there are actually useful for the market, the professor have a TERRIBLE teaching method and no one understands the class. The ones who do, only understands it cause of online resources, so the teacher was actually useless. I don't know the quality of teaching in the US or other countries, but I study in the best university of Brazil and it's completely awful (useless classes also have terrible teachers, so it's the worst of both worlds).
3. Even if the class covers important topics and the teacher is ok, the avaliation method is terrible, at least in my opinion. Some people might disagree, but I think that tests are a terrible way of evaluate the learning of a student. I guess it's not so much about the test it self, but the way the teacher makes it. Tricky questions, things that you have to memorize to be good on the test, but you wouldn't need to memorize if you are using it for real, questions with subjective answers that the teacher gives arbitrary grades. I just failed AI class because of a trick question. I knew all the theory, but the teacher was dishonest and failed me because of that question. ONE question. THAT'S NOT FUCKING FAIR.

I admit that I failed some classes because i didn't study hard enough. But the vast majority was because of unfair reasons, arbitrary teacher decisions and mediocre teaching. I know that's sounds a little like whining, but i'ts not. I studied A LOT for most classes I failed, and it didn't changed anything.  
I guess that the wordt thing is that I am wasting so much timing studying for stuff I will forget after one week after the ridiculous test, instead of studying somethin really relevent for my career.

That's it. That's was my rant on college. I guess I don't fit there and won't learn many useful stuff for me. The point is I'm afraid of closing too many doors, and maybe should just go on with the thing, cause ALLEGEDLY (if I don't get fucked too many times) I'm graduating next year.

PS: I'm on this rant because I failed on AI because my grade was 4,93333333... And the minimun grade here is 5. Yes, I failed because of 0,07. IT'S NOT 0,7. IT'S FUCKING 0,07. Also I did an optional assignment worth 0,5, but the teacher gave me a 0. Probabily just so I didn't pass on the class, cause even with a fucking 0,05 she would had to round my grade to 5 and I would have passed. But no. She gave me a 0 (and I did everything she asked).

PS²: I started this month a 6 month intern job at IBM. I'm thinking about finishing this one semester and if I get a full time job there, quiting college.

PS³: Everyone in my college are lefties, they only think on parties and smoking weed and I hate them all.

444,There’s this guy I have on Snapchat that is a super bad person. I added him a while ago so I could get screenshots of what he was saying about a death he was involved in and send them to the police. At the time he was living in Massachusetts. Today he sent me a video of his dog stumbling round the room drunk. He also posted multiple videos of it on his snap story and I have all of it saved now to send to the police. He has moved somewhere down south and I don’t know the city or state but I really feel I should report it. How would I go about doing that? ,16Jul2018,1
