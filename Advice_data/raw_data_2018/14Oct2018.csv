0,"I'm 24 and I have never felt so lost in my life. I have like no friends, and the ones I do have are either married, or have kids. I've been through many failed relationships. The thought of looking for someone new feels like climbing mount Everest with a tank top and sandals.. why even try?  I used to romanticize my loneliness claiming its what all creatives feel. Now I live back at home with my parents after years of just failing financially and being irresponsible.   
I had so many dreams and none of them ended with me being back at square one. I feel as if I have failed even though I know there is so much time ahead of me..

I just feel powerless.  


am I alone? what would you do? or does my rambling even make any sense?

1,I see my friends aimlessly scrolling through this app. Like i get its informative and fucked up at the same time.. but how can one get addicted to it. Does the app have anything like friend interaction or something that i can do rather than just sharing some post i like on pm ,14Oct2018,1
2,"Hi there,

I believe my close friend (we will call her M) is struggling with an eating disorder. We are both 22 and are beginning to start our post college lives. I moved to Washington a few years ago, while she lives in Florida still, close to where we grew up. We keep in touch and see one another about twice a year. In the past two years, every time I see M, she is thinner and thinner. When we are together she will only take a few bites of food and she will go to the gym or running every day, but it doesn't seem like she eats enough calories to offset the exercise. The last time we saw one another, we were camping. She drank too much, got physical with me, and woke up the campground with screaming and yelling. She has always been prone to mood swings, but that night made me believe that she is truly hurting and struggling through a greater battle. Our other close friend (who lives in FL near her) says that she currently drinks a lot, and only truly eats after drinking. At that point she will binge eat whatever is available and go back to eating nothing the next day. Our other friend also says that she thinks M is obsessed with image and social media. She says she will often change outfits 6 times before she can leave the house to run even a small errand. When all 3 of us are together, M often isolates herself and it's hard to figure out why she is upset. Living so far away, it has been easy to remove myself from the situation and go about life because I don't see her everyday. It's on my mind a lot, but I have no idea how to support her. Her mum has reached out to me about it, but it's hard to talk to M about it because she has never admitted that she has an eating disorder to me. I am also a very passive person and have been afraid to bring it up because I know it will upset her. Our other friend in FL has done wonders to support and continue being a friend even when M isolates herself.

TLDR; my friend is struggling with an eating disorder but has never admitted it to me. I live in a different state and don't know how to support/help her.

To those who have struggled/are struggling with an eating disorder, how have your friends supported you? What is truly helpful, and what makes things worse?",14Oct2018,1
3,"I was sort of planning to (finally) apply to graduate schools this fall, but now I'm not sure it's a good idea. My academic background isn't very good, I have no money, and my mental health has lowkey been a mess all year. I'm also not very well prepared for application season and haven't taken the GRE yet. Not sure if I should forge ahead or take another year or two to try to get into a better place before attempting more school. I've already contacted one person about a letter of recommendation, so will feel like a dork if I back out, but I'm not sure if I trust myself to do a good job with this right now. ",14Oct2018,1
4,"So basically I’ve been texting this girl for a while. We were at a party together and we spent the whole night talking and I think she was dropping hints but I didn’t try get with her because I thought I was overthinking it. 
Now when I look back I feel like I missed an opportunity and I’m wondering if i should text her asking if she would have gotten with me that night
Any advice?",14Oct2018,1
5,"I don't really have old friends anymore. I live with my partner and we're gonna be doing this long-term so that's nice. Basically a bunch of my friends got professional jobs and ended up doing their own friend group thing. I just didn't class up with them (neither did my partner), and only a couple bother with me anymore. Mwap mwap. It's cool but I've been kind of... rebuilding? 

I've been taking night classes and there are some other people my age I'm in a study group with but it's not particularly social which is fine. I have volunteered for the same org for six years and I'm on the board. When I started, we had a really tight group and we'd go hang out but it's turned into... well, I just don't particularly gel with everyone anymore, both the volunteers and the board. I don't mesh with who I have played with during DnD games - it's most just showing up for the game and leaving, it's nice but that's all. I'm not blaming them, or anyone here, it's just reality and pretty mutual. I go to different community events and don't really get anywhere. I went to a few DIY kind of learning things and nothing. 

I do all these because I want to without the intentions of meeting people, but I'm also very open to it. I feel like I used to be pretty decent at this, and I know our lives get smaller... but it's just way too small and I feel way too young to be this closed in. Maybe this is more of a r/ offmychest post but fuck, if anyone can say anything that worked I'd love to hear it because I don't know what else to do.",14Oct2018,1
6,"I'm having a hard time to accept where I am placed in society. To further explain myself, I have fallen into the ""invisible"" group of society. This group consists of people who have nothing to offer to people. No laughter, happiness, joy, etc. They are people who have nothing unique to their looks or are undesirable by many. It's a group that cant be escaped from so it's often the group that must accept where they are or kill themselves to escape the group. I'm not suicidal by any means and I want to accept it though it's taking longer than I expected.

&amp;#x200B;

I know how it's going to turn into ""but you can escape from this group"" in the replies this will get but I can fully say that I doubt that. The appearance I have can not change into anything better: I can't improve my weight as it's already fit, I can't improve my face as I have no acne or anything of the sorts, I can't do anything more to change it. The personality I have can't change as by nature I'm a quiet person and have traits in me that are totally undesirable by people. I can't really change the side that people don't want as it's me.   


Being undesirable means that people will overlook you. Why be around someone who can't bring them happiness or laughter, or good times in general? Why be around someone who is cynical, pessimistic, and someone who doesnt smile often? I can understand that part and have accepted it but truth be told it would have been nice if I wasnt like this but I am unfortunetly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well what I'm asking as how do you guys accept where you are in societal terms? I know there's some people who have never experienced this but to those who have I'm asking how to accept this situation easier? Must be a fast way to do so.",14Oct2018,1
7,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling a bit. . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and like politely smiled a little (not a full smile just like a tighten lips hard to explain) and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excited like a bit to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the it went like:

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

8,"I (21M) am currently working as a window washer in Albuquerque making $13.50/hr, I get paid for at least 15 hours a week whether I work it or not, but we are entering our busy season where I’m generally getting between 30-40 hours. I graduated high school and did one year of community college but didn’t go back. I have basically no money saved outside of my savings account my parents have built for me, and I’d really like not to dip into that too much. My life has become depressing for me on a day to day basis and looking to make a move for a new start. Ideally I would like to move by March.

9,"So I don't know if this is ok to post here sorry if it's not but I am panicking and I just need a place to type this out and hopefully get some advice. 

I told a really close friend (we used to date, we haven't for around a year but remained very good friends, nothing more)  that I was sexually assaulted a few months ago.  He's the first person I've told and I was just telling him because I thought he's the person that knows me more than anyone else and I wanted to get it off my mind and just have someone to talk it through with, nothing more.  Just someone to listen. 

 However, he reacted by crying hysterically down the phone to me, aggressively shouting at me to 'tell me his fucking name' and that he was going to go and 'beat the shit out of him and kill him'.  I tried and tried to tell him to calm down and that I just needed him to listen and nothing more but he kept escalating saying he was coming to my house and taking me to the police tomorrow and telling my parents and now I can't sleep or stop panicking about what he's going to do.  I feel even more helpless and vulnerable than I did in this situation in the first place.  I've said it's not about him and he needs to respect that I don't want to report it right now or take any action but he won't listen to me.  I ended up hanging up the phone on him because I could feel my chest closing with panic at how angry he was and I messaged him saying that I would like him to just calm down and listen to me.   I sent him a few links to articles on how to react when someone tells you they've been raped/sexually assaulted with advice on how NOT to react in the way that he did as it's very counter effective, even pointing out the places where it mentions to not pressure me into speaking to the police or reacting with anger but he keeps saying it's just 'the way he is' and that I'll 'thank him for it one day' because this guy needs to pay for what he's done.  I honestly don't know what to do and I'm terrified because all I wanted was to just tell someone, and it not to be the huge drama and stress on my life that it now is.  I ended up telling him that I had now told my best friend and she would be helping me with this moving forward (which I have but more because I was just so terrified of what he'll do) and I wouldn't like him to bring it up with me again unless I initiate the conversation but he's refusing to drop it or stop telling me how he's going to 'sort this all out'.

It’s gotten to the point where I can’t hold a conversation with without feeling pissed at him mocking me and I honestly think he has some kind of inferiority syndrome that he’s covering up for.

14,"I live with three other girls, one of whom (I'll call her Sarah in this post) was a good friend before I moved into her apartment. She's a very good person and means well for the most part, but she's been a terrible roommate and it adds a lot of unnecessary stress at home. Some of the things she's done:

She has the master bedroom, which has its own bathroom, and is paying less than she would for this room because we agreed that she and I would share this bathroom. However, when she's home, her door is almost always locked, so I basically have to ask permission anytime I want to use my bathroom.
She was using all of my bath products for a very long time, and at one point filled out my body wash with water so it wouldn't look like it had been used. She has her own products, but they look empty and have been that way for months. I talked to her about it, and I think she's stopped.
She was using and eating all of our food for months. i think she's stopped this as well after an extremely hostile reaction from another roommate.
She was the main account holder for one of our bills and failed to realize that we were constantly one month behind, so we had to deal with late fees and reactivation fees. I eventually switched the account to my name.
She has had so many bounced rent checks that our apartment is no longer allowed to pay with checks or EFTs. We have to pay by debit/credit card or certified check, which means we're paying extra to pay rent now. This has also resulted in hundreds of dollars of late fees, and she denies that she owes money until we pull up the account and show her the payment history.
What can I do about this? My other roommates want her to move out, and I'm leaning towards this as well. I really don't want to fuck up our friendship or screw her over, but this has become a huge source of stress for us and it has a negative impact on our lives. How can I approach this, and do you have any suggestions that would help us ensure she prioritizes living expenses over nonessentials?",14Oct2018,1

19,"So, my mom has been divorced for over 20 years now. She’s dated on and off throughout my life, and had a very brief marriage once that ended in divorce (the guy was a weird religious nut and she was in a bad place following the death of her mother/my grandmother). I know she’s lonely. From the way she talks about finding someone, I know she wants to but doesn’t want to get hurt and doesn’t have a lot of confidence in herself. She hasn’t even dated since the brief Disaster Marriage, and that was about 10-12~ years ago. 

I went to visit her today and noticed she was trying to fill out a dating app. Having used online dating apps before, I know they can be a cesspool. I don’t want her to get hurt, either, but I want her to put herself out there and find someone to spend time with who isn’t a female friend from church who isn’t really even that close to her. She’s been working from home and staying home all the time is starting to make her feel depressed. I got her out of the house today and she felt a little better. But I want her to go on dates and feel pretty. I want her to feel valued and appreciated by people other than her kids. 

What can I do? Is there anything I can do? She’s 55. Are there any free dating sites that would be decent for someone her age or hobbies she might have some luck with?

One day my mom said she couldn't wake him up so she took him to the ER, they ran a cat scan and found nothing wrong. He started having ""seizures"" violently everyday at least more than 10 times a day.( He's made himself throw up before to skip school due to bullies. We've moved to a new state in a small school that has a lot less bully problems) looking at him I thought it was fake. I've had a friend who had epilepsy and he never acted like the way my brother was acting. My mom was going to call 911 because he wouldn't wake up when she held his nose, I walk over there to him and tickle his armpit and he hollars at me to leave him alone. Any time he had a seizure after that I'd tickle him and he would get extremely mad and throw a fit. I totally get needing to heal from a concusion. I could tell that he did have a few  seizures. My family doesn't like me and I say that lightly. 
     He went to the hospital for 4 days and they put him on congnitive rest for a week(no tv, no phone) everything was going fine. Last sunday he began sleep walking. I totally understand that, but my mom would tell me to grab him before he falls and right as she said that he would drop to the floor and I would get screamed at for not being fast enough. About 3 days ago he's screaming meow. Mind you my brother hates my guts. And I'm pissed. He's meowing and running through the house jumping on furniture and stuff. My mom says he does whatever he hears in his sleep(in front of him) she's making jokes about it and he's giggling. I told him he needs to stop it and it's going wayy to far. I got yelled at. He begins to become destructive destroying things. One time I grabbed him because he was going for my laptop and he starts scream meowing and bites me. Later he's sleep walking near the T.V and my mom orders me to grab him before he falls, of course he falls right then and there, except I catch him. He begins screaming and kicking not me but my Xbox he isn't allowed to play due to his head injury. I drag him to the bed he gets off and just runs for the xbox. I tell my dad and he's not even mentally there half the time. He says it's just he needs scientology. My brother's keeping my mom up at night which makes her extremely moody, but won't even dare get mad at him. He keeps meowing and my mom says I need to pet him and love him. I said I wasn't going to do it. Today our dog had puppies so my mom is there helping the dog out and he breaks down a baby gate on all fours and bust opens the door. I found out he had bullies. Anytime I get in trouble because he does something he smiles. Anytime I tickle him he screams and says I'm hurting him. I'm 100% sure this cat thing is bullshit. I'm under so much stress and the doctors aren't going to find anything he's had an MRI and a Cat Scan. He doesn't want to go to school and do his work.

22,"Just got home from a friend’s 18th and I’m still really drunk. We’re all 17/18 (I’m 18). The host has around 20 friends and 20 family members. About 4 hours in this 23 year old family member I’ll call Jake made out with my female best friend I’ll call Jane, who’s 17. She was extremely drunk and doesn’t go out and this guy was almost sober. I go to a sober friend to sort things out for me and I end up talking to Jake. He says he understood what was going on and so stopped himself so I said fair enough and shook his hand out of respect. 

He then goes on to take her phone number so I’m like enough’s enough and he tells me to fuck off. I see clear as day from then that he just went to the young people’s bit of the party just to creep on people so I just saw red. Had a go at him and shit and just got him to fuck off home which I think might have made it a bit awkward for the host and her fam. Is 17 and 23 weird to anyone else? Does the guy seem like a creep? Just need some validation to avoid regretting making things awkward.

26,"This is an incredibly long story. I made a full post describing what happened in detail, which I'll link here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9mjavy/i\_dated\_my\_best\_friend\_and\_ended\_up\_destroying/](https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/9mjavy/i_dated_my_best_friend_and_ended_up_destroying/)

But, if you don't want to read that, I'll give you the short version. I met my best friend through tumblr in May of 2016, and we were best friends for a year until I realized he had a crush on me, and I got incredibly excited since nobody had ever liked me before and so I asked him out and he said yes. 6 months later, I began to feel terribly guilty about everything, so we break up. A week or so later, I'm afraid we're going to stop being friends, so in a desperate attempt to keep him in my life (which was incredibly selfish and horrible of me and I deeply regret it so much), I told him that I was aro and that I wanted to do a QPR-like relationship, and we called that our s/o thing and we did it for around 9 months. Last month, I felt terrible and I knew that I was just keeping him from finding someone else, so I end things. This lead him down to an awful stage of horrible depression, self-esteem issues, and just awful mental health. He already had bad mental health to begin with, and now seeing all of the posts he has made on other social media such as vent, I think he is actually going to do something. If not, he is leaning on the edge of it. I'm fucking terrified. He thinks that I don't care about him at all, but I do so fucking much. I regret everything I did to him and I feel fucking terrible about it. But whenever I tried to apologize before, he took at it as me trying to fake and manipulate my way into us becoming friends again. I still can't get rid of my awful manipulative tendencies and I don't know what to do. I need help. I was planning on sending him the post, to let him know how I really feel, but he said that if one more bad thing happens to him, that he's going to kill himself. I'm fucking terrified. I don't know how well it would end if I talked to him again, but I want to so fucking badly. Every word that comes out of my mouth to him sounds like a lie. I don't know what to do. Please, if you have any advice on this at all, please tell me. I'm terrified about what he's going to do. I don't want to lose him I don't want him to do that please help",14Oct2018,1

30,"Hey everyone, this is my first post on r/advice as I was looking for input from people other than my immediate family and Im not sure who else to turn to. 

Im 24 and returned home from university last year in July. I was on the job hunt for a year while I was freelancing here and there (photography/social media marketing) making very little money.  Admittedly, I was very depressed upon returning home for a bunch of reasons, so I wasnt exactly putting in maximum effort during this time.

At the beginning of summerI got a part time gig at a small art gallery and it's super chill, there are even 3 cats that just hang out there while I work. I make barcodes, label items, work the cash register and all that. Despite the menial tasks and slow days, I like it there. My supervisor is very understanding and shes one of those bosses that feels like a friend but is firm when she needs to be. She is also very encouraging and values my opinion on how to improve the place/keep it running smoothly. I also enjoy art and being in creative environments so thats a plus.

My other job that I started almost 3 months ago is at a fairly big hotel (400+ rooms) as a security guard. Full time, with health insurance and other benefits to boot. The problem is that the department is in shambles. It's understaffed (as Im writing this Im 1 of only 2 security officers on property, on a saturday night, when theres a party going on), there's communication issues, morale is super low, and most of my co workers are retirees that came back to the work force for various reasons. Needless to say, being the youngest guy in the department, a lot of stuff gets delegated to me because my co workers are either old or just too plain lazy to do things. 

Now, I dont like my security job. At all. Its boring 99% of the time, its not engaging for me whatsoever, and the schedule is unpredictable. I just spent an entire month on the night shift, and the months before that I was being moved around regularly on all the shifts. it obviously affects me on my other job (entire weekends with very little to no sleep for example) and I can genuinely feel it affecting my mood on a day to day basis.

The benefits at the hotel are nice, and its obviously great to receive a pay check every week instead of getting a small one at the end of the month, but between not liking the security work, and working the art gallery, Im always tired and I'm not exactly happy (I wouldnt say Im miserable either though).

The reason why Im unsure if I want to stay or leave my security job is because Im basically choosing between a steadier income or a shot at resuming what I love, which is photography. I've saved just under 10k since June, and Im really considering resuming freelancing now that I have some money to keep me on my feet for a bit. I have an older brother who is a popular DJ in my local scene, so my plan was invest in some essential equipment, photograph his parties/events and meet potential clients that way. I also have friends that work in multimedia that have connections. Photography isnt my only interest either; radio, podcasts and video were also things I got up to while I was in school/job hunting.

The last hurdle in all of this is my family. They dont want me to quit, and I understand why. But I can easily see myself going from indifferent to miserable at this security job. On nights, I sit there in a cramped hut, thinking if a million things Id rather be doing with my life. I genuinely feel pressured to do things my family's way because both my brother and my father built their lives off the hospitality industry (they're also workaholics), but its just not me. This is the 4th hotel I've worked in since I was 18 (porter, potwasher, assistant bartender, beachside assistant), and that feeling hasnt changed at all. I'd much rather keep my job at the art gallery and use the rest of my time as I please working for myself.

TLDR; working a security job I dont like and my contract expires next week. saved up a decent chunk of cash, wanna go back to doing what I enjoy, but Im afraid my family won't approve. Please help.",14Oct2018,1

33,"When I was 12 I transferred from private to public school and one of my first friends was Tom (fake name for anonymity). He was my neighbor and one of the first people who was actually nice to me, and he was well liked at our school. I hung out with him and his brother at their mom's house a lot. She was the sweetest person ever and they were a nice family. I even dated him for a very short while. 

We remained friends in High school - we were in band and had a couple of classes together, and shared mutual friends.After graduation (in 2015) I moved outside the country and didn't keep in touch with him. 

In the spring of this year, police reports were released that Tom's mom was found dead in the woods and he was missing and so was his mom's car. I'm from a small state  and a small town so when the news broke, everyone was blowing up on social media and his brother said he thought Tom had something to do with it.

The police went on a crazy search for him and found him in multiple states away and they arrested him. He was put into jail and they found him guilty for stabbing his mom and stealing her car.

I couldn't even believe that the same person that had once reached out to me to make sure I wasn't alone, the person who'd walk me home safe, the kid who you'd never see  without a smile on his face.. had murdered his mom. 

I did some research and I asked some of our mutual friends from my hometown what happened to him in the last 3 years I was gone. I learned that after graduation, everything changed. Apparently he did some drugs and it triggered schizophrenia in him, I didn't even know that was possible to get later in life. A couple people said he started just walking around the neighborhood looking like a zombie and that he had this f\*cked up YouTube account where he would smoke moths and chug entire bottles of vodka and throw up (I saw the videos before the police took them down).

It's been months and I google his name almost every week waiting to hear updates on him but there's nothing. 

I found what prison he's in and I talked to my mom about it and I really want to send him a letter. I know that sounds crazy but I know deep down he's a good person and something took over him. I wouldn't bring up anything about the situation in my letter, I would just give him someone to talk to and ask how he's doing. I really do feel like he ran away right after because he regretted everything.

So now I ask, should I write him a letter? 

&amp;#x200B;

35,"Long***I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls (only 2 of them are in this , a blonde girl and a brunette girl) were there for a few hours in the night at the end before closing time the blonde girl walked up stairs with some other girl to the toilet she kept looking back at me down the stairs and laughing/giggling a bit. . but couldn’t make it out fully. later I walked around the corner towards by where they were sitting one of them (that same blonde girl) was looking at me and like politely smiled a little (not a full smile just like a tighten lips hard to explain) and she didn’t look away and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say whispered excited like a bit to her friend the brunette girl 'that lads just been staring at me'. another while later I was cleaning a table nearby  (they were the last customers left in there it was late before closing) and the it went like:

Brunette: “excuse  me...excuse me” 

Me: *stops to look over*

Brunette: “how do yer get a job in here” 

Me: “oh just online application form and sent it from there”

Then they asked me about a girl who worked in there (where I work) I said yes and she was saying they don’t know her that well and then said ‘yea she’s bit weird like’ (which she is tbh) as she was talking with the blonde girl too but the blonde girl was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ or something like that then the brunette then said ‘well not weird just a bit...yer know.’ and then looked at me after she sipped her drink with a straw then grew a quick smile and said 'she likes you' quipped and they all burst out laughing I just walked away (she meant the girl at work who said she likes me. She doesn’t as these girls never seen me before) then I then went back to finish cleaning the table and it went 

Brunette: “excuse me”

Me: *looked over*

Brunette: “can I ask you a serious question” (she pointed at me saying it nervously)

Me: “yeah”

Brunette; “have you got a gf?” (she said it pleasantly)

Me: ignored her* 

Blonde: *watching the whole thing*  “awww leave him alone, he’s dead cute” looking over smiling and “he probably has” (probably has a gf) (she said it out loud)

Brunette: “have yer, have yer got a gf?” (Pleasantly)

Me: *ignored again wiping the table looking annoyed because I didn’t know how else to act*

Blonde: laughs a bit  and says ‘aww leave it, he’s fuming now’ laughing a bit 



 . On their way out by the door when I was cleaning other tables the brown girl looked a bit drunk and the blonde girl who seemed normal walked towards me and went out of her way a little to say ‘byyyeee’ smiling politely idk they looked like pleasant well spoken girls not loud drunk girls

Edit: a ew hours earlier in the night I thought the blonde one had called me over to ask me something about the menu drinks etc and I went  over to her and said ‘yes can I help you’ and she was calling her other friends over behind me they laughed as I walked away feeling a cunt ",14Oct2018,1

37,"I'm in high school, and I met my friend back in early September. I have a friend group (including her) and we all ride the bus and have a really good time, I always look forward to it. Last Tuesday we both went to Food Lion, bought pumpkins to decorate, and went to my house. I had so much fun it was crazy, we were constantly laughing and talking about things.  It went really well, and I was convinced we'd become a lot closer and that we'd soon be best friends. But on Wednesday, for some reason, she seemed really annoyed by me. I was't sure what it was, since we only talked a little bit over text when she went home. She was only talking to this one guy in our friend group, nobody else. I thought maybe they had talked last night about something and were finishing it. But when we were riding home, the same thing happened. She just had this tone in her voice when speaking to me like I'd done something wrong or said something. She didn't speak to me at all, but spoke to everybody else in the group without the same attitude. I'll admit I felt pretty hurt, especially after we opened up so much to each other literally less than 24 hours prior. Then on Friday, we had school off (the Hurricane caused a lot of damage in my area) and I hung out with another girl in our little friend group. I texted her asking if she wanted to join us. No response. When riding in a golf cart we drove past her house, and it was dark and their usual outside car wasn't there, so we assumed she was just out. No big deal. She also wasn't present on social media at all (she spams her snapchat story and nothing had been on it for the entire day.) But then, when she posted again, still nothing. I texted her again today asking about Halloween plans (wasn't sure what we were doing, as we talked about watching scary movies at one of our houses with another friend.) It's been a while and she still hasn't responded. Before anyone asks, no, I genuinely don't think I said anything bad to her.

39,"I'll be graduating this year after spending 5 years in the university studying what can be called a biotechnology degree in a North African country Algeria.

Since last year, I've been always thinking and thinking about my future and my career in general, after a deep thought, I concluded that it's very probable that my studies will not allow me to have a job in my field of study, it has to do with us (as students) being the first promotion of it kind in my country that they are going to be graduating in this department, there is no established industries or labor market for this kind of degree yet. I know that it can be both a disaster and a great opportunity in the same time, but with a country lacking the proper business culture and infrastructure, it will be very challenging to start a successful business around those circumstances. 

I got more disappointed after seeing a lot of my colleagues switching the degree and moving abroad to continue their studies, which makes it almost like 'save your life situation' with only the financially poor students left over in this degree. 

My country has a bad economical situation, with unemployment among graduated student being the highest in the area, a lot of graduated students either being jobless or working in something completely different from their field of study. 

the problem is with my financial situation, I want to continue my studies abroad and doing a master degree as specialization. but my situation right now doesn't allow me to do that. 

although I have between average and good marks in my curriculum. my English is somehow good and just planning to take a language test in this next months, this won't remove my fear and anxiety about my future, my only hope is to have a nice education and a good job in my field of study that I love a lot.

I feel like somehow life is slipping from my fingers and I don't know what's wrong or how to fix any of it. I'm just finishing my first year at university as a bachelor of science/computer science major living at home and I still haven't found any perspective. I got into computer science because I enjoy things related to problem solving and computers but it was mainly out of influence of my brother. He enjoyed it a lot and people said he was good at it, so when people asked me what I was going to do I just said ""something like that"". Sometimes I feel like I have no marketable skills than being someone with a working pair of arms and legs, I'm not particularly good at school with maybe an average of like B or B+. I honestly derive no meaning from the work I do at university, nothing about it leaves me with a sense that I'm doing something I want to be the best at.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no hobbies really, I've always wanted something to do by myself that I would enjoy but I haven't found it. My attention span is bad so I often just quit doing things quickly because I get bored and frustrated. When people ask me what I do I just say ""sleep"" because it's less embarrassing than saying I stay around home doing nothing. I would honestly like to get involved with more social activities but they tend to make me tired and self conscious. I enjoy talking about meaningful things with other people but I feel like whenever I try and talk to people they kind of talk to me in a courteous sort of distant way. I don't see myself as that strange or anything, people say I'm a nice person and I honestly don't see myself as creepy or anything but it's hard to evaluate yourself like that I suppose. People always seem busy or preoccupied with something going on in their own lives, but that's okay because I'd honestly do the same if I was in their position. I've never had a girlfriend as I went to a boy's high school, but as far as I can tell I don't care that much.

Doubts fill my mind like what if I AM overthinking? What if my friend IS right? This has been on my mind for a bit now..... his friends are always around me.... he never really tags along. This makes me think that like I’m overthinking? They always are looking at me though, so it makes me kinda second guess myself. One of his best friends always looks at me and him in class. I had to talk to him one time and his friends kept looking back and forth at me and him and were talking to each other.

44,"Forgive me if this ends up being a long post. I feel like I should explain everything as accurately as I can. There’s a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to read that.

So, I first began talking to a guy on an app back when I was a sophomore in high school. He was a senior at the time. We got along extremely well and I felt (and still feel) as if we are compatible and complement one another. We have a lot in common and generally get along quite well.

I ended up getting a new phone and lost contact with him a few months after initially meeting him. I redownloaded the app we met on and joined a group. 

One night I was watching Netflix and I suddenly go the urge to go on the app. I tried to ignore it but it wouldn’t go away so I went to the app. (I know this sounds odd) I went directly to the group I had joined and at the very top I saw a post similar to the one he had posted and decided to message the person. He confirmed it was him and he had never stopped looking for me. 

We began talking again and realized we had feelings for each other. We were “together” for a while before he broke it off and said he was depressed and needed to get himself together. He and I talk maybe once or twice a year and that’s it. We have tried to stay cordial when we do speak and it has worked.

Last Saturday I thought about him and soon after he messages me this: I was thinking about you last night. I wanted to apologize for what I put you through. I also wanted to tell you that you were right when you said that no one would ever be as good to me as you were. You put up with a lot, so thank you for that, and thank you for always being good to me when you were.

I’m really not sure what to make of this, especially where he said I was right about no one being as good to him as I was. I’m not sure if he likes me and wants to get with me again or not. We’ve never met irl before, but my sister has a house less than 3 hours away from where he lives and my parents have mentioned numerous times that they’d like to move close to where my sister and her family lived (my sister’s husband is stationed elsewhere but they plan on moving back after his orders change so they didn’t sell the house) so I’m thinking I could possibly meet him.

I’m just really frustrated with the whole thing. Could he actually like me and want to be with me or is he simply being reflective on the past? Should I ask him what he meant? It all just seems too odd to be a coincidence....

**TL;DR former flame I’ve never met irl messaged me out of the blue saying he had been thinking about me and realized no one would treat him the way I did and thanked me. I don’t know what he could’ve meant by his message**",14Oct2018,1

I (22F), recently graduated and started a new job in a very culturally different area of the US from where I grew up. It’s a temporary (rotational) program, so I will be moving around every 6-12 months. 

I hate, hate, hate the area I’m in now. I’ve been holding onto the hopes that I only have to stay another three months... that is, until this week my rotational manager said I might need to remain here another 6 after! I broke down after I got off the phone with her. 

I know in the end it’s a small portion of my life... but there are no other employees my age and I feel very unsafe going to bars/out to make friends by myself (the usual female problems). I’ve tried Bumble BFF and MeetUp with limited success. 

I feel terrible/like I’m bothering my SO (22M) while he works on his thesis (1000 miles away) when I reach out to him when I’m lonely/depressed. 

Every week I feel as though I slip deeper and deeper into a ‘depression.’ I’ve worked on self care/gym routines to keep myself busy.... but my job is unfulfilling and I keep struggling to make it through the day without feeling defeated. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice? 
I know there’s light at the end of the tunnel... but it’s harder and harder to get myself up and motivated each day. Help? ",14Oct2018,1
47,"The thing in question is contact a video game company over facebook. I'd like to approach a small company that has fairly recently released a game on Steam that could potentially use more voice actors for different bit parts. I am an aspiring voice actor (aspiring meaning I have almost no actual experience except a stage play where I played seven different waiters each with different voices and personalities) and I am willing to do a bit of pro-bono work to get my feet wet. Not like I can't make time while working at a fast food restaurant. SO, the question is, should I ask this company directly if they are looking for some free voice lines and stuff? If so, in what way and what should I say.

48,"Sorry this is long, and sorry for formatting.  TL;DR at bottom since kinda long.

My father has an addictive personality.  He went from an alcoholic, to a pill addict.  A few years back he got into an accident at work, and has been in chronic pain ever since.  This was what spiraled his pill addiction.  

He has destroyed my family and broken us down, due to his addiction and toxic/verbally abusive personality.  My mother doesn’t plan on staying with him for the rest of her life, and he is one of the main reasons of her depression and anxiety.

There was one night I heard a loud noise in the house, and I heard someone crying in pain.  I got up and went to see what it was.  My mom had gotten up to use the bathroom and blacked out and fell, taking the TV down with her.  Thankfully the TV didn’t fall on top of her, but she was still in pain as she is older and fell on her back (she’s okay now, it turns out her anxiety/depression medicine was the cause of this).  My dad had been the first one in there, and instead of helping her, he proceeded to yell at her and then go into the garage for a smoke.  I helped my mom get up onto the bed and made sure she was okay.  I was even crying because I never saw my mom in such a state, and I was so scared for her.  I even offered to drive her to the hospital even though I can’t legally drive.  She said she would be okay, and I helped walk her into the living room, got her some water, and laid with her until she fell asleep.  I had school in the morning, but I didn’t care.  That’s my mom.  My dad didn’t even help her.  I had went into the garage and asked why he wasn’t, that that was his wife, and that I have school.  I didn’t mind helping my mom, but I was pissed all he did was yell at her and did nothing to help.

Another time I was stranded somewhere and my mom is 99% always the one who brings me everywhere and picks me up.  For some reason she was doing something and couldn’t get me, and had me call my dad.  He wouldn’t get me because he was watching the game, and he told me that I had to get one of my friends to get me.  It took about an hour and a half for me to find a ride.

As of recently, he has told my mom that SHE is the reason we turned out the way we did (trust me, me and my sister’s aren’t bad and we have a lot of potential... my older sister has a degree for criminal justice, I’m going to pursue a career in video game design, computer animation, and graphic design, and my other sister wants to be a lawyer but is the only one who has been acting up lately but that’s another story, but some of it I’ll explain in here because it relates to my dad).  He also told her that we’re her kids, and not his basically (he’s my bio dad).  This all started because I told my mom how he was buying pills (vyvanse) off of my sister and selling them to buy his own pills.  He constantly asked my sister about her pills and asked my mom if she had got them, so she was able to make it seem like I said nothing and that she had pieced it all together.  My parents left to New York the next day, and while they were on the way back home, my sister had did something really dumb and had gotten her car taken away as a result.  My dad tried to give her her car back, and is basically just using her and helping her sell pills, which is basically saying he doesn’t care what happens if she gets in trouble as long as his addiction is getting fed.

Anyways, I told my mom that if she doesn’t do anything by the time I have my therapist appointment, I’m telling my therapist about my dad.  I don’t plan on dragging my sister in it, as I’m trying to figure out how to deal with that situation another way.  She’s just around the wrong people and not thinking straight, which I’ve been through that phase too and I understand.  It’s just not helping that my dad is another influence and condoning her actions.

Is telling my therapist the right thing to do?  I want him to face some kind of consequence or actually get help.  It’s so upsetting I can’t even be around my dad because his presence is so irritating.  The last time I told him I love him was two years ago... He’s just so far up his ass I don’t think I can convince him into rehab.

I just need advice.

TL;DR:  Dad is a pill addict.  Has fucked family up.  What do I do to avoid my family getting more fucked from him?

51,"I tried making a post already and my entire 5 paragraphs were completely deleted by my dumb phone so I’m gonna give the super cut. I’m sorry if this is incredibly banal but I can’t get this girl off my mind.

We met in my senior year of college (last year). It’d been years since I had a genuine relationship so my time with this girl meant a lot to me. She came out of a relationship with my emotionally abusive ex friend and was really lonely. She was a complete diamond in the rough, extremely cute, smart, and funny, but very very reserved. I was one of the few people to get her out of her shell because we had so much in common.

After we hit it off we spent time with each other every day. We had some very intimate moments that I’ll never forget and in the midst of it I told her my real feelings. She said she wasn’t ready for another relationship to potentially mess up her mental state and ruin her grades. Despite me trying to convince her that I wasn’t like my ex friend the no was a no. She said “it would never happen” but then turned it into a “there’s a chance in the future”.

So fast forward many months spent with her to me graduating and a very emotional goodbye and that was it. That was the last time I saw her. Her and my own financial issues and job responsibilities keep us from traveling to see one another. I still text her daily but that’s all there is. No video calls, not even phone calls. She’s become distant with me despite continuing to answer my texts. So what do I do? Is that chance gone? Did she move on? Do I give up completely? I feel like if I tell her I still have feelings it will only make things worse.  I seriously hate being lovesick but my time with this girl was genuinely unforgettable and I just wanna go back to spending every day with her. What do I do?",14Oct2018,1
52,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash area next to the bar and a girl I work with that I haven’t talked to stared at me as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn’t look away but I looked but I thought nothing of it. The next week I needed tot ask her where this food was going  to as I was holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on",14Oct2018,1
54,"Background context: found my now ex on the Tinder app and I decided to spitefully put myself out there into the ether after we split. We were still together when he decided to make a profile, it was pretty mild: he was basically looking to meet friends in the new city he was moving to. Nutshell: I make a profile with my real intentions, photo, etc. I don't embellish details to make myself sound grander than I am. I wanted to see the real results that would or wouldn't come back. I consistently swipe left until I see a handsome gentleman (48) with a great bio that doesn't sound creepy or fake. We start to banter back and forth and he comments on how I am new to Tinder (I state that in my bio) and asked how my experience has been. He makes me laugh by asking how many men have fishing gear or sunglasses in their photos. We exchange phone numbers a week later and have been talking for over 2 months. My ex had come to get the last of his items from the apartment and went through my phone and found this gentleman and reached out to him by texting him from my phone stating that he is my now ex but that I was speaking to him while we together (lie). Continues to lie about what he does professionally (states he's a professional hacker, etc. to intimidate him). He deleted that text from my phone but I knew he texted him from looking at my phone history the next day. Anyway, I text the older man the next day and apologize and think that messed any chance up but he responds with a snapshot of what my ex text him and states, ""that's what happens when you date little boys"".

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 weeks later: gentleman sets up a wonderful date for us in my city. He lives \~2 hours away. I know he's divorced, has 2 boys, picky about women and looking for someone who, ""blows him away physically and mentally"" when I ask about his dating success. I have to cancel last minute on this date due to work (it was not a lie).

&amp;#x200B;

We plan for me to come to his city on a Friday and I leave work early to beat traffic and he texts me to apologize that he cannot meet that night due to work stuff (there was a riot going on at his work that he had to manage). It was legit.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward another week, we keep in contact, he comes to my city and we meet at a bar and grill and I made the mistake of taking a few shots to calm my nerves before meeting. I assumed that since we were meeting on a week night there would be no expectations or assumptions that more would progress post-date. Then my stupid drunk ass invites him to my apartment. It's messy, he knows I just moved.....I have 2 cats (ex got them for us and left them with me) and we end up having sex and I barely remember details after leaving the restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

We both fell asleep and he leaves around 2 am due to work, gives me a hug, I'm drunk and confused but fall back asleep. Next day he is kinda distant, I ask him if we can talk and he calls and says we had a wonderful time, he wants to see me again, I need to relax and not stress. I told him I drank before and got too drunk and he said he couldn't tell. I ask if he used condom, he said no because I said no. I asked him why wouldn't he--he barely knows me! But he knows I've only been with one other person last 2 years. I ask if I need to get tested or plan B he says no to both and that he is ""fixed"" but pulled out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't text as much as usual the next 2 days (he has his boys so  I know he's busy) but says, ""sweetie, you need to relax. There is no bad vibe coming from me. Nor is there a difference in communication. It's all in your head. I'm just stressed with work and the riots right now"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I text him today a few hours ago just saying, ""hi, hope you had a good day so far and that you've been able to relax this weekend."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Four hours later, and still no response. Am I paranoid? What was I thinking. I know his full details, family, etc. I know his ex after his divorce was younger and they split cuz' he said she was too, ""clingly"". Any advice is so much appreciated. I have NEVER dated someone online I've always been in long relationships but I fucked up by drinking too much and I feel like I ruined any chance even though he says otherwise. Am I being naive ?

57,"It's my own family. 
I'm at a standstill in life due to needing a serious surgery but I'm financially incapable of receiving said surgery despite the fact that I have health insurance. Because of my condition worsening it has affected my ability to work and earn money for said surgery. Creating a vicious cycle. Work in my area is not exactly bountiful either so if I stay where I am I will stay with the job I have. 
My family is quite wealthy  with my father earning  nearly 300,000 a year. But they have not helped me one bit in life. They wanted me out at 18. So I moved and haven't been back. (Living with them growing up was actually quite volatile I've been pushed down the stairs and had knives thrown at me to paint a picture....) 
They wanted me to pay for college myself and even working two jobs it was too much a financial burden to finance and education and maintain a roof over my head. So needless to say I have no college degree but before my illness I was working hard every day and making enough to live very comfortably. 
Now that I need surgery they arent offering financial assistance whatsoever but have offered for me to move in with them to alleviate the burden of most of my bills so I can afford surgery sooner. The problem here is that my family is quite difficult to live with or even spend too much time with 
They consistently berate me on my life, demanding I return to college, demanding i make improvements and the biggest issue (although it may sound silly) is they are demanding I declaw my 6 year old cat. 
This tiny lovely creature has been a bigger emotional support in 6 years than my family has been in 26 years. I love her and refuse to let any harm come her way. I can deal with them being volatile (I think) I could probably even deal with physical abuse resurfacing and being belittled daily if it means I can get surgery faster. But I cant deal with the idea of them harming my fur baby or worse giving her up for adoption while I'm not home (which they threatened to do if I declaw her.)

So I am at a loss on what to do. I'm crushed. Im typing this in tears at a loss for what to do. Compounded with tears from the pain my tumors cause that desperately need removal.

Super happy to be having his baby yadayadayada, one night he comes home and says he wants to go back to the restaurant to drink after hours with everyone.

Weird, but ignored it. I go to work the next day and a waitress, we'll call her Sarah, is staring at me. I think nothing of it and my friend is telling me to go home because I'm pregnant and it's my last day before maternity leave. I go home and he says he cheated on me with Sarah the night before.

I'm super pregnant and super fucked up over it. A week after he admitted it I dig up more lies but decide to stay with him for our child.

I'm in highschool, so it's not exactly high risk, but I have worked hard for this and it is important to me. Anyways all was going well for the first couple of months but now, around 4 months later, it all feels wrong. I feel very alone. 
My staff is very social and constantly throws get togethers and in the beginning I went but now I'm not even getting invited or told about the events by my closest friends who do. I spend a lot of time at home doing homework and thinking about all the work I put in for 4 whole years and how I just want it to be over.
Regardless, I have my suspicions on why this has all gone to shit. One of my people- let's call him Mike-hates my guts because I ask for things to be done right and he wants to do it his way- which does not follow the standard operating procedures put in place. I have called him out for this many times and the instructors that we report to has sided with me. This has visibly made him upset. Mike has this infectious and unrelenting hate that he spreads to other people. We used to be fairly good friends and there were a couple people I hated just because he told me to, but I realized it and tried to salvage my relationship with those people. But this hate, I think he is spreading it to my staff. My theory is that everyone listens because Mike is very defensive and egotistical (which, again, are not my words he likes to brag about his ego ALL THE TIME) and people are too afraid to call him out on his hate and general disregard for other people.
A couple of days ago, my boyfriend- who happens to be Mikes friend- told Mike off for saying bad things about me and in response, he starts telling everyone I am making my boyfriend choose between his best friend and his girlfriend. Which is not true, I just told my boyfriend that it hurt when all this bad stuff was coming from someone he was so close to and he decided to speak up (not for the first time apparently...) And if I'm being frank, that's a fairly tame accusation compared to the other things I'm hearing. 
Anyways, what should I do? I'm debating between confronting him or talking to the instructor that we both report to. For now, I've just been avoiding him. However, my staff seems to admire guys who talk shit to elevate themselves so if he faces any consequences, I run the risk being even more isolated.
 But, I also have the option of graduating highschool a semester early and starting at my dream college in  about 3ish months. I havent told anyone about this option other than my bf- we both agree that it would put my organization in a weird spot and I feel horrible doing that.

77,"Im in a weird moral dilemma. So the other day I bought myself some glow in the dark rocks because our footpath to our house is very dark. So I thought it would be so cool to see these rocks lighting up the way. I only bought them two days ago and set them out. 

Today, I watched my neighbors kids steal my rocks. I went outside and said “can you bring me back my rocks?” They just ran away but def heard me. 

Anyways now I’m not sure what to do. I know they are just kids and glow in the dark rocks are cool. Here’s my option:

1. Buy more rocks. Risk the chance of them getting stolen again and let the kids think it’s now a game
2. Do nothing and lose the ability to decorate my path and the kids will think they can get away with stealing
3. Tell their parents, which seem petty for $3 rocks.

 Currently I’m in Toronto, studying English and Professional Writing as a joint program. I can’t take it anywhere else in the world, but I’ve been thinking about studying just English for a year elsewhere.

I looked on my school’s website and found that most of the options for people in English are of course, in England. 

It peaked my interest, though money would be a problem. I believe Oxford was a potential option, and since I’m already in Uni, I wouldn’t need to be ridiculously academically decorated to go to Oxford for an exchange. 

But mostly I’m considering whether I’d be ready for it or not. I’ve always wanted to visit England of course, and studying at Oxford, even if only for an exchange will look fantastic on a resume. But is it really worth it? ",14Oct2018,1

97,"My little sister has recently moved back home, and things have changed quite a bit in our parents' home, such as my boyfriend living with us. Parents are totally fine with it, as he helps out around with their business (I happen to work there as well to help them out). However, my sister wasn't as keen as of late. She complained how it doesn't feel like home anymore. She did sat me down to talk about how it's uncomfortable at times it was when we shower together (let's be honest, we were tired from work and just want to get it over it to go to bed as we get home past 10). So to make her feel more comfortable, we shower separately. Then one day, she knocked on my bedroom door and literally cried saying ""You know what you did."" and I'm just baffled because all we did that night was come home from work, laid in bed to watch a few short videos, showered separately, and just laughed loudly. So I thought that might be it, being too loud. So I apologized for being loud, and she said that's not it, you know what you did. At that point, she went to her room and slammed the door. Boyfriend felt super uncomfortable, and left the house. 

I can't seem to wrap around in what was her problem? It could be my problem and I don't see it, but from my point of view, boyfriend and I did literally everything to appease her. She once said I didn't wash the dishes correctly, and leave it to her. In the end, I still wash the dishes after days of pileup. She seems to complain when things aren't going her way, even at the littlest of things. If the parentals want her to help out with a shift at the business, she doesn't seem to happy and tells everyone that it's not the job for her. When our grandfather fell ill, she helped a little, but not too much. I would come home from work, ask if she checked on him, she said, ""No, not yet."" This scared me as she had been home for probably 6 hours, and I had been out for maybe 12 hours of the day, only checking before I left for work. I felt like I was tiptoeing over little things because anything that's wrong in her eyes, she freaks out. 

Tell me, is it best to cut her out? Or am I just being overdramatic with the situation? I do love her, but it's gotten to the point where I look back at everything and think, ""Wow, maybe I shouldn't even listen to her and my life may be a little easier."" 

P.S. Boyfriend refuses to come back into the house, hoping that it'll appease her. She has also decided to tell our parents that she doesn't want him over because we aren't married, but somehow it's okay for her to have her boyfriend over. Things are kinda tense between the parents and boyfriend and me now. We are thinking about moving out asap.",14Oct2018,1
98,"Hello, I am a 22 year old female who lives in an apartment and primarily works from home. I have a clothing store online and this week, I put some of my more delicate inventory outside after washing to let them air dry as I always do on a clothing rack.

Once they were dry, I took them inside to photograph them, but as I picked up a piece, a stink bug started crawling up the inside. I shrieked and dropped the clothing. I sprayed the bug with Raid, but it WOULD NOT FUCKING DIE! It kept crawling on the floor at full speed! I managed to grab a broom and had it stick to the bristles, then I tossed it outside and over my balcony. 

I have had a horrible experience with these bugs. They infested my previous apartment to the point where there were some getting in my place every day and being terrified of them, I could never do anything. I was ecstatic to get out of that place and move to a new, clean one. But now it is happening again.

Today I grabbed another clothing article and turned it inside out and another one fell onto the floor! I did the broom technique again but now I have spent the day procrastinating on photographing my inventory as I fear the bugs have nestled their way into ALL of the clothing... This week I have had recurring nightmares of the bugs invading my home. When I see them, my heart races and I always scream and dart out of the room that it is in and can’t bring myself to go back. I am scared of most bugs but these particular ones make me feel so much trauma for some reason. I know it is childish, but  I don’t know what to do.

99,"I'm a 17 year old girl and I go to a mental health service that deals with people with moderate to severe mental health issues. The mental health issues I deal with was first Aspergers Syndrome, which I was diagnosed when I was 14 alongside Unspecified Anxiety Disorder, because I scored higher on anxiety traits though I didn't have one single disorder. Another thing they've thought I have since I have seen them for three years is Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I stayed at a group home but during that time I had an incident where I got angry and paranoid at the staff and I accused her of poisoning my food, basically having a complete breakdown. I went back home to my parents for the night because I genuinely believed she was trying to harm me, but I forgot something so I came back a few minutes later after leaving and a girl (patient) was there as well. I became so frustrated at her for really no reason, I ended up saying that it's taking everything in me not to kill her because she laughed at my breakdown. I was discharged from that place after I went home. After many conversations with the staff they understood that I was genuinely not homicidal, because when I'm stressed I have thoughts about hurting people but I am a really kind, loving person and would NEVER hurt anyone, in fact I have been a vegetarian for the past few years and transitioning to vegan because I don't like any aspect of hurting living things.

After that they spoke to my psychiatrist and had a meeting with my family, and my psychiatrist told me that she couldn't help me.. that another service would have to help me (they are a seperate service than the group home, so they could've kept seeing me). Though my counsellor said she'll keep seeing me.. great, right? It's been two months since and she has cancelled every appointment we have scheduled. We're supposed to see each other each week and she has managed to cancel 6 different appointments on me for taking sick leave, and then the other two weeks was her holiday leave. I am compassionate and understanding if she is legitimately sick, I haven't mentioned my disappointment and I thought maybe it'll blow over time, but it hasn't. I feel stuck now, unable to get help, especially since she just got back from her holiday and cancelled our appointment for last week.

I don't really know her at all and to be fair she's not really that great. I saw my dad being assaulted by someone (he can't defend himself back, he's almost completely paralysed) and the person who did it. I've been having nightmares of seeing that event over and over, flashes in my head, whenever I hear a car driving across the road I feel scared, anything that reminds me of that event does. It was really stressful for me. This incident happened a month ago and I just wanted to talk to my counsellor about it so I could get it out. This really doesn't help with my paranoia because this happened on a casual night, and now I am convinced that anyone coming around my house will hurt me. It's so stressful.

Now that I really am not getting any help at all and I feel so depressed, unable to do anything. Whenever I express disapproval or thoughts about death (I have been suicidal a lot), I just get sent back to a mental hospital and I really hate it there. The treatment really isn't great and I get nightmares about those too. 

I don't know what other mental health service my psychiatrist was talking about, considering I have always been told because I was young I could only go to that one, they haven't contacted me about that and I haven't had any referral from anyone from my knowledge. I feel like after that incident a lot of the information they told me was very vague. Also I have just been fixating on that one comment ""We cannot help you"".. because I feel truly horrible because of it.

101,"I don’t want to write a huuuge text about this, but basically I’ve been very unhappy/sad for the past few months and nothing seems to help.
I used to have a lot of friends, go out a lot, I had the perfect boyfriend, the perfect job, honestly at the beginning if this year my life couldn’t be better. Then, slowly, I’ve started to lose these things, piece by piece, and eventually I was left with almost nothing. I’ve tried compensating with other things and convinced myself that it was good and that I was happy, but I was just fooling myself.
So it started with losing my job. There was a new manager at the place I worked at and he and I did not get along well. Few months later he stopped scheduling me (I am aware this is illegal). Then my boyfriend left me, and it really felt like it was out of the blue. Still to this day I haven’t gotten all the answers from him. I know he didn’t cheat. Everything was great and we were in love and he always told me he loved me and cherished me and one day he told me he didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. Still to this day I still don’t fully know what happened with him. I’ve never quite felt a sadness like I did from that heartbreak. That was in June and quite frankly I’m not even close to getting over this.
Shortly after this breakup I started casually seeing a guy from work to get my mind off things. The beginning was lovely, he was very nice to me. But as the “relationship” evolved I started feeling used. He would only text me at 2am, I was his drunk booty call. He wouldnt answer me when I wanted to see him, only when he did. And I complied. Because I so desperately craved intimacy and the feeling of being cared for and appreciated. I had to end it two weeks ago and he couldn’t have cared less, which hurt me a lot. It’s like to him I was nothing. He’s already dating someone new. Why am I so easy to replace. It’s like I’m nothing special at all
So I started working at a new place during the summer. This place felt very cliquey but I was confident that with time I would make my place. I was wrong. No one was rude or me to me at all, I just wasn’t included in their friendship. Also, (I work in bars/restaurants) that place was very high end, very drug/party/sex oriented, which i thought i enjoyed for the summer, but realized very quick that this is not who I am. So come the fall, I quit.
Now with friends. Nothing happened per se. But I don’t have a solid group of friends. I don’t have a best friend. I have a few random friends from different times in my life that I see maybe once a month individually. But it’s not enough. I feel so sad because I feel like I am nothing special to anyone. No one wants to date me, no one wants to be my close friend. people just want to use me and i’ve come to believe that it’s all i’m good for.

109,My best friends husband passed on Thursday. He has two young babies (7 and 2). I want to make them a little 8x8 Shutterfly book with pictures of all of them through out it. Problem I’m having is what to put on the pages. I want it to be from him and kind of explaining that he’s gone. The family isn’t really religious but the kids have been told daddy is in heaven.

111,"So, my friends and I (we'll call them Karen, Vince and Ben) were given a notice to vacate and, thus, had to move houses a couple of months back. Karen and Vince are a couple. I am not resentful of Ben in this circumstance. 

I have lived with them in three houses at this point- we are, or were, a very tight knit friend group. The first time we moved out together, we moved to a suburb that I did not like the idea of living in. After some amount of pushing from Karen and Vince, I decided to be open minded and we were accepted into a house there. Now, I should note that I suffer from bipolar, and in that first year, living in a suburb that I will now refer to as Shitsville, I was extremely depressed. There were a few factors at play here, but it got to the point where I was very suicidal. I wrote letters, started planning it and all that. When I would walk to the shops, bus stop, wherever in Shitsville I would look around and survey the area, trying to look for a quiet street or alleyway that was secluded enough for me to quietly pass on without being interrupted. 

The second house, the one we just left, was in an entirely different suburb and I had a nice time there. I felt that my life was picking up. When we found out that we needed to vacate, we all freaked out to a degree. We talked about suburbs we would consider, and I made it clear that I would not want to move back to Shitsville. As time went on, inspection after inspection, Karen and Vince were getting increasingly annoyed that I wouldn't consider looking in Shitsville. They would keep sending properties in the group chat, tell me that I was limiting the search to a great degree (even though they boycotted plenty of fine suburbs). I would also like to note that Shitsville is a stone's throw from their work and schooling commitments, but Ben and myself have to travel very far. 

I continued to state that I didn't want to consider Shitsville. They pressed and pressed, so I told Karen that the thought made me depressed, that I still feel haunted by how severely upset I was at that time and in that era. Though she was receptive at the time, a few days later she was sending places in Shitsville. Eventually she yelled at Ben, who also didn't want to move back, about how silly it was that we wouldn't move there. Time was ticking on, we were getting desperate, both Karen and Vince were wearing me down and not dropping the subject. 

One day, I woke up and they had been to an inspection in Shitsville. They never sent the property on our collective chat, only to each other. They said they really liked the house though and they'd like us all to apply, and we only had a fortnight remaining, so I folded... and I applied. And we got accepted. 

I know this is first and foremost my fault, for being weak, and being a doormat. But now, I am spiralling. When I walk around this suburb, I see apparitions of my dead body in various places where I had formally visualised ending it. Being here makes me feel dark, disturbed, and kind of sick in my core (but they're over the moon with how close to work and school they are, yay!). Although I resent myself the most, by far, I can't help but think that they truly don't give a shit about me or how I feel. How many times did I have to express my reservations and why? Twenty more? What should I do now? I'm crumbling. ",14Oct2018,1

I'm a teen that made this account just to ask this question.  (I have no idea if this is the right sub, if it's not I'll be in my way.) My D&amp;D friend brought over I think sour patch for a session one day, and he spilled the sugary powder stuff into the carpet. We aren't allowed to have candy in my room, specifically for this reason I guess.  My parents are very strict and we would probably not be able to play D&amp;D here anymore and I would be grounded. My friends and I try our best to clean this stuff up without my parents noticing, even sneaking up the hand vacuum and vacuuming it up as ""quietly"" as possible. We thought we got it all and we went along as normal. 

Well shit. About a week later I wake up to find ants crawling the carpet where the sugar spilled. They are crawling in through the small cracks in the windowsill. I have tried Borax and sugar and it hasn't worked. 

Reddit, you are my final option. If this doesn't work (which, let's be real, it won't) I'll probably just tell my parents and they will fix it and ground me.

116,"So, I'm 16 and a junior in high school. My parents' credit/debit cards have been getting declined for the longest time, and we were supposed to have money in the bank this month and try to not spend it all at once on taxes and now my mom said that, for the second time this year, we have NO money in the bank. She just got paid less than two weeks ago.

I do go to a private high school along with my twin brother, and my two younger siblings are going to a private middle/elementary school. I've been going to this high school all my three years, but we have a local high school around five or maybe even less than five minutes away (by car). I've been getting scholarships (my twin has not) for the past two years to help my parents pay for our school, but I'm beginning to think that along with the expensive schooling and my dad's poor financial planning, I need to help more. I have a job, but I'm saving that money for college (neither of my parents has been saving up at all for my college or my twin's tuition, so i can't help them out like that). My twin and I have lots of old friends that go to the local high school. (I didn't really get along with my old friends, but I can't keep living like this. I need to help out, because in the end, I fear the bank may take stuff from us if we're not able to pay. We barely have any ""food"" in the pantry, Each time I enter the house I only see letters from the bank(s) piled up near the front door. I'm really really worried). My parents keep telling us that only one more year, and my twin and i will be gone, and so they won't have to pay such expensive tuition anymore. Another thing that's affecting us is that my school did not give us financial aid (we're stuck right above the maximum, so they weren't able to give it to us. We're right around $70-80,000 a year with my parents combined). I'm leaning more and more towards going to the public high school and just going there for a year. It's only for a year, it's closer (I take a bus to my current high school. it's an hour and a half away), and it's not like I don't know anyone who goes there. It's not like it's the first time I've gone to a public school either, the old ""friends"" i have there are from my previous public elementary schools and my private middle school, so I've had a taste of both. I should go there, right? I mean, even if I don't want to be with my ""friends"", I can still be with my twin brother.",14Oct2018,1

119,"I'm a pilot, I live with one of my coworkers, we'll call him Tim, who is also a pilot  We are both first officers at a fairly small company, there's about fifteen of us there in total. It's a two crew operation, so I see my roommate at work some mornings but most of the day we're out flying with a captain. Since we're both first officers we never fly together. 

Tim gets angry very easily. We live in a house, I'm on the main floor he's in the basement, and I can hear him yelling on the phone from my room most days. He usually is yelling at his mother (including lots of ""fuck off""'s) but he also yells at his ex, at friends. He yells at himself. I hear him angrily muttering under his breath all the time too. Every time he picks up his phone he dies a hugely exaggerated sigh before storming off. It's hard to really describe but his demeanor gets just so clearly pissed off. 

I have no idea what he's like a work. Like I said, me and Tim never fly together. But at home he's not what I would consider mentally stable. 

We are both only a few months away from being upgraded to captains and I keep thinking about how, having lived with him, I wouldn't feel comfortable flying with Tim as my captain. Having seen how he reacts to minor things I wouldn't want to be sitting next to him in a plane that he's responsible for when something inevitably goes wrong. We fly old planes, eventually something will go wrong. 

In most cases I don't think it's right for someone's personal life to affect their job, I don't think it would be right for me to go to management and badmouth him and possibly cost him a promotion. But I also don't think it would be right for me to say nothing and for an incident to then happen because of his temper.

123,"So, I won't get too sappy here. I'll so my best to keep this straight and to the point. I'm pretty sure no one has ever for love advice on here. That would make me the first 😉. I know how she is with leaking details online so Ill make this as vague as possible location wise.

About 2 months I met this girl. Honestly I had seen her around much longer but didn't think much. (usually don't tend to pay much attention to people I don't know). She kind of just came out of no where. We found ourselves in this ""group trip thing"" (anonymity YAY!) for a week. As it is college related boys and girls were separated when it came to sleeping. For the most part alot of this trip took place inside of our bedrooms so I found myself just hanging out and bonding with the boys I was staying with. Actually for 95 percent of this trip I wasn't interacting with her. A couple of the other girls hung out with us while we played cards for hours. These were the people  I spent most of the trip with. One day while hanging out the topic of video games came up amongst the guys. (college boys talking about video games how rare). Being the only person who played games on a computer I was getting alot of questions. ""How much was your PC?"" ""What's PC like?"" ""Should I build a PC?"". Eventually someone asked what games I played and I mentioned one of my favorites was a game called League of Legends. One of the boys responded saying oh that's the game M plays. At first I was just shocked that someone else played the game. It was my first time knowing someone in real life who played league. Afterwards my brain was confused. What is an attractive girl like M doing playing League of Legends? (turns out she has an older brother) Fast forward to the last day. Everyone is packing up, our bags are lining the hallways and we are waiting for the bus to come. By some miracle I ended up sitting next to M on the floor with one of my new friends to the left of me. Me not being smooth what so ever couldn't just introduce myself to her. I hate to avoid appearing like I'm interested as soon as I meet someone. In my opinion going hey my names Max what's yours out of no where just screams I like you. So I turn to my left and just start talking loudly about league of legends to my friend who has never heard of the game and plays Call of Duty all day. My friend looks at me like I'm speaking Chinese until I hear, ""You play league too?"".  Mission accomplished. We start talking a bit about the game. What we like, what we hate etc. Sometime during my conversation she asks me for my league name. As soon as I say it this girl pulls up my stats and starts scrolling through my match history. She asks if I'm sure that's me and makes the comment, ""You don't look like you play league"". Not sure if thats a compliment or not. Oh boy I'm rambling apologies. 
Fast forward. I'm back in my dorm. After some work I log onto league and see a friend request saying sometimes along the lines of, ""hey its so and so from blank"". I add her and ask her which one she was (as a joke) because there was another girl who shared her name at the thingy. Over the next couple of days we started playing the game together online. Throughout our sessions she gives me her number snap and other details. (without me asking) 
In present day I only see her once a week for about half an hour but we text daily. Usually for a while in the Morning, and for a hour or two at night. (when I say text I mean some talking on the phone too.) She shares my views on the world, political and social. She was raised the same way as me. Our parents are literally identical. We like the same things. We think the same. On top of everything, she is just stunning. M hardly wears any make up and is hands down one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen. During our conversations she has made some hints which make me think she's interested. M asks stuff like if I work out. (she works out every other day). She's said I look like the perfect candidate for pull-ups. I was telling her about some of my best pickup lines I've made up in the past, she mentioned I should continue making them until she actually laughs. (she was laughing plenty on the phone) This is the part that kind of confuses me. She texts me every single time she rejects a boy in her classes. I've gotten like 6 of these texts or calls. It seems pretty random getting a text about a guy next to her whos into her. Im not going to act jealous about a girl who isn't mine so I usually just make a joke or poke fun at her. (tell her she's cruel for not giving a chance). One time she texted saying there's a hot boy sitting next to her out of no where. I have no clue what she expected me to text back so ofc me being my goofy self said ""ooo send a Pic 😍"". Does anyone know what she's trying to get from these texts. Have I been friendzoned and is she texting me like one of her friends. For every message I get like that there's another one implying she's into me. The other day she said something about abducting me and forcing me to get ice cream with her. She texts me when she's at the gym. (is this an invitation). I just don't know what to think. In my eyes this girl is perfect and I don't want to make any wrong moves. She came into my life out of no where when I wasn't even looking for girl. 
Here's the last drawback. She's a year older than me. I know this sounds stupid but this is really giving me alot of doubt. Does this make her look down on me? On my birthday she texted me something about ""befriending the younger generation"". Is this just flirting that I'm over thinking? Does the age difference matter? What should I do? If you were me how would you approach this situation?

That same day she invited me to her vollyball game and obviously I went, after the game she hugged me, I know it's not much but after then I was pretty sure she liked me too, so the next day was the first foot ball game of the year so I decided to ask her to homecoming. She said yes and he and her 2 friends went to her house and started spending a lot of time together, it was one of the greatest parts of my life. 

After probably a week or so of hanging out and getting to know each other (she was 15) found out that I was 13, a day or two later she texted me that she wanted to get to know me better before we started a relationship, at the time I thought nothing of it and just decided to.give it time, we were still great friends and it felt like nothing changed. We still went to homecoming together and I thought things were going to continue as us being good friends. And then she stared dating someone else and for a week or so I felt cheated and pissed off but then I realized that she didn't do anything to lead me on and I accepted that she was with someone else. But last week she stopped talking to me, after class we normally talk for a few minutes before I walk home with my friends and when I tried to talk to her she just seemed really pissed off at me.

Now just a few weeks ago it was D birthday and me and G set up a full day of fun and events for her, and it was going good.

Now we had a few things set up and I lied to my mom telling her I was doing a project at school when actually I was with G in the morning to pick up D from her place. In the process I met Gs parents for the first time even though they are very active and involved in school. (Side note i went to prom with G, so they've been wanting to meet me for a while) so after the morning events I went home and got ready for the afternoon event which was with me G, D and a friend of mine. Us 4 went together for Ds birthday and had some fun. Now I knew my excuse of ""school"" wouldnt last and afterwards I had to come home. The issue is that mom thinks I was doing a school project but rather was with G and D the whole time. So then at the night they had prepared a party at Ds place that we have been setting up for a long time now, and I knew i wouldnt be able to come.

131,"On 10/10/2017 (yes a year ago) I had purchased a part for my vehicle through a dealer in my car community. To make a long story short, there was a huge delay and I didn’t end up getting the part until 12/06/2017. I had messaged him every week asking if he knew when it was going to be coming and it ways always something new. “Still waiting to hear back from the company who has it” “They had the order but didn’t process it” “They said they had shipped but I had forgotten to contact you” etc. To be fair, I have no clue what was true and what wasn’t, he could have been lazy, lying, or just out of the blue from the company who makes the part. When I received the part on 12/06 it ended up being the wrong one. Immediately contacted him and he said he would get the right ones out and send a partial refund. Took about 3 weeks but finally had received the right part on 12/26/17. We had then contacted back and forth for months talking about a return label so I could get the old part back but he had never sent one. Always brought it up, but never actually sent it. Its been 10 months and I still have received no return label and no partial refund. I reached out to him a few times since then and still nothing. I even contacted him about a completely other topic and had gotten no response which was on 7/31/2018. At this point I really just want to get rid of the old part and have thought about selling it. Two things I am worried about though. 1) I sell it and he contacts me right after and says he has the return label. 2) I sell it and need to purchase another part in the future from him and he brings up the part I sold.

I worked my butt off in high school to get in and am so grateful to be here; I love my classes and professors and it has helped me secure great internships and my dream job (!). However, despite all of that, I feel like I have really struggled socially. 

Throughout high school, I had a huge network of friends through different sports and organizations and was always hanging out with different people. I was probably almost too social and out of the house all the time but had such a fun experience. When I got to college, my freshman dorm was REALLY quiet which was a big change for me. It was a hard transition and I struggled to meet people. Freshman spring was sorority rush which I tried in search of finding more like-minded people, and that helped temporarily. Fast forward to sophomore year, I had made a couple of close friends in my sorority house and was feeling better about my school as a whole. I felt more adjusted when I came back from summer break and was looking forward to a hopefully MUCH better year. Then, in October, my closest relative outside of my immediate family was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. He passed away only two months later and it all happened so fast. It hit me HARD and I was miserable and grieving so I pulled back from any social outings and just tried to focus on my classes. Next semester I barely went out or did fun things with friends because I was having a rough time dealing with it, and even worse, my friends in my sorority house weren't supportive and stopped inviting me to things that they were doing.

Junior fall came around and I went abroad for an exchange semester in Europe by myself. Unfortunately before I left, I was diagnosed with some health issues that would make it nearly impossible to eat normally in the country I was going to be living in for the next 5 months (this diagnosis happened literally the night before my flight). That being said, once I got used to living alone in a foreign country, it was amazing for me. I felt truly independent and was so happy to be exploring the world and meeting new people away from my school in the US. Fast forward to junior spring, I was back at school and feeling the worst I've ever felt. I was lonely, sick all the time, stressed/anxious, and dying to go home. Because I went abroad I had a shitty housing situation which made things even worse.

Finally now it's senior year and things are going a little bit better. I solved most of my health problems, have a much better housing situation, I'm finally a little bit less busy than I was in previous years, and I am trying to enjoy my senior year. But I just feel like I'm in such a weird spot. I had many nights out early on in college and even late in high school and I'm over the whole frat party/bar scene at school. Yet those events are the main social outings. I'm still in my sorority but feel like only a few girls are good friends of mine and not just acquaintances that I don't enjoy being around. Although I found my people in high school for sure, I just don't think I ever found them in college. People are so cliquey/cutthroat/competitive and quick to judge here and idk if that's the competitive nature of the school or what. I doubt I'll stay in touch with a lot of people here, yet I want to try to enjoy the rest of my year regardless since you only get to go to college once. I guess feeling restless is the best way to describe it - I haven't enjoyed a decent amount of my time here (despite all the amazing opportunities it's given me) and am trying to consciously make an effort to now, but then when I do try to push myself to do things with people I'm not that close with I get kind of exhausted.

Does this get better post-grad? I've made really close friends abroad and through internships but just not at school. Are there opportunities to meet a lot of new people and make new friends right out of college? Hoping this isn't a stupid question; I'm the oldest of my siblings and find it hard to talk about this with other people. Do you guys have any advice for surviving the rest of the year and trying to be more positive about everything? Thank you so much

So I know there are stretching exercises which slowly do give you a few centimeters in hight but this hight goes back to normal eventually. So I thought if I do these exercises and once I gain a few centimeters I could try eating a diet so that that nutrients I get from the food somehow keep those centimeters I gained.

So is my idea possible or its just impossible to gain height like that, if so do you know any way a teenagers could gain height??

141,"Hello all,

I am 32 years old and am just about to finish my AA. My GPA isn’t extraordinarily high, but I feel that if I’m going to work hard at something, it has to be worthwhile. Nothing fills my heart more than to be able either treat animals, or to be able to give people proper care. I love animals more than anything, and thinking about being able to help and care for them just makes me light up. 
On the other end, I would love to be able to be a physician that tends to overweight patients. Being overweight most of my life, I know how it feels for doctors to just attribute every symptom to the fact that I need to lose weight. Which of course is sometimes false, and the real condition is overlooked and made worse by a misdiagnosis.
I just don’t know where to even start. I have been trying to complete my AA for about 10 years.
I’ve gone part-time/full-time for awhile, sometimes taking more credits than I’ve needed in certain areas (mostly psychology classes). I’ve been working at an optometrist office for the past 2.5 years and can’t stand thinking that I’d have to be in my position for the rest of my life if I don’t complete my schooling. 

I haven’t really known what I wanted to do until now. I was considering nursing or teaching, but those two options would feel like I’m settling (no, I don’t think either of those careers are bad options, it’s just not what I envision myself doing). I have a loving partner that is encouraging and extremely supportive of the idea. I just feel like I’d be crazy to even think that I am capable of such accomplishment. 

If anyone has been in a similar situation, please shed some light! 

Thank you!!!",14Oct2018,1

143,"I live in a suburban town, but since I was a toddler I admired more urban areas. I've wanted to live in the city since age 6, but recently that wanting has grown to a pain in my chest telling me I don't belong here. I'm a teenager, and my family is stable here. I'm certain that it's best for me to stay here for my education and ""overall well-being"", but I fear my mental health is generally being impacted by my admiration of pop culture and city life. Along with this, my current house makes me feel... icky, for lack of a better term. It's getting more run-down every year and since my parents divorced my mom put a security camera in our living room so she can check on us while my dad is over for visitation every sunday. The thing is she never takes the camera down, and it makes me seriously uncomfortable. I talked to our counselor about it and she said my mom has the right to feel insecure about me and my dad being together due to past events, but I feel like I'm being watched whenever I'm in the living room/kitchen. Sure, I can always go to my bedroom, but my bedroom doesn't have food and a tv. Every day I feel stressed from school and I just want to throw my stuff on the floor, sit on the couch, and cry. I can't do that because I'm scared I'm being watched. Camera aside, there are spiders in the kitchen and downstairs bathroom and my room has a very stained carpet since I used to hoard trash in my room when I was 8 (thats a whole other story I really don't want to talk about). Overall, I have bad memories in my house and I just want to be alone for once. I know this is a typical teenage thing, but it's hurting my self image and mental health. 
I've tried decorating my room and changing my wardrobe but nothing really keeps the feeling of not belonging away for long. I look out the window and my head says I should be looking down at lights and streets, and when I'm on the school bus I feel like I should be walking to school (although I live a few miles from my school) and all that. I've hung up lights near my window and hung a pride flag in my room in an attempt to motivate me to make a place where I feel near home, but nothing helps because I can't replace my gross stained carpet. I feel like I've run out of options. What can I do to feel like I belong, or like I'm closer to somewhere that I belong?

145," my whole life my dad has been a severe alcoholic, a bottle of vodka every 1-3 days. as a kid he hid it from me and treated me nicely and made me feel like he was a nice person. around 12-14 he started showing his drinking habits more   
and more. it got to the point where i was basically consoling him as he cried in a drunken stupor around 4 times a week.   


after that i moved back to my mothers house and ignored him only talking to him if he messaged or called me but he did that rarely. around 16 i found out that he had been growing weed in his house while i lived there and was forcing my older brother to sell it for him starting from when my brother was 15 till he was 19.   


while my brother was living with my dad a man broke into the house trying to steal my dads weed plants. the intruder stabbed my older brother in his shoulder with a crow bar which hospitalized him.  


my brother moved out of there, only to find that my dad had invited the intruder to stay with him as long as he payed rent.   


What i didn't know is that my brother had been dealing with my dads alcoholism since he was 9 years old or so.  


my brother has recently been forgetting things that i told him the day before, and has started talking to himself and people that aren't there including god. this is definitely due to my dad as he basically mentally manipulated my brother for years.   


I just don't know what to think about my dad anymore. part of me loves him and thinks he is awesome because of my early childhood where he pretended to be nice to me, but the other half of me hates him as he sends me emails all the time saying the same things like ""i know i am a terrible dad"" and ""I'm trying to fix myself"" he has been telling me this for years and nothing happens.   


Whenever i see kids with their dads having fun i get reminded of my dad and get really upset, and then i feel bad all day.  

 there would be weekly family fights often resulting in my dad often calling the police to deal with the situation. it got to the point where the police knew us by name and we called them 10 times in one year once. sorry if this is to full on, just been looking for somewhere to vent and ask for advice.

Various factors go into my current situation: failed move abroad, autism, unemployment, etc.

I don't work and yes I'm trying to get back into work, in the mean time I've been volunteering but the roles I've been in haven't really been ideal for meeting people - eg. working with criminals, elderly, or people with special needs.

I was using meetup and it was great, but members were cliquey so I didn't integrate too well and then I dated well-liked member who became abusive, so unfortunately meetup is just out of the question for me which is a huge blow.

People said we would be friends for life, and I suppose they called it right. For many years, we talked every day and shared our most personal secrets, but we never dated. Supposedly he liked me at one point, and I liked him; however, these feelings (if both existed) were at different times. As I grew up, I realized that as much as our parents wanted us to date, we were too different for that. Nonetheless, we stayed good friends. A few years ago, he drove up to see me to celebrate his grad school graduation, and we went to a friend's house party. He became so drunk, that he assaulted me in a few very aggressive ways. We ended up talking about his actions and if our friendship was more than friendship at this point, and it became all so emotional (he had a gf at the time, too, but told me not to tell her). We both agreed to stay just friends, and he apologized a lot for his actions. I added that I could not allow ourselves to hang out again in the presence of alcohol if it meant keeping our friendship. 

Now, over 3 years later, I would like to have him at my halloween party.

Time passed and we would go skating together, go to the movies together and basically spend as much free time together as we could, but she would still deny our friendship in front of others, going as far as mocking me by calling everyone friend except me. At the time I was quite lonely, so I didn't mind that kind of stuff. However, I started to feel unconfortable whit our friendship when she started asking things like driving her to places, run errands for her and the like.

I need to point out that she has a softer side. She invites me over her house for dinner, and I get to vent out all the shit that has happened to me during the week, and we can talk just about everything,and a few times she has thanked me for being her friend.

159,"I have been in love with my friend for a few years now. She is everything I want in a girl: beautiful, geeky, and very intelligent. She is also very polite with me and she never wants to be the cause for my discomfort. Similar to same field of interests (which was very big for me), and everything about her just seemed to align perfectly with me. Internally things like wholesome conversations and interesting conversations. External things like when we are home for college, we are literally a five minute walk away from each other. My parents, at least my dad, actually likes her and approve of her, and that she is a cool young lady. To add onto that, she genuinely enjoys my company: she is all smiles and giggles with me, and I feel like she genuinely likes talking to me because in our last hangout, we were binging a show and instead of watching it, we just chatted and it became background noise for us. Though she is awkward and has very strange body language that makes me think otherwise about how she feels about me at times, I still accept her and love her.

But she doesn't feel that way about me. She rejected me about a year ago because she said she was never interested in anyone but said it wasn't me. (I had hope for change though since the people at r/asexuality told me she was just figuring out herself and to give her time). But to add more badness to the mix, I opened up to her my depression around that time as well and I get very paranoid knowing that she knows that I have it. She hasn't done anything to make me think that she doesn't accept me but I show her how paranoid and insecure I am in some of our conversations because of her strange body language, and I hate myself for it sometimes. But the ice on top is that though she is the most closest to me out of our group of mutual friends (that she doesn't even chat with outside of the hangouts I invite her to), I give side hugs while everyone else (even guy friends) get full embraces. So yeah, feels bad man.

Recently, after the last hangout where it was just us and we had a lot of fun, we had a bit of drama. She ghosted me out of nowhere and it made me feel like I was the one who caused the distance. Talked with her brother and he told me that she said I had said nothing wrong but oddly enough, assured the opposite. A few weeks later, he tells me that she is doing better but when I texted her, nothing. For a month, she ignored my texts and I finally got a hold of her a few weeks ago. She told me that she still wanted to be my friend and that she was just very stressed (presumably with college and life) and hadn't like talking. I just gave her how I felt about the ordeal and wished her luck, and told her I'd be back around Thanksgiving. She said sorry a lot and I felt bad about it after. It ended on that note. 

Talked with a Reddit friend and when I told him about the entire ordeal, he said that I was so close to getting into a relationship with her, which confused me a lot. Because I feel like I am constantly fucking it up with her with my paranoia. I made a post just venting my feelings on another subreddit another day and a guy commented that it is possible that she may be gaining feelings for me but that she doesn't want to act on them. Said that it may be because she has never felt them before and had a friend in a similar situation and she went away from him for years. Looking at how the brother kept assuring that she keeps feeling the opposite about me, and looking at how well our hangout ended before she left.

But after the month she was ghosting me, a new feeling in me started to emerge for her. Resentment and hatred. I know she doesn't deserve it because of her life situation now and she may just cope with stress the way she does but they way she did it pissed me off so much. Just ignoring me and not even telling me what was up for the time. Then I went back to previous conversations, where it was like she said the wrong thing, and it piled and piled until I began to think bad thoughts of her. And paranoia makes me feel even more distrustful to her after that.

I'm stuck in a cross between loving and hating her. I want her in my life because in hindsight, she is my best friend. A friend who I genuinely connect with on a level that transcends any other friendship I had. At the same time, she doesn't see me that way but everyone else around me is hyping me up for something that I am afraid to bring up because of the fear of rejection again. A significant part of me wants to believe them but part of me knows it can't be true. But a incremened part of me  hates her for the things she didn't say or do right for me, which I know it's not fair for her.

I know a good answer is to find another girl and I have tried. We go to different colleges but I don't connect with any other girls there. Nothing feels the same rather than it was with my friend. Conversations feel forced and I realized I don't really care about them. And I know my family won't accept them because of their values and beliefs (which is a big part of who I like as well). But the thing is I have ever only liked a very, very small handful of girls in my life (three to be exact), almost like a criterion. I can't just force myself to like them as much as I am trying, but I feel nothing.

161,Im 16 and I swear whenever I meet a guy he knows he always says “she’s looking for a boyfriend” “she’s single” persistently. Even to guys that aren’t in my age range. But the thing is I’ve never told him I’m looking for a boyfriend. I’ve actually never expressed any desire for a boyfriend to him ever. I’m content with being single. I’ve told him that it makes me uncomfortable. But he still dose it. So now I avoid going places with him. Why is he doing this? And how could I get him to stop?,14Oct2018,1
163,"Ok, so don't get me wrong. I love my mom, and since i moved away, i've tried my best to keep in touch with her. And, i always try to call her at least once a week. But, it's annoying because it's pretty much a one-sided conversation.


But, mom cannot carry a conversation. Before i call, i try to come up with various things that happened i could tell her, or ask about up there.


Now, here's how a conversation goes. I ask my questions, it's not a back and forth or anything. Just ""How are the kids?"" she'll answer, ""How was Church?"", answer, ""How Was work?"", answer, ""Is anything interesting happening."" she'll always say no. But, she NEVER asks me anything. It is completely one sided. And it ends up with us just sitting there, because i run out of things to ask. Completely silent. We've sat there for upwards of 10 minutes, she will not ask me anything or tell me anything. The only time i can recall her asking me anything is when she asked how my sister was doing.


It's incredibly annoying, and i wish she'd talk to me. Oh, and another thing, she gets upset when i have to go and hang up. She thinks i don't want to talk to her. But it's not true, i'd like to talk to her, but she just can't carry a conversation. And it makes me kind of sad.",14Oct2018,1

166,"I (18F) am planning on moving out with my boyfriend (20M) and his brother (25M) in a few months. My boyfriend and I have a 6 month old daughter. Right now I live with my parents, and he lives with his parents. Being in separate households makes it’s extremely difficult to co parent our daughter, our schedules make it so that we don’t get to see each other very often, and generally our current living situation just isn’t very comfortable for anyone involved.

So we are planning on moving in February. In the past my mom seemed okay with us moving out, until I talked to her about some personal issues in my relationship with my boyfriend. After that conversation my mom decided that my boyfriend is a bad person, he doesn’t respect me, etc. And now she is telling me it’s a bad idea to move out with him.
I am still planning on going. But I worry about how I’m going to break the news to my mom. I know she’s going to fight me tooth and nail. I’m not confrontational, and don’t handle arguments very well. I don’t feel comfortable doing things I know will make her unhappy. If I don’t move out my boyfriend is going to be unhappy. He is getting kicked out in February, so he’s going with or without me. But he’s strongly encouraging me to come. I’m not sure if there is an option that will make everyone happy.

I have my own apprehensions about moving out. It’s scary to think about being on my own for the first time, especially with a baby to take care of (although I know I have to get over this eventually). Money is going to be very tight. We will be moving in the middle of the school year, which will just cause a lot of additional stress on top of keeping up with school. I’m already considering picking up a second job on the weekends. It all just feels like so much to think about.  I’m not sure that the positives (more space, taking care of our daughter together, seeing each other more often) outweigh the negatives. But despite this it’s still my plan to move out. 

How do I tell my mom I’m going while still keeping the peace?",14Oct2018,1

We had the same interests (which was shocking since I’m a bit of a nerd) and she was insanely attractive in my eyes. We hit it off and the chemistry seemed good, but this was the first girl I’ve ever involved myself (she actually took my virginity) with and my inexperience eventually cost me. About a month ago I asked her to be my GF and she told me wasn’t ready because of a 2 year relationship she had gotten out of a month before meeting me. A little over 3 weeks later she said that she thinks I’m a great guy but we should just be friends. I told her that I was a little sad but I believed it was for the best and that maybe things could work out between us in the future. I’ve been reflecting on myself and what went wrong and feel like I learned a little about myself and how I probably came off as needy and lost her attraction at the end, and I hate to use this term but I was probably too much of a “nice guy”. I’m happy I can learn from this experience and grow from it (learning to be more confident and comfortable in my skin) and I’m trying at this whole just friends thing, but I can’t help but feel sad that it had to be her that I end up losing because she was the exact type of girl I always pictured myself being with.",14Oct2018,1

I am a 18 unfortunately living at home will going to college. My parents make too much money for me to get quality FASFA so I didn’t have an option to afford to live on campus ( they know this and know I wanted to live on campus but they couldn’t control me there). Also having little time to work to afford anything myself. I’m constantly being yelled at for not going to social interactions but when I ask it’s always a no. 

I have a girlfriend (been together 2+ years) who lives about 30 miles away at another university and I told my mom like all I want is one visit a week because our schedules our busy and my mom always plans something on the day I go over to prevent me. 

Or I’ll go and hangout with friends from high school and instead I’ll get yelled at about why am I not hanging out with people from my university. To me I see no difference it’s just I’m closer friends to my high school buddies. 

Then when I’m at home I actually do all the chores around the house.  It’s just me and my mom and dad. Every week she makes me do so many chores sometimes repeatedly just to keep me busy I feel. 

I don’t know what to do but I know I’m grown enough be able to care for myself and make right decisions like I’m a good kid who’s never did anything to warrant having to be controlled. What do I do to stop this because this interferes with just my day to day life and even my school work?

173,"Hey ya'll. I'm 22 years old and my family is very distant and tied up in their own stresses. Single mother has mental health issues and a history of alcoholism, generally has no idea how to have a relationship (which I may have inherited). Manipulative and terrible at communicating. Destruction of marriage number 3 is in progress. She was a very controlling, fearful, and protective parent.

She punished us as children by verbally berating us. When I was 13 she took me to her therapist because she found out I was self harming. At the therapist she convinced me that the first girlfriend I had was manipulating me, asked the therapist why I was looking at porn, and cried about how she felt her current husband had tricked her into marriage.

Growing up, she preferred me to my older brother while also being overly protective and controlling of me.  My development had been hampered socially and I deal with some anxieties. I try not to indulge myself. My brother was forced to mature and learn things earlier. He seems to be able to go about his life effectively nowadays.

I strongly believe he harbors resentment towards me. I don't think he would say it, but he has always had a hard edge when I try to talk with him. He's much closer to other friends he's made. Growing up I've always felt like I'm walking on egg shells around him and I still feel that way sometimes. We have talked about our differences in experiences growing up and he claims to want to have a relationship with me. Lately, I tend to not communicate because I know that the result is often not positive. My mind state is too fragile to be vulnerable with him right now.

Sometimes I think that he might be trying to manipulate me. He's mostly given up on our mom (who he's tried to help for a while, as have I).

My dad died when I was a baby and his side of the family doesn't talk to me and I never see them. My family on my mom's side are busy living their lives, uncle raising a family and working through unemployment. Asking family for help just doesn't sit right with me. My mom's brother's husband offered to house me, but I don't know them very well and I grew up listening to my mom talk shit about them... I feel super uncomfortable around them.

How can I meet people who would care me enough to help me through any of this?

How can I continue to support my mother (even though she won't get better) without losing the good parts of myself?

Anyone dealt with a similar situation with a sibling?

Can I overcome my issues with trust and maintaining relationships?

177,"tl;dr- Was driving at night and ran a red light because I was too focused on my speedometer and it would have been dangerous to stop. What should I do? 

Long version- I just recently got my drivers license and, tonight at around 9:30, I was going 60 MPH in a 65 MPH zone. The road was mostly empty, it’s a larger Farm to Market road so it gets a good amount of daytime traffic but it was mostly deserted tonight. I saw a speed limit sign, looked at my speedometer and decided to speed up to the 65 MPH I could legally do. 

Coming down a hill, I saw a green light and maintained speed. Checked my speedometer, 67 MPH. I decided I’d slow down to 65. The light turned yellow as I did this, and I figured I’d roll through as the road was deserted and I didn’t want to hit my brakes going downhill. I somehow underestimated the distance between myself and the intersection, because a half second before I crossed the line the light turned red. 

I’m not 100% sure if the light had red light cameras, but it’s highly likely. I was driving my dad’s car, so will his record be affected? Also, could I fight the ticket in court, as it would have possibly been dangerous to me or damaging to my vehicle if I hit my brakes to stop in time? I don’t necessarily need reassurances, but advice helps. Am I screwed? My dad won’t be super happy to get a ticket in the mail and I’ll obviously take responsibility and fight it in court.

I don’t get excited for hobbies, I am extremely un-motivated to do anything, and when I do accomplish something I can’t appreciate it. I don’t have that “I did it” rush that, for the previous 18 years of my life that I was happy, came so naturally to me. As a result these accomplishments don’t feel real. I’m very anxious now and I used to be a very laid back person who could find a world of entertainment just by looking out of a car window. I had a lot of imagination, now I’d be hard pressed to cook up even the smallest entertaining thought. I feel extremely disconnected from my friends and it seems impossible to enjoy spending time with them, no matter how fun the event. Just a few months ago we had gone to a concert for our favorite band, and it was my first time seeing them live. I was able to have somewhat of a good time, but it was nowhere near the level of enjoyment I would normally reach for something like that. That’s when I really started to wonder what’s going on with me. I just don’t seem to have any sort of significant emotional response to anything these days, good or bad. It’s like I just don’t care. My brain just feels off as a whole as well. I don’t think as quickly as I used to, my reactions have slowed (again I’m 20 years old, this is not an age thing), and I’m not as perceptive as before. Hell I’ve even hit some writer’s block on this post. I legitimately feel like I’ve gotten dumber. Even with all of this, though, I’ve never had suicidal thoughts. My question is not if I’m depressed, it’s perfectly clear that I am. I’m not asking for help finding the reason, either.

180,"Hello **Reddit**,

I come to you with a specific problem I'm going on with my life. Hear me out. I'm 21, in my last year of college in a prestigious art school majoring in Film and Graphic Design. Although my passion for video games has always been there since I was 3-years old gaming on the PC.

I'm a very competitive person and would like to enter tournaments, stream and basically find my niche like these other kids are doing with the world of competitive gaming but as well, make a living off of it. Now, I know this is a pipe dream but in my head I sometimes think it's a realistic idea and I feel like that may be dangerous to me but also people can always tell you to follow your heart. That's the thing, I don't know what my heart wants sometimes or what's best for it regarding financially and creatively.

I'm seen spending most of my time now a days playing League of Legends as well as trying to create content off of [Twitch.TV](https://twitch.tv/).

The problem is, once I have my mind set on something all my time goes into that like a vacuum funnel. Recently since I spend so much time improving and trying to stream my games for viewership, I end up with little time for school work and for my personal-creative craft of making Films and working on my Graphic Design skills.

**TLDR;** Having a balance issue of time between video gaming and creating content off that vs. my actual school work and portfolio development of my last year of college because sometimes I'm actually convinced I can make it into the eSports field which can be perceived as a pipe dream.

Hope this makes sense, willing to answer any abstract questions about this weird situation I'm constantly thinking about.",14Oct2018,1

182,"I’m a 17 year old product of 2 divorced parents.

I have had a 4.0+ gpa for the majority of high school, engaged myself in AP classes, don’t party, and pride myself in both my independent initiative as well as my empathy for other people, especially my family.

My parents, who although went through a nasty divorced, have managed to maintain a strong friendship (for the most part) while raising my sister and me. During my younger childhood I had a somewhat rocky relationship with my mom, and my dad would always be the one I turned to during rough patches. But lately it’s been flipped, and my mom is less strict and more informal than my dad when it comes to asking to do stuff with my friends or boyfriend. 

My dad hasn’t been himself lately, and it’s really got me down. He’s constantly tired, disgruntled, and moody after work.  Because I’m worried about him, I tried to talk to him about it, but he just said I would never understand and don’t really care, which made me extremely upset. I tend to cry in stressful situations and he puts me down for it, saying I just want attention and I need to suck it up. He’s always the one to nag me about grades/homework, random stuff that happened months ago, or even make me come home from concerts early. The way he presents himself comes off as snarky and annoyed by simply asking to do things, for instance, I have my license yet he doesn’t let me go to the grocery store alone without putting up a passive aggressive front. 

I’ve struggled with an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, and both my parents are well familiar with this. What they don’t seem to realize is that I would never intentionally lie about what I’m doing, where I’m going, or who I’m with, due to my own concern for my safety in case something happens. Therefore, I always straight up give them pretty much all the exact details up front when I ask to do something. Tonight I was headed back from a kid I babysits birthday party and I needed to go to the bathroom really quick, so I stopped at my boyfriends house, which was well on my way home. I texted my mom my whereabouts and why I was stopping. A couple minutes later, as I’m getting back in my car, get a call from my mom, lo and behold she’s yelling at me claiming “your dad and I talking unbeknownst to you about how much you lie about what you’re doing, just give it to us straight.” Like I said before, I never lie about stuff like that. She was acting weird and unlike herself, and now that i know my parents both think I lie to their faces, it’s got me incredibly anxious and just annoyed. 

Another example is asking to hang out with my boyfriend. We’ve been together for well over a year and my parents both love and trust him. He goes to a different school, so the only time we get to see each other during the week is when we work on homework together during the evening at Starbucks. My parents have both intensely interrogated me on multiple occasions about “is that what you really do?” and fail to believe that I’m telling the truth. 

So reddit, how do I productivity talk to my parents about my feelings without them calling me “over dramatic?” Should I stop being so specific when telling them what I’m up to so they don’t think I’m lying? How do I manage my anxiousness and overly empathetic attitude when it comes to this? ",14Oct2018,1

187,"Hi all. So my biological parents separated when I was 6. Dad was violent and abusive towards mom. Mom and dad were 17/16 when I was born. Dad wanted to smoke pot all day, would steal money from mom, etc. Wasn't in our lives consistently, ever, to this day. Now he has a new wife and a 3 yr old daughter. He's happy. I'm glad he is. We met our stepdad when I was 9. I have all sisters. 19, 15, 3 and 1. The 19 yr old and I have the same dad, 15 and 1 yr old are from our stepdad. Over the years my stepdad has gotten progressively lazier and more and more of an egotistical asshole. My mom has Fibromyalgia, tries to work 40 hr weeks and takes care of the baby. He works full time now, but has only started doing so because of the baby (that he didn't want in the first place, said my mom trapped him) He has said horrible things to my mom and sisters. He thinks he's a great dad, honestly. He thinks he treats us well, and equal. That's a load of shit. He's been this way for probably..10 years or so, since I started my teen years. Mom vents to me ALL THE TIME. And I tell her he's a waste of her time, a piece of crap, needs to GTFO. Does she agree? Mostly. Does she do anything? No. 
I'm tired of telling her to do better. I'm tired of being angry. They deserve to be happy, but none of them will be because of how they live. I recently told my mom I won't be coming over anymore, or bringing my son over. She didn't like that. Every time I go over there, something new has happened and I leave infuriated. I don't want that for myself, and I don't want my son to feel that anger coming from me. It's selfish to a degree, but if I don't draw the line, I'm not a good role model. I want my son to stand up for what he feels is right, but I can't teach him that if I don't do the same. My mom is clearly hurt by what I said to her. None of it was said angrily and no threats were made. I've never had to separate myself from her before, part of me really hates it. The other part is so relieved.

194,"It's definitely not very severe or perhaps even not intentional so I don't know if it could be considered gaslighting in contrast to the conniving manipulators who go under the same name, but I want to ask about it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been extremely busy recently as I have exams in a matter of weeks. Been meditating to improve focus, going to bed very early, studying of course, and this as well as my two jobs. Quite simply, I haven't had much time to talk to my best friend. I've known her almost and a year and she's been a very kind and supportive person

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, however, she's come out with a bunch of phrases such as

""Don't worry 'bout me it's absolutely fine that you just tell me that you can't talk because you have to study""

&amp;#x200B;

(I showed her a picture of a Caterpiller I took)

""Oh so been taking pictures of caterpillars instead of talking to me XD""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh so just leaving me here once again lol""

""XD""

""jokkkinnngg""

&amp;#x200B;

I can easily tell that she IS bothered by it. Partially because it's fairly obvious but also because I have experienced this before (and have never been wrong in my suspicions). She insists that it doesn't bother her at all and that it's ""clearly just jokes, silly"", which is why I liken it to gaslighting. I don't know if she's trying to hint to me that I need to make it up to her, or if she actually thinks she has me fooled. Either way, I'm not playing into it. It's very out of character for her to avoid discussing something directly as this is something we do often.

&amp;#x200B;

For some context: In a relationship I had that ended February this year, I experienced actual gaslighting. She went on a week-long crusade of attempting to get me to doubt myself by taking away the creature comforts of the relationship 1 by 1 all the while insisting everything was as normal, before breaking up with me. And I fell for it, naturally.

195,"I’m 15 and I’m not really independent, I struggle with buying groceries and stuff, really antisocial and I can’t cook at all. Basically a lot of stuff that a typical person my age should already know how to do. But my parents have been telling me that I’ll be going to college in two years and when I become an adult, the world will turn to shit. “You have to work hard”. “It’s survival of the fittest”. “It’s competitive”. “Money is everything” and apparently becoming an artist is hard because that field is competitive as hell. I have no reason to not believe them, but I’m pretty screwed. I think it’s best if I prepare now. Any things I should know?",14Oct2018,1
196,"My parent is not working, has several health issues now and most likely depressed. The thing is that they see no use in all the fuss with psychologists or doctors. This is not new at all, them always being dismissive and doing things slow and in a chosen way, it actually worked most of the time.

Part of the issue is that I am away from home now and we are mostly skyping. Helping financially a lot I really try to let them know that they can buy any required stuff, medicine, consultations, anything. Healthcare is pretty bad in my home place but it's something.

Forced by me and problems they tried to do some stuff and e.g. got prescriptions and, say, dental prosthesis. But medications take time to work and prosthesis is something you should get used to.

My parent drops anything that brings discomfort, only being sorry that they even started doing something and what a stupid idea it was.

When I try to tell they should keep tying and not just stopping in the middle the only answer I get is ""yes, sure, look how bad am I, not doing anything"" or ""yeah, I am so stupid, right"" and I hit a wall.

Is there any suggestion on what should I read or do to try reasoning better? Sometimes I get to them by carefully choosing words, but at certain point it is just the solid wall.

The worst part is the college. I dont feel i am close to anyone and anyone i can rely on. It never was like this when i was younger. I feel i was more likeable back then. Old friends still talk to me now and then , i dont know what to do.

203,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3 years. I love him very much and we plan on starting our lives together very soon. For the past 2 years however, I’ve had problems with pain during sex. The first year of our relationship we would do it 3-4 times a day. He was my first so I was completely new to everything. Eventually after a few months I didn’t want to do it that many times, maybe once a day. We had a talk because he said it was making him sad and that it’s a big deal to him, and intimate time is important. So I would do it with him to make him happy, many times I didn’t want to but I would suck it up. About 7 months after our relationship sex became painful. I kept it a secret and pushed through the pain. Eventually I couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. I would start to bleed after sex, I would have awful cramps when I was nowhere near my period. I eventually went to a gyno who told me I was perfectly healthy and everything was fine. I was convinced something was wrong so I got an ultra sound of my ovaries, the results came back normal. After this I was terrified to have sex because every time it would hurt so bad to the point that I would start crying before he even put it in. At first he was sweet and understanding of it. After many gynecologists and a very traumatizing experience at one I am tired and scared to go to another. They all tell me I am healthy and nothing is wrong. Except the last one, she told me she believes I have sexual trauma. I thought she was crazy. Over the last 2 years or so a lot of times my boyfriend will make me feel so so guilty if I don’t have sex with him. If we start and I start crying and tell him it hurts he pulls out and gets very sad and doesn’t talk to me or touch me for the rest of the night. It’s caused a huge problem in our relationship. Tonight I went to his house because he wanted me to stop by for just an hour or so. After telling him about my day and staring to fall asleep on his bed he starts rubbing my back. Then he starts grabbing my boob. This made me feel uncomfortable and he caught on. He told me that I’m the only one gets to do this with which made me feel like I have to let him touch me since he can’t touch anybody else. Then he unclipped my bra. We haven’t had sex in about 4 or so weeks. I’ve been really stressed out with personal things and school and my libido has been super low. I was anxious all day today and kept chewing the inside of my lip and had told him how my mouth was hurting really bad. Well I told him as soon as he unclipped my bra that I didn’t want to have sex. He told me that I never let him touch me and that I never let him love on me.. so I let him play with my boobs even though I was uncomfortable. As I was getting up to go he pulls his shorts down and whips his dick out. I was sitting on the bed and looked at him with the look that says “please don’t” I didn’t actually say it. He kept saying please and begging. I was feeling guilty after what he had said and I felt like a bad gf so I said okay. My mouth was hurting really bad but I still did it. I told him again that I didn’t want to have sex and he said okay. After a while he could tell I was uncomfortable and I was just waiting for him to be done. He looks at me and says there’s only one way for him to be done. I said no and he kept looking at me smiling and still trying to get me to have sex. I was filled with guilt and I just wanted this to be over and I wanted to go home so I started undressing and he got all excited and asked if I was turned on. I sighed and said no. I have a hard time hiding how I feel so I’m sure it was written all over my face how I felt. He got on top and literally had to force his way in. I cried the entire time. It was silent but his face was against my falling tears and he was looking at me as I had tears filling up my eyes. I just stared at the ceiling trying not to think about it but the tears kept coming down. Eventually he stopped and said my legs were pushing him out, I said sorry. I didn’t even realize I was doing that.  I was wiping my tears away as he was staring at me. He grabbed my hand and kissed it and told me how much he loves m. I was in so much pain and immediately went to the bathroom. I was in there for about 10 min because it hurt so bad I was crying and holding my stomach. I got out and he was in the kitchen so I went to the room and tried to sit down but it hurt so bad. I went on my phone to distract myself because I felt like bawling and I was trying not to think about it. Eventually he comes up and asks if I’m okay and I said yes but that I needed to go. He asked me to cuddle but I said no and he got sad but I told him I had to go home. Now I’m home and I’m still in pain. I feel so violated and sad. What was once a special and exciting thing between us has become this scary and painful thing for me. What do I do? We’ve talked about this before. I love him so much but every time this happens I feel more and more negative towards sex. ",14Oct2018,1

The next week I needed tot ask her where this food was going  to as I was holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on",14Oct2018,1
206,"I am slowly self-sabotaging probably but I am truly terrified of returning to work. My career is slowly disintegrating and the same issues always come back up. Also we do not live in a bubble and we are only human, so some spiteful managers/VP/directors will go out of their way to fuck your future prospects up (this has actually happened more often than not.)

I am TERRIFIED to return to work because I know this cycle will likely continue. I am in a therapy program but it's not that great.. (but it is free). I am easily triggered by negative facial expressions because it has been constantly reinforced through personal experience that when a person gives me an angry look, something very bad is going to happen to me soon. Thus I freak out whenever it happens, which may or may not exacerbate things

I have turned down a few great offers (looking a gift horse in the mouth) and I am avoiding responding to other messages.. not out of pleasure of being an asshole but I am legitimately afraid to do things like open emails sometimes. 

I severely need (at the very least) anxiety medication but I think there are other issues at play too. I have tried to find diagnosis services for aspergers/autism but the few people I am meeting (admittedly not in a clinical diagnosis setting) always say how ""normal"" I seem because of my face/appearance. Yeah, I've learned how to take showers (for the most part, ignoring days when I am afraid to go outside or even take off my clothes..) and I have learned how to dress okay. It's called camouflage.

I need help, I severely need help and I guess I have a tendency to flip the fuck out so patience is really not a virtue here...

No friends/support system to hang out with for emotional support. Ha. And despite being a massive internet nerd in my youth, I have no idea all these new platforms (thus have no idea where to reach out for friends/support/community).

So I bought some strawberries about 2 weeks ago and had some of them, but left the rest in my used mini-fridge. I checked them yesterday and they had grown mold, so I threw them out. Now a lot of the packaging (unopened lunch meat, unopened eggs) has a musty/sharp smell (it's consistently the same smell). Should I throw out the foodstuffs? and How do I clean the fridge (do I need to?)

For my other question, I got a used mini-fridge fairly recently (also 2 weeks ago). It's a combination microwave and mini-fridge, from Micro-fridge with safe plug. Sometimes the fridge rattles/shakes for a couple of minutes and I can hear what sounds like running water. The interior of the fridge itself seems dry and a little cold (I set the fridge to 4 on the interior dial, I don't know what that means and I wasn't provided with a manual).

211,"I recently joined a big company (4 months ago) and I work with 3 account directors, one of them being my manager. It’s the first time he is managing someone.

I have never had a problem with the other two, who only give me positive feedback on my work, or, when it’s not really good, tell me what was wrong, why and how to do better next time. 
They also give me important responsibilities and trust me with important tasks.

However my manager, lets call him Frank, will make me work on small tasks (like useless slides for decks or costs grid) and everything I do, he will do it differently in the end. 

But the worst part is that since he is sitting behind me at work, everytime I send an email to a supplier or a client, he will turn around and find something wrong with my email.
« Hey stormearhart, in your email please try to do this and that differently »
« Hey stormearhart, in your email to X, what did you say that and not that? »
« Hey stormearhart, by the way we usually don’t tell our suppliers that X and y »
Written like that it sounds fine but it’s the tone, like a reproach, and the frequency of these remarks. Im not even exaggerating when I say he does this about every email I send. 
None of my other superiors has had something to do about my emails
Now every time I have to write an email and cc him I’m like super anxious and will spend twice as much time to make sure it’s good enough. And I dread working with him and would rather work on projects with the other two

Am I overreacting? How can I tell him that it’s demotivating me to work with him? I am all for learning and do better but it’s like everything I do is wrong somehow with him 

TLDR: my manager only gives me small tasks and will eventually re-do everything by himself. He always finds something to criticize on my work especially my emails.

Hello Reddit.

I’m 15 years old, and I am currently in my year nine of school. At school, I mostly stick to myself, I don’t attempt to get school leadership roles or anything like that, I wouldn’t consider myself a leader. Due to where I live, I’m unable to get a part-time job like most kids my age, there’s just nowhere to work in a town as small as mine (~100 people live here).

I’d consider myself one of the smarter kids in my year, I don’t struggle with any of my subjects and I’m usually the first one to finish all my work. 

Here’s the thing though. I don’t have a damn clue what I want to do with myself in the future. My parents don’t have jobs, they never have. I’ve always been ignorant when it came to my future, and for the most part, I’ve ignored the topic, but the realisation that I need to start figuring my life now (as in, one or two years) is coming down on me hard.

I was hoping you guys could lend me a hand with this. I don’t necessarily know *how* you could help me with this, but some directions as to what I *could* do might help.

Here’s a list of what subjects I do, in order from **BEST** to **WORST**:

- History

- English

- Geography

- Science

- Math

- Computer Science (Coding/Programming)

- Graphic Design

- Cooking

- Sport/PE

... And here’s a list of my subjects in order of how much I actually **ENJOY** doing them:

- English

- History

- Computer Science

- Science

- Geography

- Math

- Sport

- Graphic Design

- Cooking

For me, the most important thing to be financially secure. I’ve always liked having something to do, I like the consistency of going to a place, and completing the work assigned to me. With that being said, I don’t want to get stuck in a trap of constantly going to work at a place I absolutely hate. 

I don’t have after school activities, or friends, or anything preventing me from studying hard, and putting in the effort now so it benefits me later in life. So I want to work hard now, but I don’t know what to work hard on.

The idea of getting a job revolving around STEM has always intrigued me, but so as a job as a historian or a teacher. I’m completely lost on what I should do. 

I think, overall, what matters the absolute most to me is having money in the bank. Not being rich, necessarily, but not having to worry about paying rent, or having bus money to school, or sleeping in bed for dinner. 

Thanks.

Also, as of posting this, it is 9:13PM. I’ll be asleep in at 10:30PM as the school holidays have ended. Please respond even if you don’t think I’ll see it straight away. I’ll be sure to try to respond in the morning (6:30AM/in 9-10 hours), and in the afternoon (4:20PM/in 19 hours).

TLDR:

I’m unsure of my future. I’ve imagined myself going down various paths, that are absolute opposites from one another, I’m good at all my subjects but I lack the ‘experience’ of what being in a job is. I’ve never had one, nor have my parents. I just need some guidance. I’d recommend scrolling up a little bit to read my subject lists if you feel like helping me. Thanks.

220,"Soo for context im a 25 year old male living in a single bedroom flat on the ground floor in a huge complex in a big city in Germany.  
I have this super small yard in the back that leads to a really long small path alongside the complex, its between a park and hidden by trees and it leads to nothing but the complex so only residents use it and they do rarely.

So 14 weeks ago we got construction framework around my part of the complex because they're painting the facade and doing something on the roof.   
Its really annoying because of some reason they made their ""camp"" where the construction workers gather in the morning directly in front of my yard. There are lots of paintbuckets laying around and they are really loud.  
They also used to plug in their equipment to the power outlet that belongs to the outside of my flat (im paying for this power), for what i got into a argument with them.  
But they pretend to not understand what im saying in German nor English. I think they're all from a eastern european country.

So on one occaison a few weeks ago I was told by a neighbor that in another part of the complex there was a break in.

And on friday i was told by them (the boss who speaks a little english) that they needed to paint the frame of my windows and that i needed to tilt my windows to let the paint dry fully. (I hope you get what i mean so the window is only partly open but I think sometimes you could grab the Window handle and turn it to open)

I was leaving the city for the birthday of a friend until saturday, but I told them I was away until sunday.  
I dont know why but I was angry or something.

So yesterday I was at home playing WoW. My PC is in a corner in the room impossible to look at from the outside.  
I had the shutters of my windows down and also the door to the yard where the framework is.  
I was not too loud but I dont know if you could've heard me from the outside. But the lights were on.

So at around 11.30pm I heard rustling at the shutters and I stand up to go and look what it is. (alot of animals are roaming around at the park and trees so not to unusual.

I was shocked to see a hands trying to push my shutters up by force. I only could see his hands and shoes and asked ""Whats up?!"" loudly in german (nothing better came to my mind).

He responded me in english with eastern european accent (!) ""Nothing"".  
I was really frozen I did not know if hes armed or somthing but I pulled up the shutters to hear him running away.

Im not saying its the construction workers but I've got this strong feeling. But what makes me really anxious is the fact that he might have heard me and have known I'm home because of the WoW sounds and the light that was on.  
I dont know what his intentions were.

Do you have any advice what to do?  
I did not call the police yet because what could they do, there is literally no evidence for anything.

Feel free to ask if I skipped any information, I'm still so terryfied I'm shaking while I write this.

225,"So a bit of context, I'm 23. I grew up in the country but moved to the city to pursue some study and a career. Naturally, leaving my home of around 2 decades put strain on the few friendships I did have back at home, now I only maintain regular contract with about three of them.

In the city I feel very isolated with no one that I can really get into contact with regularly and go hang out with and form proper friendships with. My cohort at university was/is very antisocial (can't really explain why) and as for work, well I took a supervisory position off the bat so there a sort of social divide between myself and my peers in that regard. 

I don't consider myself to be a rude, mean or anti social person. I can form friendships with people. Case in point, I have been lucky enough to embark on some international travel. In that context, making friends comes very easy, I still keep in regular contact with a handful of people overseas, even traveled to visit them. But back at ""home"" I just can't seem to break through the barrier. I can make small talk and have friendly interactions, but nothing occurs outside of work or study setting. 

Don't get me wrong, the friends I do have are great, and I have a great time with them. But the closest one is an hour away by car and even then they won't want me hassling them all the time :P I just think I would benefit from having a expanded base of friends, so I feel less lonely and feel I'm contributing more. 

So I guess what I'm asking is where is a good place to start? How do I go about it? And what behaviors should I perhaps change? 

Thanks in advance!!!

I feel guilty as hell— my mom lost her job because my family moved for my sake (she was told she can have it back when she returns, but apparently not). My dad has been doing a labour intensive job that he is getting too old for and had been counting the days to quitting (we expected mom would be able to go back). I have a younger sibling they need to provide for, and they don’t really have retirement figured out or anything.

I am in a good university for a computer science degree but I had decided sometime back that I want to write books not programs. Learning about my family thing literally minutes to 12 on my birthday kind of jolted me. Should I just go back to computer science and get a job that can provide for my family? People are fighting and clawing to get into my comp sci program because of the employability prospects—- I decided I didn’t care for money and was going to leave it to join creative writing instead. I am done the comp sci major, I got good grades although I hated the work and didn’t do any internships yet. However It breaks my heart to see my dad struggle so much, and my mom and  little brother suffer from the family stress. I don’t see myself as a long term worker in tech really but definitely see myself as a writer, so going back to cs for a job would be a sacrifice. 

I could have sustained myself for a few years on little money i get from TAing and such while I work on writing books, but now the stakes have completely changed. 

 Should I go back to computer science (which I have a degree in but don’t want to work in) for the easy money? Should I “follow my heart” and let my parents go through stress? Would appreciate advice on what to do.",14Oct2018,1

235," 

So i met this guy 2 weeks ago. The first day we met we both took 3 tabs of acid and went on a walk in the woods. The entire time he was very very touchy and all over me so i kind of felt that he liked me. Then told me he was bisexual, that he has had sex with a guy before, that he will suck my dick if i want and that we can be butt buddies. I just giggled in response to all this and nodded me head staring him in the eyes (I'm extremely shy/social anxiety). When when we got back to his dorm he ""changed"" in front of me and stood there naked for a while and told me he was sooooso horny. I was too, but I didn't want to do anything with him because he was tripping so hard and i didn't wanna take advantage of him. I didn't know if he was serious or if it was just the acid. Then after a while he said ""So we're just friends, right?"" and i said ""If that's what you want."" and i cant really remember what was said after but it wasn't very significant.

Anyways, so we have been chilling basically all day (and night) every day since the trip. I definitely feel that he likes me - the way he looks at me, talks to me, smiles at me....i know i've only known him a couple weeks but i seriously have never met someone who makes me feel so happy.

We were in the woods again the other day just talking about stuff and he told me that he feels like we were meant to meet each other and that i've helped him find purpose in life by introducing him to psychedelics . And he said that he's never met anyone who understands him the way i do and that he sees me being a big part of his life, even after college. he said ""not on any homo shit or anything, but if you asked me to drop out of college and run away with you right now i would do it."" We kept talking and somehow the conversation came ton him saying ""It's okay if you're gay. all of my friends are gay and i've fucked a guy before. *But i mean,* ***i'm straight.****.....*.""

Then later that night we were chilling at his dorm and basically nonstop for hours he kept ""adjusting"" his dick to the point where i felt like he was showing it off to me or something (he would stare me directly in the eye and talk to me while doing it, and kept glancing at me every time he would reach in his pajama pants). At one point, i said i was going to the vending machine. He asked if i could get him some sour patch kids, and i said yes. Then he told me ""Thanks. I'll have to suck your dick"" I couldn't believe my ears so i asked him what he said, and he said it again. ""I said thanks, i'll have to suck your dick."" Again, i fucked up by not pursuing this - and just giggled then went to the vending machine then when i came back it felt awkward and neither of us brought it up. But then the next morning he said that he had a dream that i asked him to have sex.

Do you guys think he likes me? I am so distraught because i want to ask him but i'm just so scared. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. We are going to trip again this week - should i divulge my feelings to him during the trip so that i can play it off easier if im rejected, or should i just be honest?

240,"Hey all its me again :(

About two weeks ago I made a post here about how I was developing romantic feelings for my best friend since childhood (you can click in my account history to see it). I was asking advice on how I can not view her as a romantic interest and just as a friend, because I knew she wasn't interested (she's bisexual, and always telling me about a girl she likes). I got some pretty good responses, with the general consensus being I should spend some time away from her whilst also telling her how I feel. 

Well, even though I thought it was good advice, I'm an idiot, and didn't listen. The only bit of advice I really did listen to was to try and hang out with my other friends, but that didn't really help because I still thought about her. 

Over the past two weeks I've been spending time with her quite often, whether over calls or hanging out in person, with our close group of friends. I thought that I could kill my feelings if I expose myself to her and try not to feel anything but that didn't work and I think I only grew fonder. And I feel so stupid and foolish for letting that happen to me. 

But what broke my heart now is a couple of minutes ago she texted me and a few of our other friends about how she's been spending some time with the girl she is crushing on, and how in a few weeks time they agreed they were gonna have sex together (I'm not sure if they are officially dating now or if it's just a casual thing). 

When I saw that I think I had an anxiety attack, and I can feel my heartbreaking, as stupid as it sounds... But now I feel completely and utterly lost at what I should do. I tried distancing myself from her but she's also my best friend and I feel like I need to talk to her everyday, when I hang out with other friends she is still on my mind, I don't even think there is a point in telling her... And what makes it worse I think is that this is the second time this year I feel like I've gotten heartbroken.

I don't remember anything past listening to that SpaceTime playlist before falling asleep, and when I woke up there was no signs of anyone having been in my room.

He would make fun of me and call me gay etc but all friend groups are like this right? only he would constantly make fun of me to a point of where i felt really upset about it and when i asked him to stop he claimed that i coudlnt take a joke so therefore i had to listen to him make fun of me and not speak out about it. It came to a point where i would go to bed upset about little things and i felt like there was no escape.

This member also made another member of the friend group contemplate doing suicide and when he spoke out about it that leader member stopped ruining his days and well was really sorry about it,but then i felt like he needed another person to make fun of and this person was me.

At this point it’s harassment and I don’t know what I should do because I have no proof it’s them and the police just say “we don’t know what’s going on as they keep changing their number” I’m being trolled or something and the cops are being useless",14Oct2018,1
251,"Hey, r/Advice. I’ve been having some problems with my brother lately. As you all probably know, Fortnite is easily the biggest game in the world right now, and according to what I’ve read online, it is extremely addictive (I’ve only played around five games myself, and didn’t find it that fun). My brother, on the other hand, seems to have an addiction. During the weekend, my brother will be up at 6:30 AM, playing Fortnite until we have to eat. When he’s done eating, he’ll immediately go back to playing the game. He still eats normally, unless I tell him I’m gonna play on the PC after eating. If I say that it’s my turn, or that he’s played enough, he’ll eat super quickly. We eat breakfast around 8:30, sometimes even 9:00. My brother then proceeds to spend the entire day playing Fortnite, taking breaks to eat/use the restroom. I only really get to play around 1:00, when my parents FINALLY  decide to step in. He’s my younger brother, and treats me like shit whenever I ask him if I can play. He gets aggressive whenever the Internet crashes, whenever Fortnite can’t open, etc. While he plays, he can get pretty mad at his friends, yelling at them. Luckily, he doesn’t get mad when he loses. My brother has also spent around $300 on the game. I checked on the Epic website, where it tells you how much you spend. He’s only eleven, and this is extremely concerning, as he already has anger issues. He’s made holes in doors and walls, and he constantly slams doors when he’s mad. He broke his phone, and I’m afraid he’ll start hitting me or one of my parents when the addiction really starts to ramp up. Honestly, I feel like one day I’m gonna snap and hit him, and it scares me a bit. I’ve had enough of him treating  both me and my parents the way he does. I don’t know if it’s important to say this, but when we had the Xbox One, and we played on that (before we got the PC), he also had these issues, but with different games. One time, he hit me over the head with a controller, HARD, because I told him it was my turn, explaining to him how he ha spent eight hours on the fucking thing. Now that he has Fortnite, it’s gotten worse, although he doesn’t hit me anymore, which is good because every time I hit him back, he would cry, and I’d get in trouble. I just need to know how I can help him, and how my parents can properly address this issue. Sorry for the long post and the occasional swear word, I’m just frustrated. ",14Oct2018,1
252,"Hey  guys, a bit of backstory, im from the UK and moved to a new sixth form  school last year (september 2017) along with the majority of my friends  from my previous school. Through the beginning of last school year from  around september - december i suffered from anxiety, frequently getting  panic attacks and felt like i was going crazy. I would get them at  random times, while i was studying, during assemblies, randomly in class  etc. I realised that they were focused around my health (i have cystic  fibrosis which had been getting worse) and that the panic attacks would  often be caused by something minor like a small pain in my chest, or  weird breathing (which didnt help considering the panic attack just made  my breathing worse). So, i talked with one of my best friends as  coincidentally he was also getting panic attacks so we would often spend  time after school just walking around our town and just talking which  really helped us both. Within about 2 - 3 months the panic attacks  started to subside and i felt a lot more in control of them, id still  get the ""feeling"" of a panic attack but it went away within a few  minutes and they werent nearly as bad as before.

Okay,  so on to my problems this year. I dont really know how to say this but  ever since i started the sixth form last year id felt i was getting  ""dumber"". My memory started to worsen, there were days that i really  didnt want to get out of bed, and i just had no motivation. Note how  this was only every now and then, probably around 50% of days.

This  school year has become a lot worse. Its only a month in and i feel like  crap. My memory has absolutely gone, to the point i cant even remember  what i ate the previous day without thinking hard about it. I go to  lessons and i have no idea what i did the previous lessons, even looking  at my old notes i think ""i dont remember writing these"". I have a  severe lack of motivation. I wake up and it takes me half an hour to get  out of bed on school days (and thats only because i have to force  myself out because im getting late, ive been late almost every day this  year.). While im at school, i realised how much work ive got due, the  amount of work i need to catch up, deadlines that are set etc so i think  ""yeah i have x amount of hours free later ill do it then"" but by the  time i get home the only thing i want to do is sleep. Ive also missed  dinner occasionally because no one could wake me up. Im also tired all  the time, spending probably 90% of my time at home either in bed on my  phone or sleeping, even on the weekends where i spend 1 - 2 hours in bed  when i wake up just on my phone browsing instagram/reddit before eating  breakfast late. My sleep is also crap. I dont have much problem going  to sleep however now i feel tired a lot earlier, going to bed exhausted  by 9pm (i can usually stay up til midnight without any problems) and  even after having 12 hours of sleep i dont want to get out of bed. The  reason i think im ""dumber"" is because it feels like my memory is gone,  as if every day is a new day and whatever happened the day before has  been wiped from my brain. Im struggling to find the words to even write  this post, it just feels like my mind is very disordered and picking out  information takes a lot longer. Because of this, my work is also being  impacted. My grades have dropped (i know its only been a month since the  new year started, but i know at this rate ill end up failing my  A-Levels) and i cant concentrate in class anymore. Im failing to  understand the work in class, it literally feels like its going in one  ear and out the other, and because of this i have a lot of work to catch  up on but i just cant find the motivation to do it.

Thanks  for reading, Im not sure what i want from this post tbh, i think i just  wanted to get it all out in words. Ive been called lazy by people so i  dont really know if theres anything wrong with me or i really am just  being lazy? I dont know if i should see my GP or not, and if so what to  expect from them.

Edit:  I forgot to add this into the main post, however ive also ""isolated""  myself. In school i usually like spending time with my friends during  free periods working, cracking jokes etc however recently ive just been  wanting to be alone most of the time, spending my time in the silent  study room trying to revise, which i know isnt a bad thing. I also dont  enjoy going out anymore, whether its just to chill out and eat with  friends or play football, badminton or even go to the gym, which i used  to love doing mainly because it helped me clear my mind. Idk i just cant  find the energy to do stuff that i used to anymore and id rather spend  my time in bed doing nothing. As i mentioned in the main post, i have  small ""sparks"" of motivation where i realise i need to do work, or ive  got x amount of things to do and i plan to do them over the weekend or  something but when the time comes to it i cant bring myself to do them.",14Oct2018,1
253,I’m 16 and have recently gotten a job at a retail store.

255,"I've known this girl for about 4-5 years now, and we've gotten pretty close, she's one of my best friends. We had drunken sex 3 years ago, but that was just a one time thing. 2 years ago I started developing feelings for her, I struggled with these feelings for a couple of months before I just came clean. She rejected me, and we didn't speak for 3 months. I got over her and we started talking and being friends again. I then met another girl and started dating her, this was a year ago, but she was a nightmare, and made it clear I couldn't be friends with her because I'd had feelings for her. When I ended it with the nightmare, my friend was there for me straight away, even though I'd been a dick to her. It has now been a year since we started talking again, and I've once again got feelings for her.

We snuggle while watching a movie, and I accidentally breathe in her ear. She's on her period, and I'm not into period sex- just a hang-up I've got involving blood.

Seriously, what do I do? She rolls over and tries to engage and starts making out, I don't want to not do that- if I use my muscles and hold her in place with one arm, she's much smaller than I am and she _really_ likes that apparently, since it brings home that she's like 45 kilo and I'm almost double that.

I'm currently a twenty year old HighSchool dropout, looking to get my life back on track with every fibre of my being. Honestly though I have no idea where to start at all. I grew up all over the world ; father works in oil and gas, as such I've never lived in my home countries of Australia and Canada. Bounced around allot growing up, new school every two years(new country as well), almost every time a different education system (alternated between the American and British mostly). Currently I reside with-in the UAE and have the option to move.

When I left high school, I was three months away from my final exams for the International Baccalaureate diploma. This was two years ago in 2016, i'm not proud to admit it but I completely shutdown. Leaving my goals in the mud.

All in all, I want to get into a University or College with-in the next year or two. Willing to do what ever it takes to get there.

I need money to buy games for my PS4, to have to go out during the week days, also just the feeling of having money is good for me. Any tips?

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going  to as I was holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right while she looked at me as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and  smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on",14Oct2018,1

263,"When I was in secondary school I was bullied and neglected by everybody around me. Nobody wanted me around them yet accepted my company.. sometimes.. other times they told me get lost and asked why I was there. They had parties and meet-ups for fun engagements without my presence, having to see them enjoy themselves on social media I was at home jealous and depressed. And occasionally at school, others would use me for my money, use me for other things as well.. call me names and pick on me because everyone knew I was the kid everyone didn’t like. At the time I didn’t see anything wrong with, well anything. But how could I? I desired the thought of friendship. 

Years later I made a new friend. But my mind is conflicting over if she is using me to talk to when she is bored. Or she feels sorry for me and is friends with me only because of that reason. Simple to say, my experience has changed my social life a great deal. I haven’t been able to have a girlfriend because of it. Nor can I specialise well with friends. I don’t know what to do.

265,"I have my ups and downs with my boss. Recently ive tried to get some sort of justice for the way she treats me and my coworkers, but our company owners and the people ranking above her autority dont seem to give a shit.

The way shes acting is now professional at all, and does not belong in a work place. For example the way she broke the law and told one of my coworkers i was pregnant. This coworker didnt know about this. Then she proceeded to tell my coworkers how i was just faking being in pain etc due to the pregnancy. She said i was probably just lazy and infact a bad employee. Also there is firm laws on how bosses and supervisors are suppose to give me lighter or easier tasks, just simply make it easier for me to work, and she managed to make a very big deal about how much that ruins her day, and how much extra work this is for her. This even after ive worked my ass off, and kept my mouth shut when they violated laws accourding to how many hours and etc is allowed to work for one person, ive always been like her right hand, and go to person for help around work. And ive never been sick or out of work like this before.

She does alot of this kind of talk behind my back, and about others that work there aswell. Shes creating a bad work inviroment for everyone.

I took this incident to the supervisor above her, and told him what she had done this time. He told me he would talk to her and when he did he told me she would come down to work and apologize to me. Instead of that, she texted me 3 days later, blaming her own private life issues on the way she acted and not really apologizing at all..
There was another time we had an argument, and it ended up with me, her and her boss again in a meeting to try to find a solution to the issues. She ended up denying everything i called her out for and i felt like the meeting really had No effect what so ever. 

I simply did not answer the text, and pretty much never mentioned it again. Neither did she. I dont know what to do about this situation anymore. All i know is going to work sucks whenever shes around and shit like this happends too often.

266,"To start off, I will say that I am a 23 year old male and I have been recently seeing this girl who I met online. We just had our third date last night and it basically consisted of us watching a movie at her place which inevitably led to us taking our close off and having sex. After some foreplay she got on top of me and put my then hard penis inside of her and after being on me for a couple minutes my dick didn't seem very hard and it started getting to me and I told her my dick was no longer hard. What happened after was too awkward and miserable to really describe. She kept asking if it was something she did and I told her it wasn't her fault and that I just got in my own head. At this time I'm still unsure of what even happened to me physically. The last time I had sex was 9 months ago and I don't if I was putting pressure on myself or not after not being sexually active for a long time? Every bit of us messing around was great up until I got soft inside her and I ended up leaving her place shortly after in utter shame and misery.

Now the advice I am asking for is, what do I do now? I don't know if I should talk to a doctor about what happened to me.

269,"Hi all, throwaway because I have family that know my Reddit account and would rather they didn't know about this. Essentially, I'm about to have a week off of school (18, A levels) and along with a boatload of homework I had been planning out what I'd do with each day and how much I could get done in each day. I **LOVE** being alone in my house. Its just me and my Mother and I love her dearly, but whenever she isn't at work she'll be downstairs using the television. Our house isn't big enough to accommodate both of us and for someone who gets distracted easily, the only place I can do my work is at a table near to the TV which whenever she is here will be on with whatever show she is watching. 

I know its something so small that it shouldn't bother me but I'm absolutely livid, the occasional one or two weeks off I get alone are the highlight of my school time and act as great refreshers for me going back to school, I always find most of my productivity and happiness in these weeks. She knows this and has purposefully taken this week off on my half term, but hasn't given a reason as to why. In my head it would've made sense to take a week off where I AM in school as we sometimes struggle to get me commuting there and back (10 miles) and so having full free days would've made everything 10x easier and we both could've enjoyed a week off. When we are both at home we don't speak much to each other, we never have been like that, and so I honestly have no idea why she has taken the week off. What do I do about the situation? I just feel like this week is going to suck from now until the end without allowing me to unwind or refresh at all.

**TL;DR -** Mother has taken a week off of work on one of the few holidays I get from school, she knows I absolutely love these weeks off as they let me refresh and unwind alone, now she will be at home I will struggle to get work done and will be confined to either a tiny room upstairs or my bedroom as she will always be using the television - about 10 feet from where I planned to do my homework or to just unwind.",14Oct2018,1
270,"This isn’t a feel sorry for me type of post I’m just curious to know what people think about my situation. I grew up in a small home with both parents and an older sister,as I grew older around 12 years old my father lost his job of 18 years and became very mentally and physically abusive to my family. He would have me help him work on cars as that was his hobby and when I couldn’t execute a task in his manner he would yell at me saying “I’m a fucking idiot.” “You’re useless.” Etc. and if he would mess something up on the cars or if something went wrong in the house he’d take it out on me and the family and because me being the only male would hit me,punch me,and even choked me a couple of times. I was only like 12ish and couldn’t physically defend myself. Around the age of 15 my mom left for a 3rd shift job every day leaving me with my abusive father and she soon found out he was cheating on her sleeping with another woman and divorced him shortly after and I lost contact with him for about a year,but he manipulated and guilted my mother back with him and they remarried. My dad swore he was a changed man and with a month back at home he was right back to that short tempered asshole who shit all on his family. I knew I had to get out and move on and swore I’d cut contact with him and never speak to him again and joined the Marines at 17 and forgave him after 2 years of being in. I visited home and he’s put on a fake act around me acting different,until I went home for pre deployment leave and helped him and did something wrong and he went off how I was an idiot etc. I swallowed my pride and pushed past it even though he hurt me and gave me like a flashback of the old asshole I remember who never gave a fuck about me as a kid or what hobbies I was into. I left for deployment and once again cut ties with not only him,but everyone and was given nothing but guilt trips from my family after I was already going through a lot of stress in my job,so I once again did a huge mistake and just swept it under the rug and went home post deployment leave and this is where my dumbass really fucked up...I brought back my now fiancé who I’ve dated for a couple years now to meet my family as she begged she wanted to so bad and I basically lied to her saying they will enjoy you and are nice etc. as soon as we got there everything was fine and she was just staying a couple nights and leaving back to her home to go back to work and I was going to spend my last 2 weeks spending time with my family and I ended up barely seeing them and showing her around my city I grew up in and took her out on a couple dates and my family became jealous and angry towards me and her saying she’s taking me away from them and I’m being selfish and my dad yelled at me in front of my fiancé like I was a fucking 13 year old all over again and saying disrespectful thing to my fiancé and I picked my shit and left right after not saying a word with no ones knowledge. I’ve been told I’m wrong and stubborn for not apologizing and the love me blah blah blah and I told my mother everyone in our family is a piece of shit I’m done being put on guilt trips and my fiancé says my family blocked her on social media and made it clear they hate her and it’s so upsetting that my family can’t even respect the one good thing in life that made me happy,instead they tried ruining it and I feel so embarrassed knowing that her family knows how she was treated. I still talk to my mother off and on very rarely and I feel bad because she never abused me,but just left a bad taste in my mouth when my fiancé came down,and my dad never apologized for anything ever in my life never cared to have a man to man talk with me.

276,"This is a really big topic, but basically, my wife and my family live in the Midwest (Michigan). Our family is really important to us. But, we don't love the Midwest. We lived in the SF Bay area for around 5 years, and absolutely loved it. We would love to live in the Pacific Northwest somewhere, Portland perhaps would be a great option for us. The ocean, the weather, etc. 

After leaving the West coast, we moved to Chicago, which was our attempt at a ""happy medium"" between a bigger ""cool"" city and living close-ish to family (relatively easy drive home for weekends, etc). Chicago was OK, but the access to nature sort of sucks and there isn't much of a culture of outdoors activities. It's OK, basically, but for us very much feels like ""settling"".

We've now left Chicago and are traveling, but eventually we'll be coming back to the US and we're getting SLIGHTLY older and are considering purchasing a house. Only, we have no idea where we'd do that, making it basically impossible to ""settle"" in anyway.

I'm wondering if anybody has any advice. I'll take any advice: cities we should live in, ways to look at the situation, etc, etc.

Part of me is thinking perhaps just buy a cheaper house in a less desirable area but with great access to nature (e.g. Northern Michigan), and use that as a ""base"", but perhaps save money to travel for example. Basically focus on ""financial independence"" and enjoy nature / being close-ish to family.  


Then part of me thinks we should just move to Portland for example, and just suck it up and fly home more often. Make more scheduled trips home, to make things easier.

It's a two crew operation, so I see my roommate at work some mornings but most of the day we're out flying with a captain. Since we're both first officers we never fly together.

Tim gets angry very easily. We live in a house, I'm on the main floor he's in the basement, and I can hear him yelling on the phone from my room most days. He usually is yelling at his mother (including lots of ""fuck off""'s) but he also yells at his ex, at friends. He yells at himself. I hear him angrily muttering under his breath all the time too. Every time he picks up his phone he dies a hugely exaggerated sigh before storming off. It's hard to really describe but his demeanor gets just so clearly pissed off.

I have no idea what he's like a work. Like I said, me and Tim never fly together. But at home he's not what I would consider mentally stable.

We are both only a few months away from being upgraded to captains and I keep thinking about how, having lived with him, I wouldn't feel comfortable flying with Tim as my captain. Having seen how he reacts to minor things I wouldn't want to be sitting next to him in a plane that he's responsible for when something inevitably goes wrong. We fly old planes, eventually something will go wrong.

In most cases I don't think it's right for someone's personal life to affect their job, I don't think it would be right for me to go to management and badmouth him and possibly cost him a promotion. But I also don't think it would be right for me to say nothing and for an incident to then happen because of his temper.

I even slipped chocolate into her lunch box... after about a week she knows...tells me that she dosent care but we become friends mostly because of my ignorance and determination. We have playdates during 3rd and 4th grade ... fast forward to 5th grade... I have wised up a bit and dont talk to her at all.... I moved away for 2 yrs that summer... 

for 1 yr I dont hear anything dont think about her... but in 7th grade we start DMing....this goes on for a while until she blockes me ( recently I learned that she thought I had a crush on her and didn't want to lead me on)  


so I come back for 8th grade and we have been texting quite a bit having long conversations and talking in school once or twice, we talk alot when we see each other at football games...today I saw her at a festival and we had a good time with several friends... every teases us about my crush on her , and we both get rly embarrased...she definitely dosent not want to talk to me but what are ur thoughts on it?

I've stayed up for three days straight, hallucinated, gone off my meds, had plenty of panic attacks, the whole nine yards. I was a mess.


Back in 2017 around May I decided enough was enough. I quit my dead end job, moved to a new place, met a wonderful woman who I love very much, found faith, and am starting to go back to school. I was in a good place, but now I feel like I'm slipping back into being a crazy hermit. I order my groceries delivered to me, I call out for work just because I can't will myself to get out of bed, I feel uilty for things that aren't my fault, I have thoughts of hurting myself (I consistently cut and bruised myself for about three years), and have even blown off my partner so I could sit in my shower and drink.

291,"Hey guys, so currently my dog (will call her S) is around 2 years old and hasn’t gotten her vaccinations yet. I’ve brought this issue up with my parents multiple times already but they always refuse to get S vaccinated. Basically, S has never been to the vet (meaning that she isn’t microchipped or desexed) 

Even though they do care for S, they believe that taking her to the vet is not necessary (if it matters, they’re traditional Asian). Whenever vets are brought up, they mention that our previous dog had lived a long life without going to one - she lived up to around 12 years 

I’m only 17 and unemployed right now, so taking her to the vet myself is not an option. I know this is bad and I absolutely would take her myself but I simply can’t afford it.  

I’m planning to get a job after I leave high school and pay for her medical expenses myself, but for the time being I just wanted to ask if my baby will be okay and if vaccinations are necessary at all

294,"I’m 16, and maybe I’m just going through a phase but I cannot fucking stand my family right now. I was just staying at my sister and brother in law’s place 2 states away for a week with their kid, and it made me realize just how uncivilized and annoying to be around my family is. Yeah, they provide for me, give me clothes and food which I’m very thankful for. But my family, especially my siblings, are annoying me to hell. I have 2 younger brothers and 2 younger sisters.


Where do I even start? I guess I’ll begin with eating. These uncivilized apes just CANNOT chew with their fucking mouthes closed. Every fucking meal, it’s the same thing:

*Sluuurp* *Chewing sounds* *Chewing sounds* (LOUD disgusting chewing sounds) *slurp* and more disgusting eating noises. I don’t have this problem with anyone else, my friends, my sister and brother in law. EVERY TIME I tell them to please chew with their mouths closed, my father will say: “SHUT UP! DONT BE SO NEGATIVE!” And give me a death stare. My siblings and mother will be like “you’re always complaining why are you bothered by everything huehurlol!”. My siblings sometimes even deliberately chew loud as fuck while looking at me to piss them off, and I can’t do anything because my parents NEVER take my side. It’s not like I’m telling them “CHEW WITH YOUR FUCKING MOUTH CLOSED!”. I’m saying, “can you please chew with your mouth closed”. I’ve been saying this EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY TO THEM FOR THE PAST 6-7 YEARS. It’s not an exaggeration.


Then we have my dad. Always getting angry over stupid shit. Physically incapable of speaking in normal sound levels. Upstairs, door closed, noise canceling headphones in, I hear every word this fucker says because he talks SO DAMN LOUD. He constantly gets physical - won’t hesitate to slap kids for shit. He slapped me around a lot when I was younger which made me develop malice towards him from a very young age. My mom is alright and I love her a lot, though. I think I’d never even come to my house if I didn’t have her.

Next up, my little siblings have disgusting behavior. My 11 year old little brother never shuts his fucking mouth, always screaming at his friends on his PS4 planing fortnite all day. He’s turning into a constantly argumentative brat. I caught him on his iPad at 2:30 AM last Wednesday, on a school night. This little shit had the *AUDACITY* to try to fight me and keep the iPad when I tried to take it from him. I wasn’t even going to tell on him either, just take the iPad and make him go to bed. You know I gave that little shit a slap to the face after that.

My little sister, 7 years old, is WAAAY too fucking old to act the way she does. She constantly cries. She cries at least 3 times a day for attention. She has attitude, she tells people to shut up, she’s eating her way to obesity to top it all off. I also have a 15 year old little sister who is being a fucking brat too, always arguing and giving attitude. 

My parents snooped through my chats and figured out that I wasn’t really a Christian anymore. Now, they send me to a “Sunday school” at a church for 7 fucking hours every damn Sunday. I’m in it right now. 10 AM to 5 PM. I AM TURNING 17 IN TWO WEEKS. THE PEOPLE IN MY CLASS ARE ALL 8-10 YEARS OLD.  THE OLDEST ONE BESIDES ME IS 12. If I complain, my dad loses his fucking shit because he’s such an orthodox Christian and thinks I’m insulting he religion.

Maybe I just don’t understand my siblings because I was always that quiet kid as a child. I don’t argue with my paren s because I learned when I was like 7 that’s it’s pointless and you can’t win, so just keep your mouth shut. My siblings seem too stupid to understand that.

I just can never get any peace at all in my house. There’s more reasons but I cant be bothered to type anymore on mobile. I might honestly just join the army at 18 and GTFO here. I’m seriously losing my mind.

295,"Good morning everyone. I was hoping I could get some unbiased opinions in regards to changing jobs. I’m currently a part time police officer and turn 28 in a couple months. I work over forty hours at the pd even though I’m part time. I’ve been a police officer at the same pd since 2014. During my employment with my current pd I’ve had a ton of disagreements with the chief, so much so I was getting targeted with suspensions. 

The chief has since retired and a sergeant has become the new chief. I get along with everyone at the pd now and love the work and community. 

I’m currently in the pre employment process for another pd. It’s a neighboring city and about the same size as the city I currently work in. I know almost over half the guys and girls that work there and like them. I’m unfamiliar with the specifics of the new pd but it’s the same retirement and better pay. 

Before I ask my question, the pd I’m at now was the pd I’ve always wanted to work at. And there is the possibility for a full time spot within the next two months. I’m in a tight financial spot and in need of insurance. 

What would y’all do? Stay with my current pd or leave if the new pd offers?

Also, at the new pd I would have the least amount of seniority for about 7 years and wouldn’t have my choice of shift. If I stay at my current pd I would be a senior patrolman within 3 years and have my choice of shift. ",14Oct2018,1
296,"So my grandma found a kitten around 8 weeks old and she called me to take it. I got home and realized his front right leg wasn't working.

He lets me touch it and he doesn't seem to be in any pain. The joint on his leg feels much larger than the other side, but it still doesn't appear to hurt him.

301,"So my best friend of almost a year (she’s a girl I’m a guy, both in high school) has been doing things that make me upset and jealous. She’s been hanging out with someone who hates me, and is very disrespectful to everyone, he’s the kind of person who makes a conversation about himself, and he has to be the center of attention. 

I put everything I can into making my best friend happy. I spend every minute of every day thinking of how to brighten up her day, but recently I feel like being friends with her isn’t worth it. Whenever I see her with this guy it makes me jealous, because everyone I know hates him, and she knows how he acts towards me but she still hangs with him rather than me, the person who has been there for her at her worst and listened to her problems.

So I told her. I told her that I can’t handle being her friend if this is how she’s gonna act, because over the last couple months I’ve had multiple breakdowns because of stress and this whole thing just was too much for me last night. She told me to be honest and she could never be mad at me, but when I told her she left me on “seen” and hasn’t talked to me.

303,"Hey, this is my first r/advice post and I don't really know if this is the right subreddit but I do need advice.

I'm a 17 y.o. born as a girl  and I've had a fair share of mental health issues in the past and struggle with depression and anxiety. I'm also not straight but still not sure what sexuality exactly. 
The reason I haven't figured that out already is because I tried to avoid any thinking having to do with me or my problems. This probably stems from my previous tries to get rid of mental illness by ""just pretending it's not there"".

Now I recently got into a fight with my father whom I live with because he found out about my self harm and decided to put a stop in that by forcing me to tell my therapist. After a very long and discussion with her I finally admitted to needing help and she told me, somewhat as a homework until our next meeting, to think of issues I have but never spoke about or put thought in. So far so good.

Now that I'm kind of forced to spend time with my issues and think about what's wrong I noticed that I feel really ""wrong"" in my body. Before that I just thought that I had issues with it because I was always overweight (not obese but chunky nonetheless) but now I start to doubt that. 
I remembered how disappointed I was that my voice never cracked and how traumatizing my first period was for me. And the first few years of developing my chest I felt embarrassed by having it, for me they've always seemed more like ""manboobs"" (for lack of a better term). 
As a child I was raised rather gender neutral (my parents are very liberal) so I was never forced to be feminine. Even though I wore girls clothes my personality was always ""boyish"" by that I mean brutally honest, funny (especially good with puns and dirty jokes) and smart.
Because I was always a chubby kid I was never fast or agile enough for being good at sports so I started to pick up karate as a kid and got really strong ""for a girl"". 

My friends know me as a tough, strong, honest and funny person and through these traits (and me being 6"") I was always treated similar to the boys in my environment which never bothered me in the slightest.

Two years ago I cut my hair really short and people started mistaking me for a boy which caused anguish for my father but made me feel proud for some reason. But I couldn't convince him to let me keep it (he doesn't really let me have freedom or privacy) so now my hair is back to almost shoulder length and people see me as a girl again (which feels surprisingly bad actually).

I don't know what to do. The thought of ""becoming"" a man feels really good to me, I fantasize about a deep voice, a flat chest and face stubble constantly but on the other hand is my view on reality distorted through the lens of depression. I also feel way to ""girly"" and ""not masculine enough"" to be a guy but I just don't know.

Does anybody have some advice on what to do?",14Oct2018,1
304,"The tldr is I've had the issue my entire adult life and it got bad enough that I've barely worked the last seven years of my life.  I'm now 32 (I'm a guy) and I've found something that's getting me out of the hole (a new treatment), not even halfway finished yet but looking forward to getting off disability and back to work so am trying to prepare myself for how to go about this in advance.

The most difficult thing is that I don't know what I can do for references, since the ones I would use are no longer available and even if I tracked them down I doubt they would let me use them.  The best position I had was in my early 20s when I had a mid-level position at a bank I had to leave due to how bad the pain was, aside from that it's been fast food and labor jobs when bouncing around trying to find something that worked.  Regardless being honest about my situation is going to make me look really awful when I hit the job market again and I fear it may make me unemployable, even though I'm getting better to the point that I feel like it'll only be a couple more months before I can start looking.

307,"Not sure if attacked is the correct word, but anyways:

I was sitting in the metro, reading stuff on my phone.

A guy who sat on my right, on the other side of the vehicle, was mumbling stuff (to me?)
He sounded a bit pissed off.
I didn't react to it. I thought he was talking to someome else.

I couldn't understand what he was saying, he spoke quietly and I assumed he was just a bit crazy and talking to himself. Alcohol was my first guess but after taking a glimpse at him, he didn't seem drunk.

A few stops later I wanted to get off the metro so I grabbed my bags, and the guy stood up and blocked me; I couldn't leave. He said ""fils de put"" to me, (something like 'asshole').
My French is not so good so I didn't respond to him. I just looked at him like ""?! What is wrong?""
And then he slapped me on the side of my face, quite hard. My ear was ringing.

I was surprised, I didn't react, I was still sitting in my seat, but I needed to go out because it was my stop.

I kept looking at him like with a face like ""huh? What's wrong? Why would you hit me?""

He hit me again and said the same words again.
The metro was full of people, nobody cared.

I really needed to get out, so I stood up (which made him make a small step backwards) and then I made my way through to the exit.

He followed me out, and kept following me.
I said ""do you speak English? Vous parlez anglais??""
He said some stuff but I didn't understand his French. It sounded like he was just raging at me.

He kept following me, and since nobody else helped me, I called the cops while walking away.
I was able to call them without the guy interrupting me, and after that basically he left and I was ok.

My main question is just 'why?' What did I do to upset him?
There must be a reason, no? He was seemingly alone. It didn't look like he was just bullying me to show off for friends. He was just alone, and as far as I can guess, he was really pissed off about something I did.

I'm also wondering what I should do if he comes to me again. I need to take that metro often.

Any ideas?

310,"Desperately need advice. There are a few moving parts to this, but I will try and keep it concise:

My successful sister got  married to a ""nice guy"" a while ago. He turned out to be an asshole; he would be mister nice guy in public but a passive aggressive dickhead at home.

They had a daughter. About two years later the he up and leaves for another woman and files for divorce

He had a good lawyer, my sister's was useless. All she got was custody and a pittance of child support.

My sister and her daughter then moved back in with my parents who are elderly. The plan was for her to stay there while she got back on her feet.

That was about 5 years ago. 

My sister, who was in a great career before leaving to have the child, now works a deadend job.

The daughter, who is now around 10, is a absolutely horrible, spoiled brat. She learned at a young age that all she needs to do is raise hell to get whatever she wants. If she wants something, she better get it or she will scream like she is being murdered and kick and punch. My parent's house is filled to the brim with toys that were all appeasements.

As of now, my sister doesn't seem to have any ambition of moving out. Along with that ,she seems helpless /useless with managing the child. She is bringing the child to  see a councillor but that only helps so much.

In the meantime, every night there is some blow out with this kid. My parents do their best to be accommodating, but the kid throws such a temper tantrum over the slightest things that it is unbearable. I worry each time one of them will drop dead with a heart attack. She also bullies both my parents who are so loving to her.

The ex husband is out of the picture. He married the woman he was cheating on my sister with and has had some children with her. I can understand my sister not pushing for him to take the daughter for visits like when they first got divorced. When they did do this, he would always pull some passive aggressive stuff to get a fight going.

My sister seems to want to spend less time with her daughter as well. She will make sure the kid is showered and dressed for school, but other than that she comes home from work and goes to bed super early. My mother winds up doing everything else. My sister also goes out on the weekends leaving her kid with my parents.

The advice I need: my parents want my sister and her kid to move out. My sister can't afford it because she works a dead-end job. I also feel that my sister doesn't want to move out because the kid is so horrible to deal with. My parents gave her an ultimatum. When the time came and nothing changed, she said ""I guess we will live in the streets."" She now uses that whenever my parents threaten that they will kick her out. As much as the child is a selfish and bratty, my parents would never want to put her and my sister in a situation where anything bad would happen to them.

 So what happens is a cycle of my parents getting driven to the limit by the daily bs, they tell my sister they can't take it anymore, my sister says "" I guess we will live on the streets then"" my parents back off and the cycle repeats itself.

I hope someone knows what I can do

312,"I am partially deaf. I can hear things, but only when I turn up the volume to what other people would consider to be uncomfortable levels, and even then sometimes I have to use subtitles. I use headphones when talking on the phone because sometimes the other person is too quiet for me to understand. The main problem is my relationships. The past 5-6 years, I have really struggled with relationships. I really try to hear my SO, but I just can't. I'm in my 20s, so not many people understand yet. I feel like my SO gets annoyed by the fact that I can't hear her, and interprets me as not listening to her. I genuinely do try to listen but sometimes the message doesn't come through all the way. My SO knows that I can't hear super well, and she is understanding about it (as understanding as she can be).

She doesn’t know that I know she thinks this way now my dad told me and they argued about to.

My brother is an ass let’s put it that way. He never lets me have my space and he doesn’t let me use my PS4 when I want and that’s just complete bs 

My grandfather can be a dick sometimes while we’re working. There’s nothing I can do about it so this is just a vent tbh 

My girlfriend is 24 years older than me (I’m 19) right so I learned a lot from her already like how to be a gentlemen during a date and how to be a good lover in bed. She has told me before that I’m the best she has ever had in the bedroom but I can’t say the same thing for myself cause she’s my first. The problem is is she Ms incredibly jealous, she looks through my phone when I’m away from it and she made a huge scene at the mall when I was hanging out with a friend who is female. She knew I was there cause a friend of hers saw me at the mall  and they called her to let her know I’m with another girl. I explained to her and she changed her attitude. I need to leave but I can’t because I love her and she loves me I love spending time with her and our sex is absolutely amazing so I’m attached to that. 

All of this is stressing me out so much it weighs me down so much that I don’t have the energy to do anything I want to do in life. I need help.

315,"hi, i'm eighteen and i've been struggling with taking the next step for awhile.

for awhile i wasn't entirely sure what i wanted to do with myself, but i want to try to get my license finally and get a job or at least start producing some sort of income so i can start to harness my own independence and skills. i don't really have anxiety about driving anymore- i mainly need more time practicing but i don't really have a lot of excuses to be driving so i don't get as much practice as i'd like and that definitely is slowing down my process of getting my license.   
the bigger thing is income. i do creative things like watercolor paintings, but i feel like my skills in visual art aren't good enough quality that people would purchase my work even though i considered an online shop. getting a traditional job is where i get stuck too.

i know it's not hard to look up and just learn how to do it, but some part of me gets a lot of anxiety when looking into the steps i need to go through to even get to that point. i never learned how to write a resume which i know isn't really that hard, but every time i sit down and start looking my mind starts racing and i start to work myself into an anxiety attack. i don't know what it is but it's overwhelming in that way, and i wish it wasn't because i know i am capable of working or just creating my own income but instead i end up in this position where i stress myself out and can't even get through step one.  
does anyone have any advice for finding excuses to practice driving more often and setting up to either produce an income independently or take the time to set myself up to apply for jobs without it being overwhelming? all help is greatly appreciated. thank you!

324,"In general, I like my job and I wouldn't intend to leave it, other than one issue that has come up, where we are expected to be available for customer support one evening per week.  (Direct customer support is not normally a part of the job that I do, and I definitely was not aware of this when I started, certainly not in the evenings.)  I've told my boss that I don't want to do this on a long term basis, and he agrees and is trying to hire someone dedicated to doing the customer support.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, they actually did hire someone, but after working for only two weeks he had a serious illness and has been in the hospital, and was let go a week or so ago.  So now it's been a month and a half since they originally hired someone to take care of this, and I imagine that they're trying to find a replacement as quickly as possible, but haven't yet (the job requires a high degree of technical skill in addition to willingness to work evenings, obviously).  The problem is that it will probably be a few weeks at the earliest before someone starts at the position, and then it will take at least a month if not more before have learned the product well enough that they can take over for everyone for the majority of support issues.  I don't want to wait a few months, and I can easily imagine that something or another comes up and in half a year they're still asking us to do support in the evenings.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to start looking for a new job, since I don't want to be stuck with this situation long term.  I should note that the job market is extremely hot right now and in general I could get several offers similar to my current job within a week or two, though that is complicated a bit because I want a part-time job with some working from home, which will be more difficult to find but probably not very difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything else to do about this than starting to look for a new job?  Other than this one issue (which is very important to me), I would much rather stay in the current position.  Should I tell my boss that I am starting to look for a new job because of this?  I'm not sure what he might do with that information that he's not already doing (other than preemptively fire me, but I doubt he would do that), but maybe I'm not fully aware of all the possibilities.

The only problem is I don’t know if it’s a great idea, we live pretty different lifestyles and I am sorta the jealous type, like she posted a story on Snapchat with her and another guy who I don’t know who he is, and the weren’t being particularly intimate, she didn’t even seem like she into him or like was ready for the photo, but I still got pretty mad about it internally. I also wish she was a little hotter but I think that might be a “the grass is always greener” type of thing and I may always have that problem.

So I have had issues with my parents growing up (abuse neglect etc) and until somewhat recently things have been way better. They do help me financially when I need it..they don't hold it over my head as much anymore..

My grandpa (my mom's dad) had surgery (he's 90..i know crazy but in good health for his age) and my moms been in and out of town to be there with him and my grandma (she has bad eyesight, macular degeneration). They (my aunts and uncle) take turns going (they are 2 hours away).

While my mom is out of town atm, I had severe pain in my back yesterday and went to the hospital (for 3 hours :( ugh) and found out I have gallstones and have to have my gallbladder taken out. I told my mom and she said she was sorry but what baffled me is this..

Keep in mind my one aunt and her don't get along. She says that she tells everything to their parents and she has bad anxiety, always saying they have enough to worry about.

Well it upset me that she told me not to tell my aunt because my grandparents have enough to worry about.

I have gotten close with my aunt the last couple years.. and I hate when she tries to tell me what to do..but I also know that I'm gonna need help because I have to take time off work and have 3 kids and I feel if I tell my aunt about MY issue she's just gonna get mad at me.. I feel like a child when she does stuff like this..

Thoughts?

328,"I’m an artist and do cheap commissions to keep some extra funds on hand. A guy messaged me to draw his d&amp;d character. 
Now my prices are posted plainly to see in my Instagram bio. He even said that he saw them and acknowledged them. I asked him what he was looking for. He wanted his d&amp;d character drawn. 
I spent a few hours on it. Showing him the rough sketch and the line work. I know it’s important that people feel their characters are correctly captured.
Finally I finished. I sent the final image and told him about the different ways of payment (Venmo, pay pal). 
About an hour later I realized I hadn’t heard back. I go check our messages again and to my horror I had sent him the NON-Watermarked final before payment. I quickly removed it from our messages but it was too late. He had already seen it and is now ignoring my messages about payment deadlines. 

It’s a shitty feeling. I’ve never been taken advantage of like this. It was a very dumb mistake on my part. A simple layer that I forgot to turn on before sending the image. 
I don’t have the money to go to court over a 20$ image I made someone. 
I’ve always kept my prices low and fair so that those people who can’t afford super expensive character drawings still got what they wanted.

So my question is, what do I do? I’ve seen other artists call out people on their insta-story that don’t pay them. I’ve seen them post arguments. And although I don’t have a massive following I still don’t want people attacking someone over the internet because they made a shitty judgement call.

He works from 3 pm to 3 am, so she hardly ever sees him.  We'd still talk all the time on the phone and she'd come back on weekends, and it came to a point where I couldn't keep it a secret anymore, so I told her that I was in love with her, and she never knew how to respond.  She would just say ""I don't know what you want me to say"" or ""I don't know what to do, I've never been in this situation before"". Before all of this I asked her to my date to a friends' wedding, and she ended up coming with me.  We both got pretty drunk and her not saying anything about the situation was getting to me, so I went and sat outside by myself to clear my head, and she eventually came out and started hugging me and crying saying that if she wasn't with her boyfriend she'd be with me.  Some other things happened that night, and we ended up just cuddling in the same bed that night since I didn't want to take advantage of my drunk friend.

Since then, my mother spent all of her life and energy to working to satisfy our needs. I grew up with my only family being my mother and my baby sister and since my mother worked all day, I ended up raising myself and setting out to do whatever I could to be as close to a father role model for my sister to the possible extent and to give everything of me to give back to my mother and make her rest.

I earned a scholarship for a very prestigious high school, probably the most prestigious of my country, and today I am in the IB honors program. Taking the needed classes for medicine and enterprise. I am a musician as well, planning on getting both my own music and my groups music out into the public.

I have ruined all of my relationship attempts, I don't know if it's fear of commitment or just the overload of commitment it would bring into my life but I just can't do it. This always ends up in me damaging myself and people I care about.

Growing up, I refused to think a lot about my lack of a father but now, as a growing, male teenager, who's life decisions and performance in everything matters a lot, I feel really empty.

This year I began to feel like my mental was not alright. I went through some very heavy episodes of depression and stress. I found out how my dad really died, which devastated me.

I fell into a deep hole of depression for not doing enough for myself and doing too much for others. I changed that by limiting the time I dedicated to my mother and sister. Not because I don't love being with them, but because I already spend too much of my time on making sure our future is better and sometimes the family tension is too high. And yes it worked for what I wanted, I got out of that hole, but This resulted in them demanding so much more from me and being angry at me.

The weight of pushing my family into happiness and economic success is breaking me with pressure and stress. I exercise constantly and whenever I get time I focus it on my music.

I don't have any sense of direction currently. I am lost. I am tired. I barely get a day to rest every three weeks or so and my body is exhausted. I just want everything to stop.

I have had suicide thoughts in the past and I have always blocked them with the effects it would have on my sister and mother, who are the people I love the most. So I know for a fact I won't do it. I don't want to die, but I just do not want to live either. It's too much weight...",14Oct2018,1

I am so angry and confused that there's some stuff so wrong with my character that she isn't willing to tell me because it'll destroy our relationship. I want to know whats so terribly wrong with me so I can fix it but she says its so ""fundamental"" that I ""can't change anything about it"". Not knowing is truly tearing me apart. However, would knowing be even worse??? Should I keep pushing for answers?? Its maddening to know that there's so many flaws in my character that I apparently can't see. She says it won't solve anything if she tells me its so hard to deal with. ",14Oct2018,1
342,"So I'm a 22 year old male who works as a car mechanic at a dealership, and since last wednesday I have a aching pain located near my tailbone.

I can hardly drive a car or move in my fatigue because of it, so I went to a doctor for examination and he thinks it could be a pilonidal cyst. received some pencillin and had to take a bloodtest and hand in some feces for testing. 

Coming week I have to make an appointment with my own doctor for further examination.

&amp;#x200B;

I had taken the rest of the day off on friday to have 3 days of recovering, now the pain has lessened quite a bit, but it's still tender to touch.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to call in sick tomorrow or at least till I know for certain what I'm dealing with.

However, I feel an uneasiness calling in sick while, except for the pain, I feel to be ready to go to work.

Am I making the right decision?",14Oct2018,1

And I only wear baggy pants or sweatpants and baggy t-shirts because I am embarassed of my body. 
Now, I have a lot of clothes. What should I do with them? I want to lose weight, but I know I can't go back to where I've been because that was unhealthy. Should I get rid of all of them? They were very expensive and some of them I like very much.

344,"I tried posting this in therapy related subreddits but didn’t really get any answers. 

Last Thursday I booked an appointment for my first therapy session.  I spoke to the office manager and hadn’t spoken to or met the therapist I’d be meeting with. Later that day she emailed me introducing herself, asked one or two basic questions and then asked when I’d be available for a quick call. Since I’ve answered this has been everything that’s happened:

-  She never answered my email back to confirm a time to call, instead she waited until Friday night to tell me she has been having phone trouble and asked if we could talk this weekend. I answered again, telling her I’m not doing anything this weekend so whenever is good for her.  Which I thought the whole thing was odd, because you can use an office phone or something but that’s besides the point. 

-  She never answered that email telling her about my weekend availability until this afternoon. Saying she’s still having phone trouble. And then she goes on to say someone booked the room over our appointment, so she has to cancel then and asked if there’s another day we could do. 

I picked this therapist because she’s only slightly older than me (both college aged) so I thought she’d be able to relate better. But I dont know if I’m just getting unnecessarily annoyed or what. But is this normal?  Should I just look for a different therapist?  It doesn’t seem very professional to me.  ",14Oct2018,1
346,"I need some help.... with my best friend.

we've known each other for 7 years now and we've been through medical school together and survived and made it to the other side. I've helped her through lots of little things and big things. she was with me when I was wrongly failed in finals and when things at home escalated to levels I'd never faced. 

But ever since internship started, she changed. she no longer treats me with the same respect as before. I'm not sure why. she started hanging out with strangers that none of us (friend circle) even knew. At hours way past a safe time. she knows we live in a dangerous city and I would be worried if she came back late to the hostel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The worst thing was those months when I was having suicidal thoughts and suffering at work. I had no one to talk to except her. When I asked her for help, she told me words that forever broke my trust. She said "" If you keep talking negative thoughts about everyone and everything, I'm going to stop talking to you. I can't handle your negativity. I can't be around you. If this continues, we can't be friends anymore.""

After that day I stopped telling her my feelings. Now I just listen to her issues and support her instead. She was never so self centered. What happened?

&amp;#x200B;

She helped me get together with my boyfriend. I told her I didn't want to date him but she set me up on a secret date without telling me. I was stuck in a position where I couldn't say no. He was about to cry when I almost said no. I didn't want to be that heartless girl. I gave him a chance and yes, we are still together but not on the terms I wanted it to be on. She knew I was working up the courage to ask him out myself. She knew that I wanted to be emotionally ready before doing this. If I said no, I wasn't sure if I could ever ask him again. It's my first relationship so bear with me....Why did she do this when I expressed my feelings to her and told her my thoughts? 

Sometimes I want to break up with him and take a break for myself and find out what I really want. 

&amp;#x200B;

she told him personal secrets about me before I was ready to share it with him. She would meet him secretly multiple times on the excuse of planning dates for me. She still messages him today when she knows I dislike it.

She's known him for like 1yr max but she's known me for so long. Why is her loyalty so weak towards me? 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the worst things was learning she told our mutual friend that she thought my boyfriend had a crush on her before we got together. Instead of limiting her interactions with him, she continued to call him and meet him DESPITE knowing/feeling that way. Why would she set me up with him, if she thought that? HOW could she not tell me this so I could ask him directly?

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked him, he told me he thought she had a crush on him. I told him I don't feel comfortable with him talking to her. He limits his messages to her to the bare minimum. Sometimes I feel like I mistrust him a bit because of his friendship with her. I've seen him hide his phone when she messages. But I want to trust him so I haven't taken any more steps besides voicing my thoughts once. He talks very little and very casually about her so i think he understands now.

&amp;#x200B;

Shes getting married in 2 months. I'm really happy for her. I am. With all my heart I know that if her fiance is what she wants, then I support it. I will have her back. I want to be there and be her friend. I don't want to mistrust her but why won't she at least talk to me? I want her to not ignore my messages and choose which ones she wants to reply to. If she doesn't want to be my friend, why can't she say so? I can move on. I just wanted to try fixing this. 7 years is a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

But something ticked me off when instead of calling me and telling me about her engagement, she called my boyfriend the moment it happened and told him. I feel so hurt that she considers him closer than me. After all the secrets I've kept for her? After all the time we spent together, she doesn't even have the decency to tell me? 

I don't know what to do... 

I really miss her but this feels toxic.",14Oct2018,1
347,"So I started this speech class at my college. There’s this girl who’s just a few years younger than me, it’s her first semester here, and she had recently graduated from high school, we both sit in the front row, our desks next to each other. I’ve been trying to work on making friends, or at least putting myself out there and trying to connect and get closer to people than just have everyone be “oh they’re just people from my class”. So when she asked I guess the first or second week of class, after introductions and all that, (I’m not 100% of the details and who all said what first or second) if we wanted to share contact info. I may have said it, or she did, but point is she asked if we could friends. I was shocked, I was like oh wow this is great, just what I’ve been looking for. It just feel into my lap and this is what I needed, to build me relationships as my ex-boyfriend had just dumped me. I said yeah that be fun or something like that. 

Then I completely change my mind on how I feel about the whole thing, and now I don’t like her very much. I like, or least I think I do or used to, helping people out. I feel like with my job now of helping people and that being a nightmare at times because people don’t understand the most simple things, they don’t listen to me, they ask stupid questions that the answer should be obvious, I get asked questions when the answer is on the website, they ask me about things that aren’t related to my department at all and so I have to either transfer or figure out how to assist them when it’s not my job to...it’s just been tiring, and I sometimes feel like I’m losing faith in humanity. 

She’s basically the kind of people I don’t want to deal with but I do at my job and I don’t get paid for this. She keeps asking me questions about our assignments when it says on our syllabus, our homework packet which not only lists the assignments and the requirements and how to do them, we have a page that shows when everything is do—meaning she has to reason to ever ask me anything unless she’s a bit confused about something right? Nope. 

I eventually sent her a picture of the schedule. Has that stopped her from asking me? No. I have answered her questions most of the time, but it’s just frustrating, and I’m trying to do my own thing and focus on my stuff. Here we are sitting in the front row, I’m taking notes, she’s taking notes too, the professor asks if anyone has questions...she never asks. 

And she does it in class too. The professor will literally be talking and she’ll look to me and try to ask me something about what the professor said. The professor just gives her a look like “really, you’re talking in the front row not even 3 feet away from me?” and I just give a look back that says “no don’t ask that right now, wait until she’s done talking, you shouldn’t be talking while the professor is talking”  Then she’ll ask me the same questions after I had even asked out aloud in class to the professor to double check about something. Same questions. Which were answered just a few minutes ago before we proceeded on. Similar stuff keeps happening. 

Then she asked me straight up (thankfully via text) How come I didn’t answer her texts last night? 
1) I’m under no obligation to respond to her texts
2) Her texts weren’t important or urgent or needed a response, it was the same as usual, what’s due in class tomorrow, and we have 2 papers each telling us when something is due 
3) I had personal stuff going on and I didn’t want to deal with her 

I didn’t tell her it was because I didn’t want to respond to or feel a need to and that I was and am getting very annoyed with her, and it was a question she could answer for herself. I actually told her I had some personal stuff going on, even a little bit of detail, and after asking if I was okay immediately jumped back in to asking me more questions about our assignments, not even responding with something for my response. 

This Friday, she texted me “Hey are you busy today? I want to hangout with you.” Yes I was busy on Friday but I also didn’t want to hangout with her, and I just wanted to be left alone to myself. I had only gotten 2 hours of sleep that night, hours of work and then an hour of therapy...I just wanted to take it easy, and especially not deal with her. I didn’t respond, probably should have but I didn’t want to right away. I just wanted to let it pass. 12 hours later, nope, she’s at it again. “Hello are you busy tomorrow or Sunday? I want to hangout with you.”  Still didn’t respond. Then yesterday she texted me “Let me know ASAP”. I finally texted her, saying I’m busy. I actually was very busy, just took a very short break.  Not even thirty seconds go by before she responds back “What about tomorrow? Why didn’t you answer my texts yesterday?” I just let it go. Few hours later she texts again “Are you busy tomorrow too?” I haven’t responded to that either...

I know I’m awful and I do feel like a bitch. Not just a bitch but a hypocrite as well. I shouldn’t be too hard on her—I feel bad and a bit shameful of how I feel about this and how I handled this, feeling pretty guilty. She’s probably like me and has been in my position, lonely and wanting friends and not quite sure of all the social cues of what’s allowed and what’s not (I eventually got them down, or at least decently enough, as I was tired of scaring people away or having them not want to be around me. I mean it’s not like people flock to me now, but for the most part I understand social situations and I’m not going to yell at one of my bosses or cut him down even if he insults me or beg my teacher and classmates to help me and have a breakdown in class) and just wants to get close to the first person who talks to her even half nicely. I don’t like who I’ve become, I don’t like that I judge or think hardly of lowly of people who don’t think for themselves or try to figure things out for themselves...I pushed myself not to do those things as I didn’t want to be seen as dumb or bothersome. But I used to, and still do but nowhere near as much, ask for help. But I always made it clear that I was sorry for asking, and I only tried to do so after trying to solve it for myself, and I’d explain I looked at the material before trying to ask. 

I shouldn’t equate someone not being the brightest as someone being a bad person or a person not worthy of my time and respect and appreciation. But that’s what I’ve started to do, and it’s not nice, and it doesn’t really make me feel better. And I usually end up making them not feel too good or liked or offended and hurt. Maybe it stems from my fear of being like that, seen like that. So I’ve worked hard to try to be seen as someone who’s capable and smart enough to handle things, worthy of respect by pushing myself to be the best, and is willing to try before wasting someone’s time and energy. 

What should I do? My patience with people is wearing thin, and I don’t want to become even more of a horrible judgmental uncaring person, but I can’t seem to find a lot of respect... and I don’t want to hurt them, those people who are my friends like that. I leave if I feel like I’m starting to get annoyed or snappy as I don’t want to hurt their feelings and our friendship. 

I don’t know what to say or do for this girl at least. I have another 10 weeks of class with her. I want to a better, kinder, nicer person...I feel I used to be that way, but not anymore...

I'm so lost right now and don't know what to do or think. I've tried every way I Can to get some contact information but I cannot find any clues. I deeply regret never finding out exactly where she was staying or other way to contact her, we've just been relying on Facebook messenger for so long and that was a stupid thing to do but, here I am.

365,"**Note**\-I tried to post in relationships but it didn't work, I have read a lot of different post about cheaters and some have related to my story but they where only a little helpful I need advice about my situation.

My (23f) fiance cheated on me (28m) here is a small break down of the scenario

 We have dated for 4 years in the begging of the relationship my family and her didn't get along at all, we kind of separated ourselves from my family to be happy. through this relation ship we have made alot of memory , we have went out of town once or twice a year she help me get out of my parents house she helped build me as a person and she has always made me happy, I've done things like make sure she has a better car , phone and stuff like that so she knew.

 We recently bought our first house together, my brother lives next door(yea he has been a jerk to her in the past but we kind of got past that I though because we went over there every now and then) I set up the house to her liking (floors, walls fridge , washer, stove, all that) The work we had to do added stress from the stress I was already getting from working dumb hours at work, we where one month into the house and it seemed we argued everyday and there where plenty of warning signs I seen but over looked.

 She started talking to this guy about a month ago that she claims talked to her the way she wanted to be talked to gave her confidence about her self and made her feel like someone cared because I wasn't doing that . I wanted to break up with her right away but she was honest with me I knew I had made mistakes and to make it worst my brother dogged everything into the ground because word got out, I understand why she did it she felt like things where never going to change my family didn't like her and she wanted a escape.

  We talked about this and I decided I would rather work this out than to throw away a relationship that I really care about, This is like literally the 5th time in my dating life I have been cheated on, every time before I was childish and instantly broke it off, with her I have spent more time than any other relationship She has done so much for me that no one else would she was suppose to be the girl I ended up marrying because I care that much at this time I forgave her because I wanted to see if everyone in the past has cheated on me maybe I'm the problem and I need to change , I don't want to give up on someone I had a life with for someone else who hell they may do it 3 months down the road and I gave up a relationship that was recoverable.

366,"Yesterday I gave my two weeks for my job. I opened the place up in March and have worked there ever since. It is a retail position; I work on the sales floor and as a cashier when needed, so I see pretty much all kinds of bs that you can imagine. I was starting to get tired of all the shit from customers and for a while I had thought about putting in my two weeks. I am a graduate student and was working there for extra cash—My other job is conducting research at my university. My schedules began to conflict these past couple of months so I thought it was just best to leave my retail position.

Right after I put in my two weeks, I instantly regretted it and have been crying off and on ever since. I do not understand why! I knew I’d probably miss the managers and my coworkers a little, but I never expected to feel like THIS. I keep replaying the conversation with my manger over and over in my head and I start crying. it was left on a good note but was emotional. Thinking about his expression upon hearing my news and when he said “you know, I really like you. you’re one of my favorites here,” and gave me a big hug seriously makes me cry.

It feels like I’m going through a hard breakup. It’s been difficult and I still have to go back for these last two weeks. I’m afraid I will be emotional at work and I’m slightly worried about having to break the news to my coworkers as well.

Is it normal to feel this way? Any advice??

TLDR; I put in my two weeks at work and have been an emotional wreck ever since, and I do not understand why. ",14Oct2018,1

I am a student that is currently studying for his A Level exams. I don't know why but I have just wasted my weekend doing hardly any work when I could have done something more productive. Even in general I tend to procrastinate a lot and I find that I do not get much done. All I do most of the time is sit and browse reddit, play video games, etc. and when I do decide to do some work it does not last very long before I stop. I can't remain focused on a particular task like studying for a test for an extended period of time. Maybe its just because I don't like the subject but I just haven't been bothered hardly at all.

It is not something unusual to pick up girls at parties but i didn't do it really much till now. I got out with her the 2nd day, got in a pub got a drink, we were with some more friends we met at that party, it was her first time drinking that much so she is not the ""party drunkie monster"". We kissed a lot and walked in the city holding our hands and other romantic stuff like that. Now we both left for our homes, and here comes the big problem:  


I am 17, I am 3 months away from 18, she is 16 and we are 5 hours away of each other. She is already really attached to me, like really, i think i may be her first boyfriend but i am not sure of that. I like her, both physically and she laughs at my stupid memes and jokes so she may be nice, but i only know her for 2 days and i don't think this is really healthy, besides that my problem with my parents that would definitely not allow me to drive that far for a girl that they with their communist mind would not understand as being ""a stable relationship at this age"", cannot bring this other way.   


With literally no way for me getting to her, she getting rarely near my city what should i do? I want to keep her because I never met a girl like her liking me back, but the lack of us seeing each other would bring the whole thing down, and I really am not experienced with the relationships, and also, how should I take on my parents with this?",14Oct2018,1

372,"My parents are generally apathetic to it and have known since I was 13. The rest of my family (on both sides) are less...enlightened. It used to be easy to sort brush off the ""Why don't you have a boyfriend?"" questions, but I'm 21 now and it's becoming an issue.

My mother's parents are abusive and her mother is severely, severely mentally ill (digging up the dead family dog and insisting he's just sleeping and cold mentally ill) so they're temperamental. They've disowned and reowned my mother at least a dozen times, but they've always adored me. My grandmother has a shrine dedicated to me. I've always been the person she says she loves most in the world, but once when I got upset and started defending my mother, she tried to disown me. I cried and she changed her mind.

Now, my grandmother is Korean and we don't know any of our Korean relatives except for her. She has a lot of wonderful Korean mementos (her hanbok from childhood, for example) and has promised to give me everything after she dies (including all her inheritance money -- which is a lot.) 

I once made a joke that alluded to being gay, and she flipped out. Like hyperventilating, angry flipped out. My grandfather held her and said, ""That's not funny."" So, that made it pretty clear where they stand. I thought I could get away with waiting them out and THEN getting married, but the other day, she basically told me she didn't want to give me jack shit if I wasn't married and had a kid.

I know my grandmother. She would probably cut me out of the will and tell me I was dead to her, but she is honest to God insane and I know she loves me. I want her in my life, I want those heirlooms, and if I'm being honest, I could really use that inheritance money. I'm kind of bi; I've liked a few men before and hoped the stars would align so I could fall for a dude and have the whole American dream sheban, but, if I'm being honest, that's pretty unlikely.

373,"I am currently working for a dentist in a small practice. I was in dental school for awhile, but I had to leave due to health issues and it was a very upsetting situation. Now that I'm doing better health-wise, I am working while waiting to get back into my old program. The dentist I work for has been married for fifteen years and has two young children. I have absolutely no plans to be a home wrecker, but funny enough, we would be a good match if he were single. My intuition says that he may have a crush on me, but on the other hand, he is a very kind person. So I might be misinterpreting this situation. \*My goal here is to differentiate whether there is a possible crush versus a situation where he is trying to build me up because he feels bad for my situation with dental school not working out the first time.\* My suspicion that my boss MIGHT have a crush on me began about a month ago for the following reasons:

\-He buys all of his workers a few pairs of scrubs. When mine came in the mail, I tried them on. I mentioned that I had never worn scrubs before. He responded by saying, ""They look pretty on you!"" And he immediately then said, ""I mean, they look nice"" as if he let the pretty comment slip. Both of the ladies I work with mentioned that he's never made a comment like that to them before. 

\-I had to meet with him one day because a coworker had been treating me like crap in front of patients. It was becoming completely unprofessional, so I explained it all to him. During our meeting about this, he immediately said he would take care of it... but this was followed by him practically gushing about how great he thinks I am. (I am not used to being complimented like this at all.) He said that I am far more talented than I think I am, that I am going to make a great dentist one day, that I am kind and very bright, fun, and that I am really devoted. I could be misinterpreting this because like I said, I am not used to getting compliments like this from anybody other than my own mother. But he was practically gushing, so I don't know. 

\-He laughs, I mean really laughs hard, when I tell a joke or when I am being sarcastic. He doesn't do this with the other girls. 

\-A few times I have noticed that he gets nervous while talking to me. He gets fidgety and mixes his words up? 

\-He gives me free license to run his social media accounts. The girl running the accounts before me was never given as much free range as I have been given. 

\-He will sometimes come up behind me and say, ""OHHHH SARAH (not my real name) IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY"" and sometimes he will tap the back of my chair. I saw him tap the back of another coworker's chair once too, but he does it to me all the time.

\-Sometimes the way he looks at me and smiles... I don't know. It just feels like something is going on. I hope I am not going crazy. 

\-He invited me to go with him to the state capital for a meeting with different private practice dentists next month. I didn't ask him to go, he just offered to take me. But if I did go, it would mean that we would go together alone. But the state capital is probably only 30 minutes away, so it's not like we would be staying the night together.

\-Whenever I make a mistake, he goes above and beyond to reassure me that I am doing great. He definitely never does this to the same degree with the other girls I work with, although he is always, always kind to them. He might do this because he feels bad for my situation with dental school. I think he is trying to build up my self-esteem because I was so upset to have to leave dental school, but I don't know for sure.

\-I definitely feel like I get preferential treatment. And again, I don't know if this is because he sees me as a future colleague or not. 

\-I was walking behind one of my coworkers the other day as he was walking by us on the opposite direction. I caught him looking at me as we walked by. It was just one of those situations where in most cases people would just look straight on. It's hard to describe, but it just felt odd.

\-I am pretty sure I felt his hand touch my back the other day when we were walking down the hall. It was probably because I walked out of a door right in front of him on accident, but it wasn't that close of a call. I don't know...

After working for him for only a few weeks, he offered me a position to work for him as a dentist for when I finally finish school. Sometimes I wonder if he is only being extra nice to me because he sees me as a future colleague, but there is still a large part of my intuition that says this is something more. From what I hear, he has a good relationship with his wife. He doesn't really talk about her often, but she seems like a great person. I know he texts her while at work, so I assume their relationship is fine.  

Anyway, sorry for the long post. Any thoughtful feedback is greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: My boss is married with two children, but he shows signs that he has a crush on me via favoritism, constant gushing about me/compliments, etc. Intuition tells me there is something else going on, but how do I differentiate this from him just being the kind person that he truly is? Thanks!

374,"Okay. So. I'm super introverted. I have a small circle but I have really good people in it. They dont start drama. They arent mean or rude or anything. My biggest problem is that they all, seemingly, suck at keeping plans. 

So here's how it goes. We make plans (I usually hang out one on one, not in groups). Then when the day comes, or the day before, I verify ""Hey, we still on for tomorrow"" or whatever. And almost always cancel then or give me an excuse. Some are understandable like having a fever (I guess I can understand that). Others are like ""I forgot and made other plans"" or ""I'm tired"" or other things that make me feel like I'm being blown off. 

I'm not sure if they mean it that way, but I've had friends I havent seen in almost a year because every time I come home (which is rarely. I live out of state) they make plans with me and then mysteriously cant make it or dont show up. I would take it as a hint, but half the time they're the ones making the plans.

Normally I would just say fine and not try anymore, but these are some of my oldest friends. Lots of history to be throwing away over constantly cancelling plans. And also, being super introverted, I'm very picky over who I spend my time with. My circle is pretty small... I want to tell them ""Dont make plans if you're gonna bail on me"" or tell them that its shitty to keep cancelling but I dont want to create a rift. I'm already far away, i dont need a wedge too. I know people make jokes about how excited Introvers get over cancelled plans, but it's getting to be inconsiderate. And again, it's like all of my friends....

And I get people are busy, but I'm never home, I give people advance notice, they agree to 
hang out, they cant make the time for me?

381,"My brother has recently moved out of my parents house and moved in with his girlfriend due to a familial issue, and essentially cut ties with them. He and I had a somewhat good relationship, but it has been deteriorating over the last few years as he's been getting progressively worse, emotionally and mentally. He has an explosive temper - physical, verbal and its like walking on eggshells around him because anything just sets him off and he'll lash out. He's been struggling with himself because he didn't go to college, works at a job he hates, and cant see himself moving forward in life. He's tried going back to school, but says he's been out of it for so long, he's not used to it and can't focus. He literally will take any chance he can take to excuse himself out of a difficult situation such as school. He's in a lot of debt, and has basically dug himself into a dark hole. He and our other sister essentially have no relationship as he's damaged it so badly to the point of her moving out as well and developing depression and anxiety. Their relationship is also another story, but im not going to delve into that.

We had a huge blowout a few weeks ago where he essentially told me to ""F--- off"", and that was my final straw. I ended up blocking his number to give myself space as in the past, after he would explode on me, he'd call me a few days later, apologize and expect me to forgive him and when I wouldn't, he'd explode all over again. I've endured too many years of verbal abuse from him and as I'm now 23 years old, I just decided to stand up for myself and to separate the toxic people out of my life. 

Yesterday his girlfriend contacted me and asked if I'd like to go for dinner with them to which I had declined because I still felt uncomfortable from our last fight. Today she said he tried to call me yesterday but realized I had blocked his number and said that he didn't take it well. Then I found out that they had gotten into a fight later that evening, that he most likely blew out of proportion, packed his stuff from her house and left. Now we both don't know where he is.

What do I do? I don't know how to help him. He rejects all forms of help, rejects therapy as an option, and essentially blames everyone else for his unhappiness. I'm worried he will do something terrible to himself. I'm just at a loss for words and actions here.",14Oct2018,1

Heres a little background of my employment.

I helped run a business that sells water filtration systems and reverse osmosis for houses. The business does pretty well since many people want clean water, although now that the holidays are coming up people don’t want to spend $400-$1,700 to service their systems (which is understandable) As for the water goes, if they wait until after the holidays, their water wont be affected unless they wait like a whole year, but a few months doesn’t do much. That being said we typically rely on weekly service appointments to keep the business running. Since we haven’t had many appointments lately, my boss laid me off, same day, last Friday. No notice at all! 

I still live with my parents so I don’t have rent to worry about right now, but I do have car payments and some other expenses. 
I have a few grand in savings, but it can go quickly if I don’t find a job soon.

I am currently in my last semester at community college, then will be transferring next year to a university. My major is sociology and I will have my AA this December. After I receive my bachelors I plan to go on to screenwriting.

My issue is that I feel like I am growing up and am ready to take on more serious employment rather than a minimum wage job. I used to work in a restaurant as a host, making $12/hr + skimpy tips, but the job I recently had was $17/hr. I don’t want to go backwards making less money, but I need a job.

I understand this next job may not be my career, but I want to find something that I can make good money, and isn’t just a local restaurant/retail customer service job. I’m hoping someone can provide some advice since I still am young, but I’m ready to start progressing and moving forward and shaping my life. 


I’d appreciate any type of insight from anyone, and am willing to hear about all types of jobs that people have information on whether it’s remote work to internships n all that jazzzzz.

I just sometimes get a hunch he likes me tho because of a lot of little things he does (calls me his fav coworker (jokingly?), (jokingly?) calls me beautiful when I ""force"" him to give me a compliment, gives me rides home, I overheard from a coworker that he got upset when he thought I left abruptly without saying goodbye, he doesn't wear glasses whenever I'm around (but when I pop in unexpectedly, he is always wearing glasses), mirroring body language, he remembers little details about me and our convos, coworkers imply that there's something going on between us, etc.).



BUT I get huge signs that he's not into me like he doesn't ask me questions about my life (but he did say I'm evasive and don't reveal much about myself), goes on his phone sometimes at work (=shows he's not interested in treasuring time with me), he doesn't show up early to catch a glimpse of me when my shift ends 30 mins before his shift begins (when I stay late to talk to him all the time) and most of all he hasn't asked for my phone number (but he has other female coworkers' numbers) or asked me out. He's very complicated because he hides his feelings and thoughts!



TL;DR: Does mixed signals from a guy most likely mean he's not \*that\* into you because if he was interested in you he would be bold in his pursuit and make an open effort to get to know you and spend time with you?",14Oct2018,1

I'm currently a senior at a top university and will be graduating in late May. I worked my butt off in high school to get in and am so grateful to be here; I love my classes and professors and it has helped me secure great internships and my dream job (!). However, despite all of that, I feel like I have really struggled socially.

Throughout high school, I had a huge network of friends through different sports and organizations and was always hanging out with different people. I was probably almost too social and out of the house all the time but had such a fun experience. When I got to college, my freshman dorm was REALLY quiet which was a big change for me. It was a hard transition and I struggled to meet people. Freshman spring was sorority rush which I tried in search of finding more like-minded people, and that helped temporarily. Fast forward to sophomore year, I had made a couple of close friends in my sorority house and was feeling better about my school as a whole. I felt more adjusted when I came back from summer break and was looking forward to a hopefully MUCH better year. Then, in October, my closest relative outside of my immediate family was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. He passed away only two months later and it all happened so fast. It hit me HARD and I was miserable and grieving so I pulled back from any social outings and just tried to focus on my classes. Next semester I barely went out or did fun things with friends because I was having a rough time dealing with it, and even worse, my friends in my sorority house weren't supportive and stopped inviting me to things that they were doing.

Junior fall came around and I went abroad for an exchange semester in Europe by myself. Unfortunately before I left, I was diagnosed with some health issues that would make it nearly impossible to eat normally in the country I was going to be living in for the next 5 months (this diagnosis happened literally the night before my flight). That being said, once I got used to living alone in a foreign country, it was amazing for me. I felt truly independent and was so happy to be exploring the world and meeting new people away from my school in the US. Fast forward to junior spring, I was back at school and feeling the worst I've ever felt. I was lonely, sick all the time, stressed/anxious, and dying to go home. Because I went abroad I had a shitty housing situation which made things even worse.

Finally now it's senior year and things are going a little bit better. I solved most of my health problems, have a much better housing situation, I'm finally a little bit less busy than I was in previous years, and I am trying to enjoy my senior year. But I just feel like I'm in such a weird spot. I had many nights out early on in college and even late in high school and I'm over the whole frat party/bar scene at school. Yet those events are the main social outings. I'm still in my sorority but feel like only a few girls are good friends of mine and not just acquaintances that I don't enjoy being around. Although I found my people in high school for sure, I just don't think I ever found them in college. People are so cliquey/cutthroat/competitive and quick to judge here and idk if that's the competitive nature of the school or what. I doubt I'll stay in touch with a lot of people here, yet I want to try to enjoy the rest of my year regardless since you only get to go to college once. I guess feeling restless is the best way to describe it - I haven't enjoyed a decent amount of my time here (despite all the amazing opportunities it's given me) and am trying to consciously make an effort to now, but then when I do try to push myself to do things with people I'm not that close with I get kind of exhausted.

Does this get better post-grad? I've made really close friends abroad and through internships but just not at school. Are there opportunities to meet a lot of new people and make new friends right out of college? Hoping this isn't a stupid question; I'm the oldest of my siblings and find it hard to talk about this with other people. Do you guys have any advice for surviving the rest of the year and trying to be more positive about everything? Thank you so much",14Oct2018,1

402,"Hey guys. For the last few months I've noticed a decrease in the hearing in my left ear. I can still hear fine and do not have any problems hearing people talking to me. I suspect that it's been caused by standing too close to the speakers at some concert. I'm not sure what concert though... I've gone to plenty where my ears are tired afterwards, but usually make at least some effort not to go SUPER close to the volume. Anyway, it's to the point where music sounds lopsided. I like listening to high quality music and can definitely notice when I'm not hearing the left side of a song. I do not listen to music 'too loud' in earbuds/headphones, but I probably listen louder than the average person. Internet guides are directed at old people and so I can't find any advice oriented towards my situation.  


I want to get my ears checked by a professional. I doubt they would be able to do anything to help me directly, but if nothing else I want to start a record so I can understand how my hearing changes over time. Who would I go to for this appointment? I've never really made appointments with my doctor because I hate Kaiser's guts but I need to do this now.

403,"hey yall, I've been struggling with how to approach this for awhile, guess maybe it's time to ask around. I haven't written about this experience / issue much so apologies that it's long and ranty. also, I am missing huge chunks of my childhood, so this isn't as detailed as I'd like. I'm not sure why I don't have much memory of growing up, but bear with me. 

my parents and I were never very emotionally connected, my dad wasn't around much growing up (went out often, he and my mom are still together). my dad has some serious toxic masculinity stuff going on, my mom continues to defer to him for everything to this day. there were threats of violence that were never carried through, but present nonetheless. I was consistently told I wasn't ""allowed to have an opinion"" about anything at all until I was 18. (I was a hard headed liberal kid growing up, but that is no way to raise a kid). he also alienated me from my mom's half of the family, because he didn't like them and thought they were strange--truthfully I wish I could have connected to them more, but you take in lots of opinions growing up and my view of them is unfortunately very skewed now. I'm working on it. (my father is exactly the man I don't ever want to be.)

I was emotionally, socially, and intellectually stunted by their casual neglect--if my desired activities required any effort by them, they absolutely did not happen, including whatever social things kids do, extra curriculars, etc. I had a few friends but they weren't allowed over much and until I could drive I had to be picked up to go anywhere. conveniently, we moved to bumfuck nowhere 30min out of the nearest city. nobody's picking that kid up to go to the mall 😂. 

when I was in my early teens, they had another child (intentionally) which I suspect was related to my increasingly apparent queerness, which they would never admit outright. their parenting style has not changed, resulting in another human who will either be entirely unequipped for real life, or will learn it on the fly like I did. as of right now, the former seems more likely. 

we speak a couple times a year, if I've done something notable or if *I* make plans to see them. we will go months without speaking if I don't initiate. my father 100% ignored my birthday this year (I'm in my mid-20s so it's not a huge deal, but our birthdays are less than a week apart, so I was certainly put off). point being, the effort is not there. 

lastly, they would NEVER understand any of this, and would more than likely hit me with the following guilt trip: a) money was and is tight so we work and are tired often / b) we did what we thought was best.

To this day I have a hard time grasping that I didn't/don't deserve this, or that this isn't want family does. My partner's family is very close and it's totally foreign to me but opening my eyes to what I missed. 

TLDR/THE QUESTION PART--
so, how do you decide to either ditch your family or hold them accountable when your relationship wasn't/isn't catastrophically bad... Just neglectful and nonexistent? What would you do?",14Oct2018,1
405,"The title may sound a bit rough. I want to emphasize that I dont have depression as far as I know. But for quite some time now I have a serious problem with how i spend my spare time  and its really stressing me out. 

So here is a little background on myself. I am 26 years old and currently working on my PhD degree. But despite of that, I have the feeling I am going nowhere with my life because I just waste most of my free time I got on youtube facebook and reddit (sorry reddit, but its mostly youtube anyways).   


I do have some really good friends and I am very happy to have them. But while I stayed in my home region, most of them moved away so I cant meet them spontaneously. I spend most of my time alone infront of my computer. Thats how it has been for quite some time now and I dont complain. However, I hate myself for the way I am spending that time.   
When I was in school I used to code a lot, I always had some project to work on,I enjoyed it and I had the feeling it drives me forward somehow. I also enjoy working with my hands, like working on cars, weld stuff etc. But I dont like to do something for the sole purpose of doing it, for example welding pieces together to cut them apart later is not my jam (nobody does that but I guess you get the point).   
Long story short, I feel like I need something to work on, some kind of project or a goal I want to achive, but I dont have something like that at the moment. I may have some huge projects in mind but Its too much to even start.   
So most of the time I just genuinely dont know what I should do. and then I sit here, watch shit on youtube all day and achieve nothing, like I did this whole weekend! It just seems so ridiculous, I am not at all happy with it but I dont know how to change It. And It goes on for months if not years now. It drives me nuts.

406,"I've known for a while that my friend has been using meth. She came to me recently and told me she wanted to quit, that is messing with her health and she hated it, and I agreed to help her. I got rid of the rest of her stash and took over her finances so she wouldn't have access to more.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few weeks didn't seem so bad, I realize now because she still had a backup stash and was secretly using, but that's gone now. She's been tired and quiet up until now, but the last few nights have been horrible. She's been alternating between begging me to give her more (I couldn't even if I wanted to, it's all gone) and threatening me to give her more (I'm not scared of her, I must have at least 70lbs on her). Last night she had some kind of psychotic break, she became unable to talk/answer, started screaming/crying, threatening to kill herself, asked me to have sex with her, didn't seem to realize where she was. She saw/heard things that weren't there, she's been very paranoid, says that she hears our roommates whispering about how horrible she is which I know to be untrue.

&amp;#x200B;

 At first I thought she was on Salvia because of how she was acting, and I thought she was having a bad trip so at first I was just trying to get her into a good state of mind so she would have a better trip, laughing, being more relaxed, I put on some music and acted like I wasn't secretly freaked out by her, and she did calm down for a few hours. I dozed off (this was all at like 4am) and when I woke up she was gone. After hours of searching, I found her at the hospital. She doesn't remember how she got there, but she said she heard something ""pop"" inside her and wanted them to take it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously she needs professional, medical attention, something I can't provide. But I don't know who to ask to get that. Her parents don't care about her, she comes from a really troubled home. She's told my stories of her Dad making her sleep outside for a whole summer and things like that. I've talked to her aunt who agrees that she and her parents don't get along \*at all\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to tell our school (we both go to a prestigious university, which I don't want to name but it's in the Northeast) which has a reputation for poor mental health and stressed students. She cares a lot about her education, everyone at this school does, and she manages good grades despite everything. She's worried if she asks the school for help, a counselor, rehab, medical exam, anything, that they will be more concerned about covering their ass than actually helping her, and she won't get her degree. Someone else told me that they're legally required to help her, especially if she shows signs of self-harm (which she does, she has scars all up her forearms and has personally told me a dozen times in the past few days she wants to kill herself). Does anyone know if a university is legally obligated to help a student experiencing substance abuse?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm terrified because I had a friend in high-school who started acting strangely like this and I thought they would just figure it out and they ended up committing suicide. I don't want to make that mistake again. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? She absolutely needs more help than I can provide her. Neither of us has the money to afford it on our own (broke college students). Her parents won't help her (I'm going to email them anyways), and I'm not positive the school is obligated to either. Is there some kind of need-based scholarship program from rehab? Are there free ones? How do I help her with this?

410,"  

I've got some problem I got into a short time ago and although I’m not certain whether this is the right place to ask about I thought about giving it try. If another sub is better suited, please refer me to it.

First some background information: I’m male and some 6 feet 7 inches tall with a muscular build because I’m a long time and avid gym goer and body builder of some sort. I should add that I’m very confrontational when challenged and I always go into a fight whenever I get the chance to do so and that because of my size and build I usually win and obliterate any opponents which makes me feel more manly and is some sort of spare time killer (in fact I’ve beat up quite some dudes this year alone).

Now to the actual problem: I like to hook up with girls a lot, which, given my build, is not that difficult to achieve, provided that they have some appetite for some big black cook which some do have (Although I know how that sounds, please don’t make fun of it.) It is one of my declared life goals to cum on a few hundred pussies at least once, which do have to be different in size, shape, form and tightness, hence I’m not into any sort of relationship besides one night stands.

Whenever I have some time and the stamina to do so, I’m looking for some juicy pussy (makes me hard typing this) to inseminate. I call that pussy hunting and it is the thing I probably like most.

(It makes for some quite interesting experiences to often see those bitches, whose warmth got to enjoy my masculinity, on an at least weekly basis, something which most people likely won’t ever experience. Imagine walking in your town seeing the girls you fucked like yeah, there is that one, which was quite good, and over there is the other one which was a tight adventure, it’s just great you should try that too.)

Doing that, this summer I happened to see some busty, fertile bitch (first discovered her on social media which makes for some good target preselection) with such a lovely ass which I just had to get (into) in a local mall I tend to frequent a lot and hence I “managed” to bump into her, while she was bending over to put something into her basket, in a way to ensure that she felt my dick pressed against her ass because she was only wearing some trackies.

In the end it was a direct hit and I did fill her up (she is white by the way, maybe she never slept with a black guy before, for whatever reason it was quite easy to get her naked) which was good or so I thought. Later on I ditched her like I always do because once a pussy has been filled up, it becomes boring and I’ve to get another one for a different experience and to add to the count.

Here is where the problem starts: A few days ago I left the gym and went home through an only scarcely lit park after dark, like I always do, because it saves me some time and because I consider myself quite a fighter I’m not worried of getting attacked or robbed. I am able to deal with that. You know black dudes naturally wear camouflage at night:) and such. Ha ha.

This time however, having made nearly half of my way through it, where the path goes through some area covered with grass and other rubbish where dogs tend to shit a lot, I saw someone standing there, motionless like he was waiting for something. The guy wasn’t that big, just very dark, completely so to speak and when I got nearer he seemed quite small actually, maybe some 5´8” if I had to guess but I’m not sure about it. 

He didn’t move out of the way as I was approaching him and since there is always some fucker who stands in the way I took a swing to give him the punch of his life with the goal to knock him out or fracture his lower jaw. That makes for some good practice and there are no witnesses. 

That fucking cocksucker had the impudence to dodge my strike and immediately got behind me. I felt his hand on my shoulder, or to be more clear, the cold metal of his gloves followed by a burning sensation around my spine with three or six (can’t remember) very sharp painful stitches.

Nearly instantly I felt very dizzy, lost control and went to the ground totally paralyzed.

Let me tell you that this is the most frightening experience of my entire life, even more so than getting beat up by some gangs in prison, since I laid there, trapped in my own body, unable to move, albeit fully conscious with the ability to see, hear and feel. It is horrible, I felt completely helpless and it is difficult to describe to others who have not had a similar experience. 

The guy bent down and stared into my face with this cold dead look out of his greenish (if I had to guess) eyes which still gives me shivers to this day.

Turns out that the girl I hooked up with in the mall is his sister and that he doesn’t consent to me fucking her. He told me that she truly liked me and that I hurt her feelings very badly when I ditched her and that he won’t tolerate that. 

He dislocated my jaw like it was nothing, which really hurt and stuffed a disgustingly bitter tasting towel in my mouth and told me that I had two options he would give me and because he is such a good Christian acting in good faith he would abstain from killing me outright. He told me that he knew exactly who I was, where I live and what I do for a living and that he also knows all my connections, that he would find me everywhere and because he is such a kind individual he would give me the chance to meet his sister again to apologize with me having to gift her something worth five figures, to make up for what I did to her, within the next two months or I would have to suffer the consequences of which no longer being able to walk would be the best outcome I could possibly hope for.

Next he kneeled down and took 6 vials of my blood. Of my fucking blood?! He took my blood, can you believe that? What does that fucker do with my blood? I’ve never heard of anyone getting assaulted and robbed of their blood. What the fuck is that? He then left with it.

Since I was in horrible pain feeling dizzy, drugged and covered in cold sweat I might have missed some details and definitely lost my sense of time, but to me it felt like I was laying there for at least between one and two hours before I regained my ability to move gain. Of course I went to the ER to get my jaw fixed which did cost quite an amount but I refused all treatments relating to my dizziness.

I made some mistakes in the past and went to prison for some drug related offenses and I did not want to be accused of doing drugs again since I’m certainly already on some watch list by local police and there is no pussy in prison. That night I also got a strong headache which lasted for about 3 days but fortunately went away later on. The area around my spine where that sucker stung me changed colour and is still painful if touched, but a lot better now than it has been earlier on.

Please help me, what should I do now? I did some research on who that dude might be and I suspect that he is a toxicologist who seems to be good friends with the local sheriff’s office, thus because of my record I don’t really want to go to police as they will just set up a trap to better their statistics I guess.

Quite frankly it isn’t economical to give every bitch who gets the privilege to enjoy my semen a five figure sum and I also don’t want to do that just because some dipshit pressures me to gift it to her.

From what I am able to remember that dude who assaulted me in the park wore a fucking riot control suit with everything you could think of, but I don’t know whether he had a gun, only that he stung me too fast in the back with something for it to be something which he would have to pull out first. Maybe it is connected to his suit or something?

To be honest I’m scared, not that I don’t have the money, I do, but that stupid whiney little bitch doesn’t deserve it. Her fucking pussy isn’t worth that much, period. I don’t want to pay her, but on the other hand her brother might have access to some law enforcement database, thus I guess if I leave the country he would follow me and find me?

At the moment I don’t know where he lives, but I could probably find out about it and prepare an ambush to off him before he gets to me again. The problem with that is that I’m not allowed to have a gun in my state because of my record, doing so would get me in big trouble if caught, murder also of course. I’m not really into that idea anyways.(I’m in kind of a difficult situation right now, one could mention that I did indeed fuck the wrong one.)

What should I do, how can I fight some jackass which wears a fucking riot control suit with combat gear and such, who has good connections to law enforcement, who has blazingly fast reflexes and who is able to potential poison me with a single strike for me to die?

Please help me, I don’t know what to do since my strength and build didn’t help me in the slightest in the park and most likely also won’t in the future since he is out to get me if I don’t comply.

For my whole life I’ve never been at the receiving end and also have never been at other people’s mercy (except the single time I got arrested, fucking cops), I feel so helpless and vulnerable, it is the first time I feel that way and I am not used to it and it really eats away my self-esteem.

Please offer your thoughts. Thank you very much.

PS: I do not want to have anything to do with the cops, that is totally out of the question, they will only harass and potentially kill me since I’m black and a former “drug offender”, if that’s the only option I might as well hang myself.",14Oct2018,1
411,"TLDR: Lost many ""Years"" trying to into uni after highschool, now im 24, with a shitty job and asking how to get better in life. 


After highschool i went to university part time, but could not adapt to this lifestyle, normally i had to work in the morning until like 4-5pm then go to university for 2 hours, but i couldn't get a job (didnt really want to also) so i stayed home until 4-5pm and went there... sucked. Thats how i lost 1 year.

After that i applied to the same university for full time course, unfortunately they were not enough applicants in my course,(BSc Marketing and management) so i had the opportunity to change to human resource management or BSc management. I did not like it, i wanted to do marketing (more focused on consumers buying behaviour, marketing strategies etc thats what i want to do in the future) so i did not accept and dropped out. Looking back, i regret it. Lost another year.

After that, i tried to go to another university, but its way more expensive like 10 times more. My parents were not rich enough to pay for my fees, but my uncle wanted to do it. Unfortunately he got into some financial problems and couldnt do it. I had to drop out after 1 full year.   

Now im 24, working a shitty job with a very low pay since im a ""trainee"" with no career path. Job hunting for the past year had been tough, got some interviews but always failed, my communication skills is bad to be honest, and yea still want to work in marketing... i do want to get better.  So i had to accept this shitty job, at least im having some money to buy basic things, however going to the expensive university is impossible and for the other one i may have to work 1-2 years more. (there is a possibility of getting some money from relatives but its uncertain..) 

I have come up with 2 options:

1. Stop working and go university full time. Fees for my 1st university is not that high, still will have to work maybe 6 more months.. 

2. Work and go university part time. 

This seems better option but, going to uni after work is exhausting, i dont have a car (not for anytime soon also) will have to take the bus (which i dont like at night tbh). I feel like im missing a lot of things when i go part time, like people say college were the best years of their life right? and also, i need to work on my communication skills i feel like with full time course i would improve. 


Maybe i should just give up on the idea of going to college? but then how can i get a good paycheck at the end of the month.. 

Literally filled with anxiety, everyday at work i suffer from it. I really need some advices, maybe my vision is clouded...",14Oct2018,1

414,"Hi, I'm a straight male at school, and lots of people if not everybody think I'm gay, why is this? Welp, I hang out with boys a lot (as guys usually do, so this doesn't make much sense), and I don't have a girlfriend. Note - I do have a crush on a girl, but I don't feel comfortable asking her out just to prove a point to everybody else.",14Oct2018,1
415,"A Tldr is provided at the bottom as this is a pretty long post.

Let me power through the backstory first. I started suffering from depression when I was 19. I have no idea if I had been suffering from depression long before that and I was either unaware/in denial of it or if it didn't officially manifest until then. It began affecting my life pretty gradually as pessimism, low self-esteem, low sense of self-worth, &amp; all around just flat out sadness/apathy became a regular part of my day-to-day existence.

The following year when I returned to college (I went to college several hours away) my depression began affecting my school life as well as my social life. My motivation to study and do work was annihilated as I often felt that I fail at everything I do and that there was no point trying because I would never do well. I would get so deep in depressive thoughts that I would zone out in lectures  I began isolating myself more often and I justified my behavior by insisting nobody wanted me around anyway. Normally I'm super chill and supportive of my friends and always try to encourage them towards positive behaviors and habits, but whenever my friends did the same or even simply complimented me, I would immediately negate what they said and reason why it's not true and why I'm worthless.

Some of my friends began taking notice of my change in mood and the fact that I was pretty down about myself constantly. I have a horrible habit of pushing people away whenever they try to help me and I'm not proud to say that is what I did every single time someone tried to help me. This has led to a few fights between some of my friends and I.

Also I should add that I'm not the best person to have around when alcohol is involved. While I'm not an alcoholic, whenever I would go out with friends and drink I always hit the bottle way too hard and I become your typical self-loathing drunk. I'd always go on about how much I hate myself, how my life is never going anywhere, etc. Worst of all, I've had a few times where I'd talk about wanting to kill myself and I'd even post it on Snapchat and send it to people. Let me be clear that I'm not justifying this behavior by any means, it's a shitty thing to do and I hate myself for doing it.

Some of my friends have suggested I start going to therapy, but I have shot them down every single time it's brought up. I don't want to go to therapy as I feel it is a waste of time &amp; money in addition to the fact that it won't help me anyway. Plus I don't care enough about myself to go. One friend in particular has been especially vocal and trying to push me the hardest to go to therapy. We've had numerous conversations and even fights about it and I've resisted the idea every single time.

A few months ago another incident happened with me getting insanely drunk and getting into another self-loathing, suicidal state. It got so bad that when she took me home we started fighting and eventually my depression was brought up where she once again yelled at me to go to therapy and I screamed back that I'm not going and never would and she slapped me across the face and walked away.

The next day in an extremely hungover and depressive state I saw her as well as a few other friends who tried talking sense into me and I finally listened and agreed I would start going to therapy. They were extremely happy that i finally agreed to go and I got a few hugs from them. My friends were under the impression that I would be attending therapy once I got back home from school.

Here I am several months later and I still haven't gone to therapy nor do I have any plans to. I've talked to my college friends a bit here and there, but mostly we're all really busy between work, school, and other life events that we haven't really talked too too much. No one has asked anything regarding me going to therapy and I haven't said anything to them about it either.

Now I was invited to visit for a weekend in a few weeks and I'm freaking out because I KNOW this topic is gonna come up. I KNOW my friends are gonna ask if I finally went and if I say that I haven't gone, it's likely gonna cause a huge fight. I don't want to lie and say that I've gone, but I also don't want a huge fight to start because of it.

I'm planning on remaining silent about the whole ordeal and not drinking very heavily to avoid another depressive drunken state, but if it comes up I want to know how to handle it. How do I explain to them that I never went to therapy and that I have no plans on going in the future? What do I do if a fight happens because of it? I really want to see my friends, but I don't want any drama happening because of me.

TLDR: I have been depressed for over two years now. It has engulfed my life and my friends took notice. I have resisted and turned down any attempts they made to help and mixed in with my drunken depressive, self-loathing, &amp; even suicidal episodes, have led to numerous fights. After a particularly bad episode, my friends talked to me and I finally agreed to give therapy a shot when I returned home. I didn't and none of my friends know. I will be visiting them in a few weeks and I'm worried the topic will come up and they will be annoyed that I haven't gone and a fight will ensue. How can I handle this if the topic ends up being brought up and prevent losing my friends?",14Oct2018,1
416,"When I was 16, and a junior in high school, I met my best friend. In my first hour English class, there was a girl I’d known throughout all of my life that I’d never really gotten a chance to know.  She smiled at me as I sat down, we began a conversation, and across the next few months became as close as two friends could be. Naturally, being two people of the opposite gender that liked one other so well, we began dating. The next two years were some of the best of my life, she had been there for me across several hardships, many great times, and supported me as I joined the Army. When I left for basic training, her and I made a promise that we were going to get through this together. I wrote her a letter almost every day, her words and her pictures are what got me through. Finally, the day came, I graduated. For those not familiar with the military, the soldierization  process is very life changing. The recruits come out very different men and women. I could tell that she didn’t exactly find the new me as suitable. Whatever the reason may have been, all that was left was AIT, and I’d be coming home for good (perks of being in the reserve). On the 25th of August, I arrived at Fort Sam Houston for 41 weeks of training to become a 68A. Last week, I discovered that after being away for only 4 months, she began to think that maybe we wouldn’t be able to work out since I’d be gone for several more months, and suggested that we take a break. If you’ve ever watched friends, you know where this is going. I did not argue, I accepted, but in full confidence that the break was only a temporary thing to keep her mind off of me. That very night, she went to visit a male friend of hers, became heavily intoxicated, and willingly slept with him. I found out shortly thereafter from a friend of hers that thought I deserved to know. I was absolutely devastated, I called her, she confirmed it was true, and in tears assured me that she had no recollection of the event and never would have done it if she could have helped it. Admittedly, I was quite upset, I said some words that I did not mean, and hung up. Next, I called my sister. I needed someone to talk to, and I knew I could always trust my sister. My sister however, was quite angry. Told my entire family, and used her social media influence to spread the word across my small town very quickly. Since this, I have been slipping in my classes, my heart is broken, and I still talk to that girl every day. I want to forgive her, because I think she is sincere, but all of my friends and family hate her now, and my newly developed insecurities make me prone to occasional moments of anger. I try to think of myself with a different girl, and I cannot bear the thought. I just want things to go back to the way they were, but circumstance seems to be preventing that. What should I do?",14Oct2018,1
417,"I have a very close friend who has been on a downward spiral for a long time. Looking back there were many signs that something was wrong, but unfortunately only recently did our group of friends realize how bad the situation is. Thanks to the help of an ex-girlfriend of his (also a friend of ours), we were able to realize how emotionally unbalanced he is at the moment. To keep it short:

\- He self sabotages every good thing in his life: professionally (rejecting good jobs to stay at a low pay high stress job), romantically (breaking  things up with a great partner and exchanging that for a toxic relationship)

\- He is starting to push everyone that cares about him away.

\- Extreme denial and illogical behavior/speech. He always finds an excuse for his bad choices, even though they don't make any sense to anybody else. 

\- He constantly wears a ""mask"" of confidence and happiness while taking at the same time about how shitty his life is. For instance, he is able to say"" everything is wonderful, I love my job"" with a smile on his face but in the next 30 seconds he will spill out how shitty everything at his job truly is. Always smiling, like he has no connection between what he is saying and how he truly feels about that.  Denial, again!

\-He is extremely insecure. He always thinks he is the black sheep, that people are judging him and that he is alone in the world. He tries very hard to conceal this and only a few people who know him EXTREMELY well are aware of this.

\- The same applies to his relationship with his family. He always tells that his parents don't care about him and that he is not loved as much as his sister. His ex-gf believes this is the core of his emotional problems. 

\- He is at a very low point of his life. Bad job, current girlfriend is an abusive drug addict, money problems, but he has no will or is strong enough to change this.  Everyone who has tried to make him see all this he has pushed away. He has a thick high wall raised and no-one seems to be able to reach him. 

\- The person who understands him the most and that still has more influence on him is his ex-girlfriend (and our close friend like I mentioned before). They dated when they were younger and they reconnected recently, although he broke things off very quickly because he can't maintain a healthy, love and caring relationship. We still believe he loves her very much (the only person he has ever truly liked), as he always did for the past years, he just can't avoid the self-sabotage, which sends him even further down on this downward spiral. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've read a lot and his case is very complex. There are a lot of psychological articles that explain and justify his behavior.  Abandonment issues, low self esteem, outer child out of control, etc. But I want to know: what can we do to help?? He is the only one who can change his behavior, but how can we support him? What should be our attitude towards him? Have you ever been in a situation like this? What did you do or didn't do?

Thank you so much!!

418,"TLDR; Believe I have a mental issue, don’t know if I should bring it up to parents or try to fight it out another year (which hopefully it may clear up on its own by then, who knows.)

So I think I have some form of bipolar disorder, or cyclothymic disorder. I have a-lot of the symptoms, but the main ones that are pointing me towards going to a psychiatrist is the constant hypomania-depressive episode that I keep flopping back and forth into. I literally feel my moods crash and change into the next and it sucks. So many things I enjoy become things I hate, so many goals I have become things I don’t want anymore, even though I need them. For example I have a job now, I start Wednesday, and I don’t want to go anywhere. I thought I was depressed a while ago, but then it cleared and I thought I was okay. But now I see I’m not and part of me thinks I’m being dramatic and I should just suck it up, but another part of me knows that feelings invincible, on top of the world happy, like nothing can hurt me , like I’m above all and have all the adrenaline a body can hold one day and feeling depressed, ready to cry and turn it off the next day isn’t normal. I thought it was my living situation doing this to me, but now I see maybe it isn’t, except when added to the depressive days I have and making them  worse.

Now I don’t have the heart to explain this to my parents. I’m one of those kids who kinda keeps everything to themselves. I don’t feel comfortable having that type of convo with them. They also don’t really take mental health serious and I don’t think they’d take me serious on thinking I have an issue. They hear mental health and starts joking about how ill have to “put my jacket on backwards, become a pill junkie” a lot of other bullshit ass jokes that take away from whatever issues I might have. 

I’ll be 18 next year, so maybe I’ll just hold off on pushing hard to go. I just believe it’s getting worse now. I don’t know, what should I do Reddit. Trying to crawl out of a depressing mood that’s temporary for who knows how long only to be thrown back into a couple days later is really fucking draining.",14Oct2018,1
419,"Hey guys! Me[18M in 2 weeks] and my gf[16F] just realised that we have a somehow huge problem. We really love each other and try to develop ourselves a lot, and I really mean that we do this and try to overcome the teen relationship cliche.

But we realised that we don’t so something good, we are at the age where we need to try things, to diversify to see what you need what you like and so on. And if you don’t do the things at their desired age, they will come out later anyway.

She’s my second serious girlfriend, I am her first serious boyfriend and we are together since january 2018. We have more than 2 years of volunteering and personal development even before we met (I felt I have to say that)

And what are we afraid of? We know we have some attractions to other girls/boys, but we don’t want to cheat, we know that 99% we feel the attraction because we feel trapped in the relationship, because you don’t have freedom and as it goes: you want what you can’t have. What do this mean in a relationship context? When you are with someone you can’t have/try/whatever someone else without cheating or breaking-up.

We don’t want to break up, but we also know that if cheating/smth related will happen in the future... we won’t be prepared for it. We have to be now.

We know a women that have some EQ knowledge and may help us but we already know that she would tell us “break up. explore discover learn what you like and need, and then, come back together, if it would be to be like that again”

But we can’t breakup, at least not because of that... but we also want to keep our relationship healthy and we want to diminish the chance of breaking up maximum. If we can live together from now on... we would be so, so happy!

But we fear that we need this diversity... because we even feel it sometimes and if we hessitate now, it will happen anyway.

They ended up scraping the bumps with a knife to check for scabies. It came out negative. But they still treated me for scabies.

But for those of you that don’t know. Scabies is these little microscopic bugs that crawl under your skin and reproduce and poop. Your skin takes 2-6 weeks to notice that your allergic to it. So then you start itching everywhere. But they are super contagious. You can get it from shaking someone’s hand. Like it is really contagious. And so if you have it, they say for everyone that you’re close to get treated. And so one of my close friends i told her. And she wanted me to pay for her doctors appointment.

425,"Hello,

I have worked for this company for a few years now and recently we have started to downsize and restructure our departments. My department has gone to smaller teams focusing on larger areas. Unfortunately I was placed in a position where the work load is too much and the scope of the projects keeps getting larger. I have been clear that I can not keep up but am at a loss. We have only been in this new format for about 3 months and already on our second boss. The VP of my department has been overseeing everything and does not like me.

I needed help with some work and he took it upon himself to do it but has been relentless on his emails and questioning of what I'm doing. There is already a way for him to see what I have been working on but now he is asking me for detailed lists of what I do, from large projects to small Ad Hoc type work. He asked me a few weeks ago if I wanted to be one this team because I am the ""weakest link"" and ""do not have good work ethic"". I told him I have been working 60-80 hour weeks and cannot keep doing this, as well as that I need work taken off my desk. He sent me an email at the end of the day Friday telling me he needs more detail on absolutely everything that I have worked on last week, no matter the size, and he needed it by the end of the day. I was leaving as he sent this and have not responded, as I have given him most of the information on what I was working on. Last week was the first week in a few months where I was not overloaded and did not have too much to do, so I took it upon myself to learn some new systems, organize some folders, set up meetings for upcoming projects, things along those lines. I feel as if no matter what I say to him on what I have been doing is not going to cut it. I know he is looking for a way to fire me or move me to another team.

I am fine with getting fired financially as long as I get unemployment, and I'm OK with it personally as well. I have been looking for another job in my spare time any ways due to all these changes, to no avail yet. I just don't know how to deal with this guy and what to say to him. I have been very stressed because of all this to a point where I'm not even sleeping well, which I am sure is somewhat common. How do I deal with him? Is it best for me to try and get fired? Do I stick it out and work as much as possible to get my job done while looking for another job? This could take months and I don't think my mental health will last that long. Is there a way to quit and still receive unemployment while I look for another job?

I'm in Michigan. I have a bachelors in Engineering but am in a different field. If there is a better place to post this or if this is not allowed please let me know.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.",14Oct2018,1

427,"All the things I thought were stable and grounded about my life, went up in the air on this wave, and I'm not sure if it'll settle back down.   


&amp;#x200B;

A few nights ago, I checked my email before I'd gone to bed -- and there it was, an email from my Mom to me and my sister telling us that she's decided to ""call it quits"" with our Dad. What made it extremely stressful for me in that moment is that I've just moved to Australia -- I'm from Canada.   


&amp;#x200B;

In retrospect, I knew this would eventually happen. My parents should never have been married -- or just separated 30 years ago. There was \*always\* tension in our house when I was growing up. My dad and I didn't really get along, my sister was hit and miss, but I'd always gotten along with my Mom. So I've always had her, no matter what.   


&amp;#x200B;

When I found out the news, I immediately phoned my sister. We both made a sort of ""promise"" to each other, that'd we'll get through this no matter what. I also decided to reach out to my Dad, even though we don't get a long. I decided to send him a message on facebook telling him, I'll be here no matter what.   


&amp;#x200B;

So it's been a week since that happened. I was reluctant to call my Mom but I did anyways, and I felt much better after. (She also told me, she's been seeing a new man for the past two months. At first I was kind uncomfortable at the thought, but it's her life, if he makes her happy then that's wonderful.) I still haven't heard from back my Dad, and I \*know\* he saw my message on facebook, and he didn't reply back. I'm genuinely upset over that. It would have been nice if he'd just acknowledged the email. I then thought deeper into it, and considering mine and my Dad's history -- maybe it's just for the best if we don't talk for a while. Now, my sister -- I was expressing my feelings regarding the situation, and my relationship with our Dad. Like I said, I was very hurt that he didn't reply to my message. All I'd said to her, was that I was very hurt and that considering how he treated me in the past, maybe it really is best that we don't talk for a while. She took this as me trying to pit her against our Dad -- said that she wanted out and hung up the phone. Quick back story on my sister -- she's had depression and anxiety issues in the past, so naturally her telling me she ""wanted out"" freaked me out. I tried phoning her back, texting her, but she wouldn't pick up or reply. She then told me to f\*\*\* off . I haven't spoken to her since. She has yet to call our Mom.   


&amp;#x200B;

So here I am, a million miles away from home, and this is happening. My sister won't talk to me, and my Dad has yet to reach out to me. I'm really hurt by both of them right now. It doesn't feel like I have a family right now. I worry about what's going to happen when I eventually go home. (Allegedly, they're still going to live together. Dad's going to live in the basement, and Mom's living upstairs.) I worry a lot about what the next few months will bring. I did ask my Mom if she wanted me to come home, she said absolutely not -- this is my time to be away and really enjoy myself.

428,"Wanted to hear reddit's opinion on my situation. I am now a senior at a major public university. After four years here I have made zero friends. I am not part of greek life. I graduate next semester and this makes me sad that I have had zero friends or girlfriends. The first week of class I had sat in rows of chairs like everyone else, but after week two no one sat within 5 chairs of me. I am not a terribly ugly guy, I just have anxiety, and my lack of social interaction only makes this worse. In all my classes. I have very bad social anxiety and hyper-active sweaty arm pits, to the point where I need to bring two shirts to the school day. I stuff paper towels in my armpits between classes. When my sweat stains are large, I feel self conscious and become even more anxious, thus is a vicious cycle. I feel like an invisible person on campus, and no one makes eye contact with me. I try to be nice to people and talk to them. My parents told me to try talking to people, which is hard for me to do, especially if it is a girl, and I tried the first day of class. I tried talking to the people immediately around me the first week, week two they all moved away from me and act like they never talked to me. I literally now sit all alone in the whole row of chairs in every class. I wear a lot of deoderant and shower twice a day so I can't stink that bad. 

My major is Bio-Chem, and I am 3 years older than most of the students because I did not start college until 3 years after high school to help my family financially. I used to be very excited to be in college but now I have never felt so alone and feel like I will be alone the rest of my life. 

People I made acquaintance before in the past in other classes act like they never met me and avoid eye contact with me when walking by. Even my professors seem like they do not like to talk to me and seem annoyed if I ask them a question after class. While most kids are having fun on Friday and Saturday, I am home alone in my room watching documentaries or studying. I don't want to post this to seem like I am rambling or whining, I am just tired of being alone and feeling invisible. I appreciate the read and any advice you might have. Thank you. ",14Oct2018,1

I've been suicidal and stuff. I just don't know how to work anymore. I made a To DO list breaking down these major life goals to smaller daily steps.

I want to get healthier and prioritize health and happiness as a life goal, but I'm not sure what those daily activities would be, the shorter things adding up to the bigger goals. Maybe a forced daily 1hr meditation following exercise routine? I don't know. Thx for any input.

430,"For years, I have wasted thousands of hours on planning to learn a new skill. Countless hours in the weekend wasted at my desk planning onto learning a new skill. Programming. Learning a new language. Music producing. 3D modelling.

I've constantly tried to get into things, to finally start on learning something new but it is so hard to start and even when I start I get extremely easily distracted and end up postponing what I was going to learn for the next day. And the day after. And the day after that.

It becomes an endless cycle where I wake up, check my phone, plan on learning a new skill and then thinking about doing it all day and trying to find good resources to get started until it's 10 o'clock in the night and my excuse is that I'm too tired to get started with something thinking intensive.

It's a really serious issue and it has rendered me unable to learn any new skill. Years later, I'm still just as bad, unable to speak any Japanese, unable to code much, unable to play an instrument or on doing anything new. I wish advice as simple as ""just get your head down and get started anywhere"" would help but it just won't.

I know this is might sound like a post of self-pity and procrastination but I really need advice on how to stop wasting my time and life away.

432,"Help. I need advice. Here’s a brief backstory - I was with my girlfriend for just over 3 years. I was pretty confident she was the one that I’d spend the rest of my life with. We were inseparable. Lovers &amp; best friends. 6 months before we split up we had a serious car accident where we could’ve lost our lives. After that day my anxiety went through the roof. I was crippled with anxiety everywhere I went. We stopped doing things together because I was too anxious to leave the house. She started staying out most nights, all night drinking with her friends from work. I don’t think she cheated on me. She’s always been a heavy drinker. It just got worse after the accident. I lost my patience with it as my anxiety worsened. She would drink every day, sometimes starting in the afternoon. She’d wet the bed etc. Ultimately the day we broke up I was getting ready for work &amp; she started drinking gin at 2pm. I shouted down to her “are you drinking already?” She shouted back up “it’s fine babe” anyway, I came down to leave for work &amp; we had an argument about it. I went to work seriously upset because I’d had enough of her drinking. We were no longer intimate because her being drunk was a turn off. I never stopped wanting her. I just wanted her to stop. I got sent home from work &amp; I told her I thought she had a serious alcohol problem. At that moment she turned around &amp; told me she wasn’t happy anymore, that she wanted to break up. I was shocked, broken. Heartbroken. I never expected her to break up with me. After a messy break up in January we have been on/off in contact throughout the months. We have seen one another &amp; talked about everything. I’ve made it clear throughout that I wanted to work things out. Since January she has been so hot &amp; cold. One day I get so much false hope, the next day she’s cold as ice. She’s blocked/unblocked me about 4 times this year. I had my Birthday on Tuesday. She sent me a shitty Happy Birthday GIF &amp; it ruined my day. I expected more. It upset me the whole day. Next day I asked her about a guy friend she’d been taking to Family parties (she’s a lesbian, we were a lesbian couple) I asked if he was gay &amp; she said “wtf, why does it matter if he’s gay or not” next thing I know, before I could reply, I’d been blocked. Again. I was destroyed. I’ve had my emotions played with since we broke up in January &amp; I can’t take it anymore. I’m so depressed that she’s blocked me again. I know she has issues, but I spent over 3 years with a beautiful human that I now don’t recognise. I’ll love her forever. What shall I do? Please help.

I’ve sorted my anxiety etc out now.

The title sais it at all. I am 25 made my high school with 20, didn't learn a job to this point and im addicted to alcohol for about 2 years now.

I actually have no idea whatsoever what to do anymore and think of suicide to be a viable option. My mother tried her hardest to give me the tools for the world while my father was an alcoholic and didn't do anything. I watched this whole drama until i couldn't bare it anymore, punched him and threw him out of the house. Asking my mother why this person is still in our life didn't do much ""he wasn't like this all the time"" is the best answer i can get out of her and im sick of talking to her because of that. I can't get myself to go anywhere anymore because i am ashamed of myself for not beeing someone that does something with himself. 

I frequently try to find a job, in best case scenario i get to a job interview and never hear anything anymore. I searched for everything that fitted for me but it didn't help so far. The first job i had was at IKEA which i left after one year. I liked the job and the intetaction with customers, tried to improove on everything, but i got called cocky, not a teamplayer, not interested in the job despite beeing the executive for all of the trainees. The rest of the time i try to stay alive with mini jobs and robbery of small daytime things. And alcohol....

I don't even know what to ask for or where i need advice from, im just totally lost and feel like i can't talk to anybody. I have some friends but i realy don't want to talk with them about these privat problems.

441,"Backstory: I am the youngest in my family with a 16-22 year difference between me and my siblings. My oldest brother for the first 10 years of my life lived in another state with his two sons and now ex-wife. After his divorce, he moved back and he would take me out to what I thought was just a way to bond since his sons that are around the same age as me were no longer around. As I became older, I realized he was just mainly using me as a way to find out if our parents, or if anyone in the family, was saying anything negative about him. I also later found out from my sister that he would say very nasty things about my appearance, intelligence, etc.  behind my back. He’s also a pathological liar and would tell people complete lies to their faces (ex: would tell people that he had a multi-million dollar contract with the Navy where in reality he did siding and roofing for houses). He re-married when I was 16 to a woman who completely tried to deny the fact that he had a previous life before her. Since my parents kept in contact with his sons and ex-wife, my brother completely cut them out which meant he cut me out as well. I was devastated at the time until I found out about all the twisted shit he used to say and do. My mom would sometimes talk to him via text or email, but other than that the rest of the family hasn’t heard from him or even care to try.

Fast forward: I am now 22, I recently graduated from college and I now have a new adult job and place. I would say my life, mental-illness wise, is becoming much better and I am slowly recovering from trust issues that I’ve formed because of him. However, my mom texted me today and told me that he messaged her earlier and asked about me. He also mentioned that he regretted never really forming a real relationship with me through the years. She gave him my number and told him to message me. About an hour ago I got a text from him that said, “This is your brother, just sending you a text to say hello.”

444,"It's weird that I'm talking about this here because I'm never the one to actually discuss how I really feel regarding this part of my life. 

A little about me: I'm a college student. I like to read, I play chess. I code. I have a bunch of things I like to do. 
I have a really good friend circle. We are close. But I wouldnt say I'm emotionally close to them. They all vent out and share with me but I can't ever do the same. 
But we all get along really really well and we hangout and study together yada yada. I'm good at studies, I try to understand things. 


The whole idea of love really scares me. And there have been incidents where people have asked me out but they never really knew me and we were never close, I wasn't even comfortable around them. 
My friends say people come to you and you just say no. But what am I supposed to do? How can I date a guy who barely even knows me? Who I barely talk to? Who I'm not even calling up just like that or meeting them, you know? Like we aren't even comfortable around eachother.
Even when people tell me they like me I just can't seem to believe them. I just don't get that feeling. 



I'm very serious when it comes to relationships, maybe that's where I'm wrong. 
What's the point of dating someone if you don't see a future with them? Why waste time and energy. 
I know this is debatable but I've always been serious about love and relationships, I don't like casual.

I don't know what's wrong. Somedays not having someone really sucks, all my friends have boyfriends and they all have had them for a while. It just sucks to see them having their own person to talk to and call whenever they want to. Someone who actually cares about their day.

And the friendship I had with them has weakened since they started dating because now they have their boyfriends to talk to and vent to and hangout with. It's all good though, I understand that you naturally want to be with them.
I try not to complain.
But it'll just be nice to have someone to hug when I've had a bad day and someone I could do things for and talk my mind with and ask them about their day and just I don't know.

I'm okay most days but somedays not having someone really makes me low and sad. I just don't feel good enough, it makes me question myself a lot.
People around me (just I guess) attract love, I can't seem to find it till now, I'm 19 for fucks sake.
All my friends who were also always single have started dating too. 

I know that you have to love yourself before you love anyone else and I've been trying since so long to be okay with myself and like myself but it's so damn difficult to actually genuinely look in the mirror and be happy and content.
I'm pretty happy with my thoughts and opinions but sometimes I start to question that too. Maybe that's the issue. But most people do like how I look at things, they come to me for advice.

446,"Pretty long so there's a simple TL;DR at the bottom. I'm a 20 year old guy who's had a pretty eventful past few years which has led me to want to make a post and start working on myself again.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically a couple years back (when I was 15/16) I had a ton of confidence. I wouldn't care what people said about me, I would easily be able to talk to anyone and keep conversations going for ages. I didn't do well with girls at all back then due to me being self-conscious about my figure but apart from that life was pretty good for me (I became really close friends with a girl however which I'll get to!) I had a ton of friends I would talk to daily and I'd always be busy and would find something to do.

Over the past 2 years however things changed for me and I currently feel lost/ unsure where to go next. I lost a lot of confidence for some reason over the 2 years which has now led me to be very quiet in social situations around people I don't know and it's even slowly starting to show when I am hanging out with close friends. I've tried going to things to be more social such as taking salsa and acting classes but I've found that they didn't necessarily help me much and I still felt in the same place, unconfident and lost. The one thing that I have been working on is hitting the gym and that has been amazing! I've lost all the fat I had that made me huge and have started to turn that into muscle, so that's one thing keeping me going.

That girl I mentioned before, she's possibly one of the closest friends I've ever made and she is still really close to me this day but when I did become friends with her years ago, I did slowly find myself becoming more and more attracted to her. Earlier this year I told her everything and did say that I wanted to get into a relationship with her, which she talked to me about for a long time, but declined. We don't talk as much now as I told her I'm going to need some time but that one thing made me take a REALLY big hit and that's probably put me at one of my lowest points of all time. I think I'm fully over her and I do also want to go out there and start seeing other girls and seeing how it goes but I want to work on my confidence before that just so I don't blow it/ go up to her and be lost for words. I've never actually been in a relationship before either so am still at that annoying stage where I find it harder to talk to girls than some other guys who have had experience before.

A small last thing which I've noticed too. I've recently started University and have found that I've made no friends. It's 2 weeks in and I've had small talk with people in the class but I haven't actually done anything with anyone or made any other friends. I just find myself going into the lectures, listening to the lecture half-awake and then leaving. Going to university was always a choice I was unsure about and I think it's becoming more apparent that I don't want to be there so I may plan on leaving, but before I do, I still want to make contact with people and find friends just so I have a lot more people in my circle. I plan on joining societies but the confidence issue is stopping me, I'm sure once I start going to one it will be fine but right now I'm unconfident as hell!

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for a lot of typing but I wanted to include anything I thought that may be relevant. Not sure how to start working on my confidence but I want to aim high and be able to feel like my old self again.

I know that the sum of my experiences is not a lot compared to others but having someone 2 years my junior be surprised that I am a capable adult every time I do something is incredibly grating. I think I deserve some credit.

There's also my family. They seem to sift through my words endlessly when I talk and pick out the most minute mistakes and them flaunt them in my face as proof that I am as childlike as they think I am. I don't even like talking to them when we get together anymore, I'm too afraid of the taunting. If I do bring this up my mom will either ""side"" with me in order to get me to calm down or she'll just patronize me more. In the end though, if I fight back they just frame it as a tantrum, because you know I'm a man child, and move on. I've demanded respect before but they just gaslight me and try to make me feel bad for not perceiving the ""respect"" they give me. 

I feel like I carry some aura with me that makes people think I'm a child. I do pride myself on being a child at heart while still being able to act as an adult, and I do enjoy things that most find childish. And I will admit, I have some serious babyface.

The organization didn't have any activity in this region before: they hired me to start it, so I'm currently working completely alone in my home with no other staff living anywhere near me. Having no other staff around is starting to take a toll on how well I do my job. I'm really passionate about this organization and feel blessed to have this job.

But dealing with this shit since 12/13 (I'm now 19) is a pile of bullshit and potentially dangerous because there could be some underlying problems. To deal with my cramps I do take ibuprofen but sometimes the pain is so bad, for example right this second, it dulls the  pain a little or takes a couple hours to kick in. 

Now for the advice, I know that birth control can help stop periods all together, which is what I'd want otherwise I'd get the surgery to have my ovaries ripped out. Anyway I'm wondering on what type is most effective? I don't think I'm reliable enough for the pill but I'm keeping my options open.

Thank you. ",14Oct2018,1
461,"So a little backstory beforehand, recently I moved out of my parents house (2 months) and moved into these guys I met off of Craigslist. I rarely see one of them due to conflicting work and school schedules but the other guy, we'll call him Steve, I see him everyday.  Steve is an older guy and does not work so he's home all the time watching tv. I could tell very quickly that he didn't rent out the room to women because he's had problems with them in his past, from old roommate's girlfriends and a messy divorce of his own. Which IMO I didn't mind because it's his house. Shortly, thereafter he told me no women can be trusted because yada yada yada.

Anyway, the other night I had some friends over to have a few drinks and play some board games. Some of my friends brought their girlfriends because why not? I like them and we are all pretty chill. As our group all sat down for dinner, me and friend thats a girl were filling the drink requests. I personally don't drink that often but I grabbed a beer. To Steve's account my friend Natalie asked to have some of his wine, to which he replied that she was not 21. Then after that she apparently took some anyway, but again this is his account of the situation. Steve did not say anything that night to us and stayed off in the living room while we were upstairs. At the point in the night when everyone was leaving she went to say goodbye to Steve, at which he just replied ""Get out of my house.""

The next day, Steve sat me down and briefly talked at me, saying that night Natalie drank and the other girls were drinking even though he told me he didn't want them drinking because none of them were 21, but every other guy at the party, including myself, are not 21. The conversation in which he told me this he phrased it as, I don't want her drinking when no one else is because that is ""alcoholic behavior,"" to which I conceded and said that is fine. Anyway, Steve told me because of the fact they drank, that they are no longer allowed in the house. I retorted back, why was it okay that I not being 21 or any of my other underage friends can drink in his house, including him offering them drinks. He came back immediately that he didn't want to argue and I should respect his wishes.

Now I am contemplating moving out because I am mad that I can only have my male friends over at my own house, in which he's told me multiple times that I'm in college and he doesn't want to hinder my college experience. Am I crazy for thinking this way or is time to move out? 

TLDR:My underage women friends drank where everyone was drinking and underage, and now they specifically are not allowed back in the house I rent out. ",14Oct2018,1

467,"My friend is suicidal. It's been like this the whole time I've known her. People have always come to me for help, never really understood why but it's always been a thing, and until now it's never been a problem. With this friend however, things are obviously really serious and it's starting to take a toll on me. Like I've always been a really happy person but lately I've been feeling really down. 

Earlier tonight I told her that I felt like I was becoming more of a therapist than a friend, and that I wanted to support her and stay close, but couldn't take on all of her problems myself. To this she basically responded by saying she would get totally out of my life, and if she killed herself it would be more or less my fault.

So this basically puts me in a position where I can only see 2 possible choices:
A. I keep playing therapist. She keeps dragging me down. I potentially save her life, or at least I know I made an effort if she does something stupid
B. I distance myself. Maybe things turn out ok. Maybe she kills herself and I blame myself for the rest of my life

I don't like either of these.

- Her parents know
- Many other friends are willing to help her out, but she won't let them

470,"I'm 24F. I have depression. I am not currently taking any medication. No children. I am not in counseling. I am NOT addicted to drugs or alcohol. I live in a metro area that is not a major city. I won't go into detail but my parents have a history of severe fighting between themselves and abusiveness towards me/my siblings. They have gotten better but they still have a lot of their old tendencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm supposed to be taking online part time college classes however my depression has made me unmotivated to actually do the work. I met with an adviser and I'm probably going to drop the classes and just pay the Pell Grant back.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been applying to different places (in retail) recently. At this point, I'd be extremely lucky and happy to be able to afford to live in a small no-frills apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents never let me get a job as a teenager and I have never had one. I do not have past a 7th grade education. I only have a GED. They did not want me to be in the public school system so they pulled me out and never homeschooled me even though they were supposed to. They are religious and believed that the end of the world was beginning soon. That was when I was around 13. The world did not end so now I'm here at 24 with nothing to show for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never wanted to go to college especially after the whole college debt crisis thing. I have no strong interest in anything. I decided to try this semester but I just can't focus. I had a plan to take math and English this semester then transfer to a university in spring. I think maybe I would do better if I had to go to class in person. However, at this point I NEED income. I was actually thinking of trying to get a CDL after I pay this pell grant back.

&amp;#x200B;

I only have experience as a sex worker. Because of FOSTA/SESTA I am scared to dip back into it. I do not want to be arrested and I'm afraid that it is more dangerous now because of the bill. I never made it a full time job or did it consistently. I only did it a few times. However, if I was able to, I'd be able to live on my own more than comfortably. But this bill has made it harder for sex workers, so I have to think about it carefully.  If I were able to move to a major city close to me, it would be a lot easier to get back into it.

 

I may be able to move out with my sister (who still lives at home as well) in the future after securing employment. But that is not guaranteed as she just started this job working from home and is not doing well enough in one area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do next. I can't get free counseling if I'm not in school and I don't think my parents would pay for me to go every week. Plus, I have trouble telling strangers personal things especially after a bad experience with counselors.

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I don't just leave is because I take care of a group of cats that I care about so much. Otherwise, I guess I'd just leave even if I was homeless. I don't have any friends anymore. I stopped talking to them around 2013 so I cannot ""crash"" with one of them. I used to not want to be in bad situations but now I don't care anymore I guess. I never wanted to have to live in a shitty apartment in a shitty area (because of personal safety) but I guess if I have to I will.

Back story, I'm 21, morbidly obese (going to gym and have lost 30 lbs so far), and studying Criminal Justice. Plans to eventually be a police officer, and then an investigator. Engaged to a wonderful woman that I love very much. We have a happy relationship and a healthy amount of arguments, and things are in general pretty great on that front. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that out of the way, I'm having issues with feeling like there's a point in life. I'm not depressed, I'm usually a pretty optimistic and upbeat guy, it's just that I feel so bored. I don't really suffer from anxiety anymore, and I don't stress about much. I have a high GPA, so school isn't very challenging, which I realize is pretty lucky. Even going to the gym is going great and I don't feel like I'm killing myself with the work I'm doing. I'm slowly building up and proud of what I've accomplished, but it isn't something that's so challenging it's keeping me extremely engaged.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I've grown older, I've lost all of my interests. I don't care about video games anymore, I don't like anime much anymore, I don't read, everything is getting so old to me. I'm so bored all the time, I feel like I'm almost losing my sanity here. I try to do new things all the time, but nothing is really catching my interest.

478,"Hey everyone

I turn 21 in a week and so far it seems like none of my friends are interested in doing anything that day.  It's right before everyone has midterms so I understand that people need to study but I had hoped for maybe being able to go out to dinner but at this point it doesn't look like that is going to happen. 

I have midterms that week too so I can't go home to my family for the weekend, and to be honest I wouldn't want to anyways. My family is filled with extremely social people who all had very over the top 21st birthdays, doing things like flying out to Vegas and going to Mardi Gras with a huge group of friends. I've never really been that keen on being the center of attention so I never really imagined I could have something big like that. They all think that I don't have any friends and just sit home alone most nights and have made this clear to me multiple times. While it's true I don't have as many friends as they do, I really appreciate the people I do have. I'm not antisocial by any means and actually love going out and socializing, never the less they still put a lot of pressure on me to be more like them.

I guess what I'm mostly upset about is that I just wanted a night where I could feel special. I realize that must sound really immature but I have always been the person to plan and spend a lot of my time doing things for other people's birthdays so I guess it hurts to see that most people seem pretty uninterested in mine.  What I want to know is how can I get over this feeling?  I know its just an arbitrary day but for some reason it still stings every time I think about.

493,"I'm not sure if this is advice but I didn't know where else to post it and i know askreddit would delete it.

I initially thought that most of the u.s. pop was against child beatings. And then I saw an instagram video where a 13 y.o. stole his mom's car to pick up his girlfriend, and even messed with the wifi at their house so that his mom wouldn't see what was happening in the cameras. Well, his mom followed him anyways, pulled him over, and gave him a long beating with the belt. 

So many of the comments, likely the majority, were supporting the mother and saying that beatings are the only way to raise children.

Here's my problem with this

1) if beatings worked, why would the kids constantly need new beatings? With pr without beatings, kids are going to keep misbehaving, so might as well make it a punishment that doesn't inflict harm

2) beatings don't stop bad behavior. They just teach the kid to keep doing bad behavior, but just not let their parents find out. My teacher, for example, said that her dad beat her once for raising her skirt too high at school. So did she stop raising her skirt because of the beating? No, she just made sure to pull it down before she got home. So how are beatings benefitting anyone here? Good job, parents. Now your kids hide shit away from you

3) there are other methods that can be more effective. I know this isn't an actual study or anything lol, but I asked my brothers and cousins if they would rather get beaten for something they did or have their electronics (goodbye fortnite) taken away for a month and not be able to go out. All of them said they'd rather take the beating. So clearly, being grounded is the worse punishment here. When other methods can be more effective than beating, then there's no need to harm the kid.

4) some kids ""turn out fine"" but some don't. Some are traumatized, some have nightmares about it, some become paranoid of things like high voices or fast approaching footsteps. And some also end up using abuse on their partners, thinking that it's the only way to resolve problems.

There's just more bad than good in beatings. Even the ""good"" part of it can be defeated by punishments that are more effective. ",14Oct2018,1

I work at a pub and a group of girls sitting and drinking and one stopped to ask me can they play music on their phones I said no we arnt allowed to play music and I said if it was up to me I’d let them but it isn’t etc and I walked off to get glasses from another table when she said something to her friend “he’s...” (but I didn’t hear what she said from there) who laughed and on my way back past  she looked back at me and said ‘what time do you finish?’ I paused a little and said ‘oh....10pm’ (it was 8:40pm at this time) and then she turned away and said ‘oh so you don’t want to drink with us then’, is this a bad thing?

Edit; they then left at about 10-15 mins later for another bar

I was accused of something that cannot be proved with physical evidence but only word of mouth. The type of allegation I am involved with is very touchy/taboo. 

My attourney recently received notice that I could take a plea of 364 days in county or take it to trial and risk way more time. I dont have enough money to take it to trial and Ive heard sad horror stories about using a public defender. 

I will most likely be on probation and have to report back for the rest of my life, possibly.

I have half come to terms that I am undoubtedly fucked at the moment. 

My parents have gone through a bunch of shit with this whole thing already since they know all about it, except for the plea part, yet.. and my sister is in another state ODing on drugs and failing to show up for treatment, which they also know about.

It is assumed that I will do a minimum of 1 year in County in NJ, if not more, after my attourney agrees to the plea.

Throwaway account, b/c i don’t want anyone i know to find out about this and beware my english is really worse.

We were together for 2 years and about 5 months ago we broke up and we were best friends for about 1 year, we did not break up because we didn't love us anymore, we broke up b/c i could'nt adapt anymore.

She started to develop mental health issues depression, borderline,social anxiety and an eating disorder over the years.

Everything was going really really well until last december, her mood went from okay to really really bad.

We are both going to the same school and we are both in the same class, when it became really bad (december) she stopped contacting me for 3 months and we didn't see us private for 3 monts b/c she wanted to be alone.

I often went through hard times with her but normally it only would last 2 week so 3 months were really hard for me, i also lost my father that month and felt completly lost with out her.

I respected her ask for some time alone but she also didn't talk much to me in school so that was a bit odd.

These months were hell for me i questioned the relationship but i also understood that she didn't do that on purpose.I basically cried everynight because i didn't know if she didn't love me anymore or other things.

After these 3 months she texted me and asked me if i would like to go out and ofc i accepted because i didn't saw her for such a long time.

We met up and everything was just perfect like it always was, she excused herself and wanted to go to the toilette after dinner.I knew she was going to vomit the food out so i reached to her phone and went through her messages to find evidence if she wanted to do it or not (She always wrote her close friend that she would do it or not) also because she would always lie about that to me.

As i went through her messages i also found another thing out...

She wrote to her friend that she would rather not want to see me and be alone, so she lied to me that she would like to see me, why that is huge? I always asked her to not force herself to meet me just b/c she thinks she needs to; this was a problem for about a year and she promised me that she would tell me always the truth about this topic.

So when she came back i was really pissed and started to argue with her and left immediately after, she was really broken and started to cry and hurt herself after my break down,she send me photos of her wounds and etc. nothing new i usually knew how to handle this things but this time it really hit me hard, she also told me that she loves me and does not want to lose me and that she lied to me so that i don't leave her b/c she isolated herself to much.

After apologies here and there it went perfect again for the next months and everything was okay again.  
Than it happend i asked her if she would like to go to a party of my fathers best friend that was like a father for me.  
She never went to parties or etc. and i knew it but i begged her to come to this one b/c dad's best friend wanted to meet her too and i always went alone to parties that made me feel really bad b/c all my friends and other couples would go together and ask for her and i always were the third wheel in this social situations.

So i asked her and she flat out said no i don't want to meet anyone of your friends or your dad's best friend and there are to many ppl i don't feel comfortable.

This tear me up and i went on a long rant about how she would never get out of her hole if she never tries anything new or faces her fears and it became from minute to minute worse until i just told her to fck off and that i don't want to see her anymore and i used a secret against her that she told me.

And the day after we broke up.

I tried everything in the same week to get her back but nothing worked, she told me that i broke her trust and the only way to get her to trust me again is being friends for a while ofc i accepted but it just broke my heat more.  
I couldn't take it anymore and i broke my promise that i will never drink alcohol again; when my father died i drank almost every weekend and would text her and whine about my life.  
So there i am drunk with a broken heart and i'm texting her and make everything worse.  
She forgave me and we went on, after some time i asked her if she would ever take me back.  
Than she told me she wants to wait and she can't look in to the future.  
I went apeshit again and told her that we both know that this friendship is nothing than a attempt from my sode to get her back and that i don't want her as a friend.  
Ofc she was upset and we started to never talk again.

Now after some months without interacting with each other and with me going voluntarily to therapy and psychiatry to process the death of my father and to get hold on my depressive episode i ran into her and we talked a bit.  
In that time i also dated other girls and tried to get a hold onto my life.  
Some days ago i texted her if she would like a friendly re-approchment.

She told me that it destorys her to see me and that it destorys her that she can't trust me anymore but maybe we will meet up again.  
And that we can make small steps.

I also gathered informations about her from friends and they told me that she worried a lot about me and that she still like me a lot.

And that she would be down to start a real friendship this time and see what the future brings.

I don't know if i should do it and i don't know if she also would take me back as a partner is there even a possibility to start a new relationship with me?  
But first of all i want to be friends with her again.

If i'm honest i still love her a bit but i don't know.  
If i'm friends with her and i see her dating another person i think it would hurt me a lot but i will need to get through it.  
And i'm afraid of falling in love with her again.  
But in the other hand i like her as a person and after a time i think i will get used to it even if it hurts in the beginning.  
Also i want to redeem myself for my mistakes, she helped me a lot and i want to give it her back a last time.

TL;DR :

Even if it is endless long you will undestand more if you read everything...  
Broke up with former girlfriend b/c i couldn't adapt to her situation also b/c my situation was really bad too.  
After the first attempts to restore the relationship i meesed up big.  
Now we texted a bit again and we think about seeing us again as friends for a start.  
I know she worries a lot about me and that she still likes me.  
Also that it destorys her when she sees me and that it destroys her that she can't trust me anymore.

I want to be there for her and redeem myself for my mistakes and actions  
This time i want to be a real friend like in the beginning.

She doesn't want to tell anyone outside of the immediate family members because she doesn't have the energy to deal with other people's reactions. She's a very anxiety driven person and I think the uncertainty of whether or not she has caught a life threatening disease combined with the fact that there isn't actually a set ""now you're in the clear"" time period is driving her crazy.

These string of events have been going on for the last couple of months and it has finally come to a lull so I feel more comfortable posting about it now. I am still confused about what happened and I don't know if we did what was best for the situation. I apologize for the length, it’s way too long and wordy. TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

*A little background on this...*

My fiancé is the youngest of three boys in his family. Together, we live in a house with his eldest brother, we’ll call him EB, and another roommate, we’ll call him AR. His middle brother (MB) is our landlord and during the time of the events, he was living across country but was planning on moving back into our house after he quit his job at the end of the month.

With MB out of the house, he entrusted my fiancé to take care of the household for him, as EB had a history of not being too responsible (i.e. getting into car accidents with MB’s car and not getting repairs done for it, stealing my fiancé’s prescription medication, never following up on what he owes to other people, and just being a slob). My fiancé’s job was basically to uphold the rules that MB had previously set forth for the house. But as his role of being the eldest, EB did not feel like he had to follow what my fiancé had to say and often times ignored him.

Anyways, my fiancé and EB are in the same medical class and through their program, they met another medical student, we will call her MS. They all quickly got close to each other and formed a friend group. Additionally, I started spending more time with her and we would have our separate “girl-time” in which I got to know her more as a friend.

&amp;#x200B;

*We were all friends for over a year, until two things precipitated:*

1. She started cheating on her long-distance boyfriend of four years with EB
2. She started dog sitting through an app for extra money on the side

When she revealed to me that she was interested in EB, I had advised her to be careful in dealing with the situation because I did not want her to hurt her long-distance boyfriend or EB. She was starting to cross the line of cheating on her boyfriend so I was worried, especially when he would fly to see her every two of weeks and give her spending money. I told her that it was not right. We texted about it after one of our meet ups and her boyfriend ended up looking through our text conversation. When she told me what happened following his snooping, she twisted the situation in a way that made her boyfriend angry at me for supposedly tempting her to cheat on him. He told her that she was to never hang out with me again, but she told me that she was still going to see me, we just wouldn’t post on social media about it so that he could see.

That interaction immediately set off red flags for me and I started to distance myself from her because I knew that she was just externalizing blame for her cheating. She would say that it was not cheating because she and EB did not have sex, but she would come over every night to our house and they would cuddle and grope each other on the couch where everyone could see. I know that some people would not count this as cheating, but even EB has come out to say that she was cheating with him on her boyfriend but that EB did not care.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after, MS started to dog sit for an app so she would bring random dogs over to our house every day. My fiancé and I also have a young dog so initially, we were excited about having another dog over for our pupper to play with. However, after the first time or so, we realized that MS was not going to be responsible for the dogs that she brought over. The dogs that she brought over were not always potty-trained and they often peed all over the house. My fiancé and I recently potty-trained our dog so we understand how hard it can be. But, MS refused to clean up after her dogs. They would pee and we would alert MS of it and she would just say okay. When we asked her to clean it up, she would agree to it but end up leaving it anyways. We have light colored carpeting in our house and cannot afford to leave the pee to stain, so my fiancé and I ended up cleaning the majority of it. At one point, my fiancé handed her our cleaning bottle and some towels and she was extremely shocked by it.

Additionally, MS and EB would go off to study at Starbucks, leaving her dogs in a crate in EB’s room with no supervision for over 7-9 hours at a time. The dogs would whine and cry for a majority of that period. Feeling sorry for the dogs, my fiancé and I would let them out for potty breaks, water breaks, and playtime, but when MS returned and saw that her dogs were released, she would be upset with us for not letting the dogs stay in the crate and “self-sooth”.

&amp;#x200B;

We were upset by the way MS was treating these dogs so we brought up that she should either take them along with her or take them to her house. We told her that she was neglecting the dogs by leaving them for such long hours without water or food, and that we could not ignore the dogs if we are the ones at home hearing them cry from EB’s room. Upon bringing it up, she immediately reacted and said that we were accusing her of animal abuse and that we were upset that she was making money for dog sitting these dogs while we were not making any money off of it. She also said that it was none of our business where she left the dogs. To settle things and prevent further conflict, we ended up apologizing for making her feel uncomfortable. Although we did not relent on how terrible she was treating the dogs and how she was not welcomed at the house anymore if she continued this behavior.

After the incident, we told MB about the dog situation and he said that he did not want any more of her dogs in the house, if she was not going to be responsible for them. MB did not want the carpets to be ruined. We told EB of that and he said that he would tell MS.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time passed after as MS went home for the summer, but as fall came around, she was back and this time, she and EB were officially dating after she broke up with her boyfriend. She was now taking cues from EB on how to treat my fiancé, and she was not shy about showing him that she did not respect him. Immediately upon her return to the house, she brought another dog sitting dog with her. So my fiancé and I sat down with EB, reminding him that MB was not going to let MS bring over any other dogs. We told him that we understand the situation and that the dog can stay for the night, but from then on, no more random dogs can come by. MS and EB then responded by leaving immediately. EB was compliant and we appreciated it, although he did not have to leave immediately. He left the house silently while MS left our house purposefully glaring at us in order to intimidate and slamming doors.

However, the morning afterwards, my fiancé and I came home from running errands and find MS there alone with a different dog sitting dog. She did not acknowledge us when we came in and made no attempts to tell us why there was another dog there. My fiancé and I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought that maybe EB did not tell her about the situation (as he is a person of few words and is not very clear when communicating) so we decided to go and talk to her. MB told us to go ahead with it. My fiancé said that he would be the one to talk to her and I was up for back up in the other room if anything were to go down.

&amp;#x200B;

He asked to talk and started off by asking if she knew about the situation in the house about the dogs. Immediately when he finished asking, she started to yell at him, telling him to not address her and that he should be talking to EB about this instead of her. She told him that he was nothing to her and that she is only be willing to talk to the landlord, even if he is currently the acting landlord. I heard the yelling so I went over to check and she was clapping at my fiancé while she was yelling. She basically told him to fuck off (in a more eloquent way) and I went up to her and asked her why she was acting this way and being so reactive and angry. I asked her why she didn’t want to have a relationship with my fiancé, since he is EB’s brother. She told us that she wasn’t interested in having any type of relationship with anyone in the house besides EB and that we were to never address her ever again.

During the process of this, she was clapping aggressively and accidentally hit my hand and face. For context, I am someone who comes from a background of physical abuse and I have residual trauma that I still struggle with. I knew that she was not purposefully hitting me, but I asked her to calm down and to step away from me. She immediately started yelling that I was being ridiculous for accusing her of hitting me and that I was trying to control her by telling her to back off. MS got even more aggressive and was moving towards my fiancé and I, cornering us in the hallway. It got to a point where my fiancé asked her to calm down once again and she only continued to yell at us that he started yelling back. She then completely turned the situation around and told him that he was too uncivilized to speak in a calm manner. My fiancé was still upset and yelling was happening between the two of them when EB came home. EB immediately took MS’s side and MS acted as if we were both targeting her. She straight up lied to EB about how my fiancé was physically attacking her, when she was the only one to put her hands one anyone. At the end of it all, my fiancé apologized for making her uncomfortable and she mocked him while he was apologizing. I refused to apologized and called her delusional (I was not going to apologize to someone who refused to back off and then lied about my fiancé attacking her, as unconstructive as it was going to be for the household dynamic).

&amp;#x200B;

Following these events, she continued to stay at our house as if nothing had happened. We all ignored each other, but then later found out that she was posting on social media about how my fiancé had attacked her. For a little more context, my fiancé and EB are white dudes, MS is a black woman, and I am an asian woman. She framed her entire post about the situation as my fiancé and I being racist and using white privilege in order to make her feel uncomfortable. It honestly made me extremely sad and disappointed to see her post because I have always felt connected to her as a WOC when we were still friends and for her to take the context out of the situation and say that we were targeting her solely for her race was unreasonable. I do not wish to dismiss her feelings about the situation but I am disappointed that she would frame it in that context. She also went around in my fiancé’s small medical class and was spreading the rumor that he was trying to hit her and it got back to us when AR’s girlfriend ended up talking to MS at a party they were at. MS told AR’s girlfriend that my fiancé was getting physical and that we were both attacking her. MS also said that she could learn to forgive my fiancé, but that she doesn’t care about me anymore because I was being terrible for calling her delusional. Good thing though, because AR was home when the incident broke out and he was listening in while MS was being the aggressor so he and his girlfriend did not believe MS.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks pass and MB finally moves back and confronts MS about the rumors that she has been spreading. She gets super defensive about the situation and lies to our faces about not spreading any rumors. My fiancé and I try to be the bigger people and once again apologize to her for making her feel uncomfortable and hurting her feelings, although once again, we made it clear that her behavior was completely inappropriate. She mocks me as I am crying and refuses to apologize because she said that she is 100% in the right. My fiancé and I are reminded once again to never address her.

So that’s what we do exactly. We all go out together at one point to celebrate MB’s return and our friend visiting from out of state, and we ignore her. She is not happy about this and spends the majority of the night being silent and glaring at my fiancé and I. It got to the point where the group got uncomfortable because she was outwardly upset that we were not acknowledging her. We have not acknowledged her since then and she has not shown up at the house although she is welcomed to come over. I think that she no longer feels like she can bully my fiancé because MB is back and will not tolerate her behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

Also with some good luck, I ran into the owner of the one dog that MS frequently dog sits at the dog park and it turns out that we work at the same hospital, got to talking and I eventually told her about how MS neglects the dogs that she sits. The owner then told me that she would never use her again as she was already suspicious about how her dog was being treated as he would be picked up with his food still remaining in the bag, super hungry, and not completely fed the days that he was with MS.

*TLDR: An entitled woman externalizes blame and is checked after she felt like she could take advantage of her friends and have them clean up after the dogs that she sits.*

&amp;#x200B;

Did we do the right thing to ignore MS when she refused to apologize? And was I in the right to tell the owner about her dog being neglected? I felt good about what my fiancé and I ended up doing, but I don't know if it was the most constructive way to go about it. I feel like if we were more firm at the beginning, we could have avoided a lot of trouble, but no matter how firm we were, EB and MS were still not compliant. We were trying to avoid damaging our relationship with EB and as a result, we opened ourselves up to the abusive behavior of MS. They both no longer live in the house and I am sad that this is the result of all the events, but also relieved that I no longer have to deal with the drama and anxiety that MS brings to the house.

508,"Hey reddit, I’m in need of some advice and I’m not sure where else to turn. This may be a long post. 

So, I am currently enrolled in a basic online bachelors program majoring in business. I chose this because it was cheap and seemed easy when I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. My mother and father pay half of my tuition each, and I really do appreciate how much they do for me. 

So here’s where it gets a little complicated. I was in online high school since my freshman year because of some mental health issues, so I haven’t been to a physical school in many years. I don’t have friends in real life, all I do is my schoolwork, cook for my family, and play video games. 

I recently have decided that I want to go into game design and development, as it’s very interesting to me. I started looking at colleges and was shocked at just how much on campus tuition costs. The reason I want to do on campus is because online college is not helping my initial lack of motivation, and allows me to slack off too much.  

So, the cost. My mother makes very good money but she has student debt of her own she’s still paying off. She simply can’t afford what fafsa won’t cover without taking out more loans, and I don’t want her to do that for me. 

I looked at cheaper colleges and I was willing to check them out, but noticed a lot of them don’t have a game design or development degree. 

So, I have very limited options. 

Do I, 
a. Continue with my business degree even though I very much dislike it and do game design on the side as an expensive hobby, 

b. Go to a cheaper school but get a computer science degree instead, and focus on game design, 

or c. Get a better job, drop out of my business degree and work until I can afford to pay for college out of pocket

I’m torn and very disappointed that I won’t get better loans, but I’m willing to do what it takes to follow my passions. I just don’t know which route to take, or where to even begin. Thanks in advance for replies. 

I really want to go to school and get a degree in something I’m passionate about, so not going to any school at all, ever, isn’t really an option.

I’m so desperate but I feel so horrible considering settling for what I have always considered a job that I don’t have the heart to do. I’d feel like I’m betraying my boyfriend, who I love so much and am extremely committed to. I found an ad on Craigslist for a phone sex job paying $23 an hour. I’m so tempted. It feels so incredibly wrong and disgusting, but I need the money.

511,"I moved country two years ago to begin an intense, demanding PhD programme. Since it was a new city, I did all the usual things I'd advise someone else to do to make friends: used dating apps like Tinder, joined meetup groups, sports clubs, started to flatshare etc etc - nothing has worked. I don't have the time to dedicate to a social life the way I used to, so don't often have time to do spontaneous social things, and have to plan stuff in advance - total mood killer for budding friendships. I've also had some really horrific experiences trying to make friends, not a lot, but a couple, that have made me feel like total shit and humiliated at a time when I've been vulnerable. 

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all this, the program itself is really demanding and can impact your self esteem (they tell us this before we begin) and so people rarely move away to complete the PhD I'm on. The result of this is that I'm surrounded by peers who are in a similar situation to me, but have a network of friends, partners and family to fall back on. I have none of that.

I've gone through periods of being suicidal and really hopeless. I often feel exhausted and burnt out. Physically I've never been in worse shape than I am now, despite my efforts. 

The worst part of all this is the gradual creep of bitterness that is starting to feeling overwhelming. I've made this huge life decision to move here, that my whole career depends on, and I can't go back on it. Financially it's been a big commitment. I started going to therapy a few months ago, but even my therapist seems disinterested and blase about my experiences. I look around at my peers who have their support systems, stability and friends, and feel real loss and self pity. I am aware that this mindset is the exact opposite of what people want to be around, but emotionally I feel trapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

I keep thinking there will be a movie style montage where this all turns round, and I meet some nice people and things get brighter, but that hasn't happened. I really have genuinely tried my best to make that happen, but it feels like I'm pushing for the impossible. Sometimes I get a little paranoid that I've been having this immense run of bad luck and it's because my negative outlook is attracting more negativity into my life. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing going right in my life is my career stuff, the PhD that I moved for. But socially, emotionally, physically, my life has gone to shit.

I'd really appreciate any advice or support from anyone. Thankyou. ",14Oct2018,1

513,"So overall I have a decent life. I live in a fairly nice house with my parents. I am quite relaxed and don’t have to do much. But I’ve come to a point in my life where I have gotten very bored. I want to start living life on the edge and dangerously. 
But I just don’t know how. How do I do this?",14Oct2018,1
514,"I don't really know much about my family history, and I was estranged from my paternal grandparents as a kid. My dad didn't get along with his parents as a kid. His dad was an alcoholic and his mom didn't show him much affection. He had to care for himself and his siblings for most of his teenage years. He moved out at 16 and joined the army at 18. When he got out, he met my mom and they moved away from their hometown.

My dad never really lost contact with his parents as we would visit on occasion (mostly for holidays). I was quite a perceptive kid, however. I would pick up on certain things. For example, I'd notice that my grandparents wouldn't treat our family the same as my dad's siblings' families, or that my grandma didn't really like my mom. About 7 years ago, my grandma even tried to pressure my mom into buying a shitty overpriced apartment that they owned. When my dad found out, he confronted my grandma and told them to stay away from our family. I haven't had contact with my grandparents since then.

I've tried asking my parents about our family, but they are very reluctant to talk about it. It leads me to believe that they've lied about some things to drive me away from my grandparents. For example, they've explained to me that my grandparents and my dad's siblings have suddenly become very faithful Catholics. Apparently they're trying to differentiate themselves from us - pretty much like the Buckets from Keeping Up Appearances. Most of the things I know about my family are things that I've overheard.

I'm almost 20 years old now, and I've moved away from home. Now that I'm free to do whatever I want, I'm considering whether or not I should visit my grandparents and ask them about our family.",14Oct2018,1

If life was a game I feel like I already beat it. I'm 26 years old male and nothing interests me. My girlfriend thinks I have some mild form of depression but I would say that I am content with life I need more to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked full time since I was 16 years old. 8 hours a day I spent at school with another 6-8 hours at work. I would then spend another few hours studying and then sleeping. I did this same routine until I graduated college. A lot of my friends in high school and in college didn't have to work. They went out to football games and had a ""normal"" upbringing partying, drinking, going out. I worked a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I became a manager at my first job and interned at my second job over the Summer while taking online classes. Eventually, I got accepted into a very very large company, most would recognize the name. I worked a lot and became one of the youngest, if not the youngest, team leads. I manage a group of 15 people who are all 35+ years old. I don't have a whole lot in common with them. They are great people but they are in a complete different phase in their life.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is the job doesn't need a lot of my time. There isn't a lot more progress I can make with it. I come home and literally do nothing but watch dumb YouTube videos. I  barely work 40 hours a week. I'm so use to working nonstop and now that I don't I have to I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I have more money in the bank then I know what to do with. I make more money then I will need.  I live a very simple life that I enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I don't have any hobbies and I don't have any friends. I'm not sure how to make friends as a 26 year old. There are not a lot of young people at my job. I also don't find anything very interesting. I'm a very analytical person.  I overthink a lot of things that most people don't.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I bought an PS4 because I haven't played games in years and I thought that would be a good hobby. I kept asking myself, ""Is this what it's like to have fun?"" Like, I felt playing helped me zone out but it wasn't ""fun"" -- I felt like I was filling up time and not productive.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm asking for. I'm not depressed, at least I don't think I am. I have a life that most people would dream of having. I feel like I've done everything I was told to do growing up. Now that I've done it all I'm not sure what else there is to do.",14Oct2018,1

i’m not toxic, as far as i know. i’m supportive and i love him so much. we are practically inseparable, we’ve only been together for about 2-3 months so everything is very new.

we’re both 18, except i live out of home and dropped out of school. he’s just finished school and still lives at home. although he spends all his time here.

his mum is nice and she buys us groceries sometimes, she’s lovely. but she feels like she’s losing him or something. it’s a hard concept for me to grasp because i didn’t have a close relationship with my mum... or anyone in my family actually.

i don’t demand that he stays with me, i encourage him to see his family and friends but he just wants to stay at home with me.

he sent a msg to his mum apologising for being distant and pushing her and the rest of the family away. he also said it wasnt just her, but he’s been pushing his friends away too. but whenever his friends invite us to do things, i ask him a million times if he’d like to go and he says no.

he seems so down recently and he called in sick to work today because he didn’t want to go.

i feel like i’m the reason for this, i don’t know what to do. i want to help but not sure how? ",14Oct2018,1
517,When I was 15 I damaged my vocal cords because I used to sing for fun without any real training and apparently I was doing it wrong. Now I suck at singing and it's really uncomfortable for me. Anyone have any advice? I really do miss it.,14Oct2018,1
518,"We broke up two days ago after an amazing year and a half together. I asked her how she's dealing with the change and everything and she has been saying how she is completely fine and everything is so much better for her. I however, am absolutely heartbroken. I've never felt so low in my life, and knowing she can move on so easily while I'm literally dying inside is killing me more.",14Oct2018,1
519,"So I've been dating a guy who lives in Belgium for awhile now and everything was going perfect. But awhile back he took a break and didn't talk to me or anyone in our discord group chat for nearly 2 months. We eventually started talking again and he said that he just needed some time to himself and that it's just his bipolar disorder. I said that it was okay and that I forgive him. But I just don't feel like we have bounced back yet from it. I ended up starting college shortly after and I'm busy a lot with my classes and he has work. I still kinda have feelings for him, but it comes and goes a lot now. I feel like it's only fair to him to tell him how I feel and end it since it's not fair to him to be with him even though I'm not completely into the relationship anymore. Idk how I should go about it since he didn't do anything bad and since I'm afraid of losing him as a friend.

It's me, him, and 8 other friends of ours who are in a group discord chat together and I don't wanna mess up the dynamic between all of us. Any advice?",14Oct2018,1
